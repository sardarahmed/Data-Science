Q:

moveit_setup_assistant cannot load pr2.urdf.xacro

I follow the moveit official tutorial to roslaunch moveit_setup_assistant, and then load the pr2.urdf.xacro file, and come across error then the assistant crashes.
Here is the tutorial link: http://docs.ros.org/kinetic/api/moveit_tutorials/html/doc/setup_assistant/setup_assistant_tutorial.html

Edit1:
I follow this answer  http://answers.ros.org/question/217186/a-problem-with-launching-the-moveit-setup-assistant/
try to install xserver-xorg, but another things shown up
root@ShawnVM:/opt/ros/indigo/share/moveit_setup_assistant# sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg

Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 unity-control-center : Depends: libcheese-gtk23 (>= 3.4.0) but it is not going to be installed
                        Depends: libcheese7 (>= 3.0.1) but it is not going to be installed
E: Error, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks, this may be caused by held packages.

Edit2:
Then, I have to sovle Edit1 problem, which leads me to this
http://askubuntu.com/questions/575548/system-settings-stopped-showing-up
But it does not work for me.  Still cannot install xserver
Edit3:
I forgot to mention that, moveit_setup_assistant can load the pi_robot.urdf file in the ros-by-example-2 tutorial

Please don't use screenshots for what is essentially text. Could you copy-paste the console text into your question, then use the Preformatted Text button (the one with 101010 on it) next time? Text in imgs is not searchable by search engines, leading to reduced visibility of this question.

I don't think this will fix your problem, but note your tutorial link is for Hydro and very out of date - the latest tutorials are here: http://docs.ros.org/kinetic/api/moveit_tutorials/html/doc/setup_assistant/setup_assistant_tutorial.html

Thanks, I did follow this tutorial.  when I post the question, I search this tutorial it shows the old link, for saving time, I just copy the old link, sorry. Actually, they are the same, at least for the first two steps.
Comment by shawnysh on 2016-11-10:
sometimes the 101010 does not work well in the edit window
Comment by shawnysh on 2016-11-22:
Should I check the error log?

A:

If your dependencies are correctly installed, there is a fair chance this has something to do with your graphics driver. From the output it seems like the urdf is parsed correctly but the program crashes when it starts to make use of OpenGL. Are you by any chance running a VM?
Some more information can be found in these related topics:
MoveIt setup assistant crashes when loading a urdf
a problem with launching the moveit setup assistant
problems with moveit exit code-11
Good luck!

Yes, I am running on VM
Comment by rbbg on 2016-11-10:
Did you manage to solve the problem using the posted questions?
Comment by shawnysh on 2016-11-10:
Not yet, becase it seems OpenGL works well, I think. See the update on my post
Comment by shawnysh on 2016-11-10:
In this question and answer
This man solved his problem by this command
sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop

which seems confusing.
I haven't tried it yet.
Comment by Dave Coleman on 2016-11-10:
It is likely because of the VM, yes
