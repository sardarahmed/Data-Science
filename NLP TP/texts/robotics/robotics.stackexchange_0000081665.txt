Q:

questions on descarte planning, meaning of orient_increment

Hey all,
I wonder what is the meaning of orient_increment in AxialSymmetricPt? On its class reference, it shows
> orient_increment  (in radians, discretization of space [-Pi, Pi])

But what does discretization mean here?  My understanding is that it discretize [-Pi,Pi], like [-pi, -pi+0.01,-pi+0.02,....,pi-0.01,pi]. Is this right?
I was following the descarte tutorial, it used this helper function
descartes_core::TrajectoryPtPtr makeTolerancedCartesianPoint(const Eigen::Affine3d& pose)
{
    using namespace descartes_core;
    using namespace descartes_trajectory;
  return TrajectoryPtPtr( new AxialSymmetricPt(pose, // Nominal pose
                                               M_PI/2.0, // Search discretization
                                               AxialSymmetricPt::Z_AXIS) ); // Free axis
}

I wonder what does the M_PI/2 means.
Any help would be deeply appreciated.

A:

You are correct in your thinking.   In the cited example the discretization is specified as increments of pi/2 (90 degrees).  M_PI is a constant for pi from the math library math.h

Thank you for your reply. I'm kind of curious why is pi/2 is enough? Does pi/2 apply to the joints?

Pi/2 is arbitrary in this case and in my experience not enough.   This is the discretization about the specified free axis in terms of tool/frame poses (i.e., Cartesian and not joint angles).  Ultimately it is a trade-off between search resolution and planning time.

I usually start with pi/16 and adjust from there but it will be application dependant in the end

Thank you. I'm going to try it with different values to see what's the difference. Thank you for your reply.
Also, I wonder if you know some moveit examples with good documents available?

For just moveit there are good ones on their wiki here.  For Descartes, there is less.   You can start here
