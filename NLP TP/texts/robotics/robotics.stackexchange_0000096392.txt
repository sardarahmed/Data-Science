Q:

alwaysOn camera parameter Gazebo

Hi,
I was wondering how I could use the <alwaysOn>true</alwaysOn> tag in the <plugin name="camera_controller" filename="libgazebo_ros_camera.so"> Gazebo camera plugin.
Basically, I would like to set it to false, and switch the camera on or off whenever I need it, in order to save ressources essentially.
I read on another post (here) that this parameter is not parameterized, because Gazebo cameras are not designed to be turned on or off, at least in 2014. Is it still the case?
Cheers

I think that's a misunderstanding. Gazebo cameras can be turned on or off.
Looking through the code, I'm not sure if alwaysOn actually works on gazebo_ros_pkgs (where gazebo_ros_camera is), but you can pass the always_on SDF parameter directly to the camera sensor. Or you can always call sensor->SetActive(false) from a plugin.

witch the camera on or off whenever I need it, in order to save ressources essentially.

You may want to look at gazebo_ros_triggered_camera, which takes pictures as you send messages on a topic.
