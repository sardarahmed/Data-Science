Q:

How to receive and array of floats over a user defined message type?

Example message type :

Request :
//request feature's 308 variables!
float64[308] features
Response :
//response Contains object type!
int64 object_type

After compiling with success all of this and the .cpp code. How do i access the float array ? There is some confusing code because the array created, that can be accessed in eclipse is like : <double, allocator>
Help needed!
Thanks!

A:

If you're in C++, the type in the C++ message object is a std::vector<double>, which is traditionally accessed using subscripting:
double x = foo[5];

Actually fixed length arrays are now boost::array's, not std::vector's. See http://ros.org/wiki/msg for details on the mapping between types in message files and types in client libraries.
