Q:

Is there any humanoid robot simulation working on Kinetic?

I have been trying out few existing packages but nothing seems to be up to date (especially for Gazebo).
Darwin simulation doesn't start correctly  and NAO needs proprietary software (Webots and Choregraph) and REEM-C doesn't even compile (probably not compatible with the new Gazebo).
I just want to make something humanoid-like move arms and legs and get a bag of the joint states.

A:

The package you mentioned is not official. We are offering the OP(aka “DARWIN OP”) packages below. The robotis_op3_common package provides launch files and plug-in for Gazebo and RViz.
