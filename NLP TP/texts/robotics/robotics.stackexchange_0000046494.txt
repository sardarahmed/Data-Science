Q:

What parameters are used in PCL's Bilateral Filter?

I was trying to find out the parameters which are used as standard in PCL's bilateral filtering routine for Kinect images.
As I understand it, the required parameters for bilateral filtering are:

Spatial Gaussian width
Gaussian width in the range dimension
Width in pixels over which the filter operates

Are these parameters hard coded into the Bilateral filtering routine? If so, where can I find them? If not, what parameters are typically used with Kinect images?

A:

There are several bilateral filters in PCL:

BilateralFilter, no defaults.
FastBilateralFilter, default is 15.0f spatial width and 0.05f range sigma.
Bilateral filter in KinFu, uses 4.5f spatial width and 0.03f range sigma.
