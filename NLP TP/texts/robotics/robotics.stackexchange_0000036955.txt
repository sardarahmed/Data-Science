Q:

rgbdslam cannot save .pcd

Hi,
I am new to ROS and I finally managed to run rgbdslam on my Ubuntu 10.04.
Now the problem is that though I can save node-wide pcd files, but I CANNOT save the whole scene to pcd file. Every time after I clicked save or save as, nothing happened in the destination folder.
Did I miss something?
Could anyone help me with the problem?
Thanks.
Jack

A:

Finally I used cloud_to_pcd to subscribe the topic /rgbdslam/batch_cloud and save the scene into pcd.
