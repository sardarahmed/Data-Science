Q:

different resolutions and camera_info_manager/openni (e.g. kinect camera)

After the calibration and using the camera_calibration_parsers, I get a rgb_A00363A22671047A.yaml file. This file can be placed in /home/username/.ros/camera_info/.
But I can chance the resolution anytime(e.g. 640x480 -> 1280x1024).
How is it possible to store different calibrations, one for every supported resolution?

A:

In principle you shouldn't have to store different calibrations for each resolution. Going from 640x480 to 1280x1024 amounts to changing the binning and region-of-interest settings on the camera, which don't affect its intrinsic calibration. See REP 104 for the gory details.
It's possible that the OpenNI driver doesn't update camera_info correctly when you change the resolution - it's supposed to, but we haven't tested it much. If so, please report a bug.
