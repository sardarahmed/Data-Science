Q:

Problem with rosjava installation

Iam new to ROS trying to install rosjava in ubuntu 11.10 fuerte.But when Iam Trying to execute the following command:
rosws merge h**ps://github.com/rosjava/rosjava_core/.rosinstall
Iam getting the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/usr/local/bin/rosws", line 65, in 
sys.exit(rosinstall.rosws_cli.rosws_main(sys.argv))
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rosinstall/rosws_cli.py", line 441, in rosws_main
os.getcwd(),
OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory
How can I install rosjava successfully without these errors?

A:

Your problem doesn't seem to be related to rosjava, but to rosinstall/rosws. On Ubuntu, you should remove the old rosinstall stuff installed via pip and instead use the deb version:
$ sudo rm -rf /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rosinstall*
$ sudo rm -rf /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/vcstools*

then
$ sudo apt-get install python-rosinstall

Also, the .rosinstall link in the rosjava doc is out of date. After running the steps above, you should do this:
mkdir ~/my_workspace
cd ~/my_workspace
rosws init
rosws merge /opt/ros/groovy/.rosinstall
rosws set --git --version=groovy-devel rosjava_core 'git://github.com/rosjava/rosjava_core.git'
rosws update
source setup.bash

I've submitted pull requests 161 and 162 to fix the rosjava documentation.

rosws update gives error as:[rosjava_core] Updating /home/jhansi/my_workspace/rosjava_core

Can you post the relevant lines of your .rosinstall file, i.e. the output of grep -A 1 rosjava_core $ROS_WORKSPACE/.rosinstall?
Comment by Martin G端nther on 2013-05-30:
Which error are you getting? The "No such file"? In that case, I guess it's not rosjava specific, and I'd ask a new question like "rosinstall fails on OSX". Or do you get the "remote hung up" one? Even after following all steps above with a fresh work space?
Comment by Martin G端nther on 2013-05-31:
So you don't get any error during the rosinstall? In that case, it's a different problem and doesn't belong into this question, sorry.
