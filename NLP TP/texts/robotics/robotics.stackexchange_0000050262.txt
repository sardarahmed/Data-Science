Q:

trex in ros fuerte

Hi there.......
has anybody here worked around on T-Rex..I started working on this. I studied that the Pr2 milestone has used the T-Rex for its higher Level planning part. I am currently using ROS fuerte.
I have installed T-Rex from https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/branches/trunk_cturtle/stacks/executive_trex .
I think the Trex is not supported beyond Cturtle. But I need to know about T-Rex. So if anybody worked on Trex before please help me. It will be highly appreciated.
(The main problem is the Trex_ros package is not building...if anybody can guide me how to build it in fuerte, that will do the trick for me)

You could ask Frederic Py from MBARI (TREX's main author) directly whether he has any plans to support more recent ROS distros.

A:

Just FYI, ROS, and the milestones in particular, eventually started using SMACH instead of TREX.
