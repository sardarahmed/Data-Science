Q:

Hi, can I read the values of the current or of contact force and decide to stop the hand if it touches an object?

A:

~CHANNEL_NAME/current_controller (vector of floats, default: see yaml files)
Parameters used for the hardware current controller. See additional documentation in YAML files and below. If no values are provides the current will use safe internal defaults.

I used the values in Yaml file but they are the parameters used to control. I want to read the current value of current/force. Is it possible?
Comment by inflo on 2015-04-28:
seemed that reading the actual current value is not possible, best would be a topic, but there is none
Comment by inflo on 2015-04-28:
perhaps you can get the svh firmware and add a topic publisher which publishes these values
