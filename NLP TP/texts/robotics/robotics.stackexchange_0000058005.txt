Q:

Building ros_control on Hydro

Hello
I'm trying to build ros_control on Hydro following the steps here.
First of all when I use sudo apt-get install ros_control ros_controllers apt-get tell me it's impossible for him to find the packages.
But then when I try to build from source using those commands :
cd CATKIN_WORKSPACE/src
wstool init
wstool merge https://raw.github.com/ros-controls/ros_control/hydro-devel/ros_control.rosinstall
wstool update

Then I use catkin_make and I have two kind of errors during the process :
First :
CMake Error at /opt/ros/hydro/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:72 (find_package):
Could not find a configuration file for package cmake_modules.

Set cmake_modules_DIR to the directory containing a CMake configuration
file for cmake_modules.  The file will have one of the following names:

cmake_modulesConfig.cmake
cmake_modules-config.cmake

Call Stack (most recent call first):
ros_controllers/gripper_action_controller/CMakeLists.txt:7 (find_package)

Second :
CMake Error at /opt/ros/hydro/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:72 (find_package):
Could not find a configuration file for package cmake_modules.

Set cmake_modules_DIR to the directory containing a CMake configuration
file for cmake_modules.  The file will have one of the following names:

cmake_modulesConfig.cmake
cmake_modules-config.cmake

Call Stack (most recent call first):
ros_control/transmission_interface/CMakeLists.txt:31 (find_package)

CMake Error at ros_control/transmission_interface/CMakeLists.txt:37 (find_package):
Could not find module FindTinyXML.cmake or a configuration file for package
TinyXML.

Adjust CMAKE_MODULE_PATH to find FindTinyXML.cmake or set TinyXML_DIR to
the directory containing a CMake configuration file for TinyXML.  The file
will have one of the following names:

TinyXMLConfig.cmake
tinyxml-config.cmake

CMake Error at /opt/ros/hydro/share/catkin/cmake/catkin_package.cmake:156 (message):
catkin_package() DEPENDS on 'TinyXML' which must be find_package()-ed
before.  If it is a catkin package it can be declared as CATKIN_DEPENDS
instead without find_package()-ing it. 
Call Stack (most recent call first):
/opt/ros/hydro/share/catkin/cmake/catkin_package.cmake:98 (_catkin_package)
ros_control/transmission_interface/CMakeLists.txt:40 (catkin_package)

-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
Invoking "cmake" failed

Or I think tinyXML is installed on my system as I have libtinyxml-dev and libtinyxml2.6.2 already installed
Any help is appreciated

To complement Austin's answer, your attempt to do a source build failed because the cmake_modules package is missing (which is causing the two reported errors). You can make sure that a package's dependencies are satisfied by running rosdep install ros_control ros_controllers.
