I am using ROS Hydro on Ubuntu 12.04 and I don't have this problem with your commands.
Have you any warning or error messages ?
Is your camera connected to this port : /dev/video0 ?

I'm in the same problem, could you tell me the way to fix this, pls!

A:

I would recommend using rqt_image_view, I tried to execute this command as well but nothing is happening for me except the programm hangs in the console. I can not even terminate it with CTRL-C.
In rqt_image_view you can select the topic you want at runtime.
