Q:

Plugin.hh undefined symbol

Hello,
I am trying to write a plugin for a camera. The building works fine, but when I launch the world I get the following error
Error [Plugin.hh:141] Failed to load plugin libvtol_camera.so: /home/mago/Development/Repository/ROS/labrob_hydro_hetcont/devel/lib/libvtol_camera.so: undefined symbol: _ZTIN6gazebo17DepthCameraPluginE

I am using Gazebo 2.1 and ROS hydro

This may happen when your plugin is built but not linked, could you try adding this (if you don't have it already) to your CMakeLists file: target_link_libraries(vtol_camera ${catkin_LIBRARIES})
Comment by Andrea on 2013-12-04:
Hi, the plugin is actually linked:
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT\_NAME} ${catkin_LIBRARIES} ${GAZEBO\_LIBRARIES} ${ARMADILLO_LIBRARIES} )

A:

I found a solution.
I forgot to link the library in the CMakeLists.txt file
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} ${catkin_LIBRARIES} ${GAZEBO_LIBRARIES} ${ARMADILLO_LIBRARIES} DepthCameraPlugin )
