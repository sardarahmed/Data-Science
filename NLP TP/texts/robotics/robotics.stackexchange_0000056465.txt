Please don't close any questions unless there is a need to do so. If you find a correct answer click the small checkmark to the left. This will signal that a question was answered in the overview.

In close drop down there is a item that says " question is answered, right answer accepted". What does this mean in the light of your comment.

Only that clicking the checkmark is the preferred option to signal that a question was answered.

A:

As documented on the Remapping Arguments wiki page, you can easily remap arguments using rosrun from the command line (see example there).
