Q:

tutorial turtlebot-simulator-desktop broken

Hi,
I've successfully installed "ROS Groovy" on "Ubuntu Precise".
I'm following the tutorials -- which are very helpful, by the way! -- but I got stuck at
turtlebot_simulator /
Tutorials /
Installing TurtleBot Simulator
Not a link to avoid the karma censors:
www DOT ros DOT org /wiki/turtlebot_simulator/Tutorials/Installing%20TurtleBot%20Simulator

Step 2.4 says to install some software: "apt-get install ros-electric-turtlebot-simulator-desktop", but that package does not exist.  Indeed, "apt-cache search" finds only one package with "turtlebot-simulator" in the name: ros-fuerte-turtlebot-simulator
But I'm running "groovy".  Is it
advisable to install something
containg "fuerte" in the package
name?
Continuing on to the next tutorial part
www DOT ros DOT org/wiki/turtlebot_simulator/Tutorials/Running%20the%20Simulator

Step 2 is to launch the simulation.  I do have package "ros-groovy-simulator-gazebo" installed, but the command fails:
$ roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_empty_world.launch
[turtlebot_gazebo] is not a package or launch file name

What are the packages / commands appropriate for "ROS Groovy"?
Thanks,
-Steve

Hi !
If you are running Groovy on your computer, then you either might be following the wrong tutorial or the tutorial hasn't been updated.
Anyway, you mentionned you wanted to install : apt-get install ros-electric-turtlebot-simulator-desktop
which mentions ros-electric version. if this package does exist for Groovy, then you should replace electric by groovy in the package name.
By the way, with ROS groovy, the Turtlebot simulator hasn't been released yet (see Robot, Turtlebot tutorials for more informations). So I wonder where you did find this tutorial ? You can still try kobuki simulator, but it doesn't seem to work very well (have a look on ROS answers) for some users...

Where did I find this tutorial?  I started at the beginning of the tutorials and ran through all the Beginner Tutorials, ending with #20: "Where Next?" (http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/WhereNext).  Part 1.1 includes links to the PR2 Simulator and the Turtlebot Simulator.

Ok... Well those tutorials are outdated for groovy and precise. You can't use them as they are with your current ROS version. :-s
