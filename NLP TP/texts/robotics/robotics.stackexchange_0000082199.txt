Q:

How to add prefix to every copter in Erle-brain using Mavros

So, i have bought Erle-brain v3 that included ROS kinetic. Erle-brain automatically runs roscore. And i don't understand how to rename topics (or add prefix). It needed for dividing topics`information from each other. I mean, we have for example list of topics:
/mavros/global_position/global

/mavros/imu/data

etc.
And i want to get:
/copter1/mavros/global_position/global

/copter1/mavros/imu/data

...........

/copter2/mavros/global_position/global

/copter2/mavros/imu/data

...........
 

Maybe i must somehow disable autorun of roscore?
Or do something in bin directory.
(sorry for maybe uncorrect question: newbie)

A:

You can remap topics using the remap tag in your launch files.
