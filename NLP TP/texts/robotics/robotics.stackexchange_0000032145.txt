Q:

How to restore a stack installed from debian

Hi, I accidentally completely deleted all the packages in my diamondback/stacks directory - the packages like [common] and [vision_opencv] and [openni_kinect] and all those important things. It was a tremendously stupid thing to do, I know, but there it is. Can anyone explain to me how to get back all those packages? I tried installing diamondback again in the hopes that it would reinstall the whole stack, but it didn't work. Then I tried things like "sudo apt-get install common" to try to install the packages back one by one, manually, but that didn't work either, so apparently I'm missing a lot of the fine details about installing packages. I really don't understand ROS or Ubuntu well enough yet to work my way back out of this - any help please?
Thanks,
Khiya

A:

You can also use the reinstall option, i.e. sudo apt-get --reinstall install ros-diamondback-<whatever you need>
