Is there a problem with the rospy tutorials on the wiki?

Is there any simple ROS-RPi Programs in python ?
for example Light blink,Ultrasonic sensors and  Rotary-encoders ?

As this is HW-specific, there is (at least to my knowledge) no such tutorial. Check the Publisher/Subscriber tutorials on the ROS wiki, as well as a tutorial for how to "make a light blink" for the RPi (Google around), and try to bring them together (if you receive a message, toggle the light...)

@melvinyesudas you can check Mastering Ros For Robotics Programming by Lentin Josph mainly chapter 7
these are in c but if you want in python look at these
