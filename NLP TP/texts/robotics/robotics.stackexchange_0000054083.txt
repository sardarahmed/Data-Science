How is this the accepted answer?
If you arn't going to answer the question properly, THEN DON'T ANSWER IT!!!!!
People like you are why the learning curve for ros is a cliff. The documentation sucks, and telling people to go and read it instead of answering a simple question is why it's so steep.

@Ben12345 If you read the suggested pages and still have questions, then ask them. (There is a button on the top right "Ask your question"). Also, I highly recommend to go through the ROS Tutorials and RViz User Guide.
