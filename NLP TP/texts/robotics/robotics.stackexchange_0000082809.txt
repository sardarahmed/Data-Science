Q:

Service call failed in json-prolog while querying an owl file in Cram

Hi,
I started a roslisp node in cram and have json-prolog query services (i can see
/json_prolog/finish
/json_prolog/next_solution
/json_prolog/query
/json_prolog/simple_query

when i do "rosservice list").
Also by typing (json-prolog:check-connection) i receive T. so i assume that everything set up properly.
problem is when i try any query like
(json-prolog:prolog '("rdf_has" ?owlname "http://knowrob.org/kb/srdl2-comp.owl#urdfName" ("literal" ?var)))

i receive
Prolog query failed: Got error: The value
             |'["rdf_has",{"variable":"OWLNAME"},"http://knowrob.org/kb/srdl2-comp.owl#urdfName",{"term":["literal",{"variable":"VAR"}]}]'|
           is not of type
             LIST..

also i have
[(JSON-PROLOG) WARN] 1505226166.532: Service call failed. 
[(JSON-PROLOG) WARN] 1505226166.532: Retrying...

Thanks

Hi,
This seems like an error on the KnowRob side. I execute it on my machine and it works fine.
I'm using the master branch of KnowRob (on 14.04), the latest commit I have is from 3rd of September.
And I'm using the latest version of cram_json_prolog, master branch, last commit was on 26 June.
Try prolog-simple or a simpler query in general.

We have a bunch of tutorials.
Here is he one that showcases most complex behaviors
It runs on the newest CRAM version (0.4.0).
Consult the installation page to get the latest version.
