Q:

Updating Package to Newer Distro (Kinetic)

Hi,
I'm now working on Kinetic for the Jetson TX1 and trying out the new builds for aarm64. Everything is working great except I am missing a package that I do not see in the repo nor in the build farm. Its the nmea parser.
I can manually pull it down and install, but curious how I can help to submit it to Kinetic. I found a few mentions on how and a detailed answer here but I feel there is a submission/vetting process I am missing and haven't been able to find in the wiki other than building catkin packages.
What channels do I need to use to ask for a new release?

A:

You could create an issue asking the maintainers to make a release for Kinetic.

I wasn't for sure if they checked those. I got a PR open for almost two months with no activity. I'll open an issue.

If that still doesn't work, try mentioning the top committer's names with the @ symbol. That will send them a notification.
