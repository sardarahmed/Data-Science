Q:

No Laserscan received for many seconds for navigation?

Hi Guys,
I m trying to set up the 2D Navigation Stack. Everything works fine beside of the integration of the laser_scanner.
I set up all the transformations as well as publishing all the needed data as map, odom and laser_scan for autonomous navigation. Nevertheless amcl is always saying this:

[ WARN] [1488657566.744750961]: No laser scan received (and thus no pose updates have been published) for 1488657566.744665 seconds.  Verify that data is being published on the /scan topic.

I have been working with ROS now over 2 years and i dont understand this mistake. My tf_tree (map->odom->base_link->laser_scanner) doesnt show any errors as well as all published topics show the status ok in rviz. If I m using the fake_amcl node everything works fine.
Does anyone know what  I can do ?
The advice that i found here, to set the sim_time to true causes that amcl isnt loading the map.
Thanks for help :)

A:

Are you publishing your laser data on the topic requested by amcl?
If you type:
rostopic info /scan

can you see both your laser driver and amcl as publisher/subscriber ?
