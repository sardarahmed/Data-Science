Q:

Error in using rgbdslam with GUI

Hello,
I am trying to implement SLAM using rgbdslam. But when i run the command   "roslaunch rgbdslam kinect+rgbdslam.launch" from the wiki page "http://wiki.ros.org/rgbdslam?distro=fuerte", i get the following error. I appreciate any help.

Also, when i try to start the openni nodes and RGBDSLAM separately with the commands
'roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch'  and 'rosrun rgbdslam rgbdslam', I get the following error.
/home/morteza/fuerte_workspace/sandbox/rgbdslam_freiburg/rgbdslam/bin/rgbdslam: error while loading shared libraries: libsiftgpu.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

A:

Hi,
the first ERROR messages are unrelated, they are from the camera driver and AFAIK can be safely ignored.
The message starting with REQUIRED more or less says that rgbdslam crashed. The message in your comment hints towards a missing library. Apparently you need to build the siftgpu library, which should have been done by rosmake.
To do it manually, run make in rgbdslam/external/siftgpu/linux and copy the created external/siftgpu/linux/bin/libsiftgpu.so to a directory searched by the linker (try rgbdslam/lib or check the linker command line with make VERBOSE=1 for -L/some/dir parameters).
Also note that there's a much better version available for ROS hydro on github

Thank you for your response. I downloaded the hydro version and it works well. In fuerte i did what you said but when i ran make, although the libsiftgpu.so was made, i got error.

Ok, I guess that's fine then.
