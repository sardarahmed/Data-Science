Q:

How do you convert a quaternion into an axis-angle representation?

Hello,
I'd like to convert an orientation from geometry_msgs::Quaternion to an axis-angle representation (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis-angle_representation). Similarly, I'd like to convert back to a quaternion from an axis-angle value. What ROS libraries are available to preform these conversions?
Thanks

A:

TF datatypes are actually re-cast Bullet Datatypes. If you have a tf::Quaternion, you can use any of the functions dejan linked to above, but specifically, you want these two:
double btQuaternion::GetAngle()
btVector3 btQuaternion::GetAxis()
When you want to change the value of a tf::Quaternion from an axis/angle representation, you can use this member function:
void btQuaternion::SetRotation(const btVector3 &axis, const double &angle)
