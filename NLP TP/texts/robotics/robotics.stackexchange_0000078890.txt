Q:

How to control a hobby servo via arduino using RViz GUI?

I am using ROS Indigo, Ubuntu 14.04LTE and Arduino UNO. I need to control a hobby servo via arduino using RViz GUI. If I move the scroll bar, the motor should rotate.

I have Done now Sir @RajashekharVS

A:

Easy job :-)
Use firmata firmware for your arduino ( http://firmata.org/wiki/Main_Page)
and a simple python script using https://github.com/MrYsLab/PyMata
Now you can write a small python-node for ros and enjoy rviz.
I did it the same way for testing my robots.

Can you send me a package with URDF and Arduino code to control one motor ? I am actually bad in programming. Can you please help me ?

Load firmata to your UNO and try this as base for your tests:
