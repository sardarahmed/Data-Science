A:

ROS Lunar is not supported on Ubuntu 17.10, that is probably why you are getting that error.
You can try to see whether export ROS_OS_OVERRIDE=ubuntu:17.04:zesty works with rosdep, but it's still not supported.

You can also override the OS in rosdep with the -o flag like rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -o ubuntu:zesty --rosdistro lunar -y
