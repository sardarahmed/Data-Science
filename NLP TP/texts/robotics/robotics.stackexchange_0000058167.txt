Q:

Can't detect Asus Xtion

Hello,
I followed the tutorial from here as I had the same problem and it still does not work.
My lsusb still have that output :
ros@ros-K56CM:~$ lsusb

Bus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
Bus 001 Device 003: ID 13d3:5165 IMC Networks 

I install the driver for V1.5 and I'm using the openni_camera package rollback usb.
Still I have that error when I try roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch
 Warning: USB events thread - failed to set priority. This might cause loss of data...

A:

Solve by using openni2_camera and openni2_launcher from source...
Go there and there, enter  git checkout groovy in both folders and use catkin_make. Then it should be working.
