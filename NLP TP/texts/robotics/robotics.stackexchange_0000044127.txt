Q:

Where did unstable.rosdistro go?

I'm finally getting around to releasing some of my stacks as debs. However, I thought you were supposed to start by editing the unstable distro, but now that seems to be gone.
Where did it go, and/or where do you start otherwise?
(I'm aware of these Tutorials but I don't want to break the build by editing the electric distro incorrectly. )

A:

unstable was originally a distro which was designed to be a rolling release distro where integration happened and periodically it would be forked as things solidified towards a release.  However in reality this just ended up making a lot of work when things had to be renamed and documentation updated as releases approached.
Now we simply branch each rosdistro file from the previous one.

So is the first step to building  a deb checking the changes into say electric.rosdistro? Or is there some other testing that happens first?

I think I've got it.
