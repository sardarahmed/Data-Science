Q:

DRCSim 2.2.0 installation on 32 bit machine

I have installed gazebo 1.5 already and wanted to see how a humanoid robot is controlled in gazebo. I think Atalas is a good example to benchmark and tried to install DRCSim. The tutorial says 32 bit machine users should compile the source to use the latest version. I tried to follow the instruction, but it said /usr/local/share/gazebo/setup.sh was not found. There was another path for the setup.sh, /usr/share/gazebo/setup.sh and I re-tried with the path. However, during 'make', errors were occured at around 77%.

I have no idea what's wrong with it.

A:

I'm afraid that the AtlasInterfaceLibrary (shipped as a binary with DRCSim) is only available in 64bits at this moment, so trying to compile the source without manually making changes to take the library out of the code, is not going to work.
If you need a fully working version of DRCSim, it's totally recommended to use a 64bits system.
Some experimental work was done to remove the AtlasInterfaceLibrary from the 2.2.0 version of the code, you can find it in drcsim 2.2.0 32bits branch of drcsim. It's totally untested and lacks of the functionality provided but the AtlastInterfaceLibrary.
Again, for a real experience of using DRCSim at this moment, please go for a 64bits version.

Thank you for the answer. I thought I could install the 32bit version if I compiled the source. Somehow, I should get a 64 OS. Actually, I just realized my laptop supports 64 bit OS. :)
