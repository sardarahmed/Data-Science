A:

I'd rather install Diamondback than CTurtle. You definitely have to use SVN-install. Also, as I already pointed out in your earlier post, read REP108. Then just do as it says on the Wiki Diamondback SVN installation page, possibly replacing variant with one of those more suitable for your needs as described in the aforementioned REP108.
EDIT (see Koen's posts in this thread !!): An other possibility is using installation scripts provided by Koen Buys on his page.
You can also read my previous posts, they, for now, mainly regard the issue of your interest.
Cheers, Tom
