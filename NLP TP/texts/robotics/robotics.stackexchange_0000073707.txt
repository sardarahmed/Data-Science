Q:

E: Unable to locate package ros-jade-stdr-simulator

I have tried to install the stdr simulator, but I have encountered a problem. I have ROS Jade with Ubuntu 15.04
I tried to uninstall ROS completely and after that to install it again, like it was suggested here:
http://answers.ros.org/question/188732/e-unable-to-locate-package-ros-indigo-desktop-full/
This is what I get:
~$ sudo apt-get install ros-jade-stdr-simulator
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-jade-stdr-simulator
I did of course - sudo apt-get update , before that.
What could it possibly be?

A:

Your error is likely telling you that the stdr_simulator package is not released on Jade. If you'd like to use the package and stick with 15.04+Jade, you'll need to build the package from source (at least for now). Check out this answer I wrote a few days ago for more information.
