Q:

Why does Ubuntu (Source) installation's rosdep skip some keys

While following the Ubuntu (Source) installation, in the Install dependencies using rosdep step, some rosdep keys are skipped as following:
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -y --skip-keys "fastcdr rti-connext-dds-6.0.1 urdfdom_headers"

What is the reason for skipping these keys? I have gone back through the commit history of the tutorials back to ROS2 crystal, but these keys have existed before that time. I am wondering if the instructions are outdated.
The only logical explanation I can think of, for rti-connext-dds-6.0.1, is that it's not used as the default dds, and the size of the package is significant (154mb).

IIRC, Connext requires a license, which many people may not have, nor is it a default RMW implementation.
fastcdr is likely already included as a dependency of FastDDS (but this is speculation).
urdfdom_headers I wouldn't know.

A:

Connext is skipped because it needs a license to run so most people won't want to take the time to build it if they can't run it. Instructions for installing it directly are below.
urdfdom_headers and fastcdr are skipped because they do not provide a package.xml in their installed targets so rosdep via catkin_pkg doesn't detect that they've been installed, even if they've been installed or are in the workspace.
