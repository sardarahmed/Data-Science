Q:

Gzweb documentation development

There is little on how Gzweb works. I am interested in developing such a document. I am wondering what help/references/procedure may be there (in addition to reading the source code). Thanks.

A:

Most of the existing information about GzWeb is on the following page. There are instructions on how to install, run and develop GzWeb, as well as a user guide for the GUI.
http://gazebosim.org/gzweb
Most of that content is pulled from tutorials. These are the install and run instructions:
http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=gzweb_install&cat=gzweb
And these are the development instructions:
http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=gzweb_development&cat=gzweb
For the javascript code, you can generate documentation running the following from the gzweb root directory:
./updateGZ3D.sh -d

And open it on a browser like this:
firefox gz3d/doc/index.html

As far as I know, this is all the documentation available. Good luck!
