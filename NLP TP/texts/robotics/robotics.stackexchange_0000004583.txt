Q:

What are some low cost alternatives for lidar?

It need not be as effective as lidar or it may have some disadvantages when compared with lidar.   What are the probable alternatives?
Edit:
I'm intending to use it outdoors for navigation of autonomous vehicle. Is there any low cost LIDAR or is there any alternative sensor for obstacle detection?

A:

This representative sample of what's out there may give you some idea of what's out there at various price points:

Unfortunately, you're talking several thousand dollars for an outdoor unit with 10's to 100's of meter range (as of March 2015). The chart is from a blog article I wrote on the topic. Google used a $70-80K unit on their original vehicles. The 2nd to last item on the chart above, while not as capable as that unit, is advertised as a unit for vehicle automation. 
Sophisticated stereo cameras with image processing may be an alternative, and may be cheaper, but you're still talking significant $, not just a webcam and OpenCV.
