Q:

Accessing custom rosbuild msgs in catkin

I'm trying to access custom rosbuild msgs in catkin. I've tried using add_dependencies( .... ) but it did not work.
How do I include custom rosbuild packages and their msgs/srvs in catkin CMakeLists?
The catkin packages reside in catkin_ws and the rosbuild packages reside in rosbuild_ws.

A:

You cannot have a catkin package depend on a rosbuild package. Catkin packages provide a backwards compatibility layer to let rosbuild packages build on top, but it does not work the other way.
