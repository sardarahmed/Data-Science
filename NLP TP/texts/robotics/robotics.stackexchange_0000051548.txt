Q:

How to install morse1.0 on ubuntu 12.04?

I followed MORSE installation.
It says 'morse-1.0 is available on Debian Wheezy/Ubuntu >= 13.04'.
I want to ask how to install morse-1.0 on ubuntu 12.04 64bits,because ROS groovy is only supported by 11.10,12.04,12.10.
Thank you~

A:

Since it is a MORSE specific question, you may consider joining the MORSE user mailing list (morse-users@laas.fr).
On a personal account, I installed MORSE 0.6 binding with ROS fuerte on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, 32 bit, but have not tried MORSE 1.0.
UPDATE-1 (For MORSE 0.6 installation with ROS fuerte on Ubuntu 12.04) : Please follow the instructions on this link, this works just fine ! http://www.warp1337.com/content/morse-and-ros-detailed-installation-howto-ubuntu-precise
UPDATE-2 : Have a look here, http://answers.ros.org/question/64032/how-to-install-groovy-on-ubuntu-1304/

@sam I am not entirely sure ! that installation worked for me ! if you have issues then post it to Florian Lier or to morse-user mailing list.
