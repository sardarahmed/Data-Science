Q:

Most popular packages/stacks

Hello,
I discovered the MoveIt and navigation packages that are really awesome, and I would like to know if there's a listing somewhere with the other packages that are as huge.
I know there's a wiki page with ALL the packages/metapackages/stacks, but the list is really huge and there are a lot of small packages, so if anybody has a list containing the ones that should not be missed, it would be really helpful for beginners like me :)

OpenCv - for vision
gmapping and openslam_gmapping - evident from the names
PCL with ROS
