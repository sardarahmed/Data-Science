Q:

hector exploration with move base

Hi, there,
I am trying out hector exploration on my robot and I have a few questions regarding the configuration. I have used the explore package before and the result is ok. The hector exploration, on the other hand, appears better on paper (though not confirmed). My specific questions are:
In order to use hector exploration, another node need to call the service provided by the hector_exploration_node and feeds the provided goals to move_base. However, when I dig out the hector_exploration_node source code, I don't see a "goal" message published, instead it is the trajectory (hector navigation msg) message. How do I pass this trajectory msg to move base as a goal?  Thanks a lot

A:

I concede that integration with move_base wasnÂ´t a top priority with hector_exploration. There currently is no code to directly write out a generated target pose, but you can just take the last pose in the generated nav_msgs/Path message and forward that to move_base. The nice thing about the way hector_exploration works is that along with the generated exploration pose, it also produces a path to it. This is pretty hard to leverage with the way move_base works, however.

Thanks Stefan. I also noticed that there is a hector_path_follower node in the package and it is used together with the navigation_experimental package. If I were to use these two, do I still need move_base?

No, in that case, the robot can explore the environment without using move_base at all. This is mainly for demonstration though and does not have some of the advanced features of move_base (like avoidance of dynamic obstacles).

Hello, I am to use the hector_exploration_node on ROS Hydro, with a Husky, but I don't succeed to compile the node and can't use it. Do you have any idea? Is it because of the ROS version? Thank you
