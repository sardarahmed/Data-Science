Q:

Object recognition capture unable to find Pose

I have an Ubuntu 12.10 with ROS groovy configuration. I use a kinect on a USB2.0 port.
I would like to use the object_recognition package but I don't succeed in make the capture tool work.
I succeed capturing my textured_plane but impossible to have a 3D position displayed when I track the features.
Here is my command line for capturing my textured plane :
rosrun object_recognition_capture orb_template -o my_textured_plane --res sxga --fps 15

But when I try to see the position tracking, no position is outputed in the video
rosrun object_recognition_capture orb_track --track_directory my_textured_plane --res sxga --fps 15

But, if I show the matches, the features detection seems to work quite well.

So I try some different parameters (more feature points, less threshold ...) but the position never appears.
Does anyone have a clue on why the 3D position is not display while the features are correctly detected?
PS : I also try rosrun object_recognition_capture capture -i my_textured_plane --seg_z_min 0.01 -o silk.bag --preview --res sxga --fps 15 but no object is detected.

Thanks, I will mail him to see if I can help

A:

Have you ever tried:
rosrun object_recognition_capture capture --seg_z_min 0.01 -o silk.bag --preview --res sxga --fps 15

Omitting the -i parameter sets the capture app to use the printed markers.
This works for me!
Remark: The orb_template step is not needed if you omit -i.
It seems that there is a bug in orb_template or in capture when matching the features to the template's.

Wow, it works for me! Thank you for your solution.

I will try this tonight but I wanted to use my own textured plane.

After a try, it seems that it works wih the standard template. I have upvote your answer but there is still a bug when using our own textured plane.
