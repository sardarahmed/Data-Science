Q:

Couldn't find executable named rqt_graph

I'm running on ubuntu 14.04 indigo. since I don't have Internet access from the computer that I am working on, therefore I cannot use sudo apt-get ... commands. Therefore, I used a usb to transfer all the files. I used this link  to make sure I am downloading the right for my system.
I built rqt(0.4.8) and rqt_graph(0.4.8) from the source, when I ran catkin_make, it builts successfully. However, when I try to ran rosrun rqt_graph rqt_graph
it shows me the following:
/catkin_ws$ rosrun rqt_graph rqt_graph

[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named rqt_graph below /home/administrator/catkin_ws/src/rqt_graph

[rosrun] Found the following, but they're either not files,

[rosrun] or not executable:

[rosrun] /home/administrator/catkin_ws/src/rqt_graph

[rosrun] /home/administrator/catkin_ws/src/rqt_graph/src/rqt_graph

[rosrun] /home/administrator/catkin_ws/src/rqt_graph/scripts/rqt_graph

So I went into rqt_graph/script/rqt_graph and made it into an executable, then I ran rosrun rqt_graph rqt_graph again, and it gave me the following:
RosPluginProvider.load(rqt_graph/RosGraph) exception raised in __builtin__.__import__(rqt_graph.ros_graph, [RosGraph]): Traceback (most recent call last):

Anyone got suggestions on how I should fix this?

Looks like something is missing. Try running:
rosdep check rqt_graph

shows me: apt ros-indigo-qt-dotgraph,
so I downloaded the 0.2.32 version. Now, when I do run rosrun rqt_  tab tab, it actually shows me rqt_graph, but it still gave me the error saying can't find an executable. Then, when I made it an executable, it shows me the import error.

What version of the package ros-indigo-python-qt-binding do you have installed?

A:

I ended up configuration multiple computer network, so that I can connect to the Husky PC1 with PC2 that has wifi. Once, the rqt_graph is downloaded on PC2, I configured the network to connect PC2 to PC1, then, from PC2, I can use rqt_graph to see all the nodes and topics.
