Q:

Interactive Service Server

For actions, there is the very convenient axserver.py node in the actionlib package that provides a simply GUI for an interactive action server.
Is there something similar for services as well? I may implement something myself but would like to avoid unnecessary work if there is already something working out there.

Would the rqt_service_caller suffice?

I did not test, but from the description it is for calling services, i.e. it is a GUI for the client. What I want is a GUI for the server. However, I just managed to adapt the axserver.py for services, it was actually easier than I expected.

Yes, the rqt plugin is a service client. I'd missed the bit where axserver.py is a server.

A:

Since I did not find an existing solution, I took the axserver.py and modified it to work with services instead.
It is available here: https://github.com/synapticon/rx_service_tools
