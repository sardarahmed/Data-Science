Q:

Help with gmapping results using (slower) rplidar on turtlebot2

I mounted my new Robopeak rplidar on the center of the turtlebot's top plate, and modified the various launch/urdf to use this scanner for gmapping.  However I have not modified any of the gmapping parameters, I'm using the same files as the turtlebot gmapping tutorials.
I can teleop around and get a map, but the walls are rather thick and fuzzy.  I suspect this is a result of the rplidar publishing at only 5 hz, not 50 hz as the original kinect.   Or possibly because the rplidar is 360 degrees and kinect was only 57 degrees?
Does anyone know why my map doesn't show a sharp defined wall?
Is the slower publishing rate responsible?
What params for gmapping should I modify to optimize for the slower rate?
I tried to add a small jpg of the map image, but not enough points.
This is on Hydro/Ubuntu 12.04, using a turtlebot2 (kobuki).
thanks
buddy

Excuse me, dear mrsoft99,  I'm sorry to interrupt you. But I am facing a problem about gmapping with rplidar on turtlebot2, I am just starting to ROS, and I am struggling with this problem for a week. Could you teach me how to modify the launch/urdf?

A:

Maybe you already solve the problem. If not you can find here how to make RPLidar works with GMapping.
