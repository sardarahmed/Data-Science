Q:

Protocol for exchanging b/w ROS and Linux devs

Please, advise the protocol for exchanging of information between the ROS and auxiliary functional elements based on Linux? Earlier was thinking to use simple_massage...
The problem is as follows:

Have a central brain through ROS;
Have several executive functional
units made on Linux devices.

Necessary to provide communication between the functional units and the center.
With best regards,
Wagan Sarukhanov

What do you mean exactly with "auxiliary functional elements based on Linux"? Small embedded computers? Microcontrollers? Smart sensors?
Comment by Wagan Sarukhanov on 2015-06-16:
You are right, it may be embedded controller or micro-PC or other. For example BeagleBone Black or CyberWRT device

A:

Perhaps you can use rosserial.
A more complete overview of some of the existing ROS client libraries targeted for use on embedded / small platforms is given in this answer to the cross-compile ros_comm for ARM9 LPC3250 question.

Edit:

You are right, it may be embedded controller or micro-PC or other. For example BeagleBone Black or CyberWRT device

For Beagle Bone (Black) you could also run a full OS + ROS. See wiki/BeagleBone for more information. Whether that is appropriate depends on your specific use case / requirements.

Thank you very much

Yes it's may be very interesting but in some cases we can not install ROS on embedded devise, therefore I asked about the appropriate interaction protocols. Thank you again
