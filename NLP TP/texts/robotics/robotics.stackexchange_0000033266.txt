Q:

cvCaptureFromCAM

Hello There, I am trying to save a stream of images from KInect camera. MY first line of code is:
CvCapture* capture = cvCaptureFromCAM(-1)
I passed -1 so that It can search for the camera because I don't know the index for KInect Camera. Can someone help me find out what it is or another method used in the past.
Many thanks

A:

if you use the openni_kinect node to publish the data from the kinect, you could subscribe to one of the camera topics(/camera/rgb/image_color or /camera/rgb/image_mono).
this would give you and image message which can be converted to an opencv iplimage using the cv_bridge package (http://www.ros.org/wiki/cv_bridge)
