Q:

Robot_upstart can't find path in my package

Hi everyone,
I got a bug using robot_upstart.
I tried the install script with differents packages located in my catkin workspace and I get this :
Unable to locate path launch/example_lucos.launch in package teleopRoboteq. Installation aborted.

Is my catkin workspace corrupted ?
Thanks
Edit 26/01/2015:
I just test with a new ROS instalation. I use a compiled package with catkin_make, roboteq_driver. The launcher and the job were correctly installed.
I tried with my robot description package and robot_upstart doesnt find it for an install. How do you install your robot description package with ROS and, more importantly, where ?

Can you also provide the rosrun command you used?
Comment by TomSon on 2016-01-20:
Here it is (something like that):
rosrun robot_upstart install lucos/launch/lucos.launch --interface p1p1

I also try on a new install and I get the same error.

It seems that there is a conflict between this 2 lines on some of my installations (.bashrc):
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

I have problems in robot_upstart too, maybe to write a upstart job to start your roslaunch is better option.

I have done the same installation (i'm using the two line script to install ROS) on another computer.
I just got the source of "joystick driver" and made a launch that I used with robot_upstart and I didn't get any trouble.

@TomSon: please describe your workspace layout and contents for us. Also add how you build it and what files you source (including your .bashrc). Issues with your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH would seem to suggest there is something incorrect in your ws setup / interaction.

A:

Your two source lines are not a conflict. In fact, both lines are necessary.
There may be a package name error in your rosrun command. What is your package name for the launch file in question? Can you provide the output of rospack find your_package_name ?

When I use rospack find , I dont find my package (here lucos).
Comment by Akif on 2016-01-20:
Then it means that you have a problem with your workspace sourcing. Can you post the output of echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH ?
Comment by joq on 2016-01-20:
Only the second source command is necessary. The first one should have been done before creating the catkin_ws initially. Perhaps that was not done correctly?
Comment by Akif on 2016-01-20:
@joq, it is not a must but wiki states: "This process allows you to install several ROS distributions (e.g. fuerte and groovy) on the same computer and switch between them."
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2016-01-20:
@Akif: no, @joq is correct. You should never need to do what @TomSon is doing, provided you created your workspace correctly. The "switching" you refer to is not meant to be in-place switching, but rather allows you to source a different setup.bash in a new terminal. Not in the same.
Comment by Akif on 2016-01-20:
Although I do not think the problem is related with that, I updated my answer with feedbacks from you and @joq. Sorry for that.
Comment by TomSon on 2016-01-21:
@gvdhoorn, so there is indeed an issue with my workspace freshly installed ?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2016-01-21:
Well it depends on how you set it up. In principle you only source the last workspace in a chain. In this case, I'd say that is your catkin_ws (which overlays /opt/ros/indigo/..). Sourcing more than one setup.bash is not recommended (if supported at all, without additional arguments).
Comment by TomSon on 2016-02-02:
Everyone! I think I got it. What is your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH ? I think it missed one, I will go check on my different installations.
