Q:

blob tracking in usb_cam?

How do I do blob tracking in usb_cam?
I loaded usb_cam package in the bosch_drivers, and followed Pharos test bed
http://pharos.ece.utexas.edu/wiki/index.php/How_to_Use_a_Webcam_in_ROS_with_the_usb_cam_Package
to try it out.  I got the video window OK!
I saw another cam package on Pharos mention blob tracking (launch looks similar).  Where is documentation on how to do blob tracking on usb_cam?
Thanks,
Alan

A:

On which page on the pharos wiki you saw the blob tracking? The usb_cam outputs a video stream on /usb_cam/image_raw. You should change the blob tracker to look at this videostream.

The page is: http://pharos.ece.utexas.edu/wiki/index.php/How_to_Detect_Blobs_using_ROS_Package_cmvision.  It's another package, cmvision.  Are these drivers, and another package (transport?) gets called to do the blob detection?  I didn't see cmvision example doing the blob detection, for that matte

You can just roslaunch that file and it will start your webcam and the blob tracking. Documentation is here: http://www.ros.org/wiki/cmvision
