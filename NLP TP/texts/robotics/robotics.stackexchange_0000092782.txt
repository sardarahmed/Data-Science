Q:

Why isn't image_transport_plugins available on ROS2 dashing?

Hello, I've been using image_transport on ROS crystal but now I would like to upgrade to dashing. I noticed ros-dashing-image-transport exists, but ros-dashing-image-transport-plugins doesn't. Why so, if it was available on crystal?

A:

Apologies, this was likely me missing the package on the checklist when doing the release.  I'll get it released for you.
