Could you please clarify what you want to do exactly? MoveIt for instance is not part of ROS-Industrial. All the other packages in ROS-Industrial (Descartes fi) can be build from source on Hydro, Indigo and Jade.

A:

Does ros industrial indigo version exist

Depends on what components you're thinking about but yes, industrial_core package suite and driver package of several industrail robots (e.g. fanuc, UR, abb) are available in Indigo via DEB (apt-get-ttable).

or ROS industrial hydro can be used with ROS indigo

It might work but cross-distro compatibility is never guaranteed AFAIK.
Cf. distributions.
