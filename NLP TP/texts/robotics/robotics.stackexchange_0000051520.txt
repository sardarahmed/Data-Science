Q:

gmapping-pointcloud_to_laserscan-laser

Dear all.
I am just wondering whether it might be possible to use gmapping using laser and kinect/xtion pro based on pointcloud_to_laser.
I appreciate any suggestions,
Cheers

A:

Like already mentioned you can use gmapping with kinect provided u have odometry reading. If u dont have odometry data u can use hector SLAM as it only requires laser scans..

well, what I really mean is that I want to use both laser and knect to build a map with gmapping. Is it possible to use both sensors? I have a fake laser from Xtion pro using pointcloud_to_laser  and a real laser maps.
