Q:

How to generate bag migration scripts in Fuerte?

How do I follow this part of the rosbag migration directions in Fuerte?
$ rosrun rosbag makerule.py MyMsg.saved myrule.bmr

The makerule.py and savemsg.py scripts are missing from the Fuerte rosbag package.
Is that a bug, or have they moved somewhere else?

A:

Since no one has answered, I created a ROS defect ticket in hopes of getting the problem resolved.
UPDATE: this was a bug, now fixed. Some scripts were not getting installed with the new catkin build system.
