Q:

How to add an image as ground plane in Citadel

So, I tried to follow several like this link
And this
Then I tried to follow this, but I'm convinced that this is for classic gazebo only, not Citadel.
I still can't find why it couldn't load the image.
Here is the current plane:

The goal is to have this

I downloaded directly from this link
The directories is like this;

So the sdf with worlds is this:
      <model name='conde_world'>
  <static>true</static>
  <link name='link_ground'>
    <visual name='visual_ground'>
      <geometry>
        <plane>
          <normal>0 0 1</normal>
          <size>174 417</size>
        </plane>
      </geometry>
      <material>
        <script>
          <uri>model://conde_world/materials/scripts</uri>
          <uri>model://conde_world/materials/textures</uri>
          <name>Floor/Image</name>
        </script>
      </material>
    </visual>
    <collision name='collision'>
      <geometry>
        <plane>
          <normal>0 0 1</normal>
          <size>174 417</size>
        </plane>
      </geometry>
    </collision>
  </link>
</model>

The question is why can't I load it? Is it a bug?

A:

Thanks to @chapulina for give me a new route to explore,
I finally manage to find a way to import an image. Here is the snippet of how you import.
  <material>
    <ambient>0.8 0.8 0.8 1</ambient>
    <diffuse>0.8 0.8 0.8 1</diffuse>
    <specular>1 0.8 0.8 1</specular>
    <pbr>
        <metal>
          <albedo_map>floor.png</albedo_map>
          <normal_map>floor.png</normal_map>
        </metal>
      </pbr>
  </material>

Keep that in mind, this will find where the model.sdf is in. Just add your picture to there.
Also <Specular> is a bug atm.
