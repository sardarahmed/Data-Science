Q:

tf for mutiple Aruco markers

Hi,
I'm able to get the tf for one Aruco marker .Here is my code snippet
br = tf.TransformBroadcaster()
   
   
br.sendTransform((msg.pose.position.x,msg.pose.position.y,msg.pose.position.z),
                     (msg.pose.orientation.x,msg.pose.orientation.y,msg.pose.orientation.z,msg.pose.orientation.w),
                     rospy.Time.now(),
                     msg.child_frame_id,
                     "/camera_link")

So, if i have multiple markers how to add frames for each of the detected marker`?

A:

I solved it by adding an array type message then subscribing to it. No more hard-coding required.
