Q:

how to use tum_simulator in kinetic ros?

I am using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and I have installed kinetic ROS in my system. But I am unable to get any autopilot simulator  like tum_simulator for a.r. drone to control it with the laptop keyboard. The tum_simulator is for indigo ROS which is not running with the kinetic ROS.
Is there any library which makes me able to use the tum_simulator using kinetic ROS?

A:

The tum_simulator package has not been actively maintained for a long time. Thankfully someone has already ported it to work on Kinetic. Here's the repository. You will need to clone and checkout the kinetic branch.
