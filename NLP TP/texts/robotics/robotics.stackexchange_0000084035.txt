Q:

URDF tutorial help

I'm trying to learn ROS and URDF.
I am looking into this tutorial but I am immediately lost at the second step where I am supposed to execute the launch file.
In other words, I'm supposed to execute :
> $ roslaunch urdf_tutorial display.launch model:=urdf/01-myfirst.urdf

But the tutorial does not indicate what display.launch is nor what it contains. I executed catkin_create_pkg my_robot and my code looks like the following:
my_robot
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── package.xml
└── urdf
    └── 01-myfirst.urdf

A:

It's referring to urdf_tutorial package. You can install it with sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-urdf-tutorial.

Thank you for for your input.
Perhaps because I'm using Indigo, your suggested code did not work.
However, I executed sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-urdf-tutorial and the package installed.
I now have urdf_tutorial.
Appreciated!
