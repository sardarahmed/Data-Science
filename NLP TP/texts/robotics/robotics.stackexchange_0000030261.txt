Q:

How do I visualize acceleration?

I need to create a visualization for IMU sensor (acceleration in my case). I wanted to create a plug-in or some visualization that allows to see the acceleration as a time plot for each axis, displayed in a separate windows, as the camera display.

Any idea on how to accomplish this?

Didn't know this application, this works for the time being.

The easiest option is using rxplot to display the acceleration.
