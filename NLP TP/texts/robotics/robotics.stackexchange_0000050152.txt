Q:

How to import sr_robot_msgs in Python

I tried to run this code but doesn't work.

#!/usr/bin/env python

import roslib; roslib.load_manifest('rospy_tutorials')

import rospy
from std_msgs.msg import *
from stacks.shadow_robot.sr_robot_msgs.msg import JointControllerState

def callback(data):
    rospy.loginfo(rospy.get_caller_id()+"I heard %s", data)
    
def listener():

    rospy.init_node('listener', anonymous=True)

    rospy.Subscriber("sh_ffj3_mixed_position_velocity_controller/command", JointControllerState, callback)

    # spin() simply keeps python from exiting until this node is stopped
    rospy.spin()
        
if __name__ == '__main__':
    listener()

the answer for this is:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/paulo/ros_workspace/sandbox/beginner_tutorials/scripts/listener.py", line 7, in 
    from stacks.shadow_robot.sr_robot_msgs.msg import JointControllerState
ImportError: No module named stacks.shadow_robot.sr_robot_msgs.msg

A:

Hi,
To import it as for any other packages, make sure it is listed in the dependencies in your package manifest.xml.
Then the correct line is:
from sr_robot_msgs.msg import JointControllerState
