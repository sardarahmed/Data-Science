Q:

Gazebo shutdown (BadDrawable)

Occasionally gazebo crashes with a BadDrawable error, but the crash seems to be unrelated to anything else I do - I have been able to repeat the command and gazebo launches fine, but sometimes the error repeats once, twice, or more.
Has anyone else had a similar problem?

What kind of graphics hardware are you running?

Mobile Intel 4 Series Express Chipset - just the default graphics card that came on my laptop

A:

Many Intel graphics cards have difficulty in running Gazebo. This would cause your error. See here for a list of supported hardware.

Thank you, that's what I was afraid of. At least I know what the problem is though

I wonder if this is related, can some one test it out by disabling sync to vblank?  thanks.  http://www.preshweb.co.uk/2011/05/ubuntu-11-04-x-freezing-after-screensaver-active-laptop-lid-closed/
