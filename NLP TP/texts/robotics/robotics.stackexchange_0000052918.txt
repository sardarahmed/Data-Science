Q:

C++11 compatibility

Hello,
Is it possible yet to have a package in ROS compiled with c++ 11 support? Or does ROS need to be compiled from source with c++ 11? If so, is this possible?
Thanks in advance.

A:

I might be wrong but would like to give it a try.
Given that ROS supports only C++03 up to Hydro so far and as far as I haven't seen discussion about C++0x support, I think your question falls into general C++ discussion. And because of possible API incompatibility, mixing compiled C++03 and C++0x may or may not work.

UPDATE) This newer thread might answer more to your interest.

I had seen that post too, but since it was from 2011 I had hoped it would be possible by now. I added the c++0x flag and the c++11 flag but in both cases I get an error from some ros messages. Guessing it is not possible yet, but it has been out for a while now so making that step seems logical.

I would suggest then to start discussion in ros-users (I'm not sure which component is the right place).

Thank you for the update, I am indeed using OSX. Too bad c++11 support doesn't work proper on OSX then.
