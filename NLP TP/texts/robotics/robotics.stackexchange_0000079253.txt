A:

If you can find source code for the package (for example on github) then you can clone the repository to your workspace and try to build it by yourself (using catkin_make) as you would normally do with any other package.
There is a risk that a package might have some dependencies on other packages that are not supported in Kinetic in which case you have to resolve them yourself.
Good luck!

I'm guessing from the last commit date that this repository contains the source code for rosprofiler targeting indigo: https://github.com/osrf/rosprofiler
