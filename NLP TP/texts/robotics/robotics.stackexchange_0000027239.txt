Q:

Setting up a TCP server on gazebo ::Unable to use the gazebo::transport::Conection::listen() function

I am a beginner on gazebo I am trying to figure out how to use the gazebo::transport::Connection::Listen() function
Im unable to understand how to write the accept callback function I would be grateful if any one could post an example or guide me on how to write the accept callback function What ive written so far is :
//In the load function
transport::ConnectionPtr IMUcomm;
IMUcomm  = transport::ConnectionPtr(new transport::Connection);
IMUcomm->Listen(30000,acceptME);
//Outside the load but in the gazebo namespace
void acceptME(const transport::ConnectionPtr& comm)
{}

A:

Gazebo's Connection class is fairly low level, and not intended for direct use outside of Gazebo.
Here are some tutorials on using Gazebo's transport mechanisms.
There is also publisher example code, and subscriber example code

Then what do you suggest I should use to communicate with a program that is running the mission control code (Written in java) via TCP/IP

I believe zeromq has a java interface.
