Q:

Failed to fetch ros-cturtle-web-interface for lucid: "404 not found"

I'm setting up a build server and trying to match as best I can the packages on the three latest versions: cturtle, diamondback, electric.
In trying to install ros-cturtle-pr2, apt attempts to get ros-cturtle-web-interface:
The following extra packages will be installed:
  ros-cturtle-web-interface

And I'm getting a 404 on apt-get install attempt:
Failed to fetch http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu/pool/main/r/ros-cturtle-web-interface/ros-cturtle-web-interface_0.4.4-s1302754950~lucid_i386.deb  404  Not Found

It looks like the apt package list is listing a package it doesn't have.
I'm in the process of submitting a bug report, but wanted to ask here first before I submit. Anyone familiar with this issue?

A:

The cturtle Debian packages have been updated. You need to run "sudo apt-get update" to get the latest package index. After that, installing should just work fine. You can check on the server http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu/pool/main/r/ros-cturtle-web-interface/ what the current build version of the package is.
