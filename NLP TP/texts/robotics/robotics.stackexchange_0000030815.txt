Q:

'rosnode list' does not show the roscore in other computer

I installed Ubuntu 10.04 on two different Virtual Box.
I set the network mode as Bridge, that retrieves IP address from my router (Apple Airport).
The machine #1 has 10.0.1.24
The machine #2 has 10.0.1.25.
I ran the roscore in machine #1.
And 'rosnode list' on machine #2.
But I don't know why roscore of machine #1 does not show up in machine #2.

Can you edit your question to explain exactly what you're seeing and what you expect the output to be.  roscore is not itself a node and will not show up on rosnode list.

A:

You need to set ROS_MASTER_URI as Martin said, but you may also need to set ROS_HOSTNAME. See http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/MultipleMachines for a full tutorial.
