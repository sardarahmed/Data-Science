Q:

What causes my Gazebo robot model to repeatedly give "Couldn't find an AF_INET address for []" in termiinal and crash

I am changing a world file to a model and removed the world content and only have the model.
I'm new to gazebo and do not know why this is happening

A:

You're probably using a model with ROS plugins. I've noticed this when I use robot models that use the gazebo_ros_control plugin and possibly others. Are you using ROS? If you comment out all the plugins in your robot it should go away.
