Q:

gmapping parameters

Hello everybody! I would like to create a map with gmapping with 10x10 cells dimension and that every cells are bigger than my robot. Is it possibile? which parameters of gmapping do I have to modify?

A:

Theoretically those:

~xmin (float, default: -100.0)
Initial map size
~ymin (float, default: -100.0)
Initial map size
~xmax (float, default: 100.0)
Initial map size
~ymax (float, default: 100.0)
Initial map size
~delta (float, default: 0.05)
Processing parameters (resolution of the map)

However, 10x10 is a VERY small map with a VERY rough solution. This sounds really odd. Especially with a resolution of let's say 0.5m (guessed robot size) you will get localization accuarcy at best in this magnitude which is not preferable.

with those parametrs I have a very BIG map! Are you sure abot xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax?

You need to set them differently of course. These are just the defaults.

ok so I I want 10x10 cell I have to modify this way?:
xmax=10;
ymax=10;
xmin=-10
ymin=10;

That depends how large the cells are. The min/max values are in meters.
Comment by alex920a on 2014-08-13:
my robot is 1m big. I want to have my robot smaller than the cells
Comment by dornhege on 2014-08-13:
The cell size is called delta here.
Comment by alex920a on 2014-08-14:
is it delta in meters?
Comment by dornhege on 2014-08-14:
yes                .

ok thanks! so if i want cells 1m big do I have to set delta =1?
