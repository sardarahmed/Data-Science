Hi @Lekha
The only thing they did is to generate a yellow plane with Gazebo Materials. You can check the Gazebo model that the tutorial is using here. You should place the yellow_line folder than contains the Gazebo model on .gazebo/models folder to be able to use in the simulator.
Besides that, in this other link you will find the specific Gazebo worlds the tutorial use so you do not really need to build the world by yourself.

Yeah thanks, @Weasfas
but even though I created the model .it is not seen in the Gazebo simulator. Please me out.
I added the model in-home/lekha/gazebo/model/yellowline
I have created both model.sdf and model.config files

To add the model in .gazebo  it is not visible in the home

Yes, the folder must be in home/username/.gazebo/models/. You can also set up your custom models path: check this.

Thank you Ia m gonna try .but when I am checking in terminal it is visible but when I wanna go directly and open that folder in-home/lekha it is not visible

Yes that is because by default folders starting with . in ubuntu are hidden, you can change that in your settings.
