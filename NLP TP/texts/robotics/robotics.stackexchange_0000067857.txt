Q:

How to write to a file using roslaunch (Python)

Hi,
I am trying to write to file with a python script using pickle. I am able to do this if I run the script directly using python (file name) but when I run the script using roslaunch it does not write to the file.
How can I make it write to the file while using roslaunch to launch the script?
Thanks!

A:

roslaunch by default starts the nodes in the working directory ROS_HOME, which defaults to ~/.ros/, i. e. /home/user_name/.ros. You may specify the working directory to the directory of the exec by setting the cwd attribute of the node tag: http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML/node
Another workaround is to give your file operations a full path, as @Bill Smart suggested. You can also set the desired path to a ros parameter, read the ros parameter and operate on the thereby retrieved full path if you which to avoid hard coding the path.
