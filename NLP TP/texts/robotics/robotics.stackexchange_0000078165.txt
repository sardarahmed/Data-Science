Q:

Qt Creator 4.2 - CMake

Today,
I updated Qt Creator from some 3.x version to 4.2 and now it can't run CMake as before :s
I tried both sugestion without success, set CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH and "roscpp_DIR"
Running "/usr/bin/cmake /home/ze/catkin/src/WiiGo_sw/wiigo_safe '-GCodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles' -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:STRING=/usr/bin/g++ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER:STRING=/usr/bin/gcc -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:STRING=/home/ze/Qt/5.5/gcc_64 -DQT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE:STRING=/home/ze/Qt/5.5/gcc_64/bin/qmake -Droscpp_DIR:PATH=/opt/ros/indigo/share/roscpp/cmake/roscppConfig.cmake" in /tmp/qtc-cmake-X0aSlj.

A:

For some reason -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:STRING=/home/ze/Qt/5.5/gcc_64 need to change it to -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:STRING=home/ze/catkin/devel;/opt/ros/indigo
Why this happen I don;t know...
