Q:

Using an IMU to build an INS

What's needed to utilize an IMU such as the ArduIMU+ V3 to be used in an INS. Is there any other hardware needed? 

A:

It contains all the necessary components to function as a rudimentary IMU.
If you read through the comments here, you'll see that either a GPS or magnometer will be required for error correction. All IMUs will suffer from drift without some calibration, especially one this cheap! I don't see a clear answer on whether this can operate without one, but I imagine it could, albeit with a large margin of error.
