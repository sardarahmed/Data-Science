Q:

Painting a cell in Stage

Hello everyone,
My robot has to traverse from one point to another using the Stage simulator. I would like to paint the start and end cell but I don't know which message I have to send on which topic.
Thanks in advance.

A:

Do you need to change the Start and End point during the runtime? If not you can create a way-point mark ( none obstacle ) for it to show the start and end point.
