Q:

Continous rotation with cables

A motor needs to spin n*360 degrees. On top of the motor there are distance sensor which scan the room. I.e. lidar. What options do I have for implementing a continous rotation while having cables which are in the way?

A:

There is also ready to use commercial solution from Adafruit, called "slip ring" http://www.adafruit.com/products/736
The only problem is the max speed, which is only 300rpm, but probably you won't get any better with a custom solution.
