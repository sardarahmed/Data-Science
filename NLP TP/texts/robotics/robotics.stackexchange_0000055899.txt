Q:

RViz quietly ignores if .rviz file given with -d option doesn't exist?

e.g. in Hydro,
$ rosrun rviz rviz -d $(rospack find urdf_tutorial)/urdf.rviz
$ rosrun rviz rviz -d $(rospack find urdf_tutorial)/urdf_noexist.rviz 

With first line loads RobotModel pane for instance. With second line no error output printed, RViz looks like starts with default config.

A:

That's the same behavior I've seen - rviz starts but doesn't create that file until you save the config. I assumed this behavior was intended.
