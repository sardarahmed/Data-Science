Q:

ROS2 prerelease website

Is there a prerelease website for ROS2 similar to the ROS1 prerelease website? Are you planning to run one in case?

A:

There is not currently an equivalent. I expect in the future that we will be able to extend that site to support both ROS 1 and ROS 2 distros in the future. We do not yet have the job types fully integrated for deploying it on ROS 2 versions of the distro yet.
Any interest or contributions would be appreciated and could likely make this happen sooner.

We do have the logic for prerelease jobs for ROS 2. They are basically devel jobs run locally. Only the prerelease site doesn't support ROS 2 atm. Since the website only generates a command you need to run locally you can "construct" that manually.

You will need a custom ROSDISTRO_INDEX_URL mentioned in https://github.com/ros2/ros2/wiki/Releasing-a-ROS-2-package-with-bloom#differences-from-ros-1-bloom as well as the ros_buildfarm package from this branch: https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/ros_buildfarm/pull/548
