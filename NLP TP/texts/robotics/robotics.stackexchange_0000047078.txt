Q:

How can I install openrave package for Fuerte?

I'm trying to install the openrave ROS package for Fuerte on Ubuntu 12.04, but I can't find it (nothing looking like ros-fuerte-openrave... in the available packages in the repositories).
The wiki page http://ros.org/wiki/openrave says "Cannot load information on name: openrave, distro: fuerte" so I don't know where should I get the source code from to install the package from source.
Does anyone know how could I install this package?
Edit: I've found this question http://answers.ros.org/question/32866/installing-openrave-package/ where the code of the openrave_planning (that happens to contain the package I need) is checked out from:
svn co https://jsk-ros-pkg.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jsk-ros-pkg/trunk/openrave_planning

I assume this is the right repo, but still the wiki doesn't point to the right data, and no package for this stack exists in the ROS fuerte ubuntu repositories.

A:

That's the right place, I used a couple of packages from there with Fuerte last year.
People may write great ROS packages for their own research, but not have enough time to create a Ubuntu package or maintain external documentation like ROS wiki.
This guide will help you install it:

Thanks for the link. I finally installed openrave standalone, as I found out that it was only being used as a library by our package (we don't use any ROS node that the openrave ROS package may contain).
