Q:

Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid) Install of Unstable Fails

When I try to install unstable-desktop-full, by running
sudo apt-get install ros-unstable-desktop-full
on Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx), I get the following output:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
  ros-unstable-desktop-full: Depends: ros-unstable-vision-opencv (= 1.6.1-s1313731218~lucid) but it is not going to be installed
                         Depends: ros-unstable-image-pipeline (= 1.5.2-s1313736766~lucid) but it is not going to be installed
                         Depends: ros-unstable-image-transport-plugins (= 1.4.1-s1313731295~lucid) but it is not going to be installed
E: Broken packages

Any ideas why?

@sdavies The tutorial was out of date.  I've updated it to use electric

Do you really need the bleeding edge unstable version? There is a perfectly fine electric release available as well... :-)

For the same reasons, I am unable to run the following tutorial: http://www.ros.org/wiki/turtlebot_simulator/Tutorials/Installing%20TurtleBot%20Simulator

A:

While this may be an issue with OpenCV, just a heads up that the ROS team has stated that unstable will be very unstable during this early stage of development as low-level dependencies get a major overhaul for the upcoming Fuerte release. It is probably better to install the Electric release for most users.

Ok, thanks.  After tfoote fixed the above tutorial, I no longer need to use unstable.
