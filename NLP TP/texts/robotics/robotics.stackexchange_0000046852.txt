Q:

vmware subscriber multiplemachines problem

Hello,
I try to connect my Ubuntu system [a] to a virtual Ubuntu machine (VMware)[b] by network.
It seems to work. I can ping and ssh from one to the other machine.
Furthermore when I start a roscore on [a] I can run for example "rosrun rospy_tutorial listener.py" on machine [b] and it finds the roscore. If I start the talker on [a] I can see on [b] the topic "/chatter" and the node "/talker_3586_1356978819462".
But if I run the listener now on [b] (still with the roscore of [a]) it doesn't hear anything. I have no clue, where the problem is. Maybe someone can help me with that?
Some things that I have already tried:

Start a talker and listener only on machine [a] works.
Start a talker and listener only on machine [b] (with core of [a]) works.
Previously I had the Ubuntu system [a] also on a virtual machine and this example worked with both virtual machines [a] and [b] running in windows.

Best Jonathan

A:

ROS relies on bidirectional communications.  Make sure you work all the way through the Network Setup Guide This sounds like you have hostnames which cannot lookup fully on both machines.
