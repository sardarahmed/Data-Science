Q:

catkin_make, CMake Error on Raspberry Pi 2

I followed the instructions in the link down below to install ROS Jade on a Raspberry Pi 2 running ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS
link text
However, after setting up a catkin workspace and tried to run catkin_make, I got the following messages

CMake Error: your CXX compiler: "CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER-NOTFOUND" was not found. Please set CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER to a valid compiler path or name.

The problem is, I already have cmake installed, when I run cmake --version, I got

cmake version 2.8.12.2

Any idea how to solve the problem?

I encountered the same problem but solved it when I ran the following command.
sudo apt-get install build-essential -y
