Q:

Transparent cubes in RViz

Hello. I would like to visualize a cube in order to make visible only the edges of the cube the inner area to not be filled with any color.
Thank you.

A:

I don't know how/if the rviz cube markers can be displayed as wireframe, but you can use rviz line markers and add the 12 lines/cube.
If it's not too many it shouldn't be a performance problem.
