A:

Currently you can't, as we have not released our packages used for QR code detection yet. The underlying semantic worldmodel is released however, see the hector_object_tracker package. More detailed documentation is in the works, but will not be available till after RoboCup due to time constraints.

The hector_qrcode_detection package which we also use for RoboCup is available in the hector_vision stack now: https://github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/hector_vision .
