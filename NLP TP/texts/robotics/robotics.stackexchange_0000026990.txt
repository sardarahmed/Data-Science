Q:

When will the 'prerender' or 'entitycreated' events be triggered

I bind my callback function with those two event in the world plugin, but they never are triggered. I would like to know why. I can't find much information on the wiki.
Thanks.
The two functions I used are:
static ConnectionPtr    ConnectCreateEntity (T _subscriber)

and
static ConnectionPtr    ConnectPreRender (T _subscriber)

I think PreRender will only be triggered in System-Plugins (client side)
