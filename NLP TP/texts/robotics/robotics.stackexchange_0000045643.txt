Q:

Migrating from Electric to Fuerte

I would like to migrate from Electric to Fuerte. Is it a good practise to keep the previous electric stacks? In my opinion if Fuerte provides backward compatibility, then i can just ignore electric. Or, if I install fuerte then, ros will manage by itself(assuming I'm too optimist in this case).
Any good link to assist this migration(related commands etc)
Thanks in advance.

A:

Here is the main Fuerte migration page.
In your tags you mention Ubuntu 12.04, Precise. Electric is not supported on that distribution. If you need both, use Ubuntu 10.10, Oneiric, instead.
ROS distributions are packaged so they can coexist on a single system. I find it helpful to keep both the old and new version when upgrading.

Make sure each shell only sources the setup for a single version.
Always cleanly recompile all source overlays for the target version. I find it simplest to check out separate copies.

@joq: Could you point me to any thread/discussion mentioning about installing from "source vs  prebuilt". I know the existance of this link "http://www.ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Installation/Ubuntu" but there are people saying that it's better to install the one that requiring building from source.

What say you?
Comment by joq on 2012-11-10:
I can't think of any advantage to building from source. That seems to be significantly more difficult with Fuerte.
