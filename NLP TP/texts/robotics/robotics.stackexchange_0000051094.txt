Q:

Programmatically get node's Namespace

Is there a way to get a node's current namespace?
Say I launch a node like this
<launch>
<group ns="robot_1">
<node pkg="myrobot" type="robot" name="robot"/>
</group>
</launch>

then this node is really called /robot_1/robot. Now what if it should publish something on a topic whose name depends on the namespace?
So in this case the topic may be /robot_1/control.
Is there a way I can get my code to dynamically find this namespace?

Do you mean that you'd prefer to select that the node publishes  in /robot_1/robot instead of /robot?

A:

If something needs to subscribe to the control topic, if it is in the same namespace as the robot node then subscribing to control will automatically find the /robot_1/control topic.  Subscribing to /control will not automatically find the one you want.  More can be read here.
Also note that if for some reason you need to get the namespace of a particular node from within that node you can do this in both  roscpp and rospy using
std::string ns = ros::this_node::getNamespace();

and
ns = rospy.get_namespace()

Thanks Jarvis, that was exactly what I needed.
