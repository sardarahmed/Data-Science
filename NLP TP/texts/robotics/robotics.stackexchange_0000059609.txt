Q:

Beaglebone Black Rev C Debian Wheezy doesn't work with ROS?

Is ROS ready for Debian on the BBB Rev C? Looks like there are many unavailable packages still. ROScore would not run or couldn't be found. The step: "Install bootstrap dependencies" failed.

Which installation instructions are you following? There are lots of debs available for Ubuntu on BBB; is installing Ubuntu an option for you?

I must have made a mistake with some command. Today it is working flawlessly for Debian. It surely takes a while to prepare the environment on the wstool init command. That little BBB CPU is hot!

A:

It is working fine but now I've filled up the 4 Gig eMMC with Debian and ROS. There must be a way to instruct it to install other files in the Micro SD. How does one do that? Actually I wouldn't need Gazebo and the Laser modules since I'm not planning on using them. The Micro SD is 16 Gig, so it should have plenty of room. Clearly ROS is "a piece of work!"

How did you overcome the error? :
python-catkin-pkg : Depends: python:any (>= 2.7.1-0ubuntu2) but it is not installable
