Q:

easy_install -U rospkg runs infinetly on debian bifferboard

I want to install ros on a bifferboard running debian squeeze. I had the same problem also with lenny and electric. The bifferboard is a small board running a 486 compatible CPU as 140 MHz.
I followed the tutorial on http://www.ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Installation/Debian and the first few steps work, but easy_install always freezes. I can have it running for a week, and it just uses the CPU and only a small amount of memory.
bifferboard:~# easy_install -U rospkg
install_dir /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/
Searching for rospkg

How could I debug this further?

A:

A guy from pip showed me how I could work around the problem, but he suggested, that it's bad practice for a package to try to import so much of itself from within setup.py.

That got me one step further. Now I have the same behavior with rosinstall. The following command ran for a couple of hours today without making any progress:
#rosinstall --catkin ~/ros-underlay http://ros.org/rosinstalls/fuerte-ros-base.rosinstall

When I terminated it with ctrl-c, I got something like a call stack:
    ^CTraceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/bin/rosinstall", line 5, in <module>
    pkg_resources.run_script('rosinstall==0.6.17', 'rosinstall')

    class SafeConstructor(BaseConstructor):
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/yaml/constructor.py", line 257, in SafeConstructor
    inf_value *= inf_value
KeyboardInterrupt

Running htop in another session suggests otherwise, but could that have to do with the limited resources of the device, or are these general problems?
