Q:

How to install packages from github

So, I know how to clone a repository from github, but that's all. I would like to install the common_msgs collection of packages onto my Raspberry Pi which is running debian jessie.  How do I go about installing ROS packages, or a collection of ROS packages from github?

A:

I believe you have a catkin workspace set up already. If not you can follow this. Once that is done, you can go to the github page for your package. In this case, I believe you are looking for common_msgs.
Open terminal and navigate to src folder in your catkin workspace:
cd ~/catkin_ws/src

Then clone the repository using:
git clone -b <branch> <address> 

For example, if you are looking to run it in ros hydro, your command could look like:
 git clone -b hydro-devel https://github.com/ros/common_msgs.git 

Once it is completed, do the following:
cd ~/catkin_ws 
catkin_make

I am using ros indigo and I followed ur steps but I am getting error : 'fatal: Remote branch indigo-devel not found in upstream origin'
Please help @skr_robo

In some cases, they may not have specific branch set up for your version of ROS. What I have posted here is only one possible example. Go to git and see what branches they have. If they haven't said anything about using a specific branch for indigo, the master branch should probably work.

If you still couldn't get it done, please post the git link here. Also, note that indigo-devel is only indigo development branch. It may not always be a good idea to use it. I strongly recommend you try:
git clone <address>

This time I got this error in the final step while doing catkin_make
Here is the link of github that has the package I want to install.

Finally I was able to execute catkin_make successfully. I figured out that I was missing a package called wxWidgets. On installing this package everything worked well
