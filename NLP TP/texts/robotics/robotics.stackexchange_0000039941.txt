Q:

RosoutPanel not included in Fuerte?

The rxtools libraries do not seem to be included in Fuerte. Is there any way to install them (or have they been moved to a new place maybe)? I have connected a RosoutPanel to my GUI, so it would be nice to be able to use it in the new relase too.
To clarify, i'm looking for the C++ source code, not rxconsole. I'm including rxtools/rosout_panel.h in my code, but can not find it in Fuerte.

The rxconsole command works for me. What OS are you using? Did you install from source or binaries?

The rxconsole command works, but i'm using the C++ library functions for rxtools::RosoutPanel. In Electric the code is located in stacks/rx/rxtools/src/ but in Fuerte the stack/rx is empty and the rxtools package has moved to share/ but there is no src directory, only bin/. I installed from binaries

I was under the impression that rxtools was getting deprecated in favor of the new ros_gui package that should be coming along shortly.  You may want to investigate that alternative.

Seems a bit odd to remove the old before having an alternative ready...

Yes, wx is deprecated in favor of Qt as a long-term goal due to cross-platform portability issues. But, http://ros.org/wiki/rxtools says its interfaces are "stable", with no deprecation indication. So, there is a defect somewhere: either in code or documentation.

Sorry, I was mistaken, the correct phrasing is that it is "End of Life" http://ros.org/wiki/fuerte#Migrating

A:

It looks like those C++ interfaces were left out when rxtools was converted to the new catkin build system. The rxtools::RosoutPanel is a documented interface, and its omission was probably unintentional.
Please open a defect ticket for the rx component on the ROS Trac system.
