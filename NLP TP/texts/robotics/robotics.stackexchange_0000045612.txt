Q:

How to use rosinstall with articulation

I am trying to install the articulation package. The documentation states you should do a svn checkout and run rosmake.
But this should now be done using rosinstall? How should this be done? Is there somewhere a clear a example of a .rosinstall file? How are missing dependencies handled then?
*In the end I just did it the old way by adding the path and ran rosmake. Only I got this error:*Error: package/stack rosgui_paramedit depends on non-existent package rqt_gui_cpp. but should this file not be present in the core installation?

A:

The best way to manage overlays and .rosinstall is to use rosws instead of doing that manually.
In general, your method also works. The tools only simplify that.
Regarding the rqt_gui_cpp warning: This is probably, because you added the trunk. If you don't need the paramedit rosgui plugin, it is safe to ignore. Otherwise, there is ros-fuerte-rqt, which contains rqt_gui_cpp.

Thanks! But I don't get it completely yet. I checked out the whole alufr-ros-pkg trunk because articulation required freiburg_tools which is in the same svn. However I still had to add the paths to the package path to be able to execute rosmake. Is this correct or can it be done more efficiently?

The package path handling, etc. is done automatically by rosws, if you use that. Instead of the trunk you could just have used freiburg_tools+articulation, but it's fine like this. The rosgui_paramedit/rqt_gui_cpp error is from another package in freiburg_tools that you probably don't need.
