Q:

necessary observation inputs for local costmap generation

hi, All,
in the costmap parameter definition below, are both inputs, laser and point cloud, needed?
observation_sources: laser_scan_sensor point_cloud_sensor
laser_scan_sensor: {sensor_frame: base_laser, data_type: LaserScan, topic: scan, marking: true, clearing: true}
point_cloud_sensor: {sensor_frame: base_laser, data_type: PointCloud, topic: point_cloud, marking: true, clearing: true}

can I have only one? say  laser_scan_sensor?
thanks
ray

A:

Yes you can. Does something with having only one not work?
