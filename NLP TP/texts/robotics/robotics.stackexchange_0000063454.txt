Q:

hector_navigation_node problem compilation

Hello,
I downloaded the hector_navigation package from github but doesn't succeed on using the hector_navigation_node
the error is : "ResourceNotFound: hector_exploration_node".
I downloaded the hector_gazebo and hector_slam packages too and don't have any problem to use them. Is there anything I have to add in a CMakeList.txt to compile this package?
Thank you for your answer

A:

Well, I used only catkin_make but had to use :
$rosmake hector_exploration_node

which is from the old version of ROS.
Now it works, thank you "ingcavh". Can you modify or complete your answer so that I can validate it, or validate mine because I can't from my own?
