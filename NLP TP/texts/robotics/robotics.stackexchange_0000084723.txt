A:

The warning was coming from rtabmap_ros/points_xyzrgb nodelet, caused by the voxel_size parameter which was set too small for the stereo point clouds. This is fixed in this commit where voxel_size is now disabled by default.
cheers

You can manually make the change in your installed rtabmap.launch, or copy rtabmap.launch to another location and modify it. No rebuild from source is required as it is a change in a launch file. You can also not subscribe to voxel_cloud in RVIZ, then the warning will disappear.
