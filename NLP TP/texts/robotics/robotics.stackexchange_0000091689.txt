Q:

Can you use SLAM Gmapping in conjunction with AMCL Node?

I understand that AMCL node deals with robot localization. SLAM gmapping deals with Localization and mapping. Is there anyway to use AMCL node with SLAM gmapping to properly localize my robot in a map?

A:

I believe the Gmapping node just uses a particle filter with a fixed number of particles.  The pose estimate generated by the gmapping node is basically not published but internally estimates the position. To increase localization while mapping you can increase the particles at the cost of computation. AMCL basically works on a generated map and dynamically assigns particles based on KL Distance. Hope it helps.

Thanks! where would I increase the particles if I'm using a lidar for scanning information?

A parameter called "particles" in the gmapping node can increase the number of particles in the particle filter.
