Q:

Issues with sourcing and overlaying packages

I was trying to overlay a package on my ROS Hydro and in order to not type it in every time, I added it to the .bashrc so that it looks like this:
source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash
source /home/robot2/overlay_ws/devel/setup.bash

However, when I try to do a normal roslaunch:
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch camera:=kinect_1 device_id:=1@0 

on openni_launch it gives the following message:
multiple files named [openni.launch] in package [openni_launch]:
- /opt/ros/groovy/share/openni_launch/launch/openni.launch
- /opt/ros/hydro/share/openni_launch/launch/openni.launch
Please specify full path instead

The thing is, the only ROS package being sourced should be a camera_pose package.  It doesn't have to do with the openni launching. I'm not sure why Groovy is being pulled in.  I have it installed but not sourced or on package path at all.

Can you update your question with the output of something like env | grep ROS? Without enough info, I can only assume that ROS_PACKAGE_PATH or else is messed up somehow.

A:

Clear the devel and build folder (along with hidden files) and do a catkin_make again.  The devel/.catkin and build/.project files at times have details of other workspaces for some reason.
