A:

It's still possible to run the rosdep (dependencies) installation again after the failure.  The second time around, no more shiboken installations are attempted.  Shiboken has already been installed at this point, and does not show up as a dependency.  However, it would be nice to eliminate this failure.

you should file a ticket for that. @WilliamWoodall where do you recommend?

This is the appropriate issue tracker: https://github.com/ros/rosdep/issues
Comment by WilliamWoodall on 2013-01-26:
rosdep should check that each dependency is still not installed before trying to install it, in this case shiboken is being installed for pyside and then rosdep trys to explicitly install shiboken again.

Sorry for the delay.  Do you still need me to create an issue in github?  I didn't know ROS answers doesn't auto-subscribe me to my own Questions.

I don't see one, you can open one if this is still an issue for you.

I will create an issue.  It looks like I did run into the same problem again while trying this new installation.
