Q:

Is there a way to call spinOnce for a specific subscriber?

Inside my node I have several callbacks. I want to avoid using spinOnce() inside my node as much as possible since the current job should always finish what it is doing before the next callback begins. However, there is one instance which I need to wait on a particular message before continuing. The current solution is to run spinOnce() in a loop, but this is not the way it should be done.
Is there a nice way of doing this? I've read a little about creating my own queuing system, but I would like to find a way that requires the fewest amount of changes.

A:

Section 4 in the roscpp callbacks and spinning describes how to assign different subscribers to different callback queues, and then you can spin the one callback queue for your subscriber without invoking callbacks for your other subscribers.

This is what I ended up doing. Created a separate nodehandle, queue, and used callAvailable on that queue.
