Q:

I get this error each time I try to run rosmake --> RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in cmp

Hey,
I created a new package and try to run rosmake...However, each time I do that this error appears and dunno why!
The error:
RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in cmp

A:

This error can occur when you have cyclical dependencies. Does your package depend on a package that also depends on your package? Sorry for the confusing wording, but I don't know of a better way to say it.
EDIT
Here's an example of a cyclical dependency:
Package A is called my_robot_config. Package B is called my_robot_sensors.
In the manifest.xml files:
my_robot_config

<depend package="my_robot_sensors" />

my_robot_sensors

<depend package="my_robot_config" />

All you have to do is look through the manifest.xml files in your packages to make sure that two packages don't depend on one another.

I'd just look at the two manifest and see if one is listed in the other

Is there a way I can check which dependency actually cause the cycle?
