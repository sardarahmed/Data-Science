Q:

I'd like to use gesture based input for my robot. What are the pros and cons between the Xtion Live and the Kinect?

As in the title, I'd like to implement gesture recognition on my robot and I'm looking for the pros and cons between the Kinect and the Xtion - and also if there are any other sensible options available.
I'm thinking of the following, but open to other suggestions:

Accuracy
Price
Driver quality
Power draw

A:

I know the Xtion is smaller and powered by USB where as the Kinect requires to use a wall power socket to operate. In terms of depth perception they are very similar in terms of accuracy. Depending on whether your robot needs to be portable (i.e not attatched to the mains) and small should probably be the deciding factor.

You might also consider the Leap Motion:

It's got amazing resolution, and the ability to pick out individual fingers at an amazing update rate.

And is even fine enough to allow you to write in the air with a pencil:

You can't buy one yet, but they'll be available soon.

A:

More driver details:
OpenNI or freenect can be used with the Xtion and the XBox Kinect.
The "Kinect for Windows" requires the Microsoft SDK and drivers. However, there is also a bridge to go from the MSSDK drivers to OpenNI: http://code.google.com/p/kinect-mssdk-openni-bridge/
Also, the latest version of the Kinect for Windows (>=1.5) has a near mode that allows for better operation close to the device, this may be of use depending on the application. I do not believe the Xtion has this mode.
The XBox Kinect and Kinect for Windows appear to have different USB interfaces, so you have to use the right set of drivers depending on which one you have.
