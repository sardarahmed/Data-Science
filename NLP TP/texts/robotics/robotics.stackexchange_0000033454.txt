Q:

rosserial std_msgs

This is probably a dumb question, but where do I find the std_msgs folder?  All of the rosserial #includes have something like
#include <std_msgs/UInt16.h>
However, the Arduino IDE returns "error: std_msgs/UInt16.h: No such file or directory".  I've searched all around for the files on my computer, but no luck.  I have a sneaking suspicion that this closely related to me being ignorant.  I'm hoping someone can help me see the light.

A:

Have you actually copied the ros_lib library into your sketchbook as described in the setup tutorial?
