A:

What version of ros are you using? When I start roscore, I have ros_comm 1.6.5 which is newer than your 1.4.7. Try upgrading to a current version. Also, what operating system are you using?

try "rosmake rosnode" and once that is done compiling, run "roscore" in one terminal and try "rosnode list" in another termial. You should see it then.
