Q:

Gazebo 1.2~1.3 Plugin for ROS

I am trying to use PR2 with new gazebo 1.3 on ubuntu 12.04 and ros-fuerte.
The specific purpose is to test contact sensors all over the robot surface (tactile sensing).
As long as I know gazebo 1.3 is stand alone program, so I need ROS-Enabled Gazebo Model Plugin for PR2.
From below link's answer, I read that there is no plugin for PR2 now.
If my understanding is correct, I have to make my own plugin over entire PR2 functions.
Is it correct? or Does it mean impossible to make the plugin for ros now?

Thanks

A:

That is correct, you'll need to make your own PR2 plugin until an official ROS plugin is released.
You can make Gazebo plugins that talk ROS.
Take a look at the DRC simulator package for examples: https://bitbucket.org/osrf/drcsim
