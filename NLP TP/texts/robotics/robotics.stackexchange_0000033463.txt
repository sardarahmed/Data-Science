Q:

What does "struct integer overflow" DeprecationWarning mean?

I am getting a lot of these errors:

    /opt/ros/cturtle/ros/core/rospy/src/rospy/msg.py:151: DeprecationWarning: struct integer overflow masking is deprecated
      msg.serialize(b)

Does anyone know what this is about?  I have not been able to track down the specific messages in my system that cause it.  I am running with CTurtle on Ubuntu 10.04.

A:

IIRC, Python emits that warning when you serialize an integer that is wider than is being requested -- it basically means that you may be overflowing a message field.

Yes, that seems to be it.  I found a place in my code that was using an int32 in a message field that was only uint8.
