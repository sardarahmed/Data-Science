Q:

autowareauto.git causes permission error during ADE installation. Are additional permission rights required?

git clone --recurse-submodules git@gitlab.com:autowarefoundation/autoware.auto/autowareauto.git
Causes error: Permission denied (publickey). fatal: Could not read from remote repository.  Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists.

A:

It seems a problem of ssh in gitlab. Please add the ssh key in your gitlab account. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/

Thank you for the response. The problem was solved by installing ade via http instead of ssh. It was indeed an ssh/gitlab problem. the ssh key should have worked, too.
