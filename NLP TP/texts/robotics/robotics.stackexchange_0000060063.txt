Q:

scaling a model in urdf

I have a perfect working car model in urdf and now I wanted to scale it. I made a smaller robot so I wanted to scale them.
Is there a way to do it in ROS?

A:

AFAIK this is not easily possible. While you can scale the individual link geometries, to scale the whole model, youÂ´d need to also scale all translations that are part of the model in joints. Stringent use of xacro macros and properties throughout the model probably could make this easier (if not completely painless).
