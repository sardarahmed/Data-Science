Q:

How to integrate libcreate in an own ros package - (turtlebot1)

Hey there,
what I recently did was installing a ROS driver for a roomba 521 (similar to a turtlebot1). I cloned this files in my catkin_ws/src/create_autonomy and then I just catkin_make them. All works fine. Now what I found out is that this ROS driver relies on a  libcreate library. This library is however build in catkin_ws/devel/src/libcreate.
What I want to do next is create an own package (e.g: catkin_ws/src/roomba_521) and in this package I would like to have some c++ files which somehow include this library, so that I can use functions etc.
(1) That is why I would like to ask how and where do I have to install  the libcreate library
(2) How do I have to reference to this library e.g. in a c++ file / just include these files?

Wait, catkin_ws/devel/ only has include, lib, and share. Where is the src? Also how did you link libcreate and create_autonomy?

A:

You can use this dev branch of create_autonomy (EDIT: merged) as a reference. This assumes that libcreate is installed as a catkin package (currently by cloning libcreate into your workspace and building with catkin). Then, in your package.xml you can add build/run dependencies to libcreate, include/link in your CMakeLists.txt (example), and include the header create/create.h and make API calls in your code (example). Hope it helps.

Thanks Jacob ;) that was easier as I thought! I got it.
I also would like to use your code and libcreate library for my own project which is specefic for the roomba 521. Do I have your permission to create an own github repository witch contains code that is very similar to yours?
Comment by jacobperron on 2016-12-02:
Yes, as long as you adhere to the 3-clause BSD license. Is there a core feature that create_autonomy is missing that you cannot just use that?
Comment by Markus on 2016-12-03:
No your code is working perfect. Anyway I just would like to experiment a little bit with it and simply git clone this modified code that is why I am thinking about making my own repository. I hope this is ok for you? Anyway I found out that I am not able to execute dual processes on the roomba.

Dual Processes on the roomba: I was for example not able to simultanously play a song and change the colour of the power clean led light.

OK. If you end up improving the functionality of the driver, pull requests are welcome :)

of course I will let you know if I have something.
