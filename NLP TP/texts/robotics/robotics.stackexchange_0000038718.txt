Q:

Make Android File

I follow the instructions on the website:http://docs.rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/rosjava_core/html/building.html, but an error occored at step 3 :
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

What went wrong:
Could not open task artifact state cache (/opt/ros/electric/stacks/rosjava_core/.gradle/1.0-milestone-8a/taskArtifacts).

java.io.IOException: No such file or directory

there are so many guides on the topic- how to create ros android. I tried almost every method, but failed. Is it possible that someone make a step-by-step guide so i can learn form it? thank you very much.

A:

You're looking at the correct documentation. However, I imagine you do not have permission to build from source out of your /opt directory.
If you're building from source, you probably want to do so from an overlay. There is an example of this here: http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/SetupEnvironment
I'll update the rosjava documentation to include that step.
