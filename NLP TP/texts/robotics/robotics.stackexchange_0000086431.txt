Q:

Best Stereo Camera that ROS Supports?

Dear Users and developers,
I am looking to buy a stereo camera, specifically for outdoor self driving car applications such as mapping and localization probably by using ORB-SLAM2.
I found that ZED and Bumblebee are two of the options.

Could anyone say which Stereo camera(with ROS support) is the best one to get and their pros and cons ?

Thanks

I think this is a very difficult question to answer (the "best that ROS supports" one), as there are very few products that have such a range in performance as to be applicable to all imaginable application scenarios. Your question text adds some more info/constraints, but is still quite vague.

A:

Personally, I don't have any experience with the Bumblebee. The ZED is IMO not very robust, especially in an outdoor context, which is mainly due to the somewhat limited FOV (again, outdoor context).
Considering your application (outdoor self driving car), I would actually go for the Multisense S21. It has the far larger base length compared to the other two, is (thus) long-range and specifically designed for outdoor and "heavy-duty" use. Also, you can get different lenses...
Con: Price
(Then again, I'm no camera expert...)
