Q:

The Intel RealSense R200 camera is not detected by the Turtlebot3 (Waffle)

Hello all,
I am trying to do 3D SLAM using the R200 camera and Turtlebot3 Waffle.  I installed the Intel® RealSense™ package following the steps given in http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/appendix_realsense/#installation
When I ran
roslaunch realsense_camera r200_nodelet_rgbd.launch

I receive the following error:
[ERROR] [1530659146.559707562]: /camera/driver - No cameras detected!

The camera was connected to Netmate USB 3.0 (4 port) hub. I tried connecting it directly but I am still getting the same error. Some additional information are:
I am not running inside a VM. The PC and OS specs are:

Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS \n \l
4.13.0-45-generic
64-bit machine

Is the camera recognized on some another platform? I didn't try this particular camera with another device other than the Turtlebot I have.
I am using the short USB cable provided with the camera device.
In here under title Installation Troubleshooting this particular error is mentioned. But as far as I understood, the solution provided applies to the case where the camera is connected to a PC not a Turtlebot, hence I didn't try the provided solution.
Any help is appreciated.

I suggest following Installation Troubleshooting in ROS WiKi

A:

I managed to solve this problem. The issue was to do with the permissions given to the user by the system admin. I asked the lab manager (who has sudo access) to give permission to my user ID to access the git cloned packages. Then I repeated these steps inside the second workspace that I created inside the Turtlebot.
$ cd catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/intel-ros/realsense.git
$ cd realsense
$ git checkout 1.8.0
$ cd catkin_ws && catkin_make -j2

and the camera started working. Hope this helps anyone else who has the same issue.
