How to use rosserial_python?

how to use rosserial? How to use rosserial_python.
My task is writing a ROS node(python) to send command and receive status code from my mcu(had been programmed). through serial port(/dev/ttyUSB0, 9600)
I noticed that rosserial package is only working for "a connected rosserial-enabled device". Is that true?
How can I finish my task using the package"rosserial"? if can not, what is the most efficient way to achive that?
Thank you very much!!!!!

A:

my blog described several ways about ROS-Serial communication. I Pasted how to build a ros_node to do the "implement your own code in the node to translate the messages from the mcu into appropriate messages for ros topics, and subscribe to appropriate topics in ros and convert that data into appropriate messages for your mcu" as nickw said.
