Q:

[Autoware.Auto] GNSS conversion node not starting

I am trying to run the GNSS conversion node that converts the GNSS data from WGS_84 to ECEF co-ordinates. When I try to run the node for experimentation using
ros2 run gnss_conversion_nodes gnss_conversion_nodes_exe
I get the following error
1640158244.062340 [0] gnss_conve: using network interface wlp111s0 (udp/192.168.0.8) selected arbitrarily from: wlp111s0, docker0, br-2d7f79e3ae0b
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'
what():  Override covariance must have exactly 3 entries.
It seems to be the problems with the parameters not being read properly, but I am not able to figure out how to solve this and run the node correctly.  Any help in resolving this or any direction to proceed for debugging would be great. Thank you.

A:

Setting the params from the param file solved this issue. I missed the param file already provided for this node in Autoware.Auto and got confused.
