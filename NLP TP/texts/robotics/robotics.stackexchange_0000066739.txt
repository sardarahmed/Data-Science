Q:

Is ROS Indigo supported by ardrone_autonomy

Hi,
I im trying to work with an AR DRONE 2.0, and I have installed ROS Indigo and ardrone_autonomy package. I wish to know if it will work, or i will have to install a previous ROS, like Hydro or Groovy, to continue working.
Thanks a lot.

Short answer: Yes
There's more information on their github page and you can get updates from the SFU lab webpages directly.
