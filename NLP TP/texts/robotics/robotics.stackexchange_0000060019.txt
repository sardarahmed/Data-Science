Q:

conversion from urdf to dae fails while attempting to install ikfast for ur5

I have been following this tutorial: http://moveit.ros.org/wiki/Kinematics/IKFast while attempting to setup the ikfast solver for a ur5. I have gotten to the point where I am required to make a collada .dae file from the urdf file provided by the universal_robot repository. I have attempted to use collada_urdf to convert the file with the command:
rosrun collada_urdf urdf_to_collada ur5_robot.urdf ur5_robot.dae

however, this fails and gives the following terminal output:

Document successfully written to ur5_robot.dae

despite the "document successfully written" message, I can not find any output file named ur5_robot.dae. Is there another way to convert these files? Or another way to install IKFast to use with a ur5?

It is considered more 'future-proof' to include as much as possible any error text / output directly in your question, as links to services like pastebin can go stale. That would leave future readers guessing as to what the error actually was. I've edited your question to include it.

Same problem here on a fresh install of ROS Indigo, Ubuntu 14.04.2...

I've seen more people report problems with trying to convert from urdt to dae on Indigo. See robot_model/issues/89 fi.

A:

this has been fixed by newer version of collada library, see  https://github.com/ros/robot_model/issues/118#issuecomment-164554380
