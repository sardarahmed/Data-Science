A:

Just run
rosrun UWSim UWSim --disableShaders
Currently, full support for shaders is possible on ATI and NVidia cards. It's possible that your integrated card doesn't support all the shaders required for UWSim. Then you have to run without shaders support, which means you will not see many of the visualization effects like silt, god rays, etc. However, all the functionality should be still there.
Please let me know if that works for you
