ROS Answers SE migration: ROS Tutorial

Hello all,
I'm searching for a documentation / tutorial that explain the ROS basis and also the working way "for newbies" in robotics. The tutorial of ROS is available from website and i would like to know if something more is existing (less technic, more logic)
Regards
Philippe

What were your expectations for the ROS tutorials? Could you give an example?

@Philippe what exactly are you looking for ? ROS tutorials will give you an idea as to how ROS functions, 'robotics for newbie' may ask for a different approach !

A:

Do you find the ROS tutorial too difficult? I found it easy enough to understand and I don't think there is anything simpler out there. If you post specific questions here then people can answer them.

@froody ROS can be difficult if one is not from Computer Science/IT background ! :-)
