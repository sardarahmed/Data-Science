Q:

Errors in setting up ROS tutorial workspace in "tf tutorials"

Hi everyone,
I am learning ROS (ROS cturtle) from the tutorials. I got an error when setting up the ROS tutorial workspace in "tf/tutorials".
It asked me to:

Create a file named
~/tutorials.rosinstall with the
following content:
- other: local-name: workspace

To overlay on cturtle:
rosinstall ~/tutorials
/opt/ros/cturtle
~/tutorials.rosinstall

I got confused with the term "workspace". I assume i gotta replace it with my working directory. I put it like
 - other: local-name: ~/tutorials. 

Then I run
 rosinstall ~/tutorials /opt/ros/cturtle ~/tutorials.rosinstall

It prompts me an error:
rosinstall operating on /home/vincent/tutorials from specifications in rosinstall files  /home/vincent/tutorials/.rosinstall, /opt/ros/cturtle, /home/vincent/tutorials.rosinstall processing config_uri /opt/ros/cturtle ahhhhhhhh, yaml parse error: mapping values are not allowed here   in "/home/vincent/tutorials.rosinstall", line 3, column 19 Usage: rosinstall PATH [<options> ...] [URI]... 

rosinstall: error: None

Deleting the space between "local-name" and "~/tutorials" in that command-line solved this error. But got another error:
rosinstall operating on /home/vincent/tutorials from specifications in rosinstall files  /home/vincent/tutorials/.rosinstall, /opt/ros/cturtle, /home/vincent/tutorials.rosinstall
processing config_uri /opt/ros/cturtle

    path = element[k]['local-name']
TypeError: string indices must be integers, not str

And I also tried replacing "workspace" with "/opt/ros/cturtle/stack" or "/opt/ros/cturtle/ros" or "/opt/ros/cturtle". They gave basically the same errors.
Can someone help me out? Probably obvious to everyone else, please excuse my dumbness.-_-

A:

Indeed that was bad syntax.  I've updated the tutorial to correctly read
- other: { local-name: workspace }

Thanks a lot, that's clear to me now~ But here comes another problem..It would be great if you could take time look at the question below... Thank you in advance~

The rosinstall file designates the path "workspace" inside ~/tutorials to be in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.  You can change it to be whatever you want, it is a relative path from where rosinstall is pointed.

So I should type exactly the same code without replacing "workspace" with some directory path? I tried that and it worked fine, just want to make sure 'cause I don't quite understand this part.
