Q:

ROS Industrial and Moveit installation

Are there special instructions to install ROS-Industrial? Is there a step by step process to follow to first install ROS then Industrial and then Moveit?

A:

All open-source ROS-Industrial packages are released through the normal ROS buildfarm, so installation of those packages is identical to how you'd install other ROS packages (on Ubuntu, a simple sudo apt-get ros-...).
As to step-by-step guides, the ROS-Industrial training exercises should provide you with that information, and more.
