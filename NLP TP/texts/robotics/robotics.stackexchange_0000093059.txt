Q:

Turtlebot 3 e-manual - trouble contacting master

Hi All,
I`m very new to programming, using Linux etc. But I have worked my way through the ROS programming book and am not working through the Turtlebot3 E-manual.
I am trying to bring up basic packages to start the Turtlebot 3 applications but am having an issue in contacting the master (my laptop).

So I have run 'roscore'
I then entered 'roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_robot.launch' on my Turtbebot PC (Raspbian). But I cannot contact the master and am getting the error message:
ERROR: unable to contact ROS master at {http://my IP address is here}, The traceback for the exception was written to the log file"".

I have done an extensive  search online for a solution and have found many discussions, but due to my inexperienced I am failing to see which solution suits my problem.
Any help greatly appreciated.
Thanks :)

A:

Try assigning static ip to turtlebot and PC. then see if they can ping each other. On VM, instead of NAT, use bridge connection in network settings
