Q:

rosbuild and roslib are non existent packages and rosdep cant find (missing resource)

I'm new to linux and ROS. if i've left out any key info needed to fix the issue, please let me know
I'm using debian 11 (Bullseye). I installed ROS through the following package deb file : https://debian.pkgs.org/11/debian-main-amd64/ros-desktop_1.16_all.deb.html
So far everything works well. I've setup a catkin workspace and have made and built a package. However the dependancies for some source files cant be found: 'rosbuild and 'roslib'.
invictus@INVICHOST:~$ rospack depends beginner_tutorials 

[rospack] Error: package 'rosconsole' depends on non-existent package 'rosbuild' and rosdep claims that it is not a system dependency. Check the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH or try calling 'rosdep update'
[rospack] Error: package 'rospy' depends on non-existent package 'roslib' and rosdep claims that it is not a system dependency. Check the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH or try calling 'rosdep update'
cpp_common
rostime
roscpp_traits
roscpp_serialization
catkin
genmsg
genpy
message_runtime
rosconsole
std_msgs
rosgraph_msgs
xmlrpcpp
roscpp
rosgraph
rospy

Trying to install via rosdep gives:
invictus@INVICHOST:~$ rosdep install roslib

ERROR: Rosdep cannot find all required resources to answer your query
Missing resource roslib
ROS path [0]=/home/invictus/catkinws/src

invictus@INVICHOST:~$ rosdep install rosbuild

ERROR: Rosdep cannot find all required resources to answer your query
Missing resource rosbuild
ROS path [0]=/home/invictus/catkinws/src

and doing rosdep update gives:

A:

If you were using released distro I would say use rosdep install beginner_tutorials with the package on your path. However you're using what we call the Upstream Packages which follow slightly different conventions than standard ROS packages.
rosdep was designed to install the dependencies of a source checkout on your path. It itself is not designed to "install" a specific package.
For the upstream packages I did an apt-cache search roslib and apt-cache search rosbuild and found you can also likely just install the package sudo apt-get install python3-roslib rosbuild
However I would strongly recommend that for the best user experience you consider learning to use ROS on one of our officially supported platforms.  ROS 1 Supported Platforms and ROS 2 supported platforms
