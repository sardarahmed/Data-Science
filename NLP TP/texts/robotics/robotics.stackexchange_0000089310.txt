Q:

MoveIt: how to use class MoveGroup::MoveGroupImpl?

Hi everyone,
I would like to use the function void setReplanningDelay(double delay) belonging to class MoveGroup::MoveGroupImpl, because I need to decrease the 2 seconds default value of replan_delay_.
How could I implement that function? An example of code would be really helpful.
I think another option is to manually decrease that value, but this would require installing Moveit in the workspace I guess, but I would leave this option as the last resort.
ROS version: Kinetic
Ubuntu: 16.04

A:

I'm assuming you're talking about MoveGroupInterfaceImpl, since you're on Kinetic and MoveGroup was changed to MoveGroupInterface.
MoveGroupInterface uses the PImpl technique (https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/pimpl). In order to access void setReplanningDelay(double delay) you will need to to build your own MoveIt and add a function to the MoveGroupInterface which in turn calls Impl's function.
void moveit::planning_interface::MoveGroupInterface::setReplanningDelay(double delay)
{
  impl_->setReplanningDelay(delay);
}

This is taken from MoveIt's GitHub (there's a bunch of similar functions at the very end).
