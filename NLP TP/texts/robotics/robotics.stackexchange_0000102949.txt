Q:

Trying to build explore_lite in ROS melodic

I'm trying to build the ROS melodic branch of  explore_lite.  I get this error:
  Errors     << multirobot_map_merge:make /home/philip/catkin_ws/logs/multirobot_map_merge/build.make.000.log
    In file included from /home/philip/catkin_ws/src/m-explore/map_merge/src/combine_grids/merging_pipeline.cpp:46:0:

           return xfeatures2d::SURF::create();

What dependency am I missing?

A:

It seem like the problem with the OpenCV. In this line try to change return xfeatures2d::SURF::create(); to return cv::xfeatures2d::SURF::create(); as the code is not defining using namespace cv;

@aarsh_t I already have openCV and need it for other projecs I'm working on. I don't want to break those other projects by doing this. Is there a way to make a seperate environment to built an openCV that will only affect this one explore_lite package?

@aarsh_t Thanks it worked! I'm now trying to use the explore.launch file. Would you know how to connect to move_base server?:

Sorry I haven't used the package so I have no idea of how to play with it. May be you can ask to the developer or create a new question.
