A:

If you install rosjava from debian packages, it has already been built and is read-only.  Thus, you cannot run 'ant dist' anymore -- there should already be a jar file inside of rosjava_core that you can use in your projects.
EDIT: Also check that your debian packages are up-to-date with:
apt-get install ros-electric-rosjava-core

reinstalling from debian solves the problem. Thanks for helping! It helps alot! life saver!

Installing from debian packages means running 'apt-get install ros-electric-rosjava-core'.  If you did that and are in the situation you are, I'm not sure what happened.  I'm going to attempt to do another release of rosjava today.

I don't see the 'dist' folder inside /opt/ros/electric/stacks/rosjava_core/rosjava

It looks like you already installed it from debian packages. Does ls  ls /opt/ros/electric/stacks/rosjava_core/rosjava/dist show rosjava.jar? If yes, it's installed correctly.
