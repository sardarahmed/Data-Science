Q:

Laser Assembler with Hokuyo Utm-30lx

Hi, I have successfully run the laser_assembler tutorial at:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/laser_assembler/Tutorials/HowToAssembleLaserScans
The tutorial uses a bag file containing the laser data. How can I change the parameters of this tutorial to work with real time hokuyo laser topic that is being published?
Changing parameters in the launch file below does not seem to help.

Could you forward that bag file to me if you still have it? Apparently, it has been removed from the tutorial.

A:

A simple launch file that starts the Hokuyo driver and the assembler would look something like this. First, launch the Hokuyo laser:
  <node type="hokuyo_node" pkg="hokuyo_node" name="hokuyo_node/>

Verify that you are getting correct laser data. To do that, you can run rviz, add a LaserScan display, and set the fixed frame option to "laser".
The second step is launching the assembler. Both the hokuyo node and the assembler use scan as the default topic, so no need to remap.
  <node type="laser_scan_assembler" pkg="laser_assembler" name="my_assembler"> 
    <param name="fixed_frame" type="string" value="base_link"/> 
  </node> 

The last step is to add something that is publishing the correct transform between the base_link and the laser frames.
