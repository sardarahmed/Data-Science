Q:

List of per-physics engine capabilities/compatibility/known incompatibilities

Is there a place where one could quickly decide which physics engine to use knowing his requirements (e.g. dynamic changes to models during runtime, joint friction, whatever).
It happens that some functionality is only implemented for ODE, but not the other engines. It would be nice to see all these "TODOs" in one place.
