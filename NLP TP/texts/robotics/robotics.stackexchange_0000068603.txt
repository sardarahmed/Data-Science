Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: ros_opentld

Hi,
I created a workspace and cloned ROS_openTLD from https://github.com/Ronan0912/ros_opentld,
and I run it in the following way,
cd ros_opentld ; source devel/setup.sh ; roslaunch tld_tracker ros_tld_tracker.launch ; roslaunch tld_tracker ros_tld_gui.launch.
but I don't know why there is always no image showing on the tld_gui window. I thought maybe I need to edit 'image_topic' in the launch file to the specific topic I used, but I don't know how to modify the  <remap from="image" to="$(arg image_topic)"/>. I'm not sure whether the modification is necessary. I am new to ROS and sorry I ask the silly question.
Someone else know the problem and can help?  Thank you.

A:

Knowing the function of arg image_topic, I solved the problem by
roslaunch tld_tracker ros_tld_gui.launch image_topic:=/camera/image_raw
roslaunch tld_tracker ros_tld_tracker.launch image_topic:=/camera/image_raw
