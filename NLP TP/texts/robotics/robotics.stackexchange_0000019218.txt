Q:

Why do strong rotations affect Monocular Vision based Visual Odometry?

In context of the paper Semi Dense Visual Odometry for a Monocular Camera J Engel, J Sturms, D Cremers
At page 7, last paragraph the author writes 

The achieved tracking accuracy for two feasible sequences - that is, sequences which do not contain strong rotations without simultaneous translation - is given in Table 1.

Here the Author implies that the method is not feasible (fails ?) on datasets that contain strong rotation. In the paper, Visual Odometry is performed in two parts inverse depth estimation of points  and tracking of camera. I want to analyze how these parts are affected when the camera undergoes strong rotations?  
Here is what I think (kindly correct me and or add missing details)  
Part I
Inverse depth estimation is based on disparity among two successive frames. The observed pixel disparity is equal to scaled inverse depth for the pixel.
When camera undergoes strong rotation it causes apparent pixel disparity however the pixel would still be at the same depth wrt the camera. So this results in false disparity and subsequently wrong depth estimation (?) 
Part II
The tracking of camera is being done via image alignment (using depth map). The image alignment is formulated as a photometric error minimization problem:
$$ E(\xi) := \sum_{i}\frac{\alpha(r_i(\xi))}{\sigma_{d_i}^2}r_i(\xi)$$
where $$r_i(\xi) = (I_2(~{\color{blue}w(x_i, d_i, \xi)}~) - I_1(x_i))^2$$
and ${\color{blue}w}$ is a warp function that maps each point $x_i$ in reference image $I_1$ to the respective point in the new image $I_2$ 
The warp function requires depth $d_i$ to calculate the new position of a pixel in image $I_2$ that was observed earlier in $I_1$. With wrong depth estimate the minimization problem would yield wrong value for $\xi$ (?)
Also, are there techniques to deal with pure camera rotation in case of Monocular Vision based Odometry?

A:

The problem of the pure strong rotation is that the image will become easily blurred unless you use 1000FPS camera. This kind of super-strong rotation often occurs in hand-held camera motion. Simply turn on your mobile camera in a slightly dark place and try to make a translational and rotational motion. You will see rotation make huge blurriness in the image where tracking or depth estimation will surely fail.
