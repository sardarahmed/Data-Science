Q:

What is the correct way to set args in rosparam?

I'm trying to launch the Multimaster node requiring parameter lists. Inside the list, I need to use an arg that would be used in other nodes in the same launch file. This is what I'd like in effect (it does not work):
  <arg name="robotname" default="robot1" />

  <node pkg="multimaster" type="master_sync.py" name="master_sync" output="screen" respawn="true"> 
    <param name="foreign_master" value="http://localhost:11311" />      
    <rosparam>
      local_pubs: [$(arg robotname)/status, /some_other_topics]
    </rosparam>
  </node>

What should be the correct way to get $(arg robotname) into the parameter list?

Have you found a workaround for this issue?

Nope, I've been busy with other things. My original implementation was pushed back to me by the ros-core team, but the followup ticket is still open: ( https://www.bountysource.com/issues/742041-add-substitution-args-parsing-to-roslaunch-yaml )

A:

This has since been implemented, set subst_value="true":
<rosparam param="whitelist" subst_value="true">$(arg whitelist)</rosparam>
