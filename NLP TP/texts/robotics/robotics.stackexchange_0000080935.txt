Q:

Unable to execute rosrun after roscore command

I am using ROS indigo on ubuntu 14.04. Please find below shell output. I am following "Learning ROS for robotics programming" by Aaron Martinez.

I don't really follow how the output you included shows that rosrun doesn't work (I only see roslaunch output), but in any case: don't use rosmake on Indigo. It's unfortunate, but that book (1st ed anyway) is from 2013, which is 'ages' ago.
Comment by rahulsharma333369 on 2017-05-21:
rosrun doesn't work means after "rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node" command, new window is expected which will have turtle. Also rosnode info, rostopic list command doesn't return anytthing.
What book would you recommend for learning ROS. I am new in this.

A:

Are you typing all these commands in the same terminal as where you started roscore?
If so, then that is your problem: roscore should run in its own terminal. If it works correctly, roscore is not supposed to 'end' and give you your terminal back. Use ctrl+c to stop it when you are done with it.
Open (a) new terminal(s) for the other command(s).

Hey thanks. Yes, I was trying in the same terminal. My bad, was referring old book by Arron.
