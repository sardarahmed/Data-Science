Q:

Can someone explaine to me this code?

static void set_default_param(DPMTTICParam& param)
{

    param.overlap = 0.4;
    param.threshold = -0.5;
    param.lambda = 10;
    param.num_cells = 8;
}

A:

It seems to belong to this software:
https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware/blob/master/ros/src/computing/perception/detection/lib/image/dpm_ttic/include/dpm_ttic/dpm_ttic.hpp
So - I assume that is just a case where someone is using that software, and it is showing how to set some default parameters.
I would suggest you ask the developers of that software directly though, if you want to use it.
