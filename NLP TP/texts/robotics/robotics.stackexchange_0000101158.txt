Q:

verbose colcon build

I want to print as much information as possible out of colcon, such as CMake, print order of compilation etc. Anyone here has any suggestions? colcon build --help doesnt really say much

A:

Does adding this to your colcon build work?
--event-handlers console_direct+ --cmake-args -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON

You could opt for console_cohesion+ instead of console_direct+, if interleaving output is confusing:
--event-handlers console_cohesion+ --cmake-args -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON
