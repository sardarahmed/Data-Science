Q:

How to begin without a robot for now?

Hello,
I'm totally a newbie in ROS but i'm learning. I understand the concept of ROS.
My final purpose is to use ROS with a robot in order to try SLAM algorithms and Visual odometry algorithm. (i saw that there are some libraries to do that)
But now i don't know really how to begin. I don't have for now a robot (i have to wait a bit) but i have to begin to studies some algorithms.
Can you please give me some advises about how to start using some algorithms in order to manipulate a bit ROS? With a simulator ?(but i don't know how to proceed for now)
I try to find concrete examples on the internet but didn't find except the turtle_sim and the famous hello World,
Thank you,
EDIT:
And if i want to use a dataset like KITTI dataset, i don't need Gazebo right ?

A:

Gazebo can be used to simulate a robot and it can be used to test any algorithm you would like by connecting it to ROS.
