Q:

How much can working with CNC machines teach you about robotics?

I have built a few simple X/Y/Z CNC machines.  I've learned about G-Code, motor control, firmware and open loop systems.  I see machines like rovers, big dog and factory arms that seem incredibly complex by comparison, yet they don't seem that magical any more.  
What are the important skills to pick up from working with CNC machines?  What's the next logical thing to learn?  What things would CNC machines never teach me?

A:

Building CNC equipment may teach you:

Motor control
Kinematics and coordinated movement
How to choose motors for a given load
Mechanical movement (torque, moment, etc)
Simple electronics

Running CNC equipment may teach you:

Software control of hardware
Timing (at least on the gross level)
Feedback
Hardware error detection and recovery

While the fields are different, very broadly speaking CNC machines are merely robots.  The reverse is true.  Due to their specific use there's different terminology and typically different control and usage schemes and scenarios, but at the end of the day you are moving things under electronic, and often autonomous, control.
Even today's high speed circuit board assembly machines use computer vision in complex ways similar to today's advanced robotics.  You'll find that the two fields share most things in common such that everything you learn in one will apply to the other in some way.
