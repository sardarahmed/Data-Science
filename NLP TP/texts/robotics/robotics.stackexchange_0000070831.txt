Q:

setup.bash refering to package and states file not found

Hello,
I am a Ubuntu 14.04 user using ROS Indigo. I am not sure what happened recently but when I do [In catkin workspace] source devel/setup.bash I get the following error message
bash: /home/dinu94/catkin_ws/src/rocon/src/rocon_app_platform/rocon_app_utilities/shells/env.bash: No such file or directory
bash: /home/dinu94/catkin_ws/src/rocon/src/rocon_tools/rocon_launch/shells/env.bash: No such file or directory
bash: /home/dinu94/catkin_ws/src/rocon/src/rocon_multimaster/rocon_test/shells/env.bash: No such file or directory
bash: /home/dinu94/catkin_ws/src/rocon/src/rocon_tools/rocon_python_comms/completion/rospairbash: No such file or directory

I had installed rocon months before and deleted in quite recently. I don't know how this polluted setup.bash . I can't understand the code and hence unable to fix it. Any help would be appreciated .
Thanks

Assuming you no longer need the mentioned package, you can delete both build and devel directories in your catkin workspace and build again; some settings that you generated "months before" when you still needed the package still try to refer to them.
