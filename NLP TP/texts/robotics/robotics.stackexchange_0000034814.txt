Q:

Arm Navigation Warehouse on the PR2

On the PR2 I start:
roslaunch planning_scene_warehouse_viewer_pr2_real.launch

while on another computer, after setting
rosparam set warehouse_host c1

I run:
roslaunch planning_scene_warehouse_viewer_pr2_only.launch

The configuration interface shows correctly, but after clicking "accept" it hangs. I've checked that both {l-r}_arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory are running (they are actions, not services as written in the tutorial).
What am I doing wrong? What is the correct procedure to launch the warehouse_viewer on the PR2?

A:

Lorenzo,
rxconsole should be giving you useful output, and the tutorial may be out of date for running on the robot.  We had a good deal of success with people following the procedure outlined in this tutorial document: IROS tutorial document .
Note that if you look in the planning_scene_warehouse_viewer_pr2_only.launch file it specifically also sets the warehouse_host parameter, so your rosparam set is being overwritten.  You'll need to edit the launch file to connect to a warehouse that's running on another machine.  So I expect that's the problem - and that the rxconsole output will say something like "Connecting to warehouse..." forever.  But it could also be something else - generally rxconsole will show useful debugging information whatever the problem.
