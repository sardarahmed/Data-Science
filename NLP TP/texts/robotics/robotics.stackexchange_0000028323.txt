Q:

About sdf.hh file and gazebo-deb

Hi guys,
I have difficulty compiling and installing files from the following website: https://github.com/thomas-moulard/gazebo-deb
Can I ask you how i can compile this package correctly please ??
The sdf.hh file is also part of gazebo development.
Thanks,
Have a nice day,

A:

That looks like a fork of a very old version of Gazebo, are you sure that's what you want to build? You'll have more luck following the instructions here:
