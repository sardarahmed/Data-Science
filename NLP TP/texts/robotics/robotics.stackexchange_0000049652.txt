Q:

port of turtlebot_navigation

Hello everyone,
I want to port the turtlebot_navigation stack to a robot called eddie,
which it uses the turtlebot API to use it under ros which is the follwing:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/eddiebot
After successfully running that package I have 2 basic nodes running:
minimal.launch
kinect.launch
this is the stack for the turtlebot navigation (which is needed for SLAM):
http://ros.org/wiki/turtlebot_navigation?distro=groovy
which has the following dependencies:
Dependencies (3)
gmapping
move_base
turtlebot_bringup

In our case we already have the turtlebot_bringup. and I think the "gmapping" package is a generic one so it doesn't needs to be modify if I'm correct. The problem is that the move_base package needs to be made for the eddiebot,
so I was going to ask you what do I need to do to get this package running?
Thanks,
Omar

A:

There are tutorials on setting up the Navigation stack on a new robot: http://ros.org/wiki/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup (move_base is simply the central part of the navigation stack). Those tutorials will pretty much explain what each configuration file in turtlebot_navigation is doing.
