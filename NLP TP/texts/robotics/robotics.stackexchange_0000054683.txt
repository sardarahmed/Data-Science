Q:

rviz crashes when adding display

I have deleted my ~/.rviz directory and rviz loads fine, but as soon as I click 'add' to add a display, the program seg faults.
Any suggestions? It was working a week or two ago just fine... :/
If I open one of my saved settings files, it loads fine but I can't add anything.

Thanks to this answer I was able to fix this issue. I think adding $ sudo apt-get autoremove makes it more perfect.
