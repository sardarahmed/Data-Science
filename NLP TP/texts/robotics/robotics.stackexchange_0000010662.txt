Q:

Stabilizing a Drone

I have my IMU and I can get attitude (pitch, roll, yaw) as well as gyro (x, y, z)
As far as I can tell, attitude is all I need to stabilize my drone.
Is there any reason to implement gyro or will attitude suffice?
-- EDIT --
It seems the benefit of gyro is an immediate response to an outside factor effecting drone stability.
Example:
A gust of wind hits your drone. The attitude will not be quick enough combat the effects of wind. As far as I can tell, the gyro will be the best way to combat extreme wobble and outside influences such as wind / tether (leash).
-- EDIT 2 --
It's been a while since I posted this but I should add in that I ended up leveraging the infamous PID algo for my arduino. 

A:

Gyro is needed to stabilize angular acceleration. Knowing only your attitude, drone doesn't know how fast on which axis is rotating, knows only where is gravity vector. Gyro gives you feedback on angular acceleration and that's what gives your drone stability.
Also, you can use only gyro in your drone, it will stabilize movement, but won't get back to horizontal flight/hovering position (depending if You are building multicopter or plane).
To fully stabilize your drone flight, you should use both gyro and attitude.
