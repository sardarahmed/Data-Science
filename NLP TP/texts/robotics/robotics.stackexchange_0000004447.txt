Q:

Is there any advantage to velocity motion models over odometry motion models for SLAM?

I've seen several examples of SLAM algorithms (EKF SLAM, Graph SLAM, SEIF SLAM) written in terms of the velocity motion model.  I have yet to see an example of any SLAM algorithm utilizing the odometry motion model.  I wonder if there is an inherent advantage to using the velocity motion model over the odometry model for this problem.  Does it have something to do with the fact that odometry sensor information comes after the motion has already taken place, whereas velocity control commands are executed before motion?

A:

I can't think of a reason why a velocity model (based on control commands)
would be superior to an odometry model (which uses the actual wheel speeds). 
The lecture notes from Freiburg on motion models imply the same:

Odometry-based models are used when systems are equipped with wheel
  encoders. 
Velocity-based models have to be applied when no wheel
  encoders are given.

The timing does not have an influence here. If any, it would affect the latency, but even that I would think is not the case. 
The better your model, the better your prediction. Having actual measurements in the model provide you with additional information to improve the model. One thing which is very commonly performed is to use an IMU to estimate the rotational part of your motion model.
