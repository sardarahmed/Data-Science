Q:

Can't install audio_common (unment dependencies)

Hello,
I'm using ROS Hydro on Ubuntu 12.04 and I'm not being able to install the audio_common stack.
I'll list everything I've tried:

sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-audio-common

output:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 ros-hydro-audio-common : Depends: ros-hydro-audio-capture but it is not going to be installed
                          Depends: ros-hydro-audio-common-msgs but it is not going to be installed
                          Depends: ros-hydro-audio-play but it is not going to be installed
                          Depends: ros-hydro-sound-play but it is not going to be installed
 ros-hydro-rosbag : Depends: ros-hydro-rosbag-storage but it is not going to be installed
E: Unmet dependencies. Try 'apt-get -f install' with no packages (or specify a solution).

sudo apt-get -f install ros-hydro-audio-common

same output as shown above

I've tried installing only one of the packages by using sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-sound-play

output:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 ros-hydro-rosbag : Depends: ros-hydro-rosbag-storage but it is not going to be installed
 ros-hydro-sound-play : Depends: festival but it is not going to be installed
                        Depends: festvox-kallpc16k but it is not going to be installed
                        Depends: gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly but it is not going to be installed
                        Depends: ros-hydro-audio-common-msgs but it is not going to be installed
E: Unmet dependencies. Try 'apt-get -f install' with no packages (or specify a solution).

I'm having the same problem (unment dependencies) when I've tried installing others packages. Does anyone know what is causing this?
EDIT:

sudo apt-get install aptitude

output:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 aptitude : Depends: libcwidget3 but it is not going to be installed
            Recommends: libparse-debianchangelog-perl but it is not going to be installed
 ros-hydro-rosbag : Depends: ros-hydro-rosbag-storage but it is not going to be installed
E: Unmet dependencies. Try 'apt-get -f install' with no packages (or specify a solution).

A:

Try installing with aptitude, it gives you options to resolve conflicts.
you need to install aptitude first :
sudo apt-get install aptitude
then
sudo aptitude install ros-hydro-audio-common

Thanks for the reply! I've edited the question with the output of the command to install aptitude. I've tried installing the libcwidget3 package, but it also outputs an 'unmet dependencies' error.
