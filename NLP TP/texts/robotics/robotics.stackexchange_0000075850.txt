Q:

ROS Navigation help

Hello everyone.
I have been reading about ROS navigation lately and I came to know that we need to explore the whole map ourself in order to build it up. What I'm trying to achieve is that, to do the same without actually exploring it, I have the image of a map with all the dimensions from obstacles(say), so can we do this? Also the map is 3D.
Regards.

A:

Yes you can do that.
I would look into the map_server package: http://wiki.ros.org/map_server which takes a predefined map and enables it for navigation. It also defines how the image format should be.
Most of the navigation algorithms (amcl, etc) use a 2D map, so you probably should convert it to 2D.
