Q:

How to control Kuka robot with Moveit?

I am trying to control KUKA KR10 using MOVEIT.  I am now able to control the joints using rqt_joint_trajectory controller.  Now I want to send the robot in random position, using Rviz and moveit, and have Gazebo simulation of the robot follow the same path too.  I have a controller named arm_position_controller in namespace kuka_kr10. I put them in this namespace, because I could not simulate the robot in Gazebo without it.
However, I cannot control the Robot using rviz only.  My guess is, this is because rviz is publishing  joint_state to  namespace "kr10/joint_state" while the robot waits for messages on "joint_state". I do not know, if this assumption is correct, because when i manually change the joint state using rqt_joint_trajectory_controller, the change is reflected on rviz(however not in gazebo). Now my idea was to simply remap "kr10/joint_state" to "joint_state" and hope it works. Apparently it is not that easy. Does anyone have an idea, how do I go on about doing this?
I found this thread on how to achieve it using EKI but I am using RSI and the second answer mentions robtot_interface_streaming.launch  which is not to be found in KUKA Industrial Package. Is there any easy way to do this?

Now can you follow this thread using rsi? I'm trying to do it, but I'm wondering.

A:

I managed to solve it following this thread. robot_interface_streaming.launch can be found here.  This Discussion helped me troubleshoot the fact, that I was unable to control my robot using rqt_joint_trajectory_controller.  If anyone encounters the same problem,  feel free to leave a comment. I guess,  I kinda understand what was going on now.

Hello @brahpra,
I am facing the same issue. Can you help me to resolve the Kuka issue? I am using Kuka RSI.
