Q:

cameracalibrator.py GUI does not start

Hi,
I've been trying to get the camera parameters for my webcam. I'm using the uvc_cam package with camera_calibration package. The commands I use to start are as follows:
`

roscore

rosrun uvc_camera camera_node

rosrun camera_calibration camacalibrator.py --size 10x7 --square 0.022 image:/usb_cam/image_raw camera:=/
Waiting for service //set_camera_info ...
OK`

At this point, nothing happens. Does anyone have a rough idea what is going wrong?
Thanks in advance

A:

Hi,
There is two things you should try :
First : I see that you type image:/usb_cam but It should be for remapping   image:=/usb_cam with the "=" !
Then I did not see what you have set for your camera since it seems that you have paste the answer of you terminal right after you camera:=/ command
So to complete your command line do a rostopic list as follow
vvittori@delos:~/ros_workspace/stereo_robust_matching$ rostopic list
/camera/camera_info
/camera/image_raw
/camera/image_raw/compressed
/camera/image_raw/compressed/parameter_descriptions
/camera/image_raw/compressed/parameter_updates
/camera/image_raw/theora
/camera/image_raw/theora/parameter_descriptions
/camera/image_raw/theora/parameter_updates
/cameraUEYE_node/parameter_descriptions
/cameraUEYE_node/parameter_updates
/rosout
/rosout_agg

and then set the command line as follow (in my exemple /camera/image_raw is my image and /camera is my camera name )
rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --size 8x6 --square 0.108 image:=/camera/image_raw camera:=/camera

So for you it should be I gess
rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --size 10x7 --square 0.022  image:=/usb_cam/image_raw camera:=/usb_cam
