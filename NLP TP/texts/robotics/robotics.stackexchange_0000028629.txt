Q:

get all topic names in C++ API

I am able to get advertised topics with
std::liststd::string topics;
topics = gazebo::transport::getAdvertisedTopics("");
How to get all topics which are present but not advertised/published ( like ~\unit_box\link\wrench , etc. ) is C++ API ?
These topics are visible with gz topic -l but how to access in C++ API
