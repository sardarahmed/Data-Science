check your video_device. I guess that there are three devices and one of them belongs to your laptop cam.

how can i check video_device.?

A:

In Linux, video devices are per default named /dev/videoX with X counting up. The order might change depending on multiple factors (for instance when the device was plugged in, already at boot or afterwards). The right way to work around this is using udev rules. To quote the Debian Wiki on udev:

udev allows for rules that specify
what name is given to a device,
regardless of which port it is plugged
into. For example, a rule to always
mount a hard drive with manufacturer
"iRiver" and device code "ABC" as
/dev/iriver is possible. This
consistent naming of devices
guarantees that scripts dependent on a
specific device's existence will not
be broken.

If you search for "udev webcam" you should find lots of information about how to setup udev rules for your webcams. Your rules should look somewhat similar to this:
SUBSYSTEM=="video4linux", BUS=="usb", ATTRS{vendor}=="0x046d", ATTRS{device}=="0x0807", NAME="webcam_left"
SUBSYSTEM=="video4linux", BUS=="usb", ATTRS{vendor}=="0x046d", ATTRS{device}=="0x0808", NAME="webcam_right"

You would then use /dev/webcam_left and /dev/webcam_right in your launch file.

udev is a Linux (OS) subsystem, it is not something provided by ROS.

First: please don't badger us. We're all volunteers here and are helping you for free.
Second: udev is not part of ROS, so please use a more appropriate (ie: Linux oriented) support forum for that. @Stefan Kohlbrecher has already linked you to relevant docs on the Debian wiki. If things are ..

.. still unclear, ask a question on askubuntu or one of the Ubuntu forums (provided you are using Ubuntu).
