how can I return before update?

A:

Yesterday I also had some weird symbol lookup errors, too (After pulling some updates with the update manager).
sudo apt-get install -f

and
sudo apt-get autoremove

together with erasing build dirs and rebuilding in my workspace by (in the catkin_ws folder:)
rm -r devel
rm -r build
catkin_make

solved the issue...
