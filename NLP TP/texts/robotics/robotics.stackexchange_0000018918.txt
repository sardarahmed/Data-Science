Q:

Why are brushless servos more common than steppers in Cobots?

Essentially every cobot I've worked with uses BLDCs instead of stepper motors in the joints.  When searching for answers as to why I see a lot of posts that suggest one or the other, but nothing explains the consistent trend in the industry.  The closest I've come to an answer is that stepper motors are worse with dynamic loads, but I don't understand why.  Steppers have much higher precision due to their detant torque, so it seems like they should win out.
If anyone could help point me in the right direction I would greatly appreciate it.

A:

Size for size, steppers are wimpy compared to brushless (feel free to look at some catalogs and check; be sure to compare both torque and maximum RPM, because a motor can always be geared).
Without fancy electronics, steppers are run open-loop.  When they get lost, their average torque goes to zero.  I would not want that close to my face if it happened.

With fancy electronics, a stepper may as well be a brushless.  A wimpy brushless.

As long as position feedback is used and it's not limited by sticktion, a brushless can attain precision proportional to the accuracy of the feedback.
