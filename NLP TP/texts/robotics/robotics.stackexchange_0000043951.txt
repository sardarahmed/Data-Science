Q:

Robot position at Velocity zero to some reference object

Hello
I would like to ask for a bit help. I would like to know my position and distance to some labelled object in the map( my object is a just a single line segment) when the robot has a velocity zero ( so when he stopped for a while close to that reference object). So my robot (assume is a rectangle) is moving around the map environment and in after a while (like after one minutes) he stopped for a couple of seconds close to some object( a bed , which I assume is a line). So I just want to know the robot minimum distance to that reference line segment and its position (angle and other parameters) to that line. Any help?

Is the question on how to detect the velocity 0 or how to compute the transform between the object and the robot? Or both?

On both. But more important is how to detect the velocity 0. Any help?

A:

First you need to detect an object you are interested in - I assume you have already done this. Next step would be to publish tf transform for this particular object (line), you can find this tutorial useful:

Carrot example is really cool :) Of course you should publish tf /object with base /laser (or whatever, according to you detection method). In the part of the code that needs an input about object position place tf listener for transform from /object to /base_link, like in this tutorial:

http://www.ros.org/wiki/tf/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20tf%20listener%20%28C%2B%2B%29

Remember to setup your robot with tfs (in this case you are going to need /base_link and /laser frames).

Yes , thanks. But how about the velocity 0? but how to detect the velocity 0?
