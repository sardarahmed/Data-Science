Q:

Error running gzserver from an ubuntu server

So I'm trying to run a Gazebo server from an Ubuntu 16.04 instance, with no GUI.
when I run gzserver --verbose it outputs my ip settings (port 11345) and then this:
[Err] [RenderEngine.cc:726] Can't open display:
[Wrn] [RenderEngine.cc:93] Unable to create X window. Rendering will be disabled
[Wrn] [RenderEngine.cc:293] Cannot initialize render engine since render path type is NONE. Ignore this warning ifrendering has been turned off on purpose.
If I try and connect to it from another machine the client will output Exception sending a message for a while and then both the client and the server will output something like Aborted (core dumped).
Also, I tried running the server from an Ubuntu instance with a GUI. I didn't get the same [Err] and [Wrn] messages, but it still did the whole core dumped stuff.
Question 1: Can you run gzserver without a GUI?
Question 2: Any help on how to run a server like this? I haven't seen a tutorial on this exactly.
Thanks much!

A:

It is possible to run gazebo without a physical screen but you probably want a display in order to get rendering capabilities. You can use the graphic card headless or launch a virtual display, check the options to configure headless gazebo.
