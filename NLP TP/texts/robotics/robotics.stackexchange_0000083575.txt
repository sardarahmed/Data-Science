Q:

How to move mobile robot in rviz

Hello,
I am sorry for being naive.
I have GPS sensor information from a moving car. I have URDF model of a robot with four wheels. All joints are fixed (wheel to base_link). I want to move the robot in rviz according to GPS data. I am able to broadcast tf trasnform following this :Link
I have gone through these tutorials but all using joint_state_publisher. Any help would be appreciated.

Maybe this will help.

A:

I found the answer.
In this case, no moving joint is needed. We just need tf trasnform from base_link to fixed frame (odom). Just broadcast tf transform and set the header frame id to base_link.
