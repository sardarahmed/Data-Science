Q:

Using Gazebo installed on same machine in MATLAB

I am planning to use MATLAB and Gazebo for one of my course projects. 
However all the tutorials I have seen till now use Gazebo by using a virtual machine which has ROS and Gazebo installed. I have already installed ROS and Gazebo on this machine (OS Ubuntu). I also have MATLAB installed on it. 
Is it possible to use the Gazebo on this machine itself with the MATLAB toolbox? 

A:

The MATLAB tutorial doesnt cover this aspect well about when you have matlab  and gazebo  running on the same linux  machine with no virtual box.
Change your linux ethernet interface ip address statically  using:
sudo ifconfig eth0   192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0

assign to ros master the same ip address using: 
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.1.1:11311 >> ~/.bashrc
export ROS_HOSTNAME=192.168.1.1 >> ~/.bashrc
export ROS_IP=192.168.1.1 >> ~/.bashrc

assign to  matlab ros, an  ip address in same subnet as the master above using :
setenv('ROS_IP','192.168.1.100:11311')
setenv('ROS_IP','192.168.1.100')

start rosmaster in terminal using : roscore
start gazebo model in terminal
connect to rosmaster ip adress in MATLAB using: rosinit('192.168.1.1:11311')
Now you should see gazebo and ros topics in matlab command window
You can also follow the matlab tutorial to see how much more you can do
