A:

This warning is coming from inside Gazebo, there's no way to get rid of it, unless you contribute with a pull request implementing the conversion ;)

Looks like you're in luck, the conversion already exists on newer Gazebo versions. You could port it to the gazebo7 branch if you're interested in contributing: https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/src/cc5101392ae32616bf9bf39b6fc051104836aeb1/gazebo/msgs/msgs.cc?fileviewer=file-view-default#msgs.cc-1860
