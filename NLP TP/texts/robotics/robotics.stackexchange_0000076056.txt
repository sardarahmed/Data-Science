Q:

Getting error on package.xml when running "catkin_ make"

I have just started with ROS and I am following one of my first beginner tutorial "Writing a Simple Publisher and Subscriber (C++)".
I am receiving an error when I run catkin_make or catkin_make install

This is my terminal:
lucadg@luca-Inspiron-3543:~/catkin_ws$ catkin_make install
Base path: /home/lucadg/catkin_ws
Source space: /home/lucadg/catkin_ws/src
Build space: /home/lucadg/catkin_ws/build
Devel space: /home/lucadg/catkin_ws/devel
Install space: /home/lucadg/catkin_ws/install
**Invalid package manifest "/home/lucadg/catkin_ws/src/beginner_tutorials/package.xml": The manifest contains invalid XML:
mismatched tag: line 60, column 2**

Below a copy of my package.xml file which I checked and everything seems to be ok, line 60 is the last word, the closing tag of package.

This is my package.xml
<?xml version="3.0"?>
<package>

  <name>beginner_tutorials</name>
  <version>0.0.0</version>

  <description>The beginner_tutorials package</description>

Thank you for your help

A:

It looks like a couple of your dependencies don't have good close tags:
<run_depend>message_generation<run_depend>
<run_depend>message_runtime<run_depend>

Sometimes the XML parser doesn't realize there's an error until it gets to a close tag, so you have to look at the error message too, not just the line number.

Also:

<?xml version="3.0"?>

Was that auto-generated @lucadg? Afaik, there are only two valid values for version: 1.0 and 1.1 (see wikipedia/XML - Versions fi).

Thank you @ahendrix, I thought that was the right line number. Also I've changed the xml version by mistake, it should be 1.0

have you solved this problem? I have met the same one
Comment by ahendrix on 2017-01-26:
Yes, the error was that some of the closing tags were incorrect. Read your XML carefully and make sure that there's a close tag for every open tag.
