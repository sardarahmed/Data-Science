Q:

I want to know whether the Create2 can interface a LIDAR?

I want to know if the Create 2 can interface a laser radar?
For example an RPLidar.

A:

If you are willing to work at it, adding LIDAR to the Create 2 should be possible. If you read the iRobot Create 2 OI Specs, you will see that you can communicate with the Create via serial communication. If you look at the datasheet for the RPLidar, you will see that you can communicate with the sensor using serial communication. Because you cannot program the Create directly, you will need to use a microcontroller to interface the LIDAR and the robot.
