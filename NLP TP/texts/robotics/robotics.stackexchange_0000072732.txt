A:

You need to have the Aldebaran NAO Simulator SDK installed and properly set up. There you'll find the missing header file.
Also, check out the Readme of the package you try to build, this actually tells you in the Building/Compiling section that you have to configure some environment variables...

I followed the steps for Building/Compiling. I am still getting the error.
My SDK path is -- ~/naoqi/simulator-sdk-2.1.2.17-linux64 -- so i have added these envoirnment variables
AL_SIM_DIR = ~/naoqi/simulator-sdk-2.1.2.17-linux64
AL_DIR = ~/naoqi/simulator-sdk-2.1.2.17-linux64
Any Help?

where did you add/export them? added to .bashrc? only in one terminal? Did you compile in the terminal where you set this? Also, does te path contain the include folder directly? Check out [this fiile]  for where the paths should "end". Also, try replacing ~  with /home/saleem.

I have added them in .bashrc file. No path doesn't contain include folder directly. My AL_DIR= ~/naoqi/simulator-sdk-2.1.2.17-linux64 -- no include in the environment variables. Do i need to add include folder in AL_DIR?
Comment by mgruhler on 2016-03-14:
if you check out this file (now with the link hopefully working), you see it expects to have the include folder directly after your AL_SIM_DIR, this is ${AL_SIM_DIR}/include should exist.

Also (long shot, but just to be safe ;-) ). Did you source the .bashrc after adding the environment variables there?
Comment by saleem on 2016-03-14:
I have hardcoded the include files in the headers. Now it has been compiled and motion and stiffness commands are working. Hoping that it will not crash for any other commands.
Thankss a lot mig for your help. Will get back to you for any other help. :)
