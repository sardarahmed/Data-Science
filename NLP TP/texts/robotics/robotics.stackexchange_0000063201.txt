Q:

How to read a vector parameter from command line

Hi
I have a std::vectorstd::string parameter and I like to read the values getParam.
How does the command line syntax look to read my names param from bash.

e.g. rosrun my_pgk my_node _names:=??????? 
I tried: 
_names:="max susi" 
_names:="max, susi" 
_names:="[max, susi]" 
_names:="(max, susi)" 
nothing worked :-(

My code looks like this:
std::vector<std::string> names;
n_param_.getParam ( "names", names);

//For debugging
std::stringstream ss;
for ( size_t i = 0; i < names.size(); i++ ) ss << ( i!=0?", ":"" ) << names[i];
ROS_INFO ( "names: %s", ss.str().c_str() );

Greetings
Markus

A:

For the moment I solved the problem with a hack
std::string tmp;
std::vector<std::string> names;
n_param_.getParam ( "names", tmp);
boost::erase_all(tmp, " ");
boost::split ( names, tmp, boost::is_any_of(","));

now I can read it with _names:="max, susi"
