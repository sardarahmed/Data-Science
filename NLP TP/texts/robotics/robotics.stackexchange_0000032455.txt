Q:

Updating ROS diamondback stacks (not an svn install)

I am using Diamondback version of ROS which I installed using the sudo apt-get command. I want to update the perception_pcl stack. When I try to update it using the synaptic package manager, I get errors liek "Unable to fetch packages". What could be going wrong?
In general what would be the best way to update ROS stacks in this case?
Thanks,
Ankit

A:

It's a good practice to run "sudo apt-get update" first before installing a new ROS stack.  You may be fetching with an index that is out of date.  Our debian packages generally iterate much faster than normal in order to keep up with the fast pace of development.
