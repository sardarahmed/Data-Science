Q:

Environment setup error - term 'call' is not recognized in PowerShell

Hi, I am a ROS beginner installing ROS 2 on Windows and at the stage of sourcing the ROS 2 setup file to set up the workspace in PowerShell. However, when I enter the command call C:\dev\ros2_eloquent\local_setup.bat (which I have verified to be the correct directory), I receive the following error:
call : The term 'call' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function,
script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a
path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.
At line:1 char:1
+ call C:\dev\ros2_eloquent\local_setup.bat
+ ~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (call:String) [], CommandNotFoundException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException

What should I do to solve this? Thank you

A:

These instructions are intended to be used with the cmd prompt.
If you want to use PowerShell you need to to invoke the setup file ending in .ps1 (which is the extension for PowerShell scripts).

Thanks a lot, works well in cmd. How do I invoke the setup file ending in .psl?

With just the filename.
