Q:

Why does it require more force to turn a servo if it is electronically connected to another servo?

I have two servo motors that I rigged up to use as a telescope remote focuser. The idea is to turn one servo by hand and use the power generated to turn the other, which is geared to a telescope focuser knob. I noticed that when the two servos are electrically connected, it is noticeably harder to turn a servo compared to turning it by itself. I tried changing the polarity of the connection hoping it would help, but it is still harder to turn the servo when they are connected. Does anyone know why this is?

A:

The other servo, being an electrical device, has some finite resistance. 
When the servos are not electrically connected, the output of the manually turned servo is an open circuit, meaning that there is infinite resistance and no current flows. Because no current is flowing, the electrical output power of manually turned servo is 
$P = IV$
where $I = 0$, so 
$P = (0)(V) = 0$. 
When you connect another servo, there is now a finite resistance connected to the manually turned servo's leads, so now current may flow. Now the current is given by
$V = IR$
$I = V/R$
so the electrical output power of the servo is
$P = IV$
$P = V^2/R$
There are two "types" of voltage in a motor when you operate it normally; the applied voltage and a back-voltage, commonly called "back EMF". This back EMF is a byproduct of motor motion.
The requirements for motor action are:

Current-carrying conductor
Applied magnetic field 
Applied voltage differential on the conductor

The output of motor action is relative motion between the current-carrying conductor and the magnetic field. 
The requirements for generator action are:

Current-carrying conductor
Applied magnetic field
Relative motion between the conductor and field

The output of generator action is a voltage differential in the conductor. 
So you can see that if you meet motor action then you get generator action and both happen simultaneously. 
When you back-drive a motor, you can get an output voltage at the motor terminals, if you have an applied magnetic field. In some instances, electric vehicles for instance, the motor is created such that the magnetic field is in the form of an electromagnet, called field windings. In this version, it is possible to vary the strength of the magnetic field by varying the current in the field windings; this varies the output current of the motor during back-driven operations and produces a variable strength braking effect. 
In your case, with servo motors, the magnetic field typically comes in the form of permanent magnets in the motor housing. This means that the only way to vary output current (assuming a fixed output resistance) is to vary speed, as this varies the voltage you generate as dictated by the back-EMF constant;
$ V_{\mbox{back EMF}} = K_{\omega} \omega \phi$
where $K_{\omega}$ is the back-EMF constant, $\omega$ is the speed at which you are driving the motor, and $\phi$ is the strength of the magnetic field. 
Looking again at the electrical output power of the servo:
$P = V^2/R$
Output power of the servo goes up with voltage squared. Since voltage is proportional to the driving speed of the motor, you can see that output power goes up based on speed squared; if you double the speed at which you drive the servo you quadruple the output power of the servo. This is why the servo gets "very hard" to drive. 
There will always be some resistance when you try to drive a servo or motor, even with an open circuit, because they are real devices and thus have mass and inertia. You apply a torque to accelerate the motor:
$ \tau = I\alpha$
where $\tau$ is the torque you apply, $I$ is the effective motor inertia, and $\alpha$ is the rate at which you are accelerating the motor shaft. Output power varies with torque and speed:
$P_\mbox{mechanical} = \tau \omega$
so it requires more power to accelerate an already-moving object than it does to accelerate a stationary object. 
Finally, the total power you apply to the servo is given by:
$P = P_{\mbox{mechanical}} + P_{\mbox{backEMF}}$
$P = \tau \omega + V^2/R$
$P = I\alpha \omega + (K_{\omega} \omega \phi)^2/R$
$P = (I \alpha)\omega + \frac{(K_\omega \phi)^2}{R}\omega^2 $
Where again, if the back-driven servo is not electrically connected to anything, then $R$ becomes infinitely large and the second term in the above equation becomes zero.
