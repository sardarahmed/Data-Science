Q:

Why does RViz segfault sometimes when I ctrl-c the process?

Just the title, really.
It doesn't seem to effect anything when I see the segfault being reported, but it doesn't seem like it should happen.  Moreover, when I close the RViz window using the (x) button in the top left, Ubuntu sometimes tells me "Sorry, RViz has crashed!" when I, well, made it 'crash'...

A:

It's probably a bug in rviz or one of the rviz plugins you're using.
Without capturing one of these segfaults in an instance of gdb and getting a traceback or getting a core dump from Ubuntu, it's pretty much impossible to say why.
If you can reliably reproduce the issue then you can report it on the rviz issue tracker.
