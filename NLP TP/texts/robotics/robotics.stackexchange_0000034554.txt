Q:

ros-electric : package => motion_planning_common

Hi,
I recently install ROS Electric (before I had Diamondback). But, with this new release, I can't find the package "motion_planning_common".
I use Ubuntu 11.04 and this package does not appear in the package manager (synaptic) but in the Diamondback version, it appears...
Do you know if this package is plan to be added ?
I need it for my robot and installing the Diamondback version does not seem to work.
Thanks,
Jo

A:

Packages from motion_planning_common that are still being maintained now live in arm_navigation.
Note also that many of the message packages that existed in motion_planning_common have been swallowed up by arm_navigation_msgs.
