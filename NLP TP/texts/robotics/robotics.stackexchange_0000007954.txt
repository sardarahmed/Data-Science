Q:

Book on mechanisms

I wanted to know if there is any sort of archive of mechanisms that contains a brief description of mechanisms like there type of motion and forces involved. Not lengthy derivations and other stuff. 

A:

Mechanisms and Mechanical Devices Sourcebook - Nicholas P. Chironis & Neil Sclater, McGraw-Hill, ISBN 0-07-011356-4. The format of this book is more akin to a scrapbook of newspaper clippings, but it is a good visual "food-for-thought" collection spanning several generations of mechanism design for a broad range of applications and industries.
