Q:

Openni_launch failure / "cannot launch node of type [nodelet/nodelet]"

Hi guys,
I run Ubuntu 11.10 plus ROS electric (installed from source) on an Pandaboard ES and try to use a Kinectsensor with this setup.
But when I fire up following command
$ roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch
I get the following kind of failure:

ERROR: cannot launch node of type [nodelet/nodelet]: Cannot locate node of type [nodelet] in package  

I tried to rebuild te packages by rosmake tf && rosmake and now i get a different failure message.

started roslaunch server http://129.73.14.14:53859/

Would be great to get some help.

Are you sure that the packages "nodelet" and "tf" are properly installed? You can check for example: rospack find nodelet. It should return something like /opt/ros/electric/stacks/nodelet_core/nodelet.

Thank you for your comment. I checked if they are installed with rospack find nodelet (result : /home/panda/ros/nodelet_core/nodelet) and rospack find tf (result: /home/panda/ros/geometry/tf )
Comment by dinamex on 2012-06-06:
the different path is probably caused by the installation from source.
Comment by Martin Peris on 2012-06-06:
If you installed from source, the error messages make me suspect that the binaries for nodelet and static_transform_publisher are not built. Have you tried rosmake tf && rosmake nodelet ?

A:

Hi,
I don't know your purpose of launching openni_launch in specific. But if you just want to get the pointclouds from the kinect. Then you may use
roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch

I see many posts on
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch

doesn't work for many people. I have seen many posts here on the same.
It would be great if these problems are consolidated in a troubleshooting section of the tutorial and make it work at that point.
Any solution regarding the openni.launch is appreciated.
Thanks,
Karthik
