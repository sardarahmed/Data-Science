A:

I think, it will be easier to connect an Arduino to your Raspberry pi. The arduino get the Information from the pi and will send it to the Servomotors.
The same like here:

There is also the code to send the Infos to your Arduino.
You need to install rosserial on your pi(including the arduino IDE, see tutorial http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial/Tutorials) and copy the code from the Servo-controller-example for your motors. You need to extend the code for your setup.
