Q:

Hi,
My system is Ubuntu 12.04. In the 3rd step of the installation instructions, a get an error about the missing siftgpu library. I execute "catkin_make" command again but I'm still having same problem;

Is SiftGPU built? Do you have the file ../src/rgbdslam/external/SiftGPU/bin/libsiftgpu.so (within the rgbdslam package directory)? Otherwise try executing make in ../src/rgbdslam/external/SiftGPU/

A:

it works thanks FELIX
