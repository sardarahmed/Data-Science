Q:

VTK package not found

Hi am trying to download a VTK package which is a dependency for my other package. I tried to access the repository https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/point_cloud_perception/trunk/vtk but is gives me the error that the URL can't be found on my sever. Also, when i click the link, it says that the repository cant be accessed on my sever . Can you please help me as to how to get the VTK package. Thanks in advance

A:

The old point_cloud_perception stack is deprecated.
The current perception_pcl stack no longer contains a VTK stack. Instead, it has a rosdep dependency on the system libvtk version.
