Q:

Creating private deb packages for distribution

I'd like to take my existing ROS packages and release different versions that can be installed and updated on a platform without a checkout of the source code repository (so no rosmake).
The current solution is copying over the compiled binaries manually and setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include all of the lib directories.
Is there a script or tool that will generate a binary-only deb package that I can distribute?  Rosdeb looks close, but there isn't a lot of documentation on how to run it by hand.  Or alternatively, what's the best solution to move over the binaries without having to manually set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH?

Edit:  Unfortunately, this is all proprietary work, so I can't just piggyback onto the Willow servers.  ;)
My ideal quick solution would be something like:
roscd my_secret_package
rosmake --make-binary-deb my_secret_package.deb -tag 0.1-2-3
scp my_secret_package.deb foo@bar:/some/path
And later, if possible, I would find a way to make a quick apt-get repo, but I'm primarily interested in being able to make quick binary releases by hand.

A:

To get a proper answer to this, you probably want to join the Fuerte Infrastructure SIG: http://www.ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Planning/Infrastructure .  The code is there, but the SIG will deal with the issues of external users using it.
