Q:

Map compatability issue with move_base and gmapping

One more quick question when I run gmapping, I am getting a cool map but when I try to run move_base I get the following error:

[ERROR] [1304145896.391400959, 492.700000000]: Client [/move_base_node] wants topic /odom to have datatype/md5sum [nav_msgs/Odometry/cd5e73d190d741a2f92e81eda573aca7], but our version has [geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped/953b798c0f514ff060a53a3498ce6246]. Dropping connection.

Obviously move_base is expecting a md5sum but gmapping doesn't provide it as far as I know, any way to change it?
thanks,
BM

A:

The "/odom" topic is provided by the robot, not gmapping or move_base. The "/odom" information is needed by the base_local_planner portion of move_base, whereas gmapping uses only the laser scan and tf information.
How is your robot publishing /odom? Have you seen this tutorial: http://www.ros.org/wiki/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup/Odom
