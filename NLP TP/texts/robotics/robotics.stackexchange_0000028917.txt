Q:

Custom attributes in SDF files

Is it possible to add custom attributes to SDF elements other than plugins?  For example should I be able to do:
<model>
    <my_random_thing>5</my_random_thing>
    ...
</model>

and then be able to access my_random_thing from the SDF element associated with my model?  I know this works for plugins, but I can't get it to work for models.
Thanks.

If you use ROS with your system you can save "your random thing" on rosparam server to access it from nodes and plugins.

A:

Reading the specification, I'd say it's not possible.
You can do this for plugins due to the copy_data element, which is not part of the model spec.
