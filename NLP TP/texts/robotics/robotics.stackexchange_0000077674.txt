Q:

ROSWTF "unexpectedly connected" message and creation of new nodes

I am attempting multi-robot simulation (currently involving two robots) and the problem is with the roswtf which throws "WARNING The following nodes are unexpectedly connected:" warning as mentioned in this terse and beautiful question (But the answer is not satisfactory). But, in my case, roswtf is also creating /tf topics and creating new nodes like /roswtf_11591_1480848778816 and /roswtf_11751_1480848797413 each time I run roswtf.
The rqt_graph s are as shown.
 and 
Can somebody be requested to let me know why this is happening and the reason behind it? Thanks for your time and consideration.
Reference note: The entire log can be found here.

A:

roswtf is initialized as an 'anonymous' node. Which is why it's node name has a unique number attached for each launch so that the node name will not collide with any other instances.
See the anonymous initialization option at http://wiki.ros.org/rospy/Overview/Initialization%20and%20Shutdown
It subscribes to /tf and you are not visualizing new topics but new edges in the graph.
