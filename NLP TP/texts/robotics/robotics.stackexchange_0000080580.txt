Q:

raspberrypi package not found

When running catkin build in my catkin_ws  workspace I get the following error:
Note added: I do not have a standard /op/ros/kinetic directory...just the catkin workspaces.
pi@dex: catkin build

If I look for Twish.h it is found as follows. The ros_catkin_ws is my primary workspace where I loaded ros desktop install
pi@dex:~ $ sudo find . / -name Twist.h
/home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/devel/.private/geometry_msgs/include/geometry_msgs/Twist.h
/home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/devel/include/geometry_msgs/Twist.h

In .bashrc file I have
source ~/ros_catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

Finally if I echo ROS_PACKAGE_PATH ,/home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/src/common_msgs/geometry_msgs:/ is in the path.
Can someone give me a hand here. Why is it not finding the include file?
