Q:

Why there is no #define before PLUGINLIB_EXPORT_CLASS macro?

When we want to make a plugin, we need to register the plugin
PLUGINLIB_EXPORT_CLASS(carrot_planner::CarrotPlanner, nav_core::BaseGlobalPlanner)

My understanding is that this is the redefinition of the pluginlib_export_class macro. However, from what I have seen so far, we need #define for this. How come there is no #define?
Thanks,
Rico

Not quite: it's an invocation of the macro.

Because you're not defining a macro, but invoking it.

Good point, but note that there is no semicolon ; after the macro. My understanding is that when we invoke a macro, there is always a ;. Here is an example for a macro with no semicolon
This is interesting
