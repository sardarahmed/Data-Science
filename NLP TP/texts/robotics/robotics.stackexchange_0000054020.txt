Q:

How to Install USARSim package

I am currently installed USARSIm on windows7 and ROS groovy on ubuntu 11.10. Question 1:How to add the package usarsim or usarsim_inf? When I type roscd usarsim_inf (in ubuntu terminal); then error comes as no such package/satck 'usarsim_inf'.
Question 2: where to include usarsim.launch file?
Question 3: I have gone through  http://sourceforge.net/p/usarsimros/code/ci/master/tree/; but how to use this to build a package? Also gone through https://github.com/makokal/usarsim-ros but it unable to connect to github.com.
Question 4: Can we provide our own predefined map without using slam in ROS?

A:

I suggest you modify your ~/.bashrc file by adding the following line:
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/path/to/usarsim-code:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

What do you mean exactly? In /path/to/usarsim-code/usarsim_inf/launch you find the usarsim.launch template file together with some working examples

I did not know the repo by Billy Okal, I'll try it. However I downloaded the software from sourceforge and managed to compile only the usarsim_inf package. Simply cd to the usarsim_inf directory and enter make

yes, look for the map_server entry in the wiki

By the way, did you manage to make USARSimRos work, in the end? I think there's a bug in USARSimRos, I posted a comment about it, with a workaround here: http://sourceforge.net/p/usarsimros/discussion/general/thread/baca98c8/
