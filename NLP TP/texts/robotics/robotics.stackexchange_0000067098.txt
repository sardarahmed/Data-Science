Q:

Using Indigo with Gazebo 5

Is it possible to use Gazebo 5 with Indigo?
The Indigo install docs say it comes with Gazebo 2, which is ancient and has a lot of usability issues. Gazebo 5 has a pretty convenient repo for easily installing it on Ubuntu 14.04, which is what Indigo is based on. However, their docs note that only the upcoming Jade release will be using Gazebo 5.
I'm still new to ROS. If I try and use Indigo with Gazebo 5, am I going to run into a wall?

A:

I do not know if it is too late, but yes. It is possible to install ROS Indigo and Gazebo 5 and not run into problems. All you have to do is simply not install any of the ros-indigo packages that depend on Gazebo (as it will install Gazebo 5 2). Then, just install the gazebo5 package and ros-indigo-gazebo5-pkgs.
This works well to me. However, some packages as for example Kobuki description will have dependencies conflicts and you will have to install them from source.

as it will install Gazebo 5

I think you meant Gazebo 2, so I corrected it.
