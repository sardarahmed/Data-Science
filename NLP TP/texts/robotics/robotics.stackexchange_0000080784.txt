Q:

LMS1XX on ROS Kinetic

Hy,
I am trying to get a connection in ROS Kinetic to my LMS111 Laserscanner with:
 rosrun lms1xx LMS1xx_node _host:=192.168.3.7

The result is a connection fail. I saw the other posts like http://answers.ros.org/question/207220/connecting-a-sick-laserscanner-via-ethernet/ and http://answers.ros.org/question/66437/using-the-sicktoolbox_wrapper-with-lms1xx/ bbut there is never a full description to the solution...
Does anyone have an idea what could be the problem or could provide a full solution path?
Thanks in advance,
Michael

I think the problem is due to permission of the port. Try $ sudo chmod a+rx [port of the LMS]  before launching the lms node. It should work. I have had no problems using LMS sensors on ROS kinetic so far.

i messed up the configuration, thanks for your answer, i added a solution path below.

A:

In order to establish a connection of the Laserscanner SICK LMS111 to ROS Kinetic several steps have to be performed.
1.Supply the Sensor and connect it to the ethernet port a system running Windows.
2. Install SICK SOPAS Engineering tool and execute it.
3. Configure the Paramters in the SICK Software SOPAS. That means define a ethernet ip adress and adjust measuring parameters.
4.Install the sick toolbox wrapper:

$ sudo apt-get install
ros-kinetic-lms1xx

In Ubuntu under Settings configure the wired connection to be different than the IP of the laserscanner. The IP of the laserscanner can be obtained by

$ sudo ifconfig

Make sure that the connection between ubuntu and the LMS is established in Ubuntu (You can see this in the Network Settings).

$ roscore

In order to establish a connection to ROS use a new terminal and enter

$ rosrun lms1xx LMS1xx_node _
host:=[IP of the scanner obtained from
sudo ifconfig]

has to be used.
9.When using rviz: the fixed frame in global options has to be set to laser and a LaserScan display has to be added with the topic /scan enabled.
