Q:

How to use test_move.py script from ur_modern_driver

Hello,
I am currently running on Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS, UR Software 3.3.0.145, and am running Indigo. I am able to get roslaunch to work, however when I try to run rosrun ur_modern_driver test_move.py. I get the error
rospkg.common.ResourceNotFound: ur_driver 

I have run the rosrun command in a new terminal after running source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
Any thoughts or insights are greatly appreciated!
Cheers,
Pawel

A:

The test_move.py script from ur_modern_driver includes a (as far as I can tell) erronous roslib.load_manifest(..) line (here), that references the ur_driver package.
Quick work-around: make sure to have the ur_driver package available on your PC: either install ros-$distro-ur-driver, or clone the universal_robot git repository into your catkin workspace (don't forget to rebuild the workspace).
Now rosrun ur_modern_driver test_move.py should work.
You could also just remove the roslib.load_manifest(..) line: it is no longer needed.
PS: it would be nice if you could report this to the ur_modern_driver issue tracker.

Even if test_move.py in ur_modern_driver is fixed, having the ROS-I universal_robot packages installed seems like a good idea in order to do almost anything useful (e.g. to have the URDF in ur_description).

Yes, good point. Although that depends on what you actually want to do, of course.

Indeed, that's where the almost comes from ;)

I had the same error: "rospkg.common.ResourceNotFound: ur_driver"
and I solved it by: sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-ur-driver
