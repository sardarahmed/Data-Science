When I install turtlebot indigo on jetson tk1 from source and I get this error:

Exception caught during install: Error processing 'yocs_msgs' : [yocs_msgs] Checkout of https://github.com/yujinrobot/yocs_msgs.git version indigo into /home/ubuntu/kobuki/src/yocs_msgs failed.

ERROR in config: Error processing 'yocs_msgs' : [yocs_msgs] Checkout of https://github.com/yujinrobot/yocs_msgs.git version indigo into /home/ubuntu/kobuki/src/yocs_msgs failed.

A:

Checkout of https://github.com/yujinrobot/yocs_ms... version indigo into /home/ubuntu/kobuki/src/yocs_msgs failed.

As you can see from the list of branches over at yujinrobot/yocs_msgs/branches, there is no indigo branch (any more).
I've seen a few of these questions already, it'd probably be a good idea to report this issue over at the issue tracker. It would seem the tutorial you followed needs to be updated, or the .rosinstall file.
