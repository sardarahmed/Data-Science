Q:

sick_tim unable to connect to laserscanner

Hi,
I tried to start the sick_tim package, but it can't connect to the TiM Laserscanner.
With Windows and SOPAS ET I can config the scanner.
The IP is set to 169.254.8.76 and the Subnetmask to 255.255.0.0
With Ubuntu 12.04 and ROS Hydro I can ping the scanner but with ROS I can't connect.
Here the console output:
roslaunch sick_tim sick_tim551_2050001.launch
... logging to /home/youbot/.ros/log/e93740a6-eac1-11e5-8203-000bab452ad7/roslaunch-youbot-mobile-24935.log
Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.

A:

Just to be clear: You set the scanner IP to 169.254.8.76, right? What did you set your computer's IP to? If you also used 169.254.8.76, you weren't pinging the scanner, you were pinging yourself. Try something else in the 169.254.8.* range, like 169.254.8.42 . Also see sick_tim #34.
