Q:

Where I can find a list of dependencies?

I don't know where find or what dependencies to use when I will create a package dependencies. It's possible create a depends? For example, in the Tutorial I see rospy, roscpp and std_msgs. Where I can find more and how I can know what dependencies use in my projects? Is there some description about the dependencies?

A:

The package.xml file inside the package that you created contains the information about package dependencies.
This is the place to edit the package dependencies.

So, what I want to know is where I can find the list of dependencies in the site of ROS. Because, I know basically three dependencies (rospy, roscpp, std_msgs).

First you need to state an application and see what all available packages are required. Based upon application you might require tf, geometry_msgs, nav_msgs et cetera. Check this ros wiki page: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage
