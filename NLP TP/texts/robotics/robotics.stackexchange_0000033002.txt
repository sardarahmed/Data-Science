Q:

How do I start a node with an anonymous name with roslaunch?

I have a node that passes the following argument when calling ros::init:
ros::init_options::AnonymousName

It works fine and gives me a unique node name. However, when I launch this node from a roslaunch file, it does not create a unique node name anymore.
How do I fix this?

A:

Please see: http://www.ros.org/wiki/roslaunch/XML
"
$(anon name)
e.g. $(anon rviz-1). Generates an anonymous id based on name. name itself is a unique identifier: multiple uses of $(anon foo) will create the same "anonymized" name. This is used for  name attributes in order to create nodes with anonymous names, as ROS requires nodes to have unique names.

Is there a way to actually generate random ids/names then?
