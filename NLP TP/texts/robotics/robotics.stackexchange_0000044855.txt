A:

ROS is the name of the operating system (like windows or ubuntu). Electric is the specific distro (like XP and vista or precise pangolin 12.04 and oneiric ocelot 11.10).
ROS Fuerte is the current distro as of 10.12.12, and it's recommended that you use that.
You should check out the introduction to ROS and the ROS distribution page for more info.

So as not to confuse someone who is new to all this, remember that ROS is not an "operating system" in the common sense of the term.  It is not its own linux distribution, for example.  It still must be run on an operating system, like Ubuntu/Windows.
