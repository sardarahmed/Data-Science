Q:

speed-based tracking

I try to make speed-based tracking that moves the speed of AX-12 servo motors based on the speed of my joints (my body) using kinect, but I don't know the mechanism how to get the speed by using kinect.. Anybody know ??
Do I must get kinect frame rate first ?
How to get the speed of my joints (my body) using kinect ??
I hope that someone can help me ^_^
Thanks..

A:

Or simpler, if you are using openni.
[EDIT] : the pi_tracker is the one I meant. Openni tracker only gives transforms, not coordinate of the joints.
If you have a look at the tracker file, you'll see that you can access to the points coordinates. Then computing a velocity is the easy part. However, I have no idea how to command your motors (but I hope you know it ;-) )
To access the points, it easy : make a listener, then access the parts you are interested in :
for each joint (here corresponding to index k), you have the following fields
msg.position[k].x
msg.position[k].y
msg.position[k].z
msg.orientation[k].x
msg.orientation[k].y
msg.orientation[k].z
msg.orientation[k].w

[EDIT 2 ] = the pi_tracker has already something to command velocity for a robot, based on joint velocity....
I hope it'll help you,
Bests,
Steph
