Q:

How to set the parameter of the global planner in navigation stack

Dear all,
The global planner pkg provides few algorithms like A*, grid path and etc. My question is how I can set these methods? For example, for grid path method I need to set global planner parameter as "use_grid_path=True" but I do not know where and how I should set it? Do I set them as rosparam in launch file?
Thanks for your help.

Adding a good example for option (A): turtlebot_navigation @alireza_m See launch/includes/move_base.launch.xml and and param/global_planner_params.yaml
