Q:

Getting Started Using ROS on a Micro Controller

Hello, I'm relatively new with Robotics as I've previously only done things with Parallax's robot kits.  I'd like to start learning ROS but there doesn't seem to be any starting help.  To begin with I need to get a computer with Ubuntu as the Windows version is limited.  The bigger question is, what MicroController do I need?  I was under the assumption when I used the Parallax Basic-Stamp 2 that my desktop software that I programmed with translated my program into something the chip understands.  But is this universal?  Can I pick pretty much any microcontroller in the world to use with the ROS system?  Please help guys as I'm completely lost.

A:

ROS is not about micro controller programming in the first place. It is a set of tools, libraries and modules to work with robots. The PR2 and most other robots run normal Linux PCs. Have a look at the getting started page for more information.
There are some packages to work with micro controllers though, for instance rosserial.
