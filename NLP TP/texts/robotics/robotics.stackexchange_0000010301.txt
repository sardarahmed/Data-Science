Q:

what books do you suggest for a beginner like me ?

i am studying bacholar of dental surgery but have intrest in learning this subjet so tell me about a good book to read.

A:

If you only want a single comprehensive text on Robotics, I would recommend the Springer Handbook of Robotics. I covers everything from controls and artificial intelligence to perception and mechanics; it is a phenomenal touchstone for further reading and is authored by the best minds in each sub-discipline in robotics. Of particular relevance to your background, there is significant coverage given to medical robotics, which you might find interesting.
