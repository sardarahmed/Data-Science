Q:

Humanoid Robot Control and Interaction

hi all,
I am trying to run Halit Bener SUAY's Nao demo. I have found that in step 3:
"roslaunch openni_camera openni_kinect.launch", the file "openni_kinect.launch" doesn't exist, but "openni_node.launch". Then I went through to step 6.
When running "rosmake nao_openni", I got the errors:
/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/ros_comm/clients/cpp/roscpp_traits/include/ros/message_traits.h:121: error: ‘const struct std::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >’ has no member named ‘__getMD5Sum’

and
/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/ros_comm/clients/cpp/roscpp_traits/include/ros/message_traits.h:138: error: ‘const struct std::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >’ has no member named ‘__getDataType’

Hope someone can help me with this.
Thank you very much.

both errors stemmed from the file teleop_nao_ni.cpp.
2 lines were commented out:
teleop_nao_ni.cpp:872:  //obj.m_speechPub.publish(naosay.data);
teleop_nao_ni.cpp:976:      //teleopNao.m_speechPub.p

Problem solved in this way:

Is that the complete error output from running make (as it's a little short)? Could it be that you're mixing a diamondback and electric ROS system somehow?

A:

In order to get rid of the compilation errors, I adjusted the C++ code a bit:
both errors stemmed from the file nao_openni/src/teleop_nao_ni.cpp.
I commented out these 2 lines:
teleop_nao_ni.cpp:872:  //obj.m_speechPub.publish(naosay.data);
teleop_nao_ni.cpp:976:      //teleopNao.m_speechPub.publish(naosay.data);
after which I was able to run the command "rosmake nao_openni" without errors.
I assume that my changes in the source file will not have any effect on the behaviour of the nao, except that the nao will a little more silent.
