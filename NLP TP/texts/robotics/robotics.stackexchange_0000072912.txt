Q:

catkin_make error: invoking "cmake" failed

I'm on ubuntu 14.04
I'm using ROS indigo.
I am new to ROS.
I know there are similar questions on here but their answers didn't help me.
I've been following some ROS/catkin tutorials and am currently on this one: http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace.
The instructions all worked fine until I got to catkin_make.
Roscore was running in a separate terminal at the time.
I took a snapshot of the error and was going to upload it but apparently I don't have enough points.
(If you want to teach newbies to write questions in an easy-to-follow way, it'd be useful to allow them to upload screenshots.)
I uploaded the screenshot to photobucket instead:

Personally I'd rather ppl copy/paste the console text, as it is then indexed by search engines, whereas images are not. Also: img hosts have different retention policies, which can lead to screenshots disappearing.

I'm on windows 8.1 [..]

Can you please tell us how you installed ROS, which VM product you are using and what arch this is?
Comment by Fuzzball on 2016-03-19:
I'm not sure what a VM product is or what an arch is. I just realized that windows 8.1 was incorrect (I got confused cos this computer has two operating systems), I'm using ROS on Ubuntu 14.04. I installed ROS by following the steps in this link: http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2016-03-19:
VM == virtual machine, arch == processor architecture. As you reported you were running Windows 8.1, the only way to have ROS running would be in a virtual machine, hence my question.

Hi.I have met the same situation. Have you solved it yet? Thanks for your help.

hi, found the answer http://answers.ros.org/question/196915/invoking-cmake-failed/

A:

Hi,
try:

$ echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

to see a list of paths, you should see something like:

/opt/ros/indigo/share:/opt/ros/indigo/stacks

If not, probably you have placed a new path to your ~/.bashrc . Simply remove it and it should work.
Type:

$ sudo gedit ~/.bashrc

a file will open, scroll all the way down and remove the last one(s), save and exit. Try in a new terminal.
