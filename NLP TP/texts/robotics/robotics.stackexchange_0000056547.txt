Q:

Issue installing USB_CAM on Groovy Raspbian

Good night partners
I would like to use an usb camera (common usb camera) on my raspberry pi running groovy-raspbian.
I've just followed the instructions in

http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Setting%20up%20ROS%20on%20RaspberryPi#ROS_Peripherals

At step 4.1  when I finally type roscd usb_cam I have the following:

roscd: No such package/stack 'usb_cam

Where am I wrong? Where is my mistake?
Thanks you so much
EDIT1 : I have also downloaded this https://github.com/bosch-ros-pkg-release/usb_cam-release/releases/tag/release%2Fgroovy%2Fusb_cam%2F0.1.3-0  but I'm not sure if it will help me. I don't really know how to proceed with this.

A:

You need to make sure that usb_cam is in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH so that the package can be found.
