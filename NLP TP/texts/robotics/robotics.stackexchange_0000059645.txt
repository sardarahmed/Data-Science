Q:

Simple GPS guided vehicle

I'm trying to familiarize myself with ROS by doing simple DIY projects with the hardware I have.
The goal is try to get a mobile base to navigate a direct/straight path from point A to point B where Point A&B are marked GPS coordinates (waypoints?). The sensors I have are GPS/AHRS sensors. I looked into the tutorials for ROS navigation for a while before realizing that the stack needs sensor streams from LaserScans or PointClouds.
I dont have any range sensors, and at this point I'm not too worried about obstacle avoidance. I have the GPS/AHRS sensor working independently in ROS and I'm trying to merge this all together with my motor controller. Is there anyway I can use the navigation package without a laser/range sensor? Is there an alternative package that I use to do navigate a direct path from point A to point B? Or, can I somehow use the navigation package with a simple usbcam instead?

Hey Is there any link that you can share to connect bebop to GPS in ros and set waypoints

A:

If you don't need obstacle avoidance you can use the navigation stack without a map and without a laser scanner (We've used the configuration based on the pr2_navigation_apps). You just need to remove the base_scan sources for the costmaps.
You may still need to use a localization package to provide the estimated position of the robot. We used the robot_localization package and it worked really well.
Hope it helps!

Can you give us a link to your source code for the launch files? Working out which topics need feeding in move_base from robot_localization.
