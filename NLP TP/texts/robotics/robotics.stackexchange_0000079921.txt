Q:

Debugging and developing environment for ROS

After watching beginnners tutorials, I still dont get where am I supposed to write code using ROS? Can I do It in QtCreator for example ? If so, how am I going to import libraries there? And how may I debug code ?
I already installed everything step by step from tutorial.

A:

Now that you know how ros works, what packages, msgs, nodes, topics are you should move on on the  public/subsc
http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingPublisherSubscriber%28c%2B%2B%29
create 1st a node that can publish your own msg type, lets say a frame {x,y,z} after that white a node that can receive that information, when that is working you can then edit publisher node and make a GUI for it, if ou like QT the go for QT, you can what ever you want....
About debuging:
if you need to debug you have a couple of options, you can in Terminal (and using ros tool suite) echoes a topic, you can too log the info to a file or to a terminal, you can use a bag(maybe too much for that purposes)
