Q:

Set near/far clip distance for the visualization window camera

When viewing an outdoor gazebo world from some distance above, I get strong Z-fighting artifacts between two ground planes located on top of each other at a distance of about 0.5 meters.
I suppose this could be fixed with a more suitable near and far clip distance for the visualization camera. Is there a way to set this distances in gazebo? Is it possible to access the camera parameters using a Gazebo-GUI-Plugin?

@Illuminatur please don't try hijacking the thread, instead open a new question :)

A:

It should be possible to do it from a GUI plugin. Just get the user camera:
rendering::UserCameraPtr camera = gazebo::gui::get_active_camera();
And set the new clip distances:
camera->SetClipDist(near, far);
