Q:

Shape Recognition and finding the location

Hello Everyone,
I have a 3d point cloud data of human head. I have attached few markers (sphere/hemispheres) to the head before scanning the head with laser scanner. I need to find the location (xyz coordinates) of these markers. I was wondering if anyone could help in identifying these markers through shape/pattern recognition or any other technique so that I get the location of the markers. Does this software package has the capability of doing this? Thanks in advance.
Thanks
Santosh

A:

I haven't looked at the implementation myself but perhaps the shape_detection package from the object_recognition stack is a solution?
