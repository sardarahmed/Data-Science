Q:

Is code analyzer supported in ros_buildfarm?

Hi,
I am interested in the "Make ROS package quality visible" work by the Quality Assurance WG.
Is it currently supported to execute code analysis on the ros_buildfarm?
I found some scripts for code analyzer which are noted "deprecated" in the ros-infrastructure repository.
https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/jenkins_scripts/tree/master/code_quality
Then I have checked the wiki page of code_quality and the scripts directory in ros_buildfarm but couldn't find the answer.
http://wiki.ros.org/code_quality
https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/ros_buildfarm/tree/master/scripts
Thanks.

A:

In general we don't add code analyzers / linters to the buildfarm alone since it would make it difficult to reproduce the results locally.
Instead in ROS 2 any kind of linters are integrated on a per-package level. So when you run the tests of a package you also run any kind of linter available (e.g. clang-format, clang-tidy, cppcheck, cpplint, flake8, uncrustify, xmllint). The generally used ones are in this repo: https://github.com/ament/ament_lint All of these produce xUnit compliant result file to be picked up by Jenkins when running the tests in the buildfarm.
For ROS 1 there is no such infrastructure for linters and you would need to integrate each linter manually into each package.

I understood the current policy for ROS 1 infrastructure. Thank you!
