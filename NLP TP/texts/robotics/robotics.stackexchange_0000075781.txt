Q:

rosbag error /clock

Hello ,
I tried to make the rosbag that is refering to tutorial in http://wiki.ros.org/rosbag/Tutorials/Recording%20and%20playing%20back%20data.
But I could't make the bagfile and the error is the following:
use_sim_time set to true and no clock published . Still waiting for valid time.
I set the use_sim_time true , but I could't be successful.
Please help me.

The tutorial says nothing about setting or using the /use_sim_time parameter. Why do you think you need to set it?
Comment by sasadasd on 2016-08-13:
I think that I need to set use_sim_time to true,due to the error mssage "use_sim_time set to true".

It is success by restarting the roscore . Thank you very much !

A:

No; the tool is stating that /use_sim_time is set; not asking you to set it. I suggest you unset /use_sim_time and try the exercise again. (you can also clear all parameters by restarting the roscore)
