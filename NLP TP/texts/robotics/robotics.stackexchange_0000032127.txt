Q:

UDPROS/TCPROS - how to select?

Hello!
I was talking with a friend about ROS and he said me that have had some problems (latency) on communicating nodes using a wireless communication. Reading here I saw that TCP is the default transport used in ROS.
In fact if you are working with wireless communication and use TCP for that you can have some problems because the "nature" of the protocol itself.
So the question is: How do I select/change to UDPROS? Is that choice "global" (affect all topics)?
:D
thanks!

Some of the subscribe() variants let you pass a TransportHints, but how do you use that on the publisher end?
