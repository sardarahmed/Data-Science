Q:

(Groovy | 12.04 | armv7l) Install from Source Desktop

$ wstool init -j8 src h t t p://packages.ros.org/web/rosinstall/generate/raw/groovy/desktop

I am having issues with some packages (flann, opencv2, cv_bridge, image_geometry, collada_parser, camera_info_manager, rqt_image_view, rosbag, diagnostic_analysis, interactive_markers, pcl, urdf, ... will continue adding while I continue...)
I ended up erasing those directories rm -rf src/flann,  rm -rf src/opencv2,... and running
./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install --install-space /opt/ros/groovy

Is there a way to bypass the errors so that it does not make from the beginning and just continue were it left? Also, is there another way to correctly install these?

A:

If you run catkin_make_isolated again, it will kind of continue where it left, since it will not do anything for completed packages.
