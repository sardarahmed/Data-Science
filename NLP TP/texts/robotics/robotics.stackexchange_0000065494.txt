Q:

ROS does not detect packages installed with apt-get

Hello,
I tried to install packages to ROS indigo by running the command: sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-package name
The packages are downloaded and installed but neither roscd nor rosrun can find them, despite sourcing the file setup.bash after the download.
Am I missing a step?
Best Regards

A:

Could be that your cache is (somehow) out-of-date. Try a rospack profile after you've sourced setup.bash.

Thank you so much gvdhoorn!
It worked and ROS can now retrieve the packages installed. All good.
