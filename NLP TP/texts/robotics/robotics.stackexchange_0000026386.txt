Q:

DRCSIM: BDI modes change the hand force/torque sensor behavior

The hand force/torque sensor behaves well until the BDI modes are changed. While in STAND mode the output of the sensor is correct, however, when the mode is changed to MANIPULATE for example, the force/torque sensor start giving a nonsense output.

I was able to duplicate this issue using the control_mode_switch demo, and hacking to use a set of seemingly reasonable kd_position gains and k_effort related to moving arms and torso, but leaving legs under BDI control.  See https://bitbucket.org/osrf/drcsim/issue/273/bdi-modes-change-the-hand-force-torque for specific gains

A:

It was determined that reducing the kd_position gains avoids this problem.
