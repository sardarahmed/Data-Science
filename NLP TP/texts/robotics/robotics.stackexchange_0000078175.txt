Q:

How to change velocity & acceleration in MotionPlanRequest topic

With the newest version of MoveIt! (Indigo 0.7.6), we can nicely scale the velocity and acceleration of trajectory on MoveIt! RViz plugin. Looking at the Time Parameterization tutorial changing them programmatically during runtime seems also possible by changing MotionPlanRequest.msg, but how exactly can we do so?
Now I'm trying to see using NEXTAGE but I don't see that type of topic being published while MoveIt! is running.

A:

It depends on what interface you are using to make the planning request. If you are making the service call yourself, it is trivial to set the max_velocity_scaling_factor and  max_acceleration_scaling_factor manually.
When using the the move_group C++ API, you have a function for the velocity and for the acceleration. These updates factors will then be used for the next planning request.
the moveit_commander move_group interface also has these functions (velocity and acceleration)
Setting the acceleration is quite recent for moveit_commander but I'm pretty sure it is in 0.7.6.

Thanks. set_max_acceleration_scaling_factor is still missing from Indigo, so I opened a PR for it.
