Q:

filtering and republishing topic messages from console

I'm looking for a fast and easy way to republish data of a topic filtered in another new topic. I see that implementing a filter could be an interesting alternative. However it needs too much developing infraestructure (pluginlib, a package, some c++ code, etc.). I wonder if there is something simpler like the rostopic echo tool:

rostopic echo  /topic_name --filter "{predicate}"

It should be something like this:

rostopic dup /input_topic /output_topic --filter "{predicate}" 

In my case I want it to use in combination with rxplot. For instance, reading the tf messages fields filtering by the field: child_frame_id.

A:

Looking at the rostopic documentation, it appears that you can pipe filtered echo data into a rostopic pub command to do what you want:
$ rostopic echo /topic_name --filter "{predicate}" | rostopic pub /output_topic tf/tfMessage

Is it possible to do from the code (i.e. C++)?
