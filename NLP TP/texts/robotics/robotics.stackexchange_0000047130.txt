Q:

Unmet dependencies installing Groovy on Oneiric

I am unable to install Groovy on a fresh install of Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric). I get the following:

Reading state information... Done
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
