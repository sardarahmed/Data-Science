@salma I came across a good electrician and he made a step-down appliance into my irobot adapter/charger ! :-)

A:

I just checked the transformer. It states that you need 22V and at least 1.25A. It should be possible to find a transformer (maybe from a laptop) which can get close enough to 22V and 1.25A should not be a problem either
