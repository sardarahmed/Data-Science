Q:

image_transport/compressed_sub does not exist in android tutorial

Running a camera tutorial app in android_core, I get this error.
$ rosrun image_view image_view image:=camera/image _image_transport:=compressed
[ERROR] [1363589825.051878817]: Failed to load nodelet [/image_view_1363589824626933265] of type [image_view/image]: Unable to load plugin for transport 'compressed', error string:
According to the loaded plugin descriptions the class image_transport/compressed_sub with base class type image_transport::SubscriberPlugin does not exist. Declared types are  image_transport/raw_sub image_transport/theora_sub

Running following command launchs a window without yielding error but nothing is shown on it.
$ rosrun image_view image_view image:=camera/image _image_transport:=raw
$ rosrun image_view image_view image:=camera/image _image_transport:=theora

Several question threads discuss similar error regarding image_view but can't figure out how to work it around (I want to see an image that's taken by the camera on the android phone that's connected via USB. Camera app on android seems to be working fine). Thank you.

A:

Is ros-groovy-image-transport-plugins installed?  Maybe try reinstalling it.
