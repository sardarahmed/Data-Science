@wassimhariri I guess it's pretty late of me askign, but were you able to find a working procedure for multi floor navigation (localization) in indigo or Kinetic? I've seen your other query. I had the same notion as the mongo_DB part is a pretty old stack now.
It would be helpful if you could share your approach in case you were able to get the multi floor navigation working.

A:

Never used none of these personally though:

U-Texas Austin is maintaining multi_level_map package. Seems to be still used for their research as of today.
A bit outdated, there's also multi-floor mapping with drones at U. Penn. Don't know if the code is opensourced.
The famous PR2-get-me-sandwitch-at-Subway-downstairs demo code seems to be opensourced.
