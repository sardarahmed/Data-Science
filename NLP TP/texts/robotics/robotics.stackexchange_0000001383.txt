Q:

Software for robot parts interaction modeling

I'm robotic engineer, using OpenSCAD to model robotic components (gears, pulleys, parts, etc). But I need an application to model the physics and interaction of the components (for i.e. how will robot move if I rotate a given gear).
So, is there any software I can use for modelling interactions in Linux? Google SketchUp is good, but I can't use it in Linux.

A:

Have you considered modeling the robot in a simulator? V-REP is new and quite good, having lots of examples robots from other famous projects. Gazebo is another popular one that is usually used with ROS (although V-REP also has ROS support). Both run on linux and are open-source.
