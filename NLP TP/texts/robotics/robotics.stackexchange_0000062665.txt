Q:

Check on a rostopic programatically?

I've tried searching for this but have been unsuccessful so far.
Is it possible to see a topic's value, programatically?
Basically, I need the functionality of rostopic echo, but I need to add it to my code.
It's a topic that I created myself, so I can't just create a client and call a service...
And I also do not want to subscribe to the topic and create a callback function.
I just want to know the topic's value at a given point in my code.
Is this possible?

A:

In C++, you can use ros::topic::waitForMessage(): http://docs.ros.org/indigo/api/roscpp/html/namespaceros_1_1topic.html
Note that this will be slow, because internally it creates a subscriber, waits for it to connect, waits for the first message, and then removes the subscriber.
