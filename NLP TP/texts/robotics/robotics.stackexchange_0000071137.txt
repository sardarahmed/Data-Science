Q:

Occupancy grid mapping for beginner

Hi,
I am a beginner in the field of localization and mapping for mobile robots and I am a little confused right now.
What am I basically trying to do is to implement some occupancy grid mapping algorithm that uses only data from laser range finder sensor on mobile robot and uses some kind of probabilistic approach.
Trying to find one of those existing algorithms I just feel overwhelmed with information about theory but not actual implementation, which could help me to understand. Especially with all probabilistic models I don't seem to quite understand why it should work or how to imagine it.
Can you suggest any implementations or maybe some articles about this problematic, or maybe some advice?
Thank you

A:

Try understanding the theory, there are many papers out there for different algorithms.
One example package is gmapping  by the University of Freiburg.
On the external documentation are some links to papers regarding this implementation.
