Q:

Micro-Ros: Package 'micro_ros_agent' not found

I am trying to install micro-ROS through the steps provided in this link: https://micro.ros.org/docs/tutorials/core/first_application_linux/
However, when I tried to run Micro-ROS Agent node

ros2 run micro_ros_agent
micro_ros_agent udp4 --port 8888

it gives:

Package 'micro_ros_agent' not found

I believe that the command line (below) supposed to create micro_ros_agent package

ros2 run micro_ros_setup create_agent_ws.sh

but since I have run it previously, it replied:

Repo-file ros2.repos already present,
overwriting! ....

=== ./eProsima/Micro-XRCE-DDS-Agent (git) ===

behind 'origin/foxy' by 1 commit, and

All required rosdeps installed successfully

Could any one point out where is micro_ros_agent package located?
Note:
Workspace microros_ws is overlay from workspace ros2_foxy.
PC details:
OS: Ubuntu 20
ROS Distro: ROS2 Foxy

A:

Make sure that you do:

ros2 run micro_ros_setup create_agent_ws.sh

ros2 run micro_ros_setup build_agent.sh

source install/local_setup.bash

before trying to run the micro-ROS agent.

Thanks @Pablogs, I somehow missed out "ros2 run micro_ros_setup build_agent.sh"
