Q:

ROS Fuerte in Multiple machines

Hello,
In ros fuerte i can't communicate from slave to the master! can someone help-me?
I have in the bash script for master this:
export ROS_IP=192.168.55.112
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.55.112:11311

at the slave the same. In the slave i make rostopic list and i see all publications.
but when i run a node, in the slave pc, that should publish something, the master can't ear anything! (if run the publisher in the master and subscriber in the slave it works, the inverse not!!!!)
If i run the same node in the master everything runs ok! What could be the problem?

A:

The slave should not export its IP to be the same as the master. It should export its own IP.
