Q:

BUG? topic subscription shutdown() fails to shutdown

Hi,
The scenerio is we are trying to do custom kinect calibration and we need both
raw IR and RGB image. The kinect/asus hardware do not support stream ir and
rgb at the same time, so we need to switch back and forth between two topics, or we will get a "can't stream ir and rgb at the same time, stream rgb only now" warning from ros. The problem is I tried sub.shutdown() the rgb topic subscription but still can't add IR topic subscription and get the same warning. I also tried use ros::topic::waitForMessage<sensor_msgs::Image>("/camera/rgb/image_mono", *nodeHandle); which is suppose to subscribe->get a frame of data ->unsubscribe. But I still get the same warning. It seems neither shutdown() nor waitForMessage is able to turn off the subscription to a topic. Is this a bug or I am doing something wrong here? Insights welcomed. Thank you!
Best,
Ranqi

A:

From the documentation of Subscriber.shutdown() it states that it unsubscribes the callback it does not state that it unsubscribes the topic.  You might need to destroy the Subscriber instance.
