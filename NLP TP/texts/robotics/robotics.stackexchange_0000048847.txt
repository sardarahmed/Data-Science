Thanks, I evidently missed that one!

@Hsang91: No luck, same exact error after doing that and rerunning rosmake!

Also I'm not sure if that will solve the errors of the form   /Users/alex/ros_ws/visualization_tutorials/rviz_plugin_tutorials/src/drive_widget.cpp:114:24: error: variable length array of non-POD element type 'QPointF' QPointF right_track[ step_count ];. Thoughts?

Sorry, then I do not know :)

No worries, cheers anyway! Let's see if anyone else has some inspiration. :)

@Hsang91 (and others): Interesting... did you notice that the log has both ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64 (one occurrence) and ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture i386 (one occurrence). How odd...
