Q:

How to update screen after SetWorldPose in Gazebo v1.8.6

I am working on Gazebo v1.8.6 with ROS-Fuerte and PR2.
While I am running my robot, I manipulate some objects using 'gazebo::physics::Entity::SetWorldPose.'
My problem is the following; non-static objects are visually updated correctly after its' position manipulation. However, static objects are not visually updated (its' actual position is changed and there is contact on expected location.)
I can see this kind of situation 9 out of 10 simulations.
Is there any way to force to update screen except 'ConnectWorldUpdateBegin'?
Thanks

it may be related to this issue in gazebo. I've seen it before too, and happens to static models

I am not sure whether it is same or not. But, it looks very similar. I have used Gazebo v1.4.6 and seen this problem. It happens randomly but so much frequently.

A:

I'll mark this question as closed since more recent Gazebo version has this fixed.
