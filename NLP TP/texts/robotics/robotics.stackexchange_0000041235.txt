Q:

Exception AttributeError when starting roscore

I am new to ROS and am going through the tutorials.
I have just attempted to start roscore and am receiving the following error:
*auto-starting new master
Exception AttributeError: AttributeError("'_DummyThread' object has no attribute '_Thread__block'",) in <module 'threading' from '/usr/lib/python2.7/threading.pyc'> ignored
process[master]: started with pid [3719]
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311/
setting /run_id to 897134ae-b183-11e1-9fcb-00269ed0509d
Exception AttributeError: AttributeError("'_DummyThread' object has no attribute '_Thread__block'",) in <module 'threading' from '/usr/lib/python2.7/threading.pyc'> ignored
process[rosout-1]: started with pid [3732]
started core service [/rosout]*

After this last line, it seems that the process hangs. I can input new commands but no output is displayed.
I also ran these commands before running the roscore command:
$ export ROS_HOSTNAME=localhost
$ export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Despite the annoying error message, there is nothing apparently wrong here. Roscore is running, so you need to open another terminal window for other commands to have an immediate effect.

A:

This seems to be the same as this and should be harmless.
