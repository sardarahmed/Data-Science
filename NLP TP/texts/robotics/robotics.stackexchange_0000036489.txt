Q:

move_arm_warehouse package error

How do you you use Arm Navigation Warehouse viewer on Ros electric? I tried to run rosrun move_arm_warehouse create_launch_files.py pr2_test from the Iros2011 motion planning Tutorials and it return this error message: ([rospack] couldn't find package [move_arm_warehouse]). Thanks
