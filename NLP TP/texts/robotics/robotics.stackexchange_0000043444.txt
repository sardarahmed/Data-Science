A:

Gazebo can be run without GUI. Try to write a .world document including the model you need, run roscore, and then rosrun the .world document you have. If you want to use the GUI later, in another terminal run
/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/simulator_gazebo/gazebo/gazebo/bin/gzclient

But, I highly recommend you to buy a Graphics card for gazebo. It will only cost you about $30 to do this.
