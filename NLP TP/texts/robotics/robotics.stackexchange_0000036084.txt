Q:

About geometry_msgs/Twist

Are there any instructions about the meaning of geometry_msgs/Twist elements? e.g. What's the unit of linear and angular, m/s? degree/min? degree/s?

A:

Hi,
These are just msgs in a structured way so that they can be published or subscribed by a node. They are just values. It depends on the node which actually uses them to manipulate robot.
It depends on how you want to use it. For example in teleop_base package the teleop_base_keyboard.cpp takes the msgs from keyboard and uses them as m/sec. If your node takes this msgs as mm/sec then the node execution will be accordingly.
You can know the msg types by the following command.
rosmsg show geometry_msgs/Twist

whose output is
geometry_msgs/Vector3 linear
  float64 x
  float64 y
  float64 z
geometry_msgs/Vector3 angular
  float64 x
  float64 y
  float64 z

Hope this helps, Karthik
