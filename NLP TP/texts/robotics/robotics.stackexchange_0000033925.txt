Q:

Rviz bug: transform from the same frame does not exist

Hi,
I am getting a weird error from rviz when trying to show Laser Scan:
Transform [sender=/kinectFRMI] For frame [/openi_depth_frame]: Frame [/openi_depth_frame] does not exist

It is the same frame why needing a tf ?
I am trying to get fake laser scan from the point cloud /camera/rgb/points. And I wrote the node inspired from pointcloud_to_laserscan.
The topic  /camera/rgb/points is publishing normally.
Thank you,

Can you confirm that both your fixed frame and target frame are set to /openi_depth_frame (target frame could be set to fixed frame and it should work if the fixed frame is correct)? Also, double check for a misspelling since the default is openni_depth_frame if I recall correctly.

A:

Is this just a typo openni vs openi ?
