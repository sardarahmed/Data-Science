Q:

How can I find the appropriate robot footprint?

Hello all, I'm starting out in ROS and trying to set up my nav stack correctly. I'm trying to figure out on how to specify my robot's footprint and request some help. Thank you :D

A:

If you want to set up the footprint of a "non-comercial" robot (DIY) you should write down the coordinates on the common costmaps yaml.
I have a rectangular sized robot with the base_link frame at the center of that rectangle, so I have 4 coordinates written in counterclockwise direction.
So, for example, if I have something like this:

My footprint should be: [[-10, -20], [10, -20], [10, 20], [-10,20]].
Hope this can help you!

For move_base, these values should be in units of meters. @Ronro Your example shows a very, very large robot.

Yeah! You are completely right! The correct footprint should be: [[-0.1, -0.2], [0.1, -0.2], [0.1, 0.2], [-0.1, 0.2]]
Massive thanks, buddy! @MikeScheutzow
