Q:

how to delay escalation to sig-term after sending sig-int to roslaunch

When I control-c a roslaunch command, each node is terminated first with sig-ints.  If the node fails to die after 10 seconds, sig-int is escalated to sig-term.  Is there a way to stop or delay this escalation from happening?
This is useful when debugging examples like this one.

A:

Right now this delay is not configurable, so changing this behavior means editing pmon.py in roslaunch directly.  It would be a good future enhancement to make roslaunch more configurable.

looks like that's nodeprocess.py rather than pymon.py.

pmon.py will work for now.  Thanks.
