Q:

[roslibjs,rosbridgesuite] How to get data back from the robot in turtleSim

According to the roslibjs documentation, we should be able to get the data back from the robot by using a listener:
// Publish the Topic
var cmdVel = new ROSLIB.Topic({
    ros: ros,
    name: '/turtle1/cmd_vel',
    messageType: 'geometry_msgs/Twist'
});

// Subscribe to the Topic
var listener = new ROSLIB.Topic({
    ros: ros,
    name: '/listener',
    messageType: 'std_msgs/String'
});

listener.subscribe(function (message) {
    console.log("Recieved Message on: " + listener.name + ": " + message.data);
});

However, when I tried to use this, there was a compilation error that said property 'data does not exist on type 'message'.
I really need to get the turtle-robot data back to my web browser, any help with this matter would be highly appreciated.
Many thanks!

Could you please use the Preformatted Text button next time when copy-pasting console text, source code, etc? It's the one with 101010 on it. That will make things much easier to read.
Thanks.

@gvdhoorn will do!

A:

I was using Typescript, so I had to do add the following to the Typings file:
data:{
    ros: Ros,
    name: string,
    serviceType: string
}
