Q:

can't communicate with rosmaster on other machine

Hello everyone,
I have two machines in the same local wifi network.
On the machine with the roscore I have set
- ROS_MASTER_URI: http://<own_ip>:11311
- ROS_IP: <own_ip>
- ROS_HOSTNAME: <own_ip> (I know I don't need this one, I just tested it. Also the machines hostname is just localhost.localdomain so I don't know if I can use thatvalue)

On the other machine I have set
- ROS_MASTER_URI: http://<ip_machine_with_master>:11311
- ROS_IP: <own_ip>
- ROS_HOSTNAME: <own_ip>

If I start a roscore and then try rostopic list on the other machine I don't get the error "ERROR: unable to connect to Master!" but the terminal just shows empty space after the command. If I run the command on the machine with the roscore I get displayed that /rosout and /rosout_agg are there.
Also I played a rosbag from the other machine which should publish a couple of topics but they also don't arrive at the master.
Could it be a problem that the machines are running different versions of ros? The master uses melodic and the other machine noetic.
Any ideas what could be going wrong here? Thanks in advance.

First thing to check: firewall active on any of the involved machines.

A:

Thanks to gvdhoorn I checked the firewall. As it is a device borrowed from work it has a very strict firewall indeed which should be my problem. I switchd to running everything on one machine in the end as I did not have the rights to change something about the firewall.e
