Q:

Long while loop might crash ros::Rate.sleep()?

 ros::Rate loop_rate(8);     // 8Hz while(ros::ok()) { Kalman_Filter.filter_control();       ros::spin_once(); loop_rate.sleep();              }
The function Kalman_Filter.filter_control() is a state machine and one state runs on 1Hz, while the rest of the code runs on 8Hz. Will this crash loop_rate.sleep()?

A:

No (or at least: not because the code takes too long, there could still be other problems with it of course).
It will just mean that loop_rate.sleep() will return immediately after the "one state [that] runs on 1Hz" has finished, as there is no more time to sleep.

The function Kalman_Filter.filter_control() is a state machine and one state runs on 1Hz, while the rest of the code runs on 8Hz. Will this crash loop_rate.sleep()?

What makes you wonder whether it will crash? Also: what is a crash for you?
