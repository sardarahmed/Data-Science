Q:

How to get /fix on NMEA data emitted on a TCP port

I have a process emitting NMEA packets, similar to what gpsd does, on a TCP  port . How do I use gspd_client on this port so that I can get the fix and extended_fix rostopics? Is there any other way to get a /fix quickly?

So it's a UDP or TCP port? Or is it a serial port?

Were you able to find how to do it? I am also struck with the same problem?

found it under tcp feed section in gpsd webpage

A:

The gpsd_client node uses the gps structure defined in <libgpsmm.h>, which (in the version of gpsd I'm using: gpsd3.3) uses QTcpSocket to connect to gpsd. I haven't read through the code very extensively, but it seems that if you set the ROS parameters for host and port in the gpsd_client node, it should try to connect to your TCP socket.
rosrun gpsd_client gpsd_client _host:=YOUR_HOST _port:=YOUR_PORT

Just to be clear, I have not tested this. My answer is based off of a quick read-through of the source code.

Not quite! GPSD_Client needs a gpsd process running on the port. Otherwise it just quits
