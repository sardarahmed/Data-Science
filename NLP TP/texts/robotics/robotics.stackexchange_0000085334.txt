Q:

Forward /dev/input/js0 from control station to robot

Hi,
I am forwarding joystick events from a control station to an on-board computer running ROS.
Is there a way for me to write the events to a file similar to the /dev/input/js0 file so that ROS Joy can utilize it?
If so, what format must I make the contents of the file?

May I suggest a title change? Your current question title suggests a completely off-topic question, but the body text actually asks about how to either make joy_node open a 'remote' joystick, or how to provide joy_node with data coming from a remote location.

yes: keep the binary format that you read from /dev/input/js0 and use something like uinput to inject it into the kernel of your control station. Alernatively use socat (or a similar tool) to pipe /dev/input/js0 (on your control station) to a socket on your on-board PC (similar to this). Then have joy open that socket instead of an actual device.
Other than that I would say you have two options:

publish Joy msgs on your control station and subscribe those on your on-board pc
use a custom node running on your on-board pc, that, through a custom protocol, gets joystick event data and then publishes it as Joy msgs there
