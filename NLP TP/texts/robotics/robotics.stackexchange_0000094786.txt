Q:

Undefined reference to rosidl_typesupport_c__get_message_type support_handle__std_msgs__msg__Int32

Hi,
I am compiling micro-ROS crystal version and want to run the publisher demo for Int32. However, I get the following error:
undefined reference to `rosidl_typesupport_c__get_message_type_support_handle__std_msgs__msg__Int32'

I think this function should be defined somewhere but it seems that it has not been defined. Would you please tell me in which library I should find this function?
Thanks

You may want to post this as an issue on the appropriate micro-ros issue tracker. The intersection between micro-ros developers/users and ROS Answers frequenters is probably not very big, so it may take quite some time before you get a response here.

Thanks @gvdhoorn, but since this problem is related to the ROS typesupport which is shared between normal ROS2 and microROS, I decided to post my question here :)

@gvdhoorn I would highly recommend the micro-ros developers to watch answers.ros.org and specifically the micro-ROS tag.

@saeid-dehnavi I have add the micro-ROS tag to your question since the problem happens when you compile micro-ROS.

Couldn't agree more, but I'm not one of them. Nor do I talk to them often.

A:

The symbol should be in install/lib/libstd_msgs__rosidl_typesupport_c.so for humble.
$ nm install/lib/libstd_msgs__rosidl_typesupport_c.so | grep rosidl_typesupport_c__get_message_type_support_handle__std_msgs__msg__Int32
00000000000044fc T rosidl_typesupport_c__get_message_type_support_handle__std_msgs__msg__Int32
000000000000454b T rosidl_typesupport_c__get_message_type_support_handle__std_msgs__msg__Int32MultiArray
