Q:

undefined reference to tf::poseMsgToEigen

I'm on Ubuntu 14.04 with ROS Indigo.
Inside a service callback, I want to convert a geometry_msgs::Pose to Eigen::Affine3d. I'm trying to use tf::poseMsgToEigen.
My includes are as follows:
#include <tf/tf.h>
#include <tf_conversions/tf_eigen.h>
#include <eigen_conversions/eigen_msg.h>
#include <geometry_msgs/Pose.h>

The relevant part of code is:
geometry_msgs::Pose pose;
Eigen::Affine3d transform;  
tf::poseMsgToEigen(pose, transform);

I get the following error:
undefined reference to `tf::poseMsgToEigen(geometry_msgs::Pose_<std::allocator<void> > const&, Eigen::Transform<double, 3, 2, 0>&)'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

Inside my CMakeLists.txt I have
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
  std_msgs
  geometry_msgs
  tf
  tf_conversions
)

and in the package.xml I have added the build and exec_depends for the same.
Thanks a lot in advance for your help.

Are you maybe missing eigen conversion?
Comment by dhindhimathai on 2018-07-26:
@destogl I already included it: #include <eigen_conversions/eigen_msg.h>. Do I have to include it anywhere else?

I was missing tf_conversions and had similar error.

A:

Sorry guys, I was missing eigen_conversions inside find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS ) in my CMakeLists.txt.
Thanks to @destogl for the hint.
