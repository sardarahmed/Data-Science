Q:

Determining position from a 2D map and LIDAR

We need to determine the 2D position of my robot. To do so, we have a LIDAR at a known high, with an horizontal plane, which gives us the distance to the nearest point for each angular degree (so 360 points for one rotation). The environment is known, so I have a map of the position of every object that the LIDAR is susceptible to hit.
My question is, based on the scatter plot that the LIDAR is returning, how can we retrieve the position of my robot in the map ? We would need the x, y position in the map frame and also the theta angle from the map frame to my robot frame.
We have tried to match objects on map with groups of points based on their distance between each other and by identifying those objects and the way the LIDAR "sees" them to retrieve the robot position. But it is still unsuccessful.
To put it in a nutshell, we want to make SLAM without the mapping part. How is it possible, and with what kind of algorithms ?
A first step could be to stop the robot while acquiring data if it seems easier to process.

A:

Your problem is called localization. A simple approach would be to use a point set registration algorithm such as ICP with a map represented as a point cloud, where the real-world position of every point is known. To localize, you would then run the point set registration algorithm to find the best match for the LIDAR scan you just acquired in the map. The algorithm will return a 2D transform that will give you the position and orientation of your robot (strictly speaking your lidar, assuming it is at the origin of your point cloud).
