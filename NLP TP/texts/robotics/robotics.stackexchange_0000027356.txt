Q:

Mesh Scale Huge for .stl file

Hello, having a problem where the meshes which i'm importing to my URDF file are absolutely huge. The dimensions are correct in solidworks (around 400mm cube). I tried changing the units of the part back to meters as i was working in mm and this had no effect. Any idea what i'm doing wrong?

It would help if you're able to share your STL and URDF files. You can just update the question.

I dont really know what was causing this, maybe the fact that the solidworks model was developed in mm rather than m, i ended up just using a scaling tag and setting the three parameters to 0.001 and it imported fine

A:

It seems that there isn't a way to specify units in STL files. So whatever unit you use will be treated as meters by Gazebo. That's why your 400 mm cube came out as a 400 m cube.
Your solution seems to be the easiest one, to specify a scaling factor for the mesh on SDF, from mm to m for example:
<mesh>
  <uri>model://model_name/meshes/your_mesh.stl</uri>
  <scale>0.001 0.001 0.001</scale>
</mesh>

An alternative would be to rescale the mesh with an external editor.

That worked for me. just remember to write it down under every  part of the world code.
Thank you!
