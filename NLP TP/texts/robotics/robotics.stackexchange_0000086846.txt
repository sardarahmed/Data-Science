Q:

How to use a Arduino Due in a CMake-based package using rosserial-arduino?

I prefer using the CMake-based approach for packages using rosserial-arduino as not requiring the Arduino IDE has quite a few advantages. For the older Arduino boards, specifying the board type is as simple as typing it somewhere in the CMakeLists.txt, e.g. (example from here):
generate_arduino_firmware(controller
  SRCS controller.cpp ../lib/AFMotor.cpp ${ROS_LIB_DIR}/time.cpp
  BOARD uno
  PORT /dev/ttyUSB0
)

It appears to be a bit more complicated for the Due however, as that one is special and not a "classical" avr device (see location-of-boards-txt-for-an-arduino-due-sam-board on stackoverflow for instance).
My question is: Is it possible to "painlessly" compile and flash firmware for the Due using a CMake setup, or is it required to manually copy and setup the boards.txt for that one somewhere?

Just found http://answers.ros.org/question/225519/arduino-due-cmake-with-rosserial_arduino/ ,which pretty much is the same question, but asked 2 years ago. No really useful answer, though.

A:

I opened an issue on the rosserial github regarding this (see rosserial #370). Unfortunately, at this point in time, the Due is not supported. Adding it would mean integrating a newer fork of arduino-cmake.
