Q:

AR tag tracked, but overlapping with Pointgrey camera

I have a blackfly GigE camera and I want to use it to track a tag. Now the problem is I can detect the tag, but the tag frame is overlap with the camera frame. Does any body have any idea? Thank you!

A:

Using output_frame you should specify the frame that the output cartesian frame is relative to. Detail can be found on the package's wiki doc where you can also find the concrete example launch files.
