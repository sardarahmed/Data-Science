Q:

Segmentation fault, stopping uvc camera driver

Hi All,
I have an extra logitech QuickCam Messenger VGA Webcam. When I simply try to run it with uvc_cam, it give me a error "Segmentation fault, stopping uvc camera driver.
[ERROR] [1351517497.937394454]: Segmentation fault, stopping uvc camera driver.
[uvc_cam_node-1] process has died [pid 7268, exit code -11].
log files: /home/btian/.ros/log/916ac8ea-21c8-11e2-9c54-002710a9471c/uvc_cam_node-1*.log"
The integrated cam of my laptop works fine with the uvc_cam. I installed guvcview, and it can switch between the two cameras without any problem. I tried the logitech webcam on another PC, same error. What should I do with the uvc_cam? Thanks!
Tian

A:

Recently I have encountered this problem again. Thanks to http://answers.ros.org/question/9089/what-driver-should-i-use-for-my-usb-camera/, an old post, I have tried some other drivers. Finally I found that gscam gscam is very universal. It supports my 8 years old logitech quickcam and Philips SPC900, which is a very popular camera for robotic fans. Both of the cameras are with c-mount, easily change to wide angle lens.
