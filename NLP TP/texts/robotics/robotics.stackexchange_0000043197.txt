Q:

Communicate with different Client Libraries

Hi All.
now, I understand concept of node.
this page shows that below.
ROS client libraries allow nodes written in different programming languages to communicate:

rospy = python client library
roscpp = c++ client library

And, rosjava uses node also.
So I think rosjava node communicate with roscpp node.
Is It right?
I cannot see the tutorial that communicate with rosjava and roscpp.. TT

A:

All languages have tutorials using similar topic publisher and subscribers, service providers and client. So you can start the talker node from a rosjava tutorial and use it with a listener node from a c++ tutorial.
