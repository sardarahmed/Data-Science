Q:

arm_navigation : planner_service_name v.s. planner_id

The former one belongs to
arm_navigation_msgs::action_goal.planner_service_name

The latter one belongs to
arm_navigation_msgs::action_goal.motion_plan_request.planner_id

According to the following tutorial:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/move_arm/Tutorials/MoveArmJointGoal

The planner_id is different from the planner_service_name since some planning libraries might offer different types of planners within the same service call
Then I would like to ask what is the planner_id for the default ompl planner? Where is it specified(from which file or parameter)?
Thanks for any help

interesting question. in the planning configuration yaml file we can fill in several planners. i guess these ids are corresponding to those planners there and maybe increase from 0 monotonously

What and where is that yaml config file? Thanks~

A:

Here you find some example planner configurations:
http://ros.org/doc/fuerte/api/planning_environment/html/ (scroll down a bit)
And here in the source code you can find the currently available planners via the OMPL ROS interface (look at the private member functions):
http://ros.org/doc/fuerte/api/ompl_ros_interface/html/classompl__ros__interface_1_1OmplRosPlanningGroup.html
Further than that I have been successfully using the CHOMP planner, which is not part of OMPL.
/edit:
Albert, regarding your comment:
My planner configuration was created automatically by the planning description configuration wizard. The created configuration file looks similar to this one for the pr2.
I'm loading those parameters like this:
  <node pkg="ompl_ros_interface" type="ompl_ros" name="ompl_planning">
        <param name="default_planner_config" type="string" value="SBLkConfig1" />
        <rosparam command="load" file="$(find your_robots_arm_navigation_pkg)/config/ompl_planning.yaml" />
  </node>

Hope this helps!

I've read the pages, thanks. Besides, I tried to find the yaml file in the planning_environment package , and inspected the launch file pr2_3dnav/right_arm_navigation.launch and the launch file included by it, but I couldn't find the rosparam tag that included the correct yaml.
