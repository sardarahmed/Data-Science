Q:

openni_camera.openni_node.launch won't start

Hi,
On the beginning a list of similar, but slightly different issues:
Issue1, Issue2, Issue3
I've installed Diamondback variant mobile from source a couple of days ago. Then I added image_transport, vision_opencv, perception_pcl_addons and ni. Everything compiled fine. After building openni_camera I tried to run roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch, but unfortunately the kinect node got killed everytime I tried this as I also documented here, as I thought this might be related.
Then I saw there is also a openni_kinect stack which includes openni_camera, so I downloaded and compiled this one instead of ni (and deleted ni). Unfortunately the whole thing is still not working, but the output is slightly different:
process[openni_node1-2]: started with pid [3221]
process[kinect_base_link-3]: started with pid [3226]
process[kinect_base_link1-4]: started with pid [3227]
process[kinect_base_link2-5]: started with pid [3236]
process[kinect_base_link3-6]: started with pid [3247]

My udev rules are set as said in Wiki:
ATTRS{idProduct}=="0200",ATTRS{idVendor}=="1d27",MODE="666",GROUP="video"
ATTRS{idProduct}=="0300",ATTRS{idVendor}=="1d27",MODE="666",GROUP="video"
ATTRS{idProduct}=="0400",ATTRS{idVendor}=="1d27",MODE="666",GROUP="video"
ATTRS{idProduct}=="0500",ATTRS{idVendor}=="1d27",MODE="666",GROUP="video"
ATTRS{idProduct}=="0600",ATTRS{idVendor}=="1d27",MODE="666",GROUP="video"
ATTRS{idProduct}=="02ae",ATTRS{idVendor}=="045e",MODE="666",GROUP="video"
ATTRS{idProduct}=="02ad",ATTRS{idVendor}=="045e",MODE="666",GROUP="video"
ATTRS{idProduct}=="02b0",ATTRS{idVendor}=="045e",MODE="666",GROUP="video"

Any clues? Before I reinsalled ROS a couple days ago, everything run smoothly.
Regards, Tom

What platform are you running on? OS, hardware, etc?

A:

The problem was my machine doesn't have SSE3 support. The solution to the problem can be found here.
