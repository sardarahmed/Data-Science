Q:

There is some error messages like this when starting.
$roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch

Looks like two different problems. Let's start with socket error. This can happen if driver is already running. What happen if you roslaunch minimal.launch just after startup? Can you also verify that ros is nor running before?  (execute sudo killall ros)

@jorge : thanks.why dont we have command like "sudo service turtlebot stop" in groovy instead of kill all?
Comment by jorge on 2013-03-27:
normally you don't need it. Ctrl+C should do the job, unless you launched ros automatically at startup
Comment by jorge on 2013-03-29:
All the errors disappeared? I would have said that there're something more wrong...
Comment by CarolineQ on 2013-04-02:
I have the same problem than your second one (Sevice call failed for the nodelet) when I launch minimal.launch. But it doesn't appear each time. Sometimes it starts well but most of the time I got the error... Did you solve it ? Thanks
Comment by jorge on 2013-04-02:
Maybe is related with the laptop you use; what's the model?
Comment by CarolineQ on 2013-04-02:
@jorge, the laptop I am using is an Asus Eee PC, why do you think it can be related to this ?
Comment by hiranya on 2013-04-03:
@jorge I manage to run applications except android panorama app(desktop one is working).Do you have any idea?  @CarolineQ please upgrade the broken Linux packages of your laptop(turtlebot) then build turtlebot applications by source. then you can run the applications.
Comment by jorge on 2013-04-08:
@hiranya what's wrong with panorama? Can you run it without the Android front-end (roslaunch turtlebot_panorama panorama.launch)? Maybe can be the issue of another ROS answer.

A:

Answer second problem: If you installed by USB(pre-oders turtlebot usb have this broken packages) you can upgrade the broken packages. you can check that from synaptic manager and select all the broken packages and upgrade it. Then you can download turtlebot-apps(kobuki_desktop turtlebot turtlebot_apps turtlebot_viz) source then build.
make sure you have created udev rule
kobuki's udev rules
. /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash
rosrun kobuki_ftdi create_udev_rules

you can run the applications except android panorama.

I don't have any broken package in the synaptic manager...
Comment by hiranya on 2013-04-03:
Did you try to build from source and run apps?
Comment by mkeenan on 2014-03-30:
I'm having the same issue. Was there ever a solution? The Kobuki just stopped communicating all of the sudden.
