A:

The tutorial for ROS Noetic has not been updated to use manipulator with waffle. Last update was melodic. Having said that if you install from source using melodic instructions it should work. Here is my suggested installation:
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
$ git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_manipulation.git
$ git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_manipulation_simulations.git
$ git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/open_manipulator_dependencies.git
$ sudo apt install ros-noetic-ros-control* && ros-noetic-control* && ros-noetic-moveit*
$ cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make
$ echo 'source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash' >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc

To test:
$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle_pi
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_manipulation_gazebo turtlebot3_manipulation_gazebo.launch

It works :)
