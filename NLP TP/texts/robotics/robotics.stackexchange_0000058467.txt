Q:

brics_actuator/JointPositions

Hi,
I try to launch command : "rostopic pub -1 /vrep/position_command  brics_actuator/JointPositions '{positions: [{joint_uri: arm_joint_1, unit: rad, value: 2.9}]}' "
but there is this error :

ERROR: invalid message type:
brics_actuator/JointPositions. If this
is a valid message type, perhaps you
need to type 'rosmake brics_actuator'
