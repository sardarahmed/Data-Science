Q:

What is the next ROS distribution?

Currently, the most recent distribution is Melodic. In keeping with the release schedule, a new version should come out in about a month. Has any information about the next distribution been released? I can't find so much as a name, much less potential changes or a release date.

A:

Discussion and updates about upcoming ROS releases happens on the ROS discourse server.
The next ROS release will be Noetic Ninjemys: https://discourse.ros.org/t/ros-melodic-morenia-release/4871 (name announced as part of the Melodic release announcement).
It looks like there has been some discussion around planning the Noetic release, but it does not look very active: https://discourse.ros.org/t/planning-future-ros-1-distribution-s/6538 . I think most of OSRF's energy is focused on ROS2 at the moment.

A key part in this answers is linked to from the Noetic discussion: https://discourse.ros.org/t/proposed-changes-to-the-ros-releases/4736. Specifically, the decision to only make ROS releases on Ubuntu LTS releases was made, so Noetic will be on the next Ubuntu LTS, 20.04.
