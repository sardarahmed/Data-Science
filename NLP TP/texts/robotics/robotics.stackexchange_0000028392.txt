Q:

Animated Human model (actor) ROS Kinetic, gazebo7

Dear all,
I am new with Gazebo. I need to simulated an animated human model (something like the actor model for Gazebo8.0) but unfortunately Ros Kinetic works with Gazebo7 which does not support actors.
I want to know do you have any idea how I can import an animated human model (where I can follow his/her legs with LaserScan)?
Thanks a lot

How about using ROS Kinetic with Gazebo 8? See this tutorial:

Thanks a lot for your suggestion. we have already tried that. Our simulation is too much depended on Gazebo 7 and changing to 8 leads to an enormous adaptation work... this is why I search a solution that I can insert an actor in Gazebo7

Unfortunately, the last I checked, actors weren't working properly on Gazebo 7, so I think that would require patch to Gazebo.
