Q:

integrating a c# dll in ROS

I am forced to integrate a .NET assembly in a ROS node (kinetic).
I have tested the .NET assembly with mono and it works just fine.
What are my chances of creating a succesful ROS node purely in C#?
For example, I would need to subscribe to a topic for receiving image data.
Or would you recommend to wrap the .NET assembly in c++ and use c++ for ROS integration?
I have never done any of the two...

A:

I have decided to wrap the dot net assembly in c++.
After a look at how to embed mono in a c++ application it does not look that difficult. I expect the .NET dll to be quite static and the interface to be quite limited.
So there is no need to involve C# in accessing the ROS API, for example worry about how ROS messages are parsed and generated.
