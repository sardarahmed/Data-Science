Q:

Connections on a Baby Orangutang B-328 board

I am new to robotics and planning my first purchase.
I'm looking at the Baby Orangutang B-328. Here is information about the microcontroller: http://www.hobbytronics.co.uk/baby-orangutan-328.
The pin headers come unmounted, so you have to do the soldering yourself. My problem is that I don't know what the pin connections are for. Here is a picture of the board:

Could someone briefly tell me what the different connections are for, or link a website that does?

A:

Look at the bottom of the page on your first link:  http://www.hobbytronics.co.uk/baby-orangutan-328. under "Documents relating to the Baby Orangutan B-328".
There you will find links to the Baby Orangutan B Users Guide as well as other useful links.
The user's guide contains the pin descriptions you need on page 5.
