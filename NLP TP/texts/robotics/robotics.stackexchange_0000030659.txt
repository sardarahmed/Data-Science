Q:

Communicating between ROS and non-ROS (LabView) via TCP/IP

Hello,
In our project we're using ROS running on a fit-pc for high-level and NI-sRIO and other NI components for low-level. We need to pass some signals between high-level and low-level.
LabView can read signals from an IP-address, but I can't figure out how to use ROS to simply dump data to a specific port. Can anyone help on this?
As far as I understand, the ROSTCP simply allows connecting different CPUs running ROS very easily, but is not meant for communicating between ROS and non-ROS hardware via TCP/IP.
Thanks in advance.

A:

ROSTCP is not intended to be used outside of the ROS architecture, as far as I know.  So, I think that you would have to implement some minimum bit of a ROS client library in order to use ROS with labview.  You probably want to read up on a few things:

Implementing Client Libraries - a good overview of what a client library MUST and SHOULD do in order to operate.
ROS Technical Overiew - A concept of operations for ROS
TCPROS - The transport layer for messages and services in ROS.

You may also be able to take a look at the Orocos toolchain code to get an idea of how to build a "relay" node of sorts.
I have briefly investigated actually implementing some portion of a client library on LabVIEW, but it seemed that it would be a significant undertaking with little actual gain.  If you are primarily interested in creating GUIs and control panels, most of that is successfully handled in ROS already, or easily implemented in something like QT or MatPlotLib.
