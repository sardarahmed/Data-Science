[rospack] opendir error [No such file or directory] while crawling /home/camilla/ros_workspace
What kind of error is this?
Because it appears on the shell but then my node is executed correctly.

A:

It probably means $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH is not set correctly in your shell. Or, maybe your ros_workspace directory does not exist.
What do these commands return?
$ echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
$ ls ~/ros_workspace
