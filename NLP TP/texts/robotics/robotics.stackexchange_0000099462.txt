Q:

How to run Autoware in the Server

Hi,
I would like to kindly ask whether Autoware.Auto is suitable to be ran on the server. We would like to have a Software-in-the-Loop simulation in the end. However, we met some problems as follows:

Two instances cannot stay
simultaneously in the same ade
environment. I think this is the
limitation of ade right? So is it
better to run the Autoware.Auto
locally using our own ade and then
checkout project if there are any
updates? Or do you have any
suggestions for project management
for Autoware.Auto?

We try to run the LGSVL simulator on the server per remote desktop but
failed (aborted (core dumped)). We
figure out that we would have to
have a remote desktop session that
could access the GPU of the server.
Does anyone know a possible solution
for this?

A:

When you say 2 instances - do you mean 2 instances of Autoware.Auto? If yes, they can perfectly run inside ade. https://ade-cli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ is nothing but just a thin wrapper for easier management of docker images and volumes. As such you can run inside ade anything that you can also run inside the docker container. The way you install Autoware.Auto is either via ade or without the ade, see: https://autowarefoundation.gitlab.io/autoware.auto/AutowareAuto/installation.html. The advantage of using ade is that you can very easily come back to the reproducible environment. Which is more difficult if you develop directly on the host.

Or do you have any suggestions for project management for Autoware.Auto?

I am not 100% sure what you mean by the project management. Some possible answers:

I am not sure what exactly the problem is with your setup. More information would help here. Our problem with the LGSVL simulator is actually this one https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/issues/1403.

Thanks a lot for your reply.
Two instances mean that two users are using the same ade environment at one server simultaneously. When the second user enters the 'ade', the first one is forced to quit automatically now.
