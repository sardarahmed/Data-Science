Q:

catkin build configuration options

Is there a way to define the default behaviour of catkin_make with a .cmake-file or such?
For example, I would need to disable some platform-specific ROS-packages included in a repository. Or, toggle CUDA or some other optional library. The problem I'm facing is that catkin includes all subdirectories in the workspace, so I can't make my own CMake macro which would set(ENABLE_CUDA) or set(BUILD_ANALYSIS_TOOLS), and then add_subdirectory() if this is set.
To give some idea what would be nice to have, OpenCV does its build options very nicely (from line 155):

A:

OpenCV is a single project so it's not really comparable to a system which builds groups of projects. You can certainly add options to individual CMake projects, but you'd have to pass options to each of them.
As for controlling which packages get built in a catkin workspace, you can use CATKIN_IGNORE files to prevent certain packages from getting processed by catkin_make. Or you can use the CATKIN_BLACKLIST_PACKAGES variable to blacklist certain packages, see: http://answers.ros.org/question/54181/how-to-exclude-one-package-from-the-catkin_make-build/
You get more control with the upcoming tools provided by the catkin_tools project, but it's got some problems that we're still working out before it's ready for prime time:
