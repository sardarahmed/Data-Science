Q:

Object slips out of gripper | Gazebo 7 | UR5 | Robotiq 3 finger

Hello,
We want to manipulate some simple objects in Gazebo 7 using UR5 and Robotiq 3 finger gripper. We are using ROS indigo on Ubuntu 14.04.
The object slips out of the gripper every time. Sample video: https://youtu.be/-YixCumWrt0
We have tried changing the mu1, mu2, kp, kd values of the gripper and the object. But no luck. We are using the Robotiq package from DRCSIM.
Have anyone faced similar issues? We will greatly appreciate a quick solution!

A:

Here is an example tube that has been used in grasping tasks:

In your world file, you can try this physics parameters:
<physics type="ode">
      <gravity>0.000000 0.000000 -9.810000</gravity>
      <ode>
        <solver>
          <type>quick</type>
          <iters>100</iters>
          <precon_iters>0</precon_iters>
          <sor>1.000000</sor>
        </solver>
        <constraints>
          <cfm>0.000000</cfm>
          <erp>0.500000</erp>
          <contact_max_correcting_vel>1000.000000</contact_max_correcting_vel>
          <contact_surface_layer>0.00000</contact_surface_layer>
        </constraints>
      </ode>
</physics>

Additionally:

Check the interia value of your tube. You can visualize the inertia in the GUI.
Try turning on collision visualizations, and see if the contacts are being created as you might expect.
What type of control for the hand are you using, position or torque?
