Q:

Using robot_pose_ekf in gazebo simulation

Hi everyone,
Now, I'm trying to use /robot_pose_ekf to publish the transform from odom -> base_footprint in gazebo simulation.
The tf tree tells me that the broadcaster of odom -> base_footprint is /gazebo, but I want it to be /robot_pose_ekf.
So I think the point to this question is how to prevent gazebo publishing the transform of odom -> base_footprint and let /robot_pose_ekf send the transform to /tf.
Actually, the tf tree shows both /gazebo and /robot_pose_ekf are connected to /tf, while /tf are using the transform of gazebo instead of /robot_pose_ekf, too bad :(
Any advice is welcome. Thanks in advance!
