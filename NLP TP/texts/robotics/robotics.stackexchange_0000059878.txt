Q:

pass laser scan to move_base

Hi, all,
I am calling move_base to navigate my robot, by calling "rosrun move_base move_base _global_costmap/global_frame:=world".
move_base Diagram
But I could not find the parameter to define the laser_scan input topic and odometry topic. How do I pass these two parameters? I scan thru move_base.cpp, but cannot find any clue.
all comment appreciated!
thanks
Ray

hi, i only have done this in groovy, but take a look at http://wiki.ros.org/costmap_2d#costmap_2d.2BAC8-flat.Parameters, you can pass the laser scan topic as a observation_source to the costmap, which move_base is using.

A:

I would heartily recommend using a launch file to set the parameters for move_base. There are many parameters, and trying to do it all via the command line will be too complicated. I would start with the tutorials listed here: http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials
