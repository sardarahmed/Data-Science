Q:

gazebo_ros_control plugin is waiting for model URDF in parameter [/robot_description] on the ROS param server

Hi guys,
trying to simulate a kuka iiwa in gazebo11 with Ubuntu 20 and ROS noetic. I get the following output after I
roslaunch iiwa_gazebo iiwa.launch

So it never loads the gazebo_ros plugin. I can't figure out why.
These are the contents of the log file:

I have attached the
launch file C:\fakepath\iiwa.launch and
sdf file C:\fakepath\iiwa7_no_collision.sdf
If anyone can help, it would be much appreciated :)
Thank you guys so much!

A:

matching
<param name 

in the launch file with the
<robotParam>

in the .sdf worked! hehe :)
