Q:

Bebop 2 camera can not be operated!

I could not operate on the "camera_control" topic and used the "joint_states" topic, but I could not do it anymore.
If someone knows how to operate the camera with bebop_autonomy, please teach.

Thank you for your reply.
The problem has already been solved, so it's okay.
I'm sorry for confusing you.

Can you please add as an answer what you did to solve your problem?

A:

rostopic pub /bebop/camera_control geometry_msgs/Twist -r 50 -- '[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]' '[0.0, 1.0, 0.0]'
I typed it in the terminal like this, but it worked only a little.
When I changed the numerical value of angular_y greatly, the camera moved greatly.
rostopic pub /bebop/camera_control geometry_msgs/Twist -r 50 -- '[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]' '[0.0, -90.0, 0.0]'

By entering like this, the camera turned directly beneath.
I did not understand the operation on the joint_states topic.
