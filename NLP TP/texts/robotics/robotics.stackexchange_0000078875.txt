Q:

ROS-Industrial support for Kinetic

I was a little bit shocked when I saw that the ROS-I installation page suggests installation with/on Hydro: http://wiki.ros.org/Industrial/Install.
Now, does anyone have experience with ROS-I running with Kinetic?
Through how much pain would I need to go through?

A:

This is a 'known issue': ros-industrial/ros_industrial_issues#40. The tutorial is outdated (and technically, it does not really suggests to install Hydro: it documents how to install various ROS-Industrial packages on ROS Hydro. But it is outdated in any case. Edit: I've just updated the page to at least make that more clear).

Now, does anyone have experience with ROS-I running with Kinetic? Through how much pain would I need to go through?

That will completely depend on what packages you'd like to use. Without knowing that, I can only tell you that almost all packages will build from sources in a Catkin workspace, they just haven't all been released.
If you can update your question and include which packages you need, I can provide more detailed instructions if needed.

Edit:

So I would like to use the universal_robot, ur_modern_driver, ur_modern_driver, moveit, basically anything that I need to do ik, calculate trajectories and planning. I think the first three are little problematic.

you list ur_modern_driver twice, but:

moveit has been released for Kinetic, so that is just an apt-get away (note btw that MoveIt is not a ROS-Industrial package)
universal_robot has a kinetic-devel branch and is being used by many people on Kinetic already

As for ur_modern_driver: there is currently no development targetting Kinetic, but incompatibilities are mostly confined to the ros_control parts. If you don't need those, you should be able to compile and run everything. If you need / want the hardware_interface, there is at least one fork that addressed the incompatibilities. See ur_modern_driver#58 for more info.
