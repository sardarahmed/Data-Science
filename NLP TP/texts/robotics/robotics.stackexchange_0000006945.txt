Q:

Help to dimension the right controller for the following Tranfer Function

I have a generic problem to create a controller for the following system:
$$\ddot{x}(t) = a y(t)$$ 
where $a$ is a constant real value.
The system could be seen as an equivalent of a mass-spring-damper system, where damper and spring are removed. Also $x(t)$ is the $x$ dimension and $y$ is simply the force moving the mass. BUT in this case I need to drive the force using $x(t)$ and not the contrary.
Transforming according Laplace I get:
$$ y(t) = \frac{1}{a}\ddot{x}(t)$$
$$ Y(s) = \frac{1}{a}s^{2}X(s)$$
$$ G(s) = \frac{Y(s)}{X(s)} = \frac{s^{2}}{a}$$
Considering that $a = 1$ I implemented a possible example in Simulink. 

Please not that I put the output given by the scope for showing up the resulting answer of the system.
So I have 2 questions:

Is it possible to develop such a system? As far as I know the degree of the numerator should be $=<$ the degree of the denominator. So is the above system possible?
Is it possible to create a PID or PD controller to stabilize the output of the system?

Nope, the system is not feasible since the causality principle states that the degree of the denominator of the transfer function must be greater or equal to the degree of the numerator, as you have correctly pointed out. The system analysis, indeed, does always proceed in terms of integral blocks (i.e. $1/s$) and not derivatives. In this respect, what is the system you have in mind? Are you 100% sure that you caught all its implications?
Even assuming the double derivatives as a purely ideal system to stabilize - only in simulation -, a PID is unable to cope with the task. Imagine we are at equilibrium, then the system output $y$ is equal to the input $r \neq 0$ and the error $e=r-y$ before the PID is thus zero. However, a constant output means that upstream to the double derivatives we must have a signal $u$ varying as $t^2$. The signal $u$ is also the PID output, while the PID input is $e=0$, as said. You must have then a double integrator in the PID. But this is only a theoretical speculation.
