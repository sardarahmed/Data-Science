Q:

Replacement for message_to_tf in noetic

message_to_tf is no longer available in noetic. What's a good replacement for it?
Context, if helpful: I'm using this package in simulation to test with perfect localization, which I accomplish by publishing Gazebo's /exact_pose to the TF tree.

One thought was to use robot_localization, but is there a simpler replacement?

If I understand you correctly, I'd suggest to use fake_localization for this.
It'll pretend to be an actual localisation component, but still "just forward" the ground truth coming from the simulator.

Edit: and if you'd really like to use message_to_tf, why not build it from source? I haven't tried, but it doesn't appear to have any really crazy dependencies, just standard packages.
