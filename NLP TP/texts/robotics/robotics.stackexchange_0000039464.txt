More info required, like what dd u do, what is the error displayed, your environment, OS, ROS version and PCL version. Only then people will be able to answer the question.

Still not clear as to what are you trying to do. Whats your script? Make file doesn't work, means any error? What are you trying to make?

A:

For ROS Electric you have to use the PCL library that comes with ROS ... you can't use the standalone library from Pointclouds.org. ROS uses an older version of PCL. Take a look at joq's answer to a similar question.
