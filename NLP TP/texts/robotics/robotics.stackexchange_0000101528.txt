Q:

Do I need another IMU if my camera has IMU?

I am building a 4 wheels robot.
The main chassis has a pan/tilt turret with a camera. The camera has an IMU sensor built in.
Should I have another IMU sensor to precisely drive the robot.
I am asking that since the IMU on camera might provide complex info if the robot is on the move while the turret rotates.
Thanks in advance.

It is a quite interesting question - I think there should be some problems with moving the camera with this IMU. How can you transform IMU measurements with rotated camera? What kind of camera model is it? This is a nice roundup about IMU in robots. I hope it will help you.

Thanks. I think is more clear now that I need another IMU on the body of the robot.
