Q:

Is ROS uses gcc or g++ compiler for c codes?

Hello community,
I have a C code which is using some C++ functions and i want to know if the ROS catkin_make uses gcc or g++ compiler ?
Or where can i change the default compilers and compiling flags.
Thank you.

A:

You can check which compiler is being used by looking at the message when you run catkin_make.
If you get the following message, you are probably using gcc and LLVM g++.
-- The C compiler identification is GNU 4.2.1
-- The CXX compiler identification is Clang 4.0.0

ref: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/BuildingPackages
To change the compiler and options, add the following to the CMakeList.txt file
set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER "/usr/bin/clang++")
set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER "/usr/bin/clang")
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "-O2")
set(CMAKE_C_FLAGS "-O2")

Note: nothing here is ROS-specific. This is all CMake.
If you want to learn more about selecting and configuring compilers which will be used by Catkin/Colcon: look up the relevant CMake documentation.

The problem I'm facing is that Cmake is giving an error which is the compiler can't find some of the boost libraries (boost_signals), but i am pretty sure that the boost library is well installed.

This may have already been discussed in https://answers.ros.org/question/333142/boost_signals-library-not-found/. If not, please create a new question. I think we are starting to stray from the title of this question.

please can you tell me where can i find the tf ros package C/C++ codes because I'm only finding the include codes not source codes

You should create a new question. When asking a question, it is recommended that you also provide information about your OS and how you installed the tf package.
