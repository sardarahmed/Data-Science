Q:

How to obtain CameraInfo Message

Hi guys,
I am doing this robot simulation on the UDK/UsarSim and have been able to publish image from the Robot Camera in the simulator to the ROS System. Then I want to use this image to perform SLAM using the V-Slam from willow garage. The problem is that the V-Slam node also subscribe to the CameraInfo Message. So my question is how to obtain the Camera Info Message from the USARSim/UDK?
Thanks

Did you use USARSimROS to interface USARSim with ROS?

A:

The Camera Info Message will not be published by USARSim, it describes the distortion of the Camera. What it is supposed to contain, can be found in the Camera Info Message Api

If the camera is uncalibrated, the matrices D, K, R, P should be left
zeroed out. In particular, clients may assume that K[0] == 0.0  indicates an
uncalibrated camera.

Okay thanks for the information. Another question I want to ask is how you get the information regarding the "Header"?
