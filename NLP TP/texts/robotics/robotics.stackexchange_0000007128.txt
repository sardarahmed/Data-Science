Q:

Determining a robot's distance from a certain point when the robot's position is constantly changing

I was wondering how I could determine a robot's distance from a fixed point when the robot itself is constantly changing positions. I can keep encoders on the wheels and can also get data from a gyroscope and an accelerometer.

A:

If you know the position of the point at the begin, an easy solution would be to implement Dead Reckoning using the encoder value. Knowing the position of the robot at time t, compare it to its initial position and you can easily find where the fixed point is, in the robot frame (and thus calculate the distance).
Then to compensate the drift create by the dead reckoning process, you can use the values given by your IMU (gyro and accelerometer).
