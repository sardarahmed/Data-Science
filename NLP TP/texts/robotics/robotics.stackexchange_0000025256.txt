Q:

How to put Hokuyo laser sensor on p2os?

Hi! I'm new at gazebo, and I would like to know how to put a hokuyo sensor on my p2os model. I am not using a real robot, I just want to know how to add a sensor on my simulation.
I've tried https://kforge.ros.org/turtlebot/turtlebot/file/fb8354a98ac5/turtlebot_description/urdf/gazebo.urdf.xacro (turtlebot_sim_laser) Sensor insertion into robot's urdf: https://kforge.ros.org/turtlebot/turtlebot/file/fb8354a98ac5/turtlebot_description/urdf/turtlebot_body.urdf.xacro (laser_joint) but it still doesn't work. (Check http://answers.ros.org/question/44691/how-to-put-hokuyo-laser-sensor-on-p2os/)
Thanks!

A:

Hello,
If you're using SDF, then you can nest models using:
<model name="pioneer2dx">
  <include filename="pioneer2dx.model" />
  <include filename="hokuyo.model" model_pose="0.2 0 0.3 0 0 0" />
  <include filename="camera.model" model_pose="0.2 0 0.5 0 0 0" />
</model>
