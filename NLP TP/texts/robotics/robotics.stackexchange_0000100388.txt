Q:

Visual studio developer command prompt freezes after launching 2nodes in windows 10

Hi,
I am unable to run more than 2 nodes in windows10.
The moment I launch more than 2 nodes. The vs developer command prompt freezes.
Steps I followed:

Open visual studio developer command prompt.
source ros_foxy with command "call ros2_foxy/local_setup.bash"
build my workspace "my_workspace" with command "colcon build"
After successful build, i source the workspace
"install/local_setup.bash"
Finally, i launch all the node(5nodes) using launch file "ros2
launch mypackage mypackage.py"

expected behavior : All nodes should have been launch.
actual behavior: Only two nodes are launched.
Few more inputs: I am using ros2 inside a windows vm. 8GB RAM, 110GB C:, 4cores.
Once two nodes are launched(out of 5nodes) i am unable to run any other ros2 related programs like rqt, ros bag record/play. But interestingly i can run all apps via commandline other than ros2 related.
I did check the CPU load and memory usage it was well under 60% of utilization.
My development setup

Visual studio : 2019
Python : 3.8.3
Windows: 10
ROS2_Foxy: Patch 6.1
C++ 11

Any hints or suggestions highly appreciated.
Thanks

Unless you're running nodes as background processes, not being able to use the terminal after starting a node seems like expected behaviour (as in: it's just a program running, which is blocking).
I believe it would help (others) if you could describe exactly how you are starting things, and what you expected to happen (if something else happened).

Even if I run 5 separate instances of vs developer command prompt with each running different nodes. Still I can only run two nodes.

Hi! I guess I have the exact same problem, in fact I created this post. Did you manage to solve it? If not, are you using dynamic array allocation? Are you sending dynamic array via topic (like an image)? Do you think it is a ros problem or is your code causing it?

A:

Try to change your RMW implementation to rmw_cyclonedds_cpp as said here. For me, this did the trick.
