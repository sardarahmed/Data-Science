Q:

Error building rviz on osx

Building rviz on osx i have encountered another problem
[ 61%] 1 warning generated.
Building CXX object src/rviz/CMakeFiles/rviz.dir/moc_tool_properties_panel.cxx.o
Linking CXX shared library /Users/tatsch/ros_catkin_ws/devel_isolated/rviz/lib/librviz.dylib
ld: library not found for -lOgreMain

make: *** [all] Error 2
<== Failed to process package 'rviz':
KeyboardInterrupt
Command failed, exiting.
I found in the ogre forum that this seems to be one of the usual quirks about OS X. The solution could be to use -framework Ogre instead of -lOgreMain, but where would i have to apply that?

A:

Make sure you have the latest version of Ogre installed from our repo.
brew remove ogre
brew update
(ros/groovy/ogre should update)
brew install ogre
(or you can do rosdep again)
