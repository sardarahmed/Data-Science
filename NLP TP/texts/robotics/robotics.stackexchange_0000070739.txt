and this is my CMakeList.txt

ofcourse i change this line to solve this problem but it hasnt been solved :
catkin_package(
  INCLUDE_DIRS include
  LIBRARIES beginner2_tutorials
  CATKIN_DEPENDS message_runtime roscpp rospy std_msgs
  DEPENDS system_lib
DEPENDS message_runtime
)

its package.xml content :

Hi , i want to install catkin_make but i couldnt because of an error, i want to know could i change package.xml or not and if not how could i fix this problem? please help
Comment by joq on 2015-12-05:
Please edit your question, adding your CMakeLists.txt and package.xml contents. The error says you are missing a dependency on message_runtime. Does that make sense?
Comment by fatima on 2015-12-05:
thank you for reply , i edited my question as you told please help me
Comment by joq on 2015-12-05:
The error says that the message_runtime dependency is missing from your package.xml. Please list its contents, too.
Comment by joq on 2015-12-05:
If you are following a tutorial, please provide a link to it.

this that link :http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingPublisherSubscriber%28c%2B%2B%29

at first i wanted to run 11.Writing a Simple Publisher and Subscriber (C++) , i have done every thing but when i want to run catkin_make i had many errors i solved them but at last this error with message_runtime couldnt be solved
Comment by fatima on 2015-12-05:
i think so , but i dont know how to change package.xml and add message_runtime?
Comment by fatima on 2015-12-05:
i added my package.xml as you told

A:

You should add  message_runtime to your package.xml file as run dependency. Like;
<run_depend>message_runtime</run_depend>

That's what I suspected from the error message. But, apparently it's no longer part of that tutorial.
Comment by fatima on 2015-12-05:
thank you so much Akif and joq i did  <run_depend>message_runtime</run_depend>but now i have another problem with nodelet like previous problem.
Comment by joq on 2015-12-05:
You need to update your question so it lists exactly what you currently have in both those files, then paste in the exact error message.
