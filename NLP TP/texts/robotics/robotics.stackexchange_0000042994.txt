Have you verified all nodes are gone via rosnode list afterwards? -- I regularly end up with zombie nodes and their topics, too, and the only way I found to get rid of them is restarting the roscore.

How to restart roscore?
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-08-09:
Alternatively, you can do a rosnode cleanup. It will try to ping all nodes that are registered at the core and remove them if they are not running.

@Lorenz Great find, assuming it works. But why isn't there any documentation about this subcommand?

A:

I guess it's only the /rosout topics?
Those come from roscore, so all non-core topics are gone.
If others are left, the node might either be still running or the master hasn't realized it's gone properly.

There's a hidden command rosnode cleanup which might clear the extra state.
