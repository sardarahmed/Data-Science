same issue ,anyone help me to solve this problem please

A:

I've just tested this in a debian:buster Docker container (on amd64) and following the installation instructions results in apt wanting to install 1126MB of packages for me when I ask it to install ros-noetic-ros-base. So it seems to work.
What is the output fo uname -rvmp on your machine?
Note that Buster only gets binary packages (from the ROS buildfarm) for the amd64 and arm64 architectures (see also wiki/noetic/Installation). If you're attempting to install it on other platforms (such as armhf) you cannot install it using apt.

I have armv71 too, there is a guide that clearly explain the way to install it, but I have problem, to install one package. If you find a way to install it please tell me because I m trying 4 days
