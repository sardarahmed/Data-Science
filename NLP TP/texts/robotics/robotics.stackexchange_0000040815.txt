Q:

Large project example?

Hi,
we are planning to build larger robotic project (industrial robots, many sensors, high and low level planning), and we are planning to use ROS. Is there some similar large project in ROS which can be used as an example?
What we are currently seeking is example of high-level design for large ROS project.

I feel like there should be a WikiBook or something for building a tutorial on how to do this.

I think the notion of design patterns for a "large-scale" project is poorly defined without more info. I would ask you, what is it that you want ROS to do for you?

For now, the PR2 opening door is good example for large scale project. However, most of the tutorials are focused ether on how to run some demo or how to write some code to get some particular functionality. ...

... What I thing would be great starting point is some kind of top down example using some real task scenario, with explained high level design concepts which should be used.

A:

After two days of digging, I have found another similar project to PR2, the Care-O-Bot, and I was able to run at least one tutorial.
