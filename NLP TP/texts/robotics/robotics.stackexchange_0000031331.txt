Q:

Is there a command line utility to list available nodelets within the package path?

In debugging nodlet issues, and considering which nodes can be consolidated into a single process via nodelets, it would be nice to be able to simply list all available nodelets. Is there a command that does this?

A:

Now there is (since a while actually).
A first check can be done via:
$ rospack plugins --attrib=plugin nodelet

Ref: http://answers.ros.org/question/65189/nodelet-is-not-recognized-as-a-plugin/
(S: The link @tfoote provided is dead, but wouldn't be surprised, if this is the tool he talked about.)
However, this only shows you packages exporting the nodelet information.
If your nodelet is listed there, but  you are still unable to load it properly, I suggest to run the following (replace /nodelet_manager with the name of your nodelet manage):
$ rosservice call /nodelet_manager/load_nodelet "name: ''
type: 'burb'
remap_source_args: ['']
remap_target_args: ['']
my_argv: ['']
bond_id: ''"

This will respond with an error.
ERROR: service [/nodelet_manager/load_nodelet] responded with an error:

But in the terminal running the nodelet manager you will get the list of available nodelets. If your nodelet is missing there (or registered under a wrong name), something went wrong with your plugin registration and/or exported nodelet information.
