Q:

Interfacing standard Gazebo sensors with ROS

It seems to be a trivial task, but I can't find an answer so far.
I need to interface standard sensors like (camera, laser scanner etc.) with ROS. This page mentions all the plugins I need, but there is no further information on this.
Gazebo Wiki is silent about this as well. The only thing there is how to write your own plugin.
What did I miss?
Thanks,
Boris

Although it is helpful, but not exactly what I'm looking for. Is there ready to use plugins like this? Looks like it won't be a problem to write one, but I would prefer to reuse the existing ones. Thanks.
