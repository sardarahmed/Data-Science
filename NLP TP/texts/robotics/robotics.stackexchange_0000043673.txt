Q:

Openni_tracker no skeleton data published in /tf

Hello everybody,
I want to visualize the skeleton transforms in rviz. After starting openni.launch, openni_tracker and doing the psi-pose, i expect the different body-part frames in the tf-topic....but the only frame i receive is called /user, which tracks my position. Am I doing something wrong with the calibration or why are these body-part-frames missing? Or maybe is there something wrong with my tf-Configuration?
Here are the informations i get after "rostopic echo /tf":

transforms:
header: 
  seq: 0

There is just the /user transform and some irrelevant transforms (i think they are not relevant for my problem) posted on the /tf topic.There appear no head-transform for example, after echoing the /tf topic.After using roslaunch turtlebot_bringup kinect.launch, only the /user transform is published

I solved my problem by using the pi_tracker instead of the openni_tracker....

A:

Did you check if there are any transforms posted on the /tf topic? RVIZ will only display the transforms if you provied a full tree to the fixed frame... You can also set your fixed frame to your /camera_link-frame to check if the tracker works...
