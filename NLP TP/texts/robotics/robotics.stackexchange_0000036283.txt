A:

Hi,
Launch file is looking for a calibration file in specified path and which is not available.
This question is already open
http://answers.ros.org/question/2891/ros-kinect-roslaunch-openni_launch-opennilaunch
You can use the following which works fine for me, if it serves your purpose.
roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch

Hope this helps,
Karthik

In the trunk it isn't an error anymore. Just a warning, so I assume it will eventually appear in the debs.
