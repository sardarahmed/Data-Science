Q:

Where are the ROS Hydro stacks installed?

Hi,
Can anyone tell me what happened to the (usual) source code location inside the /stacks folder? After an installation of ros-hydro-desktop-full, the size of /opt/ros/hydro is 279.5 MB compared to Fuerte's 3.1 GB.

A:

For packages which have transitioned to the new buildsystem catkin, the source is not installed by default.
If you want the source for a debian package.  Duplicate the packages.ros.org line in your apt.sources.list file and put 'deb-src' instead of 'deb'
Then you can apt-get source PACKAGENAME
