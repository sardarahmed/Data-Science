A:

This looks like a duplicate of your previous question: https://answers.ros.org/question/299297/maximum-limit-of-string-in-ros2/
To see how to define bounded strings in ROS2 you can refer to the Interface Definition design document:
a string with an upper boundary: string<=N to limit the length of the string to N characters
An example of message definition using bounded strings is available here
