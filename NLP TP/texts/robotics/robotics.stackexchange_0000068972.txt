Q:

[RViz] How do I use marker.colors with LINE_LIST?

The doc says colors should have same size as points. But in case of LINE_LIST, there are 2n points, with n = number of lines. I tried both to resize colors to n and 2*n and setting every color twice for each line, but I always end up seeing only every second line segment and having several segments rendered black.

A:

The strange behaviour was due to a programming bug.
The correct solution is to have colors the same size as points. Indeed you are coloring the points, not the full line segments. The two colors (start point and end point) are interpolated along the line segment.
