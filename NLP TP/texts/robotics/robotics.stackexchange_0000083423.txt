Q:

E: unable to locate package ros-hydro-desktop-full

Hi,
I am new here and I was trying to install ROS hydro on Ubuntu 12.04.05 LTS. I have followed the ROS wiki instructions but i got this error after:
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-desktop-full

Ubuntu is on a virtual machine by Parallels Box on mac.
I'd like to add that the same installation at the same version of ubuntu and ros was fine with typical linux installation (not with virtual machine).
I hope someone can help me!
This is what I've got after sudo apt-get update

Hydro reached end of life a while ago so I don't believe that the binaries are available for download anymore. I could be wrong but I seem to remember reading this somewhere (just can't recall where).
Comment by jayess on 2017-10-19:
Is there a reason that you need to use Hydro instead of a newer version such as Kinetic or Lunar?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-10-20:
The package exists in the repositories, and you mention yourself that it works on "a typical Linux installation", so at this point it would seem you might've made a mistake when setting up the repositories.
Can you show the full output of sudo apt-get update? Use the edit button/link for that.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-10-20:
@jayess: Hydro is EOL, but the package repository still has all the packages. They just won't receive any updates anymore.
Comment by jayess on 2017-10-20:
Ah ok. Must have been thinking of Fuerte or older. Thanks for the correction.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-10-20:
All the packages for all older ROS releases - at least back to Box Turtle - are still available. If you can't install them, that either means the mirror you are using hasn't synced them, or your OS isn't compatible with them.
Comment by jayess on 2017-10-20:
Good point about compatibility. Forgot about that detail.
Comment by rubicki on 2017-10-20:
I have to use Hydro, because i am using ros to communicate with KUKA YouBot and a lot of packages were created for Hydro.
Comment by rubicki on 2017-10-20:
@gvdhoorn i will show you full output of sudo apt-get update
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-10-20:
re: have to use Hydro: as long as the message, service and action definitions (ie: .msg, .srv and .action files) haven't changed between Hydro and the ROS version you would like to use, things should just work.
And even if they've changed, you could recreate the msgs and use those to ..
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-10-20:
.. bridge into the YouBot Hydro node graph.
Note: I haven't done this, but it should be possible.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-10-20:
Searching for kuka youbot indigo shows quite some results. Are you sure that there is no Indigo (at least) compatibility for what you need/want?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-10-20:
Please edit your original question to add this new information. Comments are too limited for this.
Comment by rubicki on 2017-10-20:
Done, but i don't know how to format this like you correct
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-10-20:
Use the Preformatted Text button (the one with 101010 on it). Copy-paste your text, then select it, then press the button (or use ctrl+k).
Comment by rubicki on 2017-10-20:
@gvdhoom I am new here so i didn't know how do to it. Thank you!

A:

Skipping all the non-ROS related repositories, we see this:

Hit http://packages.ros.org trusty Release.gpg

Hit http://packages.ros.org trusty Release
Hit http://packages.ros.org trusty/main amd64 Packages
Hit http://packages.ros.org trusty/main i386 Packages
Ign http://packages.ros.org trusty/main TranslationIndex
Ign http://packages.ros.org trusty/main Translation-en_US
Ign http://packages.ros.org trusty/main Translation-en

The trusty there is what I would expect on a Ubuntu Trusty (ie: 14.04) system. For Ubuntu Precise (12.04), it should have precise in those lines.
All other output of apt-get update does show precise files being downloaded.

I have followed the ROS wiki instructions [..]

Did you follow the ROS Indigo installation tutorial by accident?
Can you tell us which instructions you followed specifically?

I followed this one: link text
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-10-20:
There is no trusty on that page anywhere.
You should be able to replace trusty with precise in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list. Then do a apt-get update and try again to install ROS Hydro.
Comment by rubicki on 2017-10-20:
Ok. Should I remove ros which I installed before this step?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-10-20:
Have you been able to install any packages? As far as I can tell, you shouldn't have been able to install any packages with the way you have things configured at this point.
Comment by rubicki on 2017-10-20:
Oh sorry my mistake. I just set up my keys.
Comment by rubicki on 2017-10-22:
@gvdhoorn everything is working. Thank you for helping me!
