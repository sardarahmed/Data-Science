Q:

Move_base PointCloud2

I get the following error with move_base
Client [/move_base] wants topic /zed/point_cloud/cloud_registered to have datatype/md5sum [sensor_msgs/PointCloud/d8e9c3f5afbdd8a130fd1d2763945fca], but our version has [sensor_msgs/PointCloud2/1158d486dd51d683ce2f1be655c3c181]. Dropping connection.

Obviously it does not like PointCloud2. Is this a configuration problem or do i need to do a conversion to Pointcloud?

maybe this or this question would help?

A:

Found a solution, there is a node which has a configurable launch file in order to convert from PointCloud2 to PointCloud or the other way round:
