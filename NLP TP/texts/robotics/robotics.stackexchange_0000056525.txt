Q:

How to merge git forks with current ROS directories? Camera_pose errors

Since camera_pose_calibration was never updated, I finally got the patched version of camera_pose from Github via this:
$ git clone https://github.com/jbohren-forks/camera_pose.git

Unfortunately I'm not allowed to modify the files in ROS directories.  I figured out that I would refer to the folder I put it in over the original ROS camera_pose folder by listing it first in ROS_PACKAGE_PATH but I'm still getting errors.  How would I eliminate the old camera_pose folder?  Using ROS Hydro right now.
Edit 1: After following the overlay instructions and using roscd to check that camera_pose is being looked at in my testspace first (it is), I'm encountering new errors.
This white text

terminate called after throwing an
instance of
'pluginlib::LibraryLoadException'
what():  rospack could not find the
image_transport package containing
image_transport::PublisherPlugin

Followed by this red text

[kinect_1/stereo_cb_detector-2]
process has died [pid 3069, exit code
-6, cmd /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/calibration/image_cb_detector/bin/image_cb_detector_action image:=image_throttle

This error shows for all 3 Kinects.
Another white error

    from camera_pose_calibration.robot_measurement_cache import RobotMeasurementCache

Followed by red error

log file: /home/robot2/.ros/log/6b38aca2-7e0e-11e3-8b67-b8ca3a789964/capture_exec-19*.log

And a white message
ImportError: No module named camera_pose_calibration.msg

Then a bunch of angry red text.  Any ideas?  I also have included the roswtf output:

ERROR Could not contact the following
nodes:  * /kinect_2/stereo_cb_detector

/kinect_3/stereo_cb_detector  * /kinect_1/stereo_cb_detector

ERROR The following nodes should be

/kinect_1/stereo_cb_detector->/rosout
(/rosout)  *
/kinect_2/stereo_cb_detector->/rosout
(/rosout)

And for all three:

ERROR Errors connecting to the
following services:  * service

[/kinect_2/stereo_cb_detector/set_logger_level]
ERROR Errors connecting to the
following services:  * service [/kinect_2/stereo_cb_detector/get_loggers]

Any ideas?

A:

If I understand your question, I think you should clone this fork into your workspace source folder(your_ws/src/) and source the setup file found in your_ws/devel/setup.bash. This will overlay the fork package over the original package.

I found this incredibly helpful.  Unfortunately now it's producing different errors.  I'm not sure if they're from it, or just ones that were hidden by previous errors.

Did you execute catkin_make on your workspace? it seems like can't find camera_pose_calibration message
Comment by Athoesen on 2014-01-15:
Yes, I followed the directions.  It's still throwing me errors. I've tried both sourcing the workspace under my Groovy sourcing in the .bashrc file, and also just doing it from terminal window.  Each time I get TONS of errors from camera_pose_calibration, moreso than without trying to overlay.

Have you solved the errors? I am getting the same errors
