Q:

how to use gzsdf?

Hello i want to transform an URDF file into a SDF file. (I am using Ros fuerte)
What am I doing wrong?
john@john-K53SD:/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/simulator_gazebo/gazebo$ ./gazebo/bin/gzsdf print /home/john/fuerte_workspace/sandbox/miurdf/01-myfirstyo.urdf
Warning [parser.cc:348] Gazebo SDF has no gazebo element
Error [parser.cc:263] parse as old deprecated model file failed.
Error: SDF parsing the xml failed

A:

The command should be $./gazebo/bin/gzsdf convert your.urdf
And if you get another error, try sourcing the bash file: $source setup.bash from gazebo
!!!! EDIT: 
I remember on older Gazebo (~1.0) versions I used to do it like this:
source setup.bash, ~/path/gazebo$ source setup.bash
rosrun gazebo urdf2model -f yourmodel.urdf -o oldgazeboformat.xml (changes the urdf to gazebo model)
then
gzsdf print oldgazeboformat.xml > yourmodel.sdf (from gazebo model to sdf)
Hope it works.

Hi, I am trying to convert my urdf to sdf format. I tried the your edited commands. THe rosrun command did generate a xml file. But the gzsdf does not work. It says missing robot element in the xml file .
