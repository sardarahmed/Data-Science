A:

The best option currently is to use the installApp task to build an executable jar and wrapper script (see the rosjava_tutorial_pubsub example and the rosjava_core documentation: http://docs.rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/rosjava_core/html/index.html). Then you can use roslaunch to execute it in the same way you would an arbitrary executable.

Thanks. I have a topic t1 which bublishes strings "yes" and sometimes "no". Another topic t2 publishes string "why" only when t1 bublishes "no". Now I want to get a chart/graph. When and which topic triggered. I have seen the rxplot (only works for numeric values). rxconsole gives the output but in a seraial form. Is there any way you know how to get my desired plot OR how to get a text file from rxconsole so that i can play with in Matlab to get the plot. I mean I am only interested triggering of the topic but on some specific values. Regards and thanks in advance
