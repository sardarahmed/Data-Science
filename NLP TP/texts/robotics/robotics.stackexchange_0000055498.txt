Q:

Can't execute rosjava Nodes. RosRUn not found Exception

I`ve been able to build and execute the tutorial_pubsub.
Then i created a new Rosjava package in an existing catkin_ws.
When i run gradle install and gradle installApp it all compiles right.
But when i now try to execute these new nodes:
scryer@Scryer:~/catkin_ws/src/rosjava_foo$ ./build/install/rosjava_foo/bin/rosjava_foo ben.dude.Listener

i get:
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/ros/RosRun
Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.ros.RosRun
    at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:217)
    at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method)

    at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:294)
    at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:266)
Could not find the main class: org.ros.RosRun. Program will exit.

What am i missing to execute Nodes that are not in the rosjava folder?

A:

Do you have the rosjava workspace sourced? RosRun is a class inside rosjava, and the script that you are running will assume you already have that class in your classpath.
If you installed rosjava from source, source the setup.bash file of its respective environment before trying to run your own node. That should work.
