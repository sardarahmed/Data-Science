Q:

Comparison of trajectories from odometries

Is there a way in ROS2 to compare trajectories from odometry data? I'm using robot_localization to calculate various odometry outputs by incorporating GPS and IMU data. I have a bag file where I recorded odometry topics, and I would like to compare the paths taken in the following configurations:

/odom_local (odometry + IMU)
/odom_global (odometry + IMU + GPS)
/odom_ackermann (only my    odometry data)

I can visualize the trajectories in rviz2, but I also want to compare them in terms of distance error, etc.
If someone has already done this, I hope they can assist me.
Thanks in advance.

A:

You should try Plotjuggler. Its a nice tool for plotting and investigating data. You can directly import rosbags into it. Another good thing about plotjuggler is that you can plot X-Y plots which really helps in case of plotting odometry data. I have been using it for years now, It might take some time to setup and get started but it will be worth it.
Tip: you can plot goal (X-Y position) and over it your odometry(X-Y position) for each case and you'll see how deviated each one of them is from reference path (goal path).
Check out this video by the author of plotjuggler and you'll understand more.
Hope this helps
