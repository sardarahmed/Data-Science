Q:

Visuallizing a set of states in real time

Hello,
I am trying to stimulate in 2D a simple robot, and I want to visualize a portion of the state space (the set of inevitable collision states for instance) that changes in real time.
I am using Gazebo as a simulator, and the state space is a simple grid (a regular lattice).
How could this be nicely done using Gazebo or Rviz?
Thanks in advance!!!

A:

rviz has several visualization plugins to which you can publish data and visualize this sort of thing.  Here's a list of display types I'd suggest looking at publishing Gridcells or Markers.
