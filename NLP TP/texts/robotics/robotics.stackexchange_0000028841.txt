Q:

Apply force to object through plugin

Hi,
is there a way to apply a force to objects/models.
There is "SetLinearAccel", but I can't find any command for applying a force.
Thanks in advance

A:

From my own experience, it seems like the answer is that one can't apply force to a model/object, only a link. This can be solved by getting the desired link from the model, where the names of the links can be changed in the .world file:

this->model->GetLink("body")->SetForce(ignition::math::Vector3d(1.0, 0.0, 0.0);

The same goes for applying torque:

this->model->GetLink("body")->SetTorque(1.0, ignition::math::Vector3d(1.0, 0.0, 0.0);

Hope this helps someone else.

Extremely helpful, my slight variation is below
this->model->GetLink("link_name")->SetForce(ignition::math::Vector3d(forceX, forceY, forceZ));
this->model->GetJoint("joint_name")->SetForce(0, torque);

One thing that was very hard to find anywhere is how to apply a torque to a link. It's done the same way as a force, but Gazebo knows what to do when "SetForce" is done on a joint (revolute joint in my case). The "0" within SetForce() is the axis index, which I think could be non
