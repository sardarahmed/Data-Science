Q:

Colcon aliases?

Hi all,
is there a way to define custom aliases for colcon similarly to what's possible with catkin tools??
Thanks.

A:

colcon doesn't offer aliases atm.
While you could create a Python package adding those that would be rather heavy weight for an alias.
You could also define the alias in your shell.

Thanks for the answer. While having shell alias is handy for some cmd, it would still be nice to have aliases for command/verbs or options. E.g. build --package-up-to -> --build-to or --event-handlers console_direct+ -> --verbose or --event-handlers console_direct+ --pytest-args -s -> --pytest-verbose, you got the idea.
Marking as correct answer since it does answer the initial question.
