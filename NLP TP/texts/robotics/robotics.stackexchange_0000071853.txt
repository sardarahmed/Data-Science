Q:

Getting Robot Position while Teleoperation

I have created a map using gmapping on turtlebot 2. Now, i want to let the user move the robot using teleoperation (meanwhile amcl is also running) and record the coordinate values of the path from where the robot moves. The problem is that when the robot moves using teleop, it does not use move_base due to which I am unable to get the robot's coordinates via topic move_base/feedback. Any ideas on how could I get the coordinates of robot in the reference frame in which my map is running. Thanks.

just checked amcl_pose and that's what I wanted. Thanks a lot for your help. I also wanted to confirm one more thing, if i get the pose from odometry, what reference frame will it be in ?

I guess odometry should be in its own frame odom, which support transformation to map with the help from acml
