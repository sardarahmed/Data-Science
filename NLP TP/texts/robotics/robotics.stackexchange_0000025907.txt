Q:

Is there a specification for the model.config file?

Is there a specification for the model.config file available online?
Specifically, is there a  tag and are multiple  tags permissible?

Well, gazebo didn't throw any errors or warnings at me when I included those tags, but I still don't know if there is an official specification for the file....

A:

Documentation for the model database is in the User Guide: http://gazebosim.org/user_guide/started__models__database.html
We need to update the document to use "model.config" instead of "manifest.xml"

Is the filename the only thing that changed? I assumed that was out of date since it seemed to only make reference to manifest.xml.

Only the filename changed.
