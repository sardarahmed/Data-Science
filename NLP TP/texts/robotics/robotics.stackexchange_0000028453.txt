Q:

Continuously Tracking and storing 6D pose of an object in Gazebo simulation

Hi,
I am currently working on a drone related project and using gazebo for simulation
In order to measure accuracy of my localisation, I need to know the ground truth values.
Is there some way in Gazebo to continuously track/store the actual/true/ground truth 6D pose,
ie the rotation and translation w.r.t. to a fixed frame like the world frame.
I wish to create something like the following -

Thanks a lot !

Hi,
While @smorad's answer helped , the mentioned topic (/gazebo/model_states) did not provide timing values. Also it provides the actual pose for all models and hence requiring additional filtering for finding the actual pose of the desired object.
If using Gazebo + ROS, the /ground_truth/state topic can be enabled in the URDF ( as seen here and here )  of the required ROS robot ( which is then converted to a Gazebo model in the generated SDF file), making it the required solution.
