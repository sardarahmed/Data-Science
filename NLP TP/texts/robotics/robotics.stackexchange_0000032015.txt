Q:

Sending goal for navigation using SimpleActionClient

Hi everyone,
I was able to send goal to the robot, but I wanted to know when the robot has reached the goal by using callback. Does anyone has any idea how this can be done in the sendGoal function of the SimpleActionClient?
Thanks,
TayXR

It can't be done in sendGoal as the idea of actionlib is to have the (long-term) action run in the background. It can be done using SimpleActionClient, however.
This tutorial describes the process:
Sending Goals

A:

It can be done using Actionlib under C++. Check this link: http://wiki.ros.org/actionlib_tutorials/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20Callback%20Based%20Simple%20Action%20Client
For an example check the face_recognition package, it uses exactly the same structure as the one in the link I sent you. However I'm still looking for a python equivalent of that as there is no tutorials about it.
