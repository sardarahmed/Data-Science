Q:

Where can I buy heavy-duty Omni Wheels?

Where can I buy multi-directional omni wheels?
I'm specifically looking at something which can support in excess of 100kg/wheel, so around 400kg in total. Also, a possible mission profile would include a 300 meter excursion outdoors on asphalt path, so they should be a little durable. The only ones I can find online are small ones for experimenting.

A:

Try andymark, their 10 inch mecanums (or smaller) may suit you well.
