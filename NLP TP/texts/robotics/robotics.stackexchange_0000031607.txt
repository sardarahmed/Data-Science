Q:

robot_description synchronization gazebo RViz

My objective is to synchronize the position of the robot in Gazebo and RViz. In Gazebo the robot model is launched into a position different than the origin while in RViz the position is set from the transform odom->base_footprint sent by gazebo, but the robot didn't moved from it's initial position hence is clear why im getting (0,0). How to load the Robot Model into RViz in a specified location.Thank you!

A:

I think I understand your problem now. RViz only displays the robot's view of the world, so you can't really set something directly. I also don't know why you would need that.
I can think of some ways to achieve what you want. Bascially you need a transformation going from <some_frame> -> /base_link that equals the gazebo pose.

In your map, change the map offset so it fits the position. /map -> /base_footprint should now work with localization.
Use a fake_localization with the gazebo position.
Publish a custom tf /gazebo_pose -> /base_footprint
