Q:

How do I use a map to reduce odometry errors? [SOLVED]

So, I have a *.pgm and *.yaml map and I want to use it, somehow, to reduce the odometry errors.
I need to get accurate locations to set point on a map and someone recomended this to me. However I couldn't find info about that anywhere.
Thanks!

A:

Sounds like you are looking for a ROS package for localization: http://wiki.ros.org/amcl
Keep in mind that localizing against a map requires Laser Scan or Point Cloud data from a corresponding sensor (spinning LiDAR, MS Kinect, etc.)

Yes!
I think it is this.
Thank you!

Well, is there a way to do it with just a camera? Our project is similar but it is outdoors. LIDAR is too expensive, and MS Kinect doesn't work with sun light. We were hoping we'd be able to use the RPi camea module. I've already looked into AprilSLAM. Haven't tried it yet.
