A:

Couple of things to try / check:

Does the file /home/sanket/.rviz/config exist?
What are its permissions?
Is it corrupted / damaged in any way?
If it exists, remove it, try again.
Check out one of the many other threads with 'rviz' and 'segfault' in their title: 1, 2, 3, etc.
Check the rviz troubleshooting section on its wiki.

Another option (perhaps the first) is to run rviz in GDB. Then get a backtrace. It seems you have coredumps enabled, so you could do a post-mortem debugging session (see here for some info (just a random link, just use a search engine for more)).
