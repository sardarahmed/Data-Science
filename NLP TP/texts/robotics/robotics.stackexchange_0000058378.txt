Q:

Roboearth DBException API

When trying to use the RoboEarth API through the website, or using the object Model Downloader as detailed in this tutorial.
I get a database exception error as detailed below.

DBException at /objects/result 'Hbase
connection failed: Could not connect
to pcube:9090'
[ INFO] [1396359404.695247797]:
SearchObjects (UID: videogame.kinectadventures): Failed

This happen whether I am logged in or not, so I assume it is a general issue.
Is there someone I should alert to this issue?

A:

The database is back up now.
If anyone knows why it was down, or who to alert next time it goes down that would be really helpful.
