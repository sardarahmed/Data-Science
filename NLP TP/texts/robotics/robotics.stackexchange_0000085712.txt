Q:

Can not install ros package via $svn co http://alufr-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/

I see some wiki page recommend to get ros package via  command like this
$svn co http://alufr-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/branches/octomap_mapping-experimental/
but when I use it in terminal,it tells me
Unable to connect to a repository at URL 'http://alufr-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/freiburg_tools/gaussian_process'
svn: E160013: can not find the path “/svn/trunk/freiburg_tools/gaussian_process”

And I also can not open this website http://alufr-ros-pkg.googlecode.com ?
Is something wrong with my Internet or this website?
My ros environment:
Ubuntu 16.04  Ros kinetic
Thanks!

A:

Google Code shutdown in 2015 so it's no surprise that you can't access it. According to that article, Google migrated much of their code to GitHub and created a tool for developers to move their code as well. However,as far as I know, Google didn't migrate other's code on its own.

Edit:
A quick Google search led me to the alufr-ros-pkg archive. They too moved to GitHub though:

OCTOMAP-related ROS stacks have moved to GitHub
NAO-related stacks have moved to GitHub: nao_robot repo and nao_common repo

Edit 2:
Here's a GitHub clone of the freiburg_tools/gaussian_process package that you were trying to clone.
