Q:

turtlebot obstacle avoidance using point cloud data

I want to understand and write a C++ program in gazebo/ros to make turtlebot avoids obstacles while moving forward using pointcloud data. How to get started with this? I have already created a node to subscribe point cloud data and visualize this in rviz.
Thanks a lot

Hello,
Best to learn by example.
Take a look at the code here: https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot_apps/tree/indigo/turtlebot_follower
You are essentially looking to do the opposite, avoid the obstacles instead of following them.

Thank you.
I would also like to know, is someone did the same thing, obstacle avoidance using point cloud data so that I donâ€™t have to reinvent the wheel?
