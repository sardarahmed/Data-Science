Q:

MoveIt Forward kinematics

Hi there,
does someone know how the forward kinematics is solved in MoveIt?
I know it is done with the getGlobalLinkTransform, but I don't know if this function solve it with a transformation matrix or in a otherwise.
Or is it only a measurement in the simulation model?
I need it for my Bachelor-Thesis to explain it a little bit.
Would be great if someone can help me out.
Best regards,
Jonas
