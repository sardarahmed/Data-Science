Q:

installation of pr2 simulator

Hi,
I'm new to ROS. I'm following the tutorial:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/pr2_simulator/Tutorials/StartingPR2Simulation
when I do:
rosmake pr2_gazebo
I get the following error:
rosmake ] Packages requested are: ['pr2_gazebo']
[ rosmake ] Logging to directory/home/randaz/.ros/rosmake/rosmake_output-20111110-144213
[ rosmake ] Expanded args ['pr2_gazebo'] to:
[]
[ rosmake ] WARNING: The following args could not be parsed as stacks or packages: ['pr2_gazebo']
[ rosmake ] ERROR: No arguments could be parsed into valid package or stack names.
I also cannot do:
roslaunch pr2_gazebo pr2.launch
[pr2_gazebo] is not a package or launch file name
I don't know if something is missing in my installation.
I installed:
sudo apt-get install ros-electric-desktop-full
and
sudo apt-get install ros-electric-wg-pr2-apps
Do I need something else?
I'm using Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric
Thank you
