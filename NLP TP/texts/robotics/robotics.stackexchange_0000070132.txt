Q:

Get apt-get dependencies given rosdep key

So I know using rosdep install will install the dependencies for a given package. However I need to get a list of all the system dependencies for a given package. Is there a way to get the corresponding apt-get entries in the rosdep database given the rosdep key?
i.e the foo rosdep key has this entry in the database:
foo:
  ...
  debian: [package1,package2,...]
  ...

Is there a command that will return package1 packag2 ... with rosdep?

A:

This command will return all system dependencies for a given ROS package (I explicitly specified OS name and ROS version):

$ rosdep keys image_transport --rosdistro=jade --os=ubuntu:trusty | xargs rosdep resolve
#ROSDEP[rosconsole]
#apt
ros-indigo-rosconsole
#ROSDEP[catkin]
#apt
ros-indigo-catkin
#ROSDEP[roscpp]
#apt
ros-indigo-roscpp
#ROSDEP[message_filters]
#apt
ros-indigo-message-filters
#ROSDEP[pluginlib]
#apt
ros-indigo-pluginlib
#ROSDEP[roslib]
#apt
ros-indigo-roslib
#ROSDEP[sensor_msgs]
#apt
ros-indigo-sensor-msgs

You can filter it further to get only dependencies:

rosdep keys image_transport --rosdistro=jade --os=ubuntu:trusty| xargs rosdep resolve | grep -v "#"
ros-indigo-rosconsole
ros-indigo-catkin
ros-indigo-roscpp
ros-indigo-message-filters
ros-indigo-pluginlib
ros-indigo-roslib
ros-indigo-sensor-msgs

This might not be what you are looking for since it's not recursive and it works only for ROS packages (not rosdep keys).

Exactly what I needed. Thanks! Recursion can be done using a simple bash script.
