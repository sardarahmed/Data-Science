Q:

core packages get removed by apt-get update & dist-upgrade

1 of my Quantal machines (that I upgraded from Precise just yesterday), apt-get dist-upgrade wants to remove following packages that are I believe included in desktop-full. Anybody has an idea why?
ros-groovy-{ bfl, bullet, common-rosdeps, orocos-kinematics-dynamics, physics-ode, resource-retriever, robot-model-tutorials, ros, rosbag, rosunit, rqt-console, rqt-plot, rqt-py-common, timestamp-tools }

Commandline output:
iuser@btt:/etc/apt/sources.list.d$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

Comment by dornhege on 2013-01-15:
My guess is something doesn't fit together anymore dependency-wise and you'd probably be able to re-install groovy after the update. No guarantees, however.

A:

Fixed this. As @dornhege indicated, in my case libboost-iostreams was somehow broken and I forced to upgrade it (via synaptic, not necessarily so though).
