Q:

Connecting a Raspberry Pi to a roomba via an FTDI cable

I have a Raspberry Pi with this FTDI cable and a Roomba 560. The Roomba has an SCI port to allow for control of the roomba via serial. I installed the PySerial library on the pi and send valid commands to Roomba, but the roomba doesn't respond. I have the TXD of the cable attached to the TXD of the roomba, the RXD on the cable wired to the RXD on the roomba, and a ground on the cable wired to the ground on the roomba (everything in  it's respective port). I do not have power going from the cable to the roomba or vice-versa.
What I can't figure out is why the commands aren't working. There's no error message upon running the python code. This is the information sheet for the Roomba's SCI port.
Code:
import serial

ser = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyUSB0')
# this is the defualt Roomba baud rate
ser.baudrate = 57600

# Start SCI - puts into safe mode
ser.write(chr(128))
# Enable full mode
ser.write(chr(131))
# Spot clean
ser.write(chr(134))

print 'Done'

A:

It turns out that the statement in the Roomba SCI spec sheet about ports is either outdated or incorrect. The Roomba 5XX series (and 7XX series) uses port 115200 to communicate, and that's what was wrong.
Wiring: I wired the TXD of the cable to the RXD of the roomba (so the orange cable would go into port 3 on the roomba), and vice versa. I also wired the ground and that was all that was needed.
