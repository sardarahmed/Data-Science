Q:

Can a graphics card speed up Gazebo?

I am running Gazebo on a laptop which is geared with 2 graphics cards, one Intel (low spec and low power consumption) for one nVidia (more powerful).
I do not see any performance gap between the two, and neither between the nVidia closed source driver and the open source one (Nouveau, shipped with Ubuntu 13.04).
So I wonder if a graphics cards can improve the performance of Gazebo and how. It looks like all processes are supported by the CPU (around 60% - 70% of use for the 4 cores).

A:

I answer to my own question after further trials.
So:

Intel chip with the default Ubuntu driver for it: simulation runs OK, but the whole system becomes slow
NVIDIA chip with the Nouveau Gallium driver and the BIOS option "OS detection for NVIDIA Optimus" enabled, simulation runs OK, the system is somehow faster
NVIDIA chip with the Nouveau Gallium driver without the BIOS option "OS detection for NVIDIA Optimus" disabled, simulation crashes, error message "X Error of failed request: BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)"
NVIDIA chip and driver, simulation OK and system fast

So the NVIDIA driver is clearly the best option, even the Intel chip is far easier to setup for a good result.
PS: for reference, I use a LENOVO T420 laptop.
