Q:

rosdep can't find cyclonedds during foxy install

I'm following the install doc but the step where I should install the rosdep dependencies results the following error:
$ rosdep install --from-paths ros2-linux/share --ignore-src --rosdistro foxy -y --skip-keys "console_bridge fastcdr fastrtps osrf_testing_tools_cpp poco_vendor rmw_connext_cpp rosidl_typesupport_connext_c rosidl_typesupport_connext_cpp rti-connext-dds-5.3.1 tinyxml_vendor tinyxml2_vendor urdfdom urdfdom_headers"
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved to system dependencies:
rmw_cyclonedds_cpp: No definition of [cyclonedds] for OS version [bionic]

I get a bit further with the -r option but when I try to source ROS2 it still throws this error:
y$ . ~/ros2_foxy/ros2-linux/setup.bash
[connext_cmake_module] Warning: The location at which Connext was found when the workspace was built 
[[/opt/rti.com/rti_connext_dds-5.3.1]] does not point to a valid directory, and the NDDSHOME environment variable has not been set. Support for Connext will not be available.

Ubuntu 18.04 / foxy
I had a melodic install on my machine
I reinstalled and updated python3-rosdep
Any idea how could I proceed with the install? :)

A:

Most likely the issue comes from the fact that you are trying to install ROS 2 Foxy on Ubuntu Bionic,  which is not a supported platform of ROS 2 Foxy. From the install doc you linked:

"We support Ubuntu Linux Focal Fossa
(20.04) 64-bit x86 and 64-bit ARM."

To find out what OS are supported by the different versions of ROS 2 you can refer to REP-2000.
This is why it cannot find a Foxy package for cyclonedds on your Ubuntu Bionic environment.
You could ignore the cyclonedds issue and try to use the default implementation (Fast-RTPS) but you're likely to hit other issues as you go since you're trying to use it on an unsupported platform.

More likely to succeed solutions would be to use an older version of ROS 2 that targets your version of Ubuntu (such as ROS 2 Dashing), or to migrate to Ubuntu Focal (20.04) and use ROS 2 Foxy
