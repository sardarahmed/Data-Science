Q:

urg node on ros indigo

I am new to ROS and as part of the tutorial, I am trying to install the hokuyo laser driver and have tried all the solutions posted so far but I keep getting the same error message
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-laser-drivers 
E: unable to locate package ros-fuerte-laser-drivers 

and
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-urg-node 
E: unable to locate package ros-hydro-urg-node

I am using Ubuntu 14.04 running on VirtualBox. I have ROS indigo igloo. Please help

A:

Since you're using ROS Indigo, you should install the package with "indigo" in the package name:
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-laser-drivers

or
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-urg-node

(note that I've replaced "fuerte" and "hydro" in the package name with "indigo").
