Q:

Can not find codec for 'png' image format

Greetings, I'm trying to install gazebo and ROS at my Ubuntu 11.10, But I'm getting some errors after I try to run roslaunch gazebo_worlds empty_world.launch , this is what I get:

gazebo: /home/k/Programs/ogre_src_v1-7-4/OgreMain/include/OgreSingleton.h:80: Ogre::Singleton::Singleton() [with T = Ogre::TerrainPageSourceListenerManager]: Assertion `!ms_Singleton' failed.
[gazebo-2] process has died [pid 13366, exit code -6].
log files: /home/k/.ros/log/87ad5d8a-600e-11e1-ab32-0024d690acd8/gazebo-2*.log

The above mentioned log does not exist in the given folder.  :(
So I tried running gzserver and then gzclient, which rendered:

But freeimage has been installed, shouldn't it be working?
Thanks in advance!

This looks like a gazebo issue.  I suggest you ask on http://answers.gazebosim.org
