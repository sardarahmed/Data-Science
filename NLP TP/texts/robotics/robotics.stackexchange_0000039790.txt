Q:

How are ROS debian packages compiled?

Hi,
I'd like to know if there's any documentation on the gcc flags used to compile the Debian ROS packages.
I assume -O3 is used everywhere and that sse1-3 is only enabled on those packages which contain rosbuild_check_for_sse(), but I'd prefer to have this documented, to verify whether I need to rebuild it myself to have maximum performance on my machines.
thank you

A:

Stacks using Catkin in Fuerte are compiled using git-buildpackage, i.e. they are based on the common Debian build toolchain.
As far as I know, classical ros stacks are compiled using some home brew scripts that can be found in rosdeb.
I don't expect too much low-level documentation on how to exist, but at least this page might contain some valuable information.
