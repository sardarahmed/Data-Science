Q:

How to import my robot?

Hi,
I've to import a robot that I've made with pro-e. I've assembled it in xml and then I want to spaw it on gazebo. I don't know how to do it.
I've tried to convert the xml file in urdf, so I tried to use rosrun gazebo spawn_model, but nothing happens.
thank you

What do you mean by "nothing happened"? Usually you should see some error messages if you can't spawn a robot. What parameters have you used for spawn_model?

thanka lot for your answer.

A:

i just import my robot into gazebo successfully. here are my steps:

create the URDF file for my robot;

open a terminal, type in: roslaunch gazebo_worlds empty_world.launch    this loads an empty world into gazebo;

open another terminal, type in: rosrun gazebo spawn_model -file some_directory/my_robot.urdf -urdf -z 0 -model myRobot

one thing to attention about urdf: you need to define the inertial for every robot link. check here for how to define the inertial: http://www.ros.org/wiki/urdf/Tutorials/Adding%20Physical%20and%20Collision%20Properties%20to%20a%20URDF%20Model
hope that helps~
