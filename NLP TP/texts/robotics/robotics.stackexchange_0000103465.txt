Can you confirm you are running a supported OS? Iron only supports Ubuntu 22.04 (or Jammy).
I ask because Foxy can't be installed on 22.04, so if you didn't upgrade your OS, it would be expected to not be able to install Iron.

Yes that was the issue, I figured it out thanks for addressing though.

A:

I figured it out, as iron only works on 22.04 I was not able to install that.
