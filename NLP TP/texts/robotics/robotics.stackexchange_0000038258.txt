Q:

How to detect mouse input in ecto?

Hello Ecto Gurus,
I have run through the various parts of the Ecto Kitchen (very cool!) and have succeeded in getting basic feature detection to work using both a webcam and a Kinect.  I would like to be able to select rectangular regions on an imshow window with a mouse and use the selected region as a mask for feature detection.  This is something that can be done with OpenCV using the SetMouseCallback() function.  I tried that alongside the ecto code in my Python script, but it doesn't seem to fire when clicking and dragging on the ecto imshow window.
Is there a way to do this?  I see the 'trigger' parameter for keyboard input but I'm not sure if this can be adapted for mouse input.
Thanks!

patrick

A:

maybe the easiest here is to have a different thread dealing with your input. That is how pressed keys are figured out in imshow. Look at :
