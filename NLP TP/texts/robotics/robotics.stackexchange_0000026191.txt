I'm seeing this trying to write a python module; I have nightly build and can't find atlas_msgs or osrf_msgs

I have verified this with the 2.3 deb and a source build. The command rosmsg package osrf_msgs shows osrf_msgs/JointCommands, but it won't import into python. EDIT: see answer below.

A:

one alternative is to do one of below:
>> import roslib; roslib.load_manifest('atlas_msgs')

or
>> import roslib; roslib.load_manifest('any_ros_package_that_depends_on_atlas_msgs')

before
>> import atlas_msgs

Well, I am using C++ and no python. Any help on that?
