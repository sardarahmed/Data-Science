Q:

Does ROS2 support keyed topic?

Hi everyone,
As stated in the title, does ROS2 have topic with keys? I have been studying ROS2 for few weeks and I have looked around but cannot find anywhere stating about keyed topic in ROS2.
Maybe I have missed something or ROS2 uses this properties in a different way. Thanks in advance for any answer!
Cheers!

A:

Short answer: No.
Long answer: You can make them keyed by placing the topics in the keyed namespaces so that you get just the instance required. For instance if you have the poses of robots on the pose topic, it may look like /robot1/pose /robot2/pose.

This isn't a complete substitution since you can't subscribe to all pose topics in every namespace with a single subscriber.

True, but its a reasonable work around (unless you have in mind a better way?), and you can programmatically have a vector of subscribers checking for a /some/namespace/ending/with/pose.

Thanks Steven! Since your answer is sufficient for me, I mark it as correct one.
