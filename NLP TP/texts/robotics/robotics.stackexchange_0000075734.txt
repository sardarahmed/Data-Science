Q:

How can make map using gmapping_demo with turtlebot simulation stage

Dear friends
I try to make map using gmapping_demo with turtlebot simulation stage.
When I run gmapping_demo.launch  it give me "No device connected....."
I know that turtlebot_gazebo can make map and this is the link for the tutorial
in my case
1st I run

roslaunch turtlebot_stage turtlebot_in_stage.launch

then I run

roslaunch turtlebot_navigation gmapping_demo.launch

A:

Your problem is that roslaunch turtlebot_navigation gmapping_demo.launch attempts to launch the node for a physical 3D sensor, such as a Kinect or Asus Xtion, as well as the gmapping node. If you look at the file gmapping_demo.launch you can see it includes 3dsensor.launch.
The tutorial instructs you to use roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo gmapping_demo.launch because Gazebo/Stage is simulating your sensor, so it only needs to start the gmapping node, which you can see here.
So try running roslaunch turtlebot_stage turtlebot_in_stage.launch as you were, then roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo gmapping_demo.launch, and it should work fine.

THANKS for your fast answer.
what I figure-out that turtlebot_stage represent a navigation with know map and we can test our path plaining using turtlebot_stage.
