Q:

How to make a heat map of WiFi signal in Rviz?

I am using ROS kinetic and tried to use wireless_watcher but it's only displaying the signal strength and I am not able to visualize it in Rviz.

A:

I'm not aware of a existing package that does this, but using the grid_map library it would be relatively easy to do a simple implementation, e.g. take RSSI and robot pose, add data into map. For making things appear nice and dense visually some more smoothing would be required (for instance by using grid_map_cv and converting to/from opencv).

Could you please elaborate on how to use grid_map library for the implementation part.
