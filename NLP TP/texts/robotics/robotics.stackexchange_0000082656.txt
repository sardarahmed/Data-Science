Q:

what is the use of " .format(**config)) "

http://wiki.ros.org/dynamic_reconfigure/Tutorials/SettingUpDynamicReconfigureForANode%28python%29
in this link ^, they have this piece of code (shown below)
rospy.loginfo("Config set to {int_param}, {double_param}, {str_param}, {bool_param}, {size}".**format(**config))**

what is the use of the bold part in the above code snippet ^
I am trying to dynamically reconfigure values of upper and lower HSV range values, so do I need to use this .format thing at the end of
lower_red=np.array([lowerh,lowers,lowerv])

if not, then what is its use?

I formatted the code in your question. To format your code please use the 101010 button not ".

Do you literally mean
**format(**config)**

or do you mean
format(**config)

?

A:

I'm assuming that you mean
rospy.loginfo("Config set to {int_param}, {double_param}, {str_param}, {bool_param}, {size}".format(**config))

This is just plain Python. From the Python docs

str.format(*args, **kwargs)
Perform a string formatting operation. The string on which this method is called can contain literal text or replacement fields delimited by braces {}. Each replacement field contains either the numeric index of a positional argument, or the name of a keyword argument. Returns a copy of the string where each replacement field is replaced with the string value of the corresponding argument.

As for the **config, checkout this answer on StackOverlfow:

This is a shortcut that allows you to pass multiple arguments to a function directly using either a list/tuple or a dictionary.

As for using it with numpy, I'm not too familiar with numpy but I don't believe that you do. But, you should ask a new question about that specifically.

I believe that I originally quoted the wrong part of the correct docs so I updated my answer to the correct part.
