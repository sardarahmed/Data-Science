Q:

Connecting two Kinects simultaneously using Fuerte?

I am running ROS Fuerte on Linux, and right now I can run one Kinect using roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch, and use rviz to see both the depth and RGB cameras.
How can I get a second Kinect to work simultaneously? I tried attaching a second Kinect to a different USB bus, and lsusb recognizes both, but rviz still only sees the first Kinect when using Pointcloud2.
Thanks!

A:

You'll need to provide some parameters to the second call to roslaunch, so that it picks up the correct device, and publishes the second point cloud on a different topic.
Also, you'll need to put each Kinect on a different USB bus; a Kinect saturates the bus it's on.
