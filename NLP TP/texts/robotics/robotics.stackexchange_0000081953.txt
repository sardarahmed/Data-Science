Q:

How can I run ROS2 nodes in a debugger (e.g. gdb)?

Is there something like the --prefix argument from rosrun in ros2 (see #q222530)?

A:

The --prefix argument is now working with ros2 run. So you can use it in the same way as known from rosrun, e.g.:
ros2 run --prefix 'gdb -ex run --args' package_name executable_name (see #q222530 for more examples).
At the moment this feature is only available on ROS2 installations, which were built from the development sources (master branch).

I don't want to create a new question for this but; how would that be written for lldb ? probably trivial but I couldn't get it to work.
