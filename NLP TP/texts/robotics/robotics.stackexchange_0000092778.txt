Q:

import rclpy error invalid syntax

when I try to run a simple python script to create a ROS2 node, I get an error immediately on the import rclpy line at the top.
Running on Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic, ROS2 Dashing, deb package installed in /opt/ros/dashing/ directory shown below.
I have tried building from source as well and I get the same error (just to a different directory instead).
Probably missing some dependency or something.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
NOTE: I can successfully run the ros2 demo_nodes_py talker and listener examples.....which use import rclpy in their code....
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./bosch_imu_node.py", line 42, in <module>
    import rclpy
  File "/opt/ros/dashing/lib/python3.6/site-packages/rclpy/__init__.py", line 62
    def init(*, args: List[str] = None, context: Context = None) -> None:
              ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

What's the command used to run your python script? Without a reproducible example my best guess is the script is being run using python 2, but ROS 2 code is all python 3.

that was it! all I had to do was update the bit bang to #!/usr/bin/env python3 and it solved that error

A:

Update for anyone else with similar issue:
fix the bit bang line to this at the top:
$ #!/usr/bin/env python3
to make sure you're using python3.
