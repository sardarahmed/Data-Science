Q:

Unable to see trajectory of AR Drone

Hey everyone,
I'm trying to perform dead reckoning using an AR Drone. Namely, initialize the drone's location on a floorplan, then as I move the drone around in my hands, I want the drone's trajectory to be updated on Rviz.
So far I have odometry data being published to /ardrone/odometry as nav_msgs/Odometry type. When I attempt to visualize this on Rviz, however, I only get the direction the drone is facing. I would also like the moving trajectory of the drone,  but I don't know how to display this onto Rviz.
Also note that I'm not flying the drone, simply moving it around in my hands. Could this be a reason why I can't see the trajectory?
EDIT : Here's how my Rviz looks like : http://imgur.com/a/9BJg6
As you can see it just tells me where the drone is pointing and does not update the movement even if I move across the room.

A:

Part of the problem is that there's no transform from the map frame to the odom frame. How can you plot the trajectory if you don't have a way to localize yourself within the map?
