Q:

Broken url in tutorial

This page
http://wiki.ros.org/actionlib_tutorials/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20Simple%20Action%20Server%20using%20the%20Execute%20Callback%20%28Python%29
has a broken link to
http://www.ros.org/doc/api/actionlib_tutorials/html/msg/FibonacciAction.html
named "Fibonacci action"
Edit: When I looked yesterday, the C++ page for the same tutorial had the same problem with the same link.

The correct link : http://docs.ros.org/api/actionlib_tutorials/html/classFibonacciAction.html
Comment by ahendrix on 2015-04-23:
That is not the correct link; it links to a C++ class; not the generated docs for Fibonacci.action

A:

This looks like a bug in the auto-generation of docs for the actionlib_tutorials; I've reported it: https://github.com/ros/common_tutorials/issues/11
