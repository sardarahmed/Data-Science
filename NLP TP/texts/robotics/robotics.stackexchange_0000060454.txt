Q:

How to get Kinect's serial number with OPENNI

Dear friends,
I am new in "openni". I want to get my Kinect's serial number that I can use this to relate the "openni_tracker" package to each kinect to have a multi skeleton tracking of a ONE human body.
I know already that we could have the Serial Number in Linux by :

List item lsusb -v

But I wanted to get this number by openni c++, then I tried this answer of this question :

List item http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8988090/how-can-i-get-the-kinect-serial-number-with-openni

But it still didnt work for me. I did not achieve to print my Serial or use it.
Can you please help me?
Thanks

A:

openni_camera prints the serial number and uses it to load the right camera parameters, too.
This should help: https://github.com/ros-drivers/openni_camera/blob/hydro-devel/src/nodelets/driver.cpp#L237
