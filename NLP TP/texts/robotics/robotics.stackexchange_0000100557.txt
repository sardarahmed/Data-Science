Q:

rosdep install of libyaml-cpp-dev fails

Hi!
I have a package with the following dependency:
<depend>libyaml-cpp-dev</depend>

When I try to run the rosdep install mypackage command, I would expect that apt installs the libyaml-cpp-dev package. However, I get the following error instead:
Cannot locate rosdep definition for [libyaml-cpp-dev]

Any idea why rosdep fails in this case? Thx!

A:

You're using the debian package name not the rosdep key for this package.
If you look it up in the rules you'll see that that debian package corresponds to yaml-cpp
https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/blob/dc95e3e9e7ff78fa8cc4f0f9c5396dd0672ad7a2/rosdep/base.yaml#L7940-L7983
You should use that key and rosdep will resolve it to libyaml-cpp-dev on Ubuntu as well different package names like libyaml-cpp-devel for Fedora. We current best practice is to use the debian package name however it's not guaranteed. And we don't change existing keys to avoid breaking existing users.
