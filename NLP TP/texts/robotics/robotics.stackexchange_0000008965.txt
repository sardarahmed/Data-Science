CC3D - Replacing RC emitter with an RPi

I am trying to control a quadcopter using te OpenPilot CC3D board and a RaspberryPi. The main idea was first replace the signals from the RC emitter to the CC3D RC receiver for an RPi connected directly to the RC receiver inputs of the CC3D.
As far as I know the RC signals to the CC3D are PWM so the RPi should be able to control the channels using RPIO library to create the PWM by software. 
But after make some tests I haven't find any way to move the motors. I am using the Ground Control System (OpenPilot Software) to configure the CC3D.
I am not sure whether I need to send the PWM signals in any order or something like that. I am also not sure how the Flight Mode Switch works, I suposse it works the same way as the other channels, using PWM.
Anyone have made anything similar to this? 

A:

I could finally control the CC3D from the RPi. 
The problem was a bad configuration from a RC input.
I also upgrade the CC3D firmware from the new Groung Control System software developed by LibrePilot, another community that wants to give support for the OpenPilot boards.
