Q:

Speed controller, service or subscriber/publisher?

If I am making a PI speed controller for a robot, should I use a service or a subscriber for my Python script?

A:

you should use a  "subscriber/publisher"topic, because you like to controll you mobile robot with a twist message.  und the output of you controller is not importent for the publisher node.
