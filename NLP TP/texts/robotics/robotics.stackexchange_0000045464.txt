Q:

It is possible to unregister a ros-service?

I would like to dispose the register resources when an specific node dies. I'm aware that parameters can be deleted. But, it is possible to do the same with services?

A:

You can unregister a service by calling shutdown() on the rospy.Service object (doc here). It looks like this isn't done automatically on destruction like in the ros c++ implementation. Maybe it should do that.

Are you seeing a service persist even after it's been destroyed? The way to unregister  a service manually is to call shutdown() on the ServiceServer object (doc here), but this should happen automatically when the ServiceServer object is destroyed. Maybe you're not actually destroying the server object.

The link to the rospy documentation is dead. It can be found here.
