Q:

Turtlebot disconnects when additional /dev/ttyUSB port is active

Hello,
I am trying out the Turtlebot stack under Electric (beta).  So far everything works great including the follower application.  Next I want to control two Dynamixel AX-12 servos that I have attached to the Kinect for pan and tilt.  The Create is on port /dev/ttyUSB1 and my USB2Dynamixel controller is on /dev/ttyUSB0 and I am using the dynamixel_motor package to control the servos.
When I launch the Turtlebot using the minimal.launch file, everything comes up fine on /dev/ttyUSB1.  But as soon as I launch the dynamixel_motor controllers (which comes up fine on /dev/ttyUSB0), I get the following error in the Turtlebot launch window:
Failed to contact device with error: [Error reading from SCI port. Wrong data length.]. Please check that the Create is powered on and that the connector is plugged into the Create.[turtlebot_node-3] process has finished cleanly.
log file: /home/patrick/.ros/log/28a03a10-bb09-11e0-bde5-00271017076c/turtlebot_node-3*.log
respawning...
[turtlebot_node-3] restarting process
process[turtlebot_node-3]: started with pid [9174]

This block then just keeps repeating indefinitely.
Has anyone else experienced something similar?
Thanks!
patrick

Thanks Alaina--that did the trick!  If you post your comment as an answer, I can accept it as the correct answer.

Have you tried setting your udev rules to make the SCI port /dev/ttyUSB0 and your USB2Dynamixel controller /dev/ttyUSB1? I have a Logitech webcam running on /dev/ttyUSB1 with no problems.

The Turtlebot software is looking for the Create on ttyUSB0. You can change that in the launch files, but I prefer to mess with less. :)

Actually, I did set the Create port to /dev/ttyUSB1 in the launch file and it connected to that port fine but I still ran into the disconnect problem when the USB2Dynamixel is on port /dev/ttyUSB0.  So I am wondering if there might be some other place in the Turtlebot code where USB0 is hard coded.  In any event, your udev solution works fine for now.  Thanks!

Could one of you guys post here the udev files you created? Thanks!
