Q:

Connection Arduino with ROS

Hey Folks,
I have a problem in the connection between arduino and ROS, I am using Ubuntu 15, 64 bit, Jade version ROS.
The problem in these two following commands commands

roscd rosserial_arduino/src
cp -r ros_lib /libraries/ros_lib

It gives the following error

bash: /libraries/ros_lib: No such file or directory

Although I have tried to download the source code from Github and putting in the sketchbook of Arduino Linux environment, but no connection.
Another concern between Catkin and Rosbuild, I have read difference between them, but uptill now I can't figure out if the problem lies in selecting the proper for building executive files.
Any recommendation!
Have a Great Day!
Best,
Marwa ELDiwiny
