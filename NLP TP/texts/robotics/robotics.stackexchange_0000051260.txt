Q:

cross-compilation ros fuerte on nao geode

Does anyone manage to successfully installed ros fuerte, ubuntu 12.04 on nao geode (cross-compilation)?. I have been trying but it seems there is a mismatch with python 2.6 and 2.7 version.

A:

I've tried to do so in the past, and it was a true dependency hell... I did manage to compile ROS on the virtual machine they provide, but ROS wouldn't run. You may find more info here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ros-sig-aldebaran
