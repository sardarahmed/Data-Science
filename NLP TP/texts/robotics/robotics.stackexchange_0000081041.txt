Q:

Preferred method to install catkin on Debian stretch

Fairly new to ROS haven't looked at it in a year. This time around I was happy to see it installed via packages to Debian rather than installing a pre configured distribution .ISO, I have Debian 9 aka stretch installed on an old HP tx2000. I have ros installed by including
jeffa@lunar:~$ uname -a
Linux lunar 4.9.0-2-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.9.18-1 (2017-03-30) x86_64 GNU/Linux
jeffa@lunar:~$

root@lunar:/etc/apt/sources.list.d# cat ros-latest.list
deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu stretch main

I followed the directions Debian install of ROS Lunar apt-get install ros-lunar-desktop-full
Should I install catkin from packages? or build catkin from source? I tried both attempting building from source first then tried with apt-get

Then it occurred to me to apt-get install catkin
root@lunar:/etc/apt/sources.list.d# apt-get install catkin

I'm slightly confused: you already seem to have catkin installed (afaik it's going to be installed by default if you install ros-*-desktop-full), and your error output seems to be about opencv3, not catkin.
Comment by jhalbrecht on 2017-05-29:
After a lot more reading... yup I have catkin installed. I guess the opencv came from a large number of examples ~96 saved in ~/ros_catkin_ws/src It was the first build to encounter an error.

A:

As pointed out by @gvdhoorn catkin was installed with apt-get install ros-lunar-desktop-full My bad for misunderstanding the catkin workflow.
