Q:

Trouble building fovis_ros on Hydro

Hello, I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 with ROS Hydro and wanted to test fovis_ros with a Kinect, but I'm having trouble building the package.
Following the advice given in this question I executed the following commands :

git clone
https://github.com/srv/fovis.git

git clone
https://github.com/srv/libfovis.git

So I had the fovis and libfovis folders inside catkin_ws/src.
Then I tried building with catkin_make and got the following messages at the end:

... [ 98%] Built target
fovis_ros_generate_messages
/home/ire/catkin_ws/src/fovis/fovis_ros/src/visualization.cpp:3:40:
fatal error:
libfovis/visual_odometry.hpp: No such
file or directory compilation
terminated. make[2]: ***
[fovis/fovis_ros/CMakeFiles/visualization.dir/src/visualization.cpp.o]
Error 1 make[1]: ***
[fovis/fovis_ros/CMakeFiles/visualization.dir/all] Error 2 make: *** [all] Error 2
Invoking "make" failed

I verified and the "visual_odometry.hpp" file is inside the libfovis/libfovis folder, like the rest of the files used by fovis_ros that don't seem to present an issue.
I tried building the libfovis library first, which gave no trouble and then adding fovis_ros but I got the exact same error. I also followed the advice from issue #11 but the problem remained.
Here is the complete log in case it's more useful.
Thank you in advance.

Hi Athria, could you try to install ros-hydro-libfovis, remove libfovis from your workspace, delete build and devel directories and compile again?

Hello, than you! I tried that before installing libfovis from the git and I got errors, but I did it again (removing the libfovis, build and devel folders, then installing ros-hydro-libfovis an then catkin_make) but this is what I got.

Hello, I'm sorry, that was indeed the problem. I was selecting Hydro on the Branch scroll bar and then copying the clone URL on the right, but I guess it was not the way to do it; this time I downloaded the zip instead and it compiled without errors.
Thank you very much!

A:

Can you check if you are using hydro branch in fovis? Now our default is set on indigo.
You can simply switch the branch with "git checkout hydro".

Thank you! I was doing it wrong, now it compiles perfectly.

I  am still facing the same problem. I installed libfovis via apt-get then I 'git clone' the repository and then checked out to hydro branch. but still I get this error

Hello Sai, I don't know if it will help you but this is exactly what worked for me in the end: I deleted what I had from fovis, then I downloaded (manually, not by git clone) the two folders (libfovis and fovis) from the hydro branch in github to the catkin/src/ folder and then it compiled well.

I think when I was doing git clone it was downloading the indigo versions (I am really new with github) and that's why it wasn't working. I hope it helps

Thanks, but it didn't work for me.
