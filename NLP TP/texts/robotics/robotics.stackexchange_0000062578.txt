Q:

Cannot plot turtle pose in rqt_plot

Hi All! I am just starting to learn ROS.
So I was following the tutorial on understanding TOPICS (http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingTopics), where I was supposed to run $ rosrun rqt_plot rqt_plot and enter /turtle1/pose/x in GUI, but I keep getting this message in the terminal:
    Traceback (most recent call last):   File "/opt/ros/hydro/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rqt_plot/plot_widget.py", line 204, in on_topic_edit_textChanged
        plottable, message = is_plottable(topic_name)   File "/opt/ros/hydro/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rqt_plot/plot_widget.py", line 104, in is_plottable
        fields, message = get_plot_fields(topic_name)   File "/opt/ros/hydro/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rqt_plot/plot_widget.py", line 75, in get_plot_fields
        field_class = topic_helpers.get_type_class(slot_type) AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'get_type_class'
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'get_type_class'

I ran roswtf and got this :
Loaded plugin tf.tfwtf
No package or stack in context

I can't get any plots described in tutorials, so I was hoping you could help.

A:

Are you sure you have up-to-date versions of all of the ROS packages? Try running apt-get update and apt-get upgrade.

I was having a somewhat similar issue and this (along with restarting my computer) seemed to help, thanks!
