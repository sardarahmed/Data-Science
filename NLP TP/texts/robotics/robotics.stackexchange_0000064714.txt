If you aren't using ROS, there's a forum for Gazebo specific questions.

A:

If you are using gazebo integrated with ros then this tutorial must be very much helpful.
Mobile robot gazebo simulation.
It explains things with a mobile robot example.
OR follow the tutorial in gazebo website Arm manipulator gazebo simulation
