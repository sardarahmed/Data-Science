Q:

DRCSIM 2.3: Strange Sensor head Changes

There were a number of changes to the multisense sensor head in the most recent version of DRCSIM.
Strange inertial values have been added to the head for each frame. See below:
  <link name="head_hokuyo_frame">
    <inertial>
      <mass value="1e-5" />
      <!-- collocate with parent link and remove mass from it -->
      <origin xyz="0.042428 0.0004084 0.0108165" rpy="0 0 0"/>
      <inertia ixx="1e-6" ixy="0" ixz="0" iyy="1e-6" iyz="0" izz="1e-6" />
    </inertial>
  </link>

Where do these numbers come from and what do they mean? Are they significant?

A:

The head_hokuyo_frame and various links with names that end in _frame are attached to its parent via fixed joint.  The fixed joint attachment currently implies child link inertia is lumped into the parent link rather than simulating a 6-DOF constraint.  Also, the *_frame link masses are made small intentionally to have negligible effects on overall dynamics.
