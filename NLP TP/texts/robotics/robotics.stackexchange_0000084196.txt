Q:

rosbag record never finalized

Hi all, i am new with ROS and I had the exiting challenge to build a lidar point cloud with a velodyne vlp-16.
I record my pacp file with tshark and now im in the ROS part.
With a lot of help in this forum i achieve starting roscore and also reading the pcap file with the velodyne driver.
My target is to get a .LAS file. After a couple of sample i figure that i had to convert my pcap to bag file in the process.
If at this point i'm not on the good way plz let me know :)
After many try i finaly got the recording with this:
rosrun rosbag record /velodyne_packets -O /media/lidar/math/test13.bag

[ INFO] [1512235521.473606088]: Subscribing to /velodyne_packets
[ INFO] [1512235521.542149460]: Recording to /media/lidar/math/test13.bag.

The problem is... it never ending. I can't figure what to do.
Any help is welcome,
thank you

A:

What do you mean

it never ending.

? Do you mean that the recording doesn't stop? If that's what you mean then you can just hit Ctrl + c and that will stop the recording.
If this isn't what you mean then please update your question to provide more details.

yes, recording doesn't stop. every time, it create my file, but test13.bag never grow more than 4.1Kb in size whatever the size of my pcap file. That's why i pretend that recording dosen't do is job.

You have to make sure there is some node publishing on the /velodyne_packets topic, with
rostopic echo /velodyne_packets, for example.
