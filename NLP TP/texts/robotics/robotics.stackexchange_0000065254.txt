Q:

Gazebo won't launch without restarting PC

I've been following the tutorials of GazeboSim.
I can spawn the 'RRBot' with roslaunch rrbot_gazebo rrbot_world.launch command, but if I close Gazebo, I cannot
spawn the RRBot again, instead, encounter with this output;
URDF in parameter [/robot_description] on the ROS param server.
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
[gazebo-2] process has died [pid 5212, exit code 139, cmd /opt/ros/hydro/lib/gazebo_ros/gzserver /home/oguzhan/catkin_ws/src/gazebo_ros_demos/rrbot_gazebo/worlds/rrbot.world __name:=gazebo __log:=/home/oguzhan/.ros/log/4c41b0c0-a00c-11e4-837b-40f02ffcf6f4/gazebo-2.log].

If I restart my PC, I can spawn the RRBot again with the same command ' roslaunch rrbot_gazebo rrbot_world.launch '.
Again, if I shut it down, I cannot spawn again, but
I tried to kill the process, killall gzserver and pkill gzserver but it didn't help.
I checked the System Monitor to see if any remaining process running, but it didn't also help.
But after these, I can launch gazebo standalone with no problem and also, I can launch gazebo with roslaunch gazebo_ros empty_world.launch  and I can spawn the Baxter robot with rosrun gazebo_ros spawn_model -file rospack find baxter_description/urdf/baxter.urdf -urdf -z 1 -model baxter
But I still fail to spawn the RRBOT with roslaunch rrbot_gazebo rrbot_world.launch
Do you have any ideas?

A:

Problem solved:
In rrbot_world.launch file, I commented out:
<!--<arg name="world_name" value="$(find rrbot_gazebo)/worlds/rrbot.world"/> -->

and it is now working without any problem.
