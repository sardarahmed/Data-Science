Q:

Launch file error

After entering a command "projectbot_world.launch, I see problems like:
Invalid <arg> tag: projectbot_gazebo
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/kinetic/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/opt/ros/kinetic/share. 

Arg xml is <arg name="world_name" value="$(find projectbot_gazebo)/worlds/projectbot.world"/>
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

Do you have an idea how to solve it?
Thanks a lot :)

A:

The problem here is that you haven't sourced your workspace so the package projectbot_gazebo isn't found. The two ROS path lines that you get from the error are all the data within the variable ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, when using $(find PKG) you will search if a package can be found at the different pathes of the variable.
Sourcing your catkin workspace add the path of the packages of your workspace to this variable.

I'm not sure this is the case. We'd typically see a "ResourceNotFound" error in that case.
The OP here posts a "Invalid  tag".

I've tried different errors by trying to find something that doesn't exist :

Within an arg tag as OP's error and it returned the same error.
Within a node tag the output error is the different pathes of ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
Within an include tag indeed I got the error ResourceNotFound

I would guess that when using the include tag an error is raised before the error when parsing the xml file.

You have to source your workspace.
