Q:

Smoother both in global planner and independent

I was wondering what is the reasoning behind having both a smoother server (e.g., a constrained smoother) and defining a smoother in the planner server. Shouldn't the smoother server be enough on its own? Is there a difference between the two? Why are the default w_smooth parameters so different for the two (0.3 when defined in the planner server and 2000000.0 when creating a constrained smoother)?

This is just a simple post processing step for the nature of the Hybrid-A* method to make the quality "pop" with little variations due to discrete cost search. It takes well under 0.1ms so its not a heavy operation like the other Smoothers in the Smoother Server.
