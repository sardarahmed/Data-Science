Q:

Start a launch file via cpp

Hey guys,
is there a way to start a launch file via c++ in a node?
In my case, I have an Actionserver (actionlib) and want to be able to start a few other nodes as a goal. But since these other nodes that I want to start on demand are changed pretty often, I want to store them in a separate file and I thought, a launch file should do the trick.
Any ideas?

It would seem harsh, but I'm almost inclined to close your post. Reason: there are many Q&As about this exact topic and quite a few of them include usable code.
Could I ask you to first try using Google to search for older Q&As? Append site:answers.ros.org to your query. That should return quite some results.

A:

Could you try following code?
#include <cstdlib>
...
std::system("roslaunch your_package your_node");

std::system allow you to pass its arguments to terminal.
