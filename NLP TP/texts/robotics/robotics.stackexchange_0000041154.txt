Q:

add sources for rosinstall

I am trying to install the package prosilica_camera using rosinstall prosilica_camera and I get the error 
rosinstall operating on /home/mike/ros_workspace/prosilica_driver from specifications in rosinstall files  
(Over-)Writing /home/mike/ros_workspace/prosilica_driver/.rosinstall
(Over-)Writing setup.sh, setup.bash, and setup.zsh in /home/mike/ros_workspace/prosilica_driver
ERROR in rosinstall:
No 'ros' stack detected in candidates [].
Please add the location of a ros distribution to this command.
How do I add the location of a ros distribution to that command? 
Thanks

A:

If you installed from packages it's usually in /opt/ros/ and you literally add it.
