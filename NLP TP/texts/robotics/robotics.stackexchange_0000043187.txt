Q:

Gazebo with controller

I know there have been a few posts on SDF vs URDF for gazebo, but I'm still not sure I know which to use.
It particularly interests me when I see this in the terminal (running pr2_empty_world.launch ):
Warning [parser.cc:348] Gazebo SDF has no gazebo element
Warning [parser.cc:291] DEPRECATED GAZEBO MODEL FILE
On July 1st, 2012, this formate will no longer by supported
Convert your files using the gzsdf command line tool
You have been warned!

So, if I want to go to SDF, then I cannot run a robot controller, or at least cannot use robot_description param required to run a controller.
But if I stick with URDF, then it's deprecated? If I could input Collada files or SDF with the robot_description param, I think it would help.
I see the reference to a collada converter here but haven't seen anything on it since this ticket that's over a year old.
Has it been maintained?

Hello, I have a simmechnaics file( meshes are in stl format). I converted it to a urdf file then to a xacro file, I got the same warnings( gazebo_worlds/empty_world_paused). I am not whether these warnings affect my simulation in gazebo.

Was the conversion straightforward? I know there are urdf->collada (or stl I assume) but didn't know of the reverse. Thanks

hello, yes the conversion was straightforward, I used simmechanics_to_urdf package but I got an tf exception error then I used another version of simmechanics_to_urdf package, no problem occured. But when i launch gazebo and my robot's urdf, I got error described by you, .dae is collada format i gue

Hi. i am a new user of gazebo with ROS and I get the similar warnings when i launched gazebo. May i know what should I do about the warnings? In addition, my gazebo often terminates unexpectedly, could these warnings be the reason for that?

A:

Hi,
URDF will not be deprecated without a way to load it in gazebo, so no worries there.  We've started the process of adding URDF parsing in gazebo, more details to come.  At least for now (in Fuerte), there will not be any interrupted support for URDF spawning in gazebo.
Thanks,
John

Thanks. Might I ask if you know what ever happened with the ticket I referenced?
Comment by hsu on 2012-08-17:
hi, if the converter is broken, please file a new trac ticket against it?  thanks,

@hsu is there already update about URDF parsing?
Comment by arennuit on 2014-07-16:
I am new to ROS/gazebo and I thought that URDF was the historical format for ROS/gazebo and that gazebo had started to move away from URDF and to SDF. Am I wrong?
