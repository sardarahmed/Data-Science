Q:

[Navigation] problem: how to go to a specific location?

Hello all
My goal is to move my robot in gazebo to a specific location {x,y,z} coordinate. I have already investigated the navigation stack. Are there any easier way to archeive this goal?
Thank you all!

Instead of putting "DESPERATE boy need help!" into the title of your question you should make a title that describes your actual problem, also try to use tags so that the people with knowledge about gazebo can find your question easier.

Hi. I modify  the title a little bit.

A:

The navigation stack is designed to do just that.  You can control the robot with your keyboard or mouse to get there.
If you're talking about starting the robot in a specific location you can use the gazebo API calls to set the position of the model directly.
