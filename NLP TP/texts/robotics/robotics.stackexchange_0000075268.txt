Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: libuvc kinetic

Has anyone tried to install libuvc or libuvc_ros for kinetic distribution? I have no idea how it should be done.

Maybe using  https://github.com/ktossell/libuvc_ros

A:

As by today it is not possible to install libuvc_ros via apt-get.
Here are the steps to install libuvc_ros manually under ROS kinetic:
# Install dependencies, as I wasn't able to install them via rosdep
sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0 libusb-1.0-0-dev

# Clone libuvc_ros and libuvc to your workspace
cd /path/to/your/workspace/src
git clone https://github.com/ktossell/libuvc_ros.git
git clone https://github.com/ktossell/libuvc.git

# The following instructions come from the libuvc's Readme file
mkdir libuvc/build
cd libuvc/build
cmake ..
make && sudo make install

# Run catkin
cd /path/to/your/workspace
catkin_make
