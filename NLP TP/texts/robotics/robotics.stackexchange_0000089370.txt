Q:

Segmentation fault while running turtlesim_node

I am following the beginner tutorials for ROS.
However, when attempting to run turtlesim by using the command rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node (after roscorebeing run in a different terminal) I run into a segmentation fault with the following message:

[ INFO] [1540211266.549429837]:
Starting turtlesim with node name
/turtlesim [ INFO]
[1540211266.558342044]: Spawning
turtle [turtle1] at x=[5.544445],
y=[5.544445], theta=[0.000000]
Segmentation fault

I tried uninstalling and installing the turtlesim package, but this didn't work.
What can I do about it?
I am using ROS Kinetic on a virtual machine running 64-bit Ubuntu, under Oracle VM Virtualbox.

When reporting SEGFAULTs, always include information about the platform you try to run things on, and how you installed ROS (from sources (ie: compiling yourself) or binary pkgs). If you used any, link to tutorials.

I downloaded a .ova file given to me by one of my professors with ROS pre-installed on it, I don't really know what method he used to install it. After doing that I followed the tutorials here, starting from point 1.1.2 (Navigating the ROS Filesystem).

It is likely then that the ROS pkgs in your VM (always mention the fact that you're using a VM!) and the pkgs you installed to follow the tutorials have gone out-of-sync.
Try upgrading all ROS pkgs inside the VM and see if that helps.
Partial upgrades are not supported by ROS.

I decided to install a new VM and install ROS on it myself, I found that better than upgrading all ROS pkgs. Now it works!

A:

By re-installing ROS on a new VM I was able to solve the problem.
