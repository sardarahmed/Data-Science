Q:

Hector_quadrotor doesn't respond to "rostopic pub" command

Hi Everyone,
I installed the hector_quadrotor package from source then I ran "roslaunch hector_quadrotor_demo indoor_slam_gazebo"
Finally, I tried to input command velocity using the "rostopic pub" but the quadrotor doesn't respond to the command velocity. I verified via "rqt_graph" that gazebo is connected to the correct topic (/cmd_vel ) and via "rostopic echo /cmd_vel" that data is published to the right topic.
I am using 1.9Gazebo&Gazebo-ROS-packs and hydro ROS installed from binaries for this simulation.
Thank you for any help with this issue

A:

I found my mistake. The motor engine didn't start since i didn't provide positive linear velocity on  the "z" direction. Now it is flying.
