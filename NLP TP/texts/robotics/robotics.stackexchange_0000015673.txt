Q:

How to transfer motion between these two parts?

I'm trying to model this arm and I'm having a problem knowing what way could I use to make the red part always parallel to the surface of the table 

A:

I believe what you are looking for is a 4 bar linkage.  When opposite links are equal in length, they stay parallel.
