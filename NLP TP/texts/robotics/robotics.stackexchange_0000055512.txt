Q:

rosmake error:no such option

Hello, I am recently learning
          http://wiki.ros.org/openni/Contests/ROS%203D/RGBD-6D-SLAM

My system is Ubuntu 12.04 and ros-libfreenect.
This is some error I don't know how to fix it:
           root@ubuntu:~# rosmake --rosdep-install rgbdslam
           Usage: rosmake [options] [PACKAGE]...

           rosmake: error: no such option: --rosdep-install

Could you help me to try it out?
Thank you.

A:

Your error says to you "no such option". On a web site (http://wiki.ros.org/rosmake), it describes that option --rosdep-install is avalable for electric and earlier.  I guess you use fuerte, groovy or hydro. So I think you should try next command, because a web site (http://wiki.ros.org/openni/Contests/ROS%203D/RGBD-6D-SLAM) describes  Compile our package. rosmake rgbdslam
