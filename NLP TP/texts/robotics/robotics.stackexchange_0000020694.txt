Q:

Raspberry pi libraries for fortran

I'm quite a fan of fortran and I was wondering if there were any libraries to control the GPIO pins in a raspberry pi with it. I find python to be quite slow so I think it is the best option for making it fast.

A:

Turns out there is in fact a very simple library called fortran-gpio for exactly that.
Another option is to access GPIO pins through device files, see here for details.
