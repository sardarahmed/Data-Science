in ROS or standalone gazebo? Did you try rosrun gazebo spawn_model?

Standalone gazebo @davinci.

A:

If you have installed Gazebo from debian, then Gazebo should auto-magically import a URDF file. You can use the gzfactory command line tool.

That would have been a very nice thing to document somewhere other than the answers site.
