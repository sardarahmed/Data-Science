Q:

How to use global planner package in hydro-devel navigation?

Hello, I am a newer and have been learning the book of <> .I have tried the gazebo turtlebot_simulation package and also realised navigation using iRobot and hokuyo in Fuerte and Groovy distribution . I found global planner package using A*  algorithm contained in the hydro distribution and hope to have a try.
But i don't know how to change the default "navfn/NavfnROS" object for the param base_global_planner in move_base package .In old navfn package ,class NavfnROS is defined with parameters like /allow_unknown contained in initialization function.I learn that the global planner package can subscribe for the navfn package. however, how to use your param so as to get the plan like befor  ?
Your suggestion would  be appreciated ,thank you@David Lu.

@David Lu Look forwards to your attention and furthermore advice.

A:

Is this all you want to know?
For example, move_base.launch.xml

&ltlaunch>
  &ltinclude file="$(find turtlebot_navigation)/launch/includes/velocity_smoother.launch.xml"/>
  &ltinclude file="$(find turtlebot_navigation)/launch/includes/safety_controller.launch.xml"/>

  &ltarg name="odom_topic" default="odom" />
  &ltarg name="map_topic" default="/map" />
  &ltarg name="scan_topic" default="/base_scan" />

 &ltnode pkg="move_base" type="move_base" respawn="false" name="move_base" output="screen">
    &ltparam name="base_global_planner" value="carrot_planner/CarrotPlanner" /> 
    &ltrosparam file="$(find turtlebot_navigation)/param/move_base_params.yaml" command="load" />
&ltrosparam file="$(find turtlebot_navigation)/param/costmap_common_params.yaml" command="load" ns="global_costmap" />
    &ltrosparam file="$(find turtlebot_navigation)/param/costmap_common_params.yaml" command="load" ns="local_costmap" />
&ltrosparam file="$(find turtlebot_navigation)/param/local_costmap_params.yaml" command="load" />
    &ltrosparam file="$(find turtlebot_navigation)/param/global_costmap_params.yaml" command="load" />
&ltrosparam file="$(find turtlebot_navigation)/param/eband_planner_params.yaml" command="load" />
    &ltparam name="base_local_planner" value="eband_local_planner/EBandPlannerROS" /> 
    &ltparam name="global_costmap/map_topic" value="$(arg map_topic)" />
    &ltremap from="cmd_vel" to="navigation_velocity_smoother/raw_cmd_vel"/>
  </node>
</launch>
