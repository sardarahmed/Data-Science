Q:

clearing all markers / view in RVIZ remotely

Hi,
I'm drawing a lot of markers in rviz to visualize the outcome of an algorithm. As I'm often interrupting/killing it, it's infeasible to keep track of what has been drawn in order to delete it later. Is there any possibility to send something like "wipe" or "clear" to rviz to clear all markers? Currently, I'm sending a message with many markers with action=DELETE but that seems a bit brute force. Is there any better option?
Thanks a lot!

A:

If you are setting markers fairly frequently, perhaps you could set an appropriate lifetime in the Marker message.
Then, rviz would erase them after you kill your node.

Thanks, that could be a workaround. I Just have to think about something when I get a coffee and the algorithm finished in the meantime... ;) It seems there is no other solution (yet)?

The usual solution is to re-use the marker.ns and marker.id values of the obsolete markers, which automatically deletes them as a side-effect.
