Q:

Using std::vector Copy Constructor In a Message

Hello all,
I am attempting the following code:
vector<float> ranges(360, 10); //A vector of 360 '10's
sensor_msgs::LaserScan currentScan;
currentScan.ranges(ranges);   // <---------- Fails

Here is the cryptic error message:

error: no match for call to ‘(std::vector&ltfloat, std::allocator&ltfloat> >) (std::vector&ltfloat,std::allocator&ltfloat> >&)’

I tried googling similar errors but to no avail.  If someone could offer some readings on the failure behind this, I would really appreciate this.  Thank you
Constantin

A:

You can't use copy-constructor syntax because currentScan.ranges has already been constructed (as part of the constructor for sensor_msgs::LaserScan).
Assignment will work, though:
currentScan.ranges = ranges;
