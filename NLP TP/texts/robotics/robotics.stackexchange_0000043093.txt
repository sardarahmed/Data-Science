Q:

ros-fuerte-desktop-full not creating setup.bash, setup.sh, etc

When installing ros fuerte on Ubuntu precise (sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-desktop-full), it's not giving me the various /opt/ros/fuerte/setup.* files.
When I try building from source (which has difficulties for other reasons), then I do get these tools.  Anyone know why the prebuilt distribution isn't giving me the whole thing?  Thanks.

A:

Would you please check the output of the following?
echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

This will output the path you have ros installed in. Also, if you could post this, too:
cat ~/.bashrc | grep ros

For me, I see:
allenh1@muri-pc7:~$ cat ~/.bashrc | grep ros
source /opt/ros/fuerte/setup.bash

If the above line is not output, you are not properly using your ROS path. To remedy this, run the following:
echo "source /opt/ros/fuerte/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc

I have never heard of the installer failing to create "/opt/ros/fuerte/setup.bash"...
This is an interesting scenario...
Try this:
sudo apt-get remove --auto-remove ros-fuerte-*

then reinstall. This should remove all things ros.

The problem is that there is no setup.bash file (or setup.sh, etc).  I did a "sudo apt-get --reinstall install ros-fuerte-ros-comm" and it gave me the various bin/ros* files, but I still don't get the setup.* files.  I then tried "sudo apt-get --reinstall install ros-fuerte-desktop-full" and no luck

"sudo apt-get remove --auto-remove ros-fuerte-desktop-full" then "sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-desktop-full" still doesn't give me the setup* files.  If they're not part of ros-fuerte-desktop-full, then what are they part of?

Try the edited command.

Yes!  Thanks!  There are apparently some ros-fuerte-* debs that should be dependencies of ros-fuerte-desktop-full.
