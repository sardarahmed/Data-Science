Q:

Hokuyo LIDAR data on Graphical Interface

Hi,
I have connected to Hokuyo UST -10LX lidar using ROS. I have installed the necessary wrapper and I could see that Lidar is working properly. When I do
rosrun urg_node urg_node _ip_address:="192.168.0.10" I am able to see a message
Connected to network device with intensity and ID:xxxxxx
Streaming data
I would now like to know how do I capture these data streams on the program to do further computation ?
Also, Is it possible to see the LIDAR data on any graphical interface?
Thanks in advance.

A:

First thing you might need to check is the Topics , Are there any topics with the scan data ?
then Try running >rostopic list and find the "scan" topic
if it is exists, you can take it (the "scan" topic) into RVIZ app in order to visualize scan data (urg_node somehow had already create the frame of reference for you)

Yes thank you, I can see 'scan' topic. But when I installed rviz on Ubuntu, I am getting segmentation fault. I'm not able to open the visualizer.  I am using ros Jade. What do you suggest me to do ?
I set the environment variable OGRE_RTT_MODE to Copy / FBO and checked, it was not helpful.

have you checked the Display Card Driver ? , i don't know exactly the solution but it might be the problem.
