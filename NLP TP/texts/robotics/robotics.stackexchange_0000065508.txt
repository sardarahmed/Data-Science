Q:

possibility of using PCL (Euclidean Cluster Extraction) for object detection

Dear All,
I need to detect objects (1-3) using Kinect at the same time. I did some research but I could not find any package for objects detection in ROS. I want to use depth information as input data and finally calculate distance of objects to camera. For objection detection, do I employ clustering methods? for example, Euclidean Cluster Extraction is provided by PCL so could I use these codes in a ROS node?

A:

An object recognition package (which is now slightly outdated, but still working) is ORK
You can also use Point Cloud Library (PCL). Our research lab uses PCL, as well as specific feature descriptors, such as CVFH. PCL can sometimes be a pain to work with, but it's quite powerful and has some decent descriptors for object recognition.
Look at these pages for more information:

Is there anyway to find moving objects.... whatever the object is ... could be human or any other thing ? I have a kinect 3d camera and usinf ROS indigo?
