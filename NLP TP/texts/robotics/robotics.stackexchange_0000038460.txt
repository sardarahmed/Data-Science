Q:

rosinstall gcc invocations?

I'd like to have the gcc invocations that result from a rosinstall command printed to stdout. Is that possible?

A:

Not that I know of.   rosinstall doesn't call gcc directly, anyways.  it just calls through to rosmake.  Thus, you can have the same net effect by calling rosinstall with -n (no build) and then calling rosmake as you see fit.
rosinstall is moving away from any invocations of build infrastructure starting with ROS Fuerte.  The old calls were a result of bootstrapping issues.  The catkin-based stuff runs rosinstall with no build (-n option).
EDIT: to see the output from rosmake:
VERBOSE=1 rosmake -V

Let me clarify. I'm not really fussed about who calls gcc, but I'd like to see all gcc invocations for a ROS build logged to stdout. What's the best way to do that?

VERBOSE=1 rosmake -V will put all console outputs to screen
