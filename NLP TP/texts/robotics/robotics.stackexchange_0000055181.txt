Q:

Why no ROSCON 2013 videos on youtube?

Youtube works more reliably in more places for me, especially on mobile devices.
I've found the links to vimeo on http://roscon.ros.org/2013/?page_id=14- couldn't there be a OSRF youtube channel with the videos duplicated from vimeo?

While I +1ed, Vimeo Android app works fine with me btw.

A:

Vimeo was chosen for the cleaner interface and the ability to host the videos without ads everywhere. Dual hosting it ends up being just twice as much work.

But most people search on youtube for ros related videos.Many would have watched them if they were in youtube.
