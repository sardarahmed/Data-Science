Q:

behaviortree-cpp not installing using apt

I tried to install behaviortree using sudo apt install ros-noetic-behaviortree-cpp* and got the following error while the system installing it:
Preparing to unpack .../ros-noetic-behaviortree-cpp-v3_3.8.5-1focal.20230814.151

E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)

I tried multiple ways to install it but was unsuccessful.

A:

Acc'd to your output:
dpkg: error processing archive /var/cache/apt/archives/ros-noetic-behaviortree-c
pp-v3_3.8.5-1focal.20230814.151459_amd64.deb (--unpack):
 trying to overwrite '/opt/ros/noetic/bin/bt3_log_cat', which is also in package
 ros-noetic-behaviortree-cpp 4.4.2-1focal.20231128.201059

Internally, the dpkg command is called on the archived file path /var/cache/apt/archives/ros-noetic-behaviortree-c pp-v3_3.8.5-1focal.20230814.151459_amd64.deb. It has an error because it's unable to overwrite /opt/ros/noetic/bin/bt3_log_cat as you install the ros-noetic packages.
It seems that you have a conflicting existing package, i.e. ros-noetic-behaviortree-cpp, and that needs to be purged prior to installing the new packages. Based on your command to install all other packages, my best guess is that it's an older package, hence the conflict.
See man dpkg
Try the following:
# Remove the existing package, -P or --purge
sudo dpkg -P ros-noetic-behaviortree-cpp

Another way to fix this (not recommend), is to simply force the overwrite when installing with dpkg.
# Force overwrite
sudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite /var/cache/apt/archives/ros-noetic-behaviortree-c
pp-v3_3.8.5-1focal.20230814.151459_amd64.deb

In either case, follow up with sudo apt -f install to fix broken pipes (as your output mentions in the following line for dpkg-deb). Then try running your command again.
# Fix broken pipes
sudo apt -f install

# Your command
sudo apt install ros-noetic-behaviortree-cpp*

Hope this helps.
