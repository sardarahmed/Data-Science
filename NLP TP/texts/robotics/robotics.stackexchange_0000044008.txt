Q:

Rgbdslam installation error

Hi guys,
I am new in ROS.
I am trying to install rgbdslam on my laptop.
I have got a following error: '/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lGL' and later I have got 'SiftGPU cannot be compiled. Returned: 2'.
What should I do? help me please.
Thanks in advance

A:

Install all this before building the package rgbdslam,
sudo apt-get install libglew1.5-dev libdevil-dev libsuitesparse-dev libgsl0-dev.
Have you built g2o package?
I think the problem is with openGL. So, try
sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev freeglut3 mesa-common-dev libqt4-opengl binutils-gold
