Q:

Is'nt ROS_INFO_STREAM_THROTTLE signature a little misleading

The definition for ROS_INFO_STREAM_THROTTLE looks like (question valid for all ROS_**_THROTTLE rosconsole macros ):
#define ROS_INFO_STREAM_THROTTLE(rate, args) ......

However, if i put ROS_INFO_STREAM_THROTTLE( 10, "whatever" ) it will be printed every 10 seconds. If i put ROS_INFO_STREAM_THROTTLE( 0.1, "whatever" ) it  will be printed 10 times a second. So unlike ros::Rate where rate means actions per second the macro arg rate here means seconds between the actions. So it is more of a timeout, isn't it? Should maybe it should be renamed like
#define ROS_INFO_STREAM_THROTTLE(rate, args) ......

??
Do you think that would be clearer to the users of the marco?

I think you meant to say #define ROS_INFO_STREAM_THROTTLE(period, args) or something similar? Your 'renamed' statement is now identical to the original one.

A:

That does look confusing/misleading, period does sound more accurate. it's probably worth a ticket to update the documentation/prototype.
