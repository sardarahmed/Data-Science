A:

You can migrate messages in your rosbag. Let's say you have a custom message which had a string in it but in a recent version it changed to a float. Given the old message definition and the new, you can create a rule file automatically and adapt it to tell it how to transform the string correctly. Then you can run rosbag fix and it does all the magic conversion for you. Have a look at the rosbag migration tutorial.
