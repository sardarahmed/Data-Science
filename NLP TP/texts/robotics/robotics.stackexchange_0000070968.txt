A:

The first thing you'll need to do is get your webcam output captured by a ros node and broadcast as an image topic so that other ros nodes can use the images. Take a look at
http://wiki.ros.org/usb_cam
or
http://wiki.ros.org/libuvc_camera
Both should work with a USB web cam. Then when the camera capture node is running you can use Rviz as a quick way to check the images are being published properly. Rviz is a GUI that allows you to visualize ros topics. If you click 'add' in the bottom left of the window and click on the add by topic tab you should see you camera node listed. Selecting this topic will add a new window to Rviz that should show the images from your webcam!
When this is all working you can have a look at the image subscriber tutorial tutorial here:
http://wiki.ros.org/image_transport/Tutorials/SubscribingToImages
to get started manipulating the image data, this is where you might starting playing with OpenCV

You have to add the image topic to Rviz.

After you run Rviz, click on Add button on lower left corner.

Then click 'By topic' and select the correct topic based on your camera topic name. It should look something like:
<camera_name>/Image
