Q:

World and Map Frame for a real robot

I am trying to develop a robot for mapping purposes. Currently, I have a Velodyne VLP16 lidar and an IMU. I am having a bit of a confusion in stating the transforms of the system. For the lidar and IMU, the transforms are supposed to be static and I have defined them using the following:
static_transform_publisher x y z qx qy qz qw frame_id child_frame_id  period_in_ms

How do I define and publish world and amp frame? How do I define the dynamic transforms between world frame and base link?

A:

As you've figured, static transforms are valid for fixed offsets such as sensor positions. They are the minimal solution the more complete recommended solution is to setup a robot model. There's tutorials on that here.
More directly towards your question on how to define the map to base link. That is generally referred to as localization. You will need to run a localization algorithm to keep track of where your robot is in the map. The most common ones are either done in a predefined map, like amcl or by a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm.
There are a lot of tutorials for getting setup, but I recommend the core series here: http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials
Since you didn't clarify in your question if you're using ROS 2 there's a good entry point here: https://navigation.ros.org/ with a first time robot setup guide.
