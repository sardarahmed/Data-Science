Q:

How to plot pose given by ROBOT_POSE_EKF

UBUNTU 12.04 and Fuerte.
I am currently using robot_pose_ekf package to find the pose of the robot equipped with IMU and odometry data.
The graph which is shown in this page is cool.
http://www.ros.org/wiki/robot_pose_ekf
I want to plot in the same way but I am not able to figure out how the graph was plotted.
I tried using rxplot but I was able to plot positions X and Y of one topic in one plot but not both the topics(with EKF and without EKF) in the same plot...I dont want to have time axis too.
Thanks,
Sai

A:

I do not have the exact example handy but you could start from here using Matlab: http://www.ros.org/wiki/pr2_mechanism/Tutorials/Plotting%20controller%20data%20in%20matlab. You will have to adopt the tutorial in that you will log the "robot_pose_ekf/odom_combined" and "base_odometry/odom" topics. From both datasets you will only be interested in the pose.position.[x|y] values and can then plot them using plot(data.pose.position.x, data.pose.position.y) command. If you merge both datasets you can obviously also create 2 plots. D.
