Q:

rosserial arduino rosmake error

Hi there,
I'm new to Arduino and ROS, and I am currently trying to install the rosserial arduino in mac. I've installed homebrew and done everything in this page.
When I try installing the rosserial for Arduino IDE, I got an error for
rosdep install rosserial_arduino

the error was:
rosdep: error: No Valid Packages or stacks listed as arguments

I tried the solution here but when I did the
rosmake rosserial_arduino

I got an error saying:
[rosmake] WARNING: The following args could not be parsed as stacks or packages: ['rosserial_arduino']
[rosmake] ERROR: No arguments could be parsed into valid package or stack names 

And sure enough when I check the Arduino IDE I still couldn't find the ros_lib in the Examples menu.
Please help me with this problem. Thanks

A:

This sounds a lot like your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environment variable is not set correctly. Are you sure your 'rosserial_arduino' package is inside a directory that is known to ROS via ROS_PACKAGE_PATH as described here?

Hi, I've tried setting the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH as describe in your link (export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/user/ros/ros-pkg) however when I was trying this http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment, when I get to the 2nd step (the source one) it says No such file or dir
