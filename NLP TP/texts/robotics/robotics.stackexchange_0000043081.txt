Connection retry strategy?

Are they any REPs or other documentation describing retry strategies for topics and services?

A:

I don't believe there are generic connection retries implemented at the moment.  There was some logic to do so, but it's only experimental.

Thanks, Tully. I think maybe we can roll this into the ROS 2.0 SIG then. Or at least explicitly leave it out :)
