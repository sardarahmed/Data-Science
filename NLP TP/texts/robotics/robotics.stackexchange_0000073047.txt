Q:

ROS Navigation Package Error

Hello I just installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my Raspberry Pi 2 and installed the Ros-Base(Bare bones). After that when I try to install the navigation package (sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-navigation) it downloads everything well but during unpacking it gives the following error :
libqt4-opengl-dev depends on libgles2-mesa-dev
Package libgles2-mesa-dev is not installed.

A:

After a lot of research, I found this link and followed it. It then worked for it! You just need to replace the name of your package with package described there and that's it!
