Q:

Permission to fly UAVs

Okay, this might sound like a stupid question but, is there some sort of a permission in the US I might require to fly a quadcopter or a UAV for that matter? I couldn't find much help anywhere else.  

A:

Disclaimer: IANAL.
For the US law, small UAVs are analogous to RC models and the regulation depends on the use intent.
For non-commercial, recreational use, the law is relatively permissive and mostly relies on the rules of the Academy of Model Aeronautics. You can find their rules here: http://www.modelaircraft.org/documents.aspx
For commercial use, the UAV currently must be certified like a manned aircraft, which is impossible in practice for small UAVs. Until recently, this has rendered the commercial exploitation of UAVs impossible in US. The parliament has been tasked to design laws to permit commercial exploitation of UAVs by 2015 at the latest. At the moment, it's possible for government agencies and university to obtain special permits through Certificates of Authorization. Other ways of demoing/using UAS are also being put in place (testing fields, lightweight certification process, etc.), but it will be difficult to have a clear picture for the next year or two. To complicate the picture, several states are in the process of passing restrictive laws related, e.g., to privacy, so the situation may end up being state dependent.
