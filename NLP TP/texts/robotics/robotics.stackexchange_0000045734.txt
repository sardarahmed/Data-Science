Q:

Fusing different laser scanners

Hi,
I want implement a collision warning system based on 3 different laser scanners for a mobile robot. Hence I plan to fuse all scan messages in a new one that combines just measurements smaller than 80cm.
Now I define a new scan topic, with the smallest resolution of the 3 scanners and match the measurements on it. Is there a more smart solution for this problem?
Best wishes

A:

Yes, use a PointCloud2 for that.
Fusing different LaserScans is a really bad idea as a LaserScan message assumes distances around a central point in regular angles. You can't combine multiple lasers and still retain this.
