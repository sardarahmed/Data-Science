Q:

Cannot view image using image_view on ubuntu 14.04

I have ros indigo installed on ubuntu 14.04. When I run the command
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/cam1/image_raw

I get the error
/opt/ros/indigo/lib/image_view/image_view: error while loading shared libraries: libavcodec.so.53: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

How do I get past this ?

A:

It looks like image_view is trying to load an old library. Are you sure all of your packages are up to date?
Try:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
