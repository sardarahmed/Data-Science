Q:

Hello, I'm installing groovy now.
After running "rosdep update" it show error as follows:
$ rosdep update

What does rosdep --version print?
Comment by Beel on 2013-04-29:
On my Ubuntu 12.04 system, loaded and updated yesterday and today, rosdep --version gives 0.10.14.  ...a few hours later ...And now, after the repository update mentioned below, the version is 0.10.18, and running "rosdep update" does not give any error messages.

A:

You are not using the latest version of that package. Please update "rosdep" - on Ubuntu/Debian using "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install python-rosdep" (at least version 0.10.18).
Rosdep has recently changed and requires a newer version since than (see http://code.ros.org/lurker/message/20130423.025734.7689bd35.en.html).

This error still occurs with the latest version of rosdep, after doing the updates and installs, a couple of hours ago. I should say, it still occurs after doing those commands to update python-rosdep.  I am booting up my Ubuntu 12.04 on my Beagleboard to see - rosdep --version shows, 0.10.14

The current version of rosdep is 0.10.18

@tfoote - see comment from ahendrix below. I will update my system tomorrow morning in hopes that it will be fixed.
