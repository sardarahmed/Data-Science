Q:

Building a project depending on ros.org platform

I'm new to ros and trying to do:
 cmake CMakeLists.txt

this file includes some ros libraries but I have an error:
[rosbuild] Building package mypackage
CMake Error at /opt/ros/cturtle/ros/core/rosbuild/private.cmake:119 (message):
  [rosbuild] rospack found package "mypackage" at "", but the current
  directory is "/home/mypackage/code".  You should
  double-check your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH to ensure that packages are found in the
  correct precedence order.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /opt/ros/cturtle/ros/core/rosbuild/public.cmake:157 (_rosbuild_check_package_location)
  CMakeLists.txt:12 (rosbuild_init)

-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

A:

Did you go through the beginner tutorials? That should tell you how to properly make a ROS package.
From your error messages:

Don't call cmake directly. Use make or rosmake.

Are you using cturtle? I think you system setup might be inconsistent.
