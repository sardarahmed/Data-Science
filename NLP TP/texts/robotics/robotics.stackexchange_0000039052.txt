Q:

Rospack command not found in makefile when trying to build

Hello,
I'm a beginner with ROS and I'm having trouble to build my first packages.
If a use 'rosmake rxtools', for example, I get a 'rospack failed to build' message.
I haven't found how to solve this so I tried to manually make this package, by going to its root directory and running 'make'. When I do this, I get the following message:
sudo make
make: rospack: Command not found
Makefile:1: /cmake.mk: No such file or directory
make: *** No rule to make target `/cmake.mk'.  Stop.

The Makefile looks like
include $(shell rospack find mk)/cmake.mk

So, it seems to me that the rospack command can not be found inside the makefile. I did some little test modifications in the makefile trying to verify this:
test=$(shell rospack find mk)
#include $(shell rospack find mk)/cmake.mk
all:
    @echo Command result: $(test)

Which gives me this result:
make: rospack: Command not found
Command result:

But I have no idea of why the rospack command cannot be found, neither how to solve this.
I'll really appreciate any sugessitons about how to continue to debug this.

Solved this, it was a permission problem when trying to build.
