Q:

ROS_PACKAGE_PATH doesn't save

Hello everybody!
I've a problem with ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.
First I tried to ad the path to my workspace with this command line
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
After I check the PATH
echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
And It's OK :
/home/andrei/catkin_ws/src:/opt/ros/indigo/share:/opt/ros/indigo/stacks
BUT
But there no more the path to recently added directory when I close the terminal or I open a new terminal Tab.
How do you think, where is my mistake?
Thank you!!!!

A:

This is completely normal behaviour. Either resource it every time or add the source... line to your ~/.bashrc, so it is done automatically.
