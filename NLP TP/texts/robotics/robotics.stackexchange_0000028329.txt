A:

You have a few options:

Since you're using ROS, you can publish to /gazebo/set_model_state, here's a tutorial.

Or you could use Gazebo transport and publish a message to the ~/model/modify topic

Finally, you can always write a world plugin which sets the pose of objects in the world. Here's a tutorial.

Is there a way to rotate all Objects with one command? Or do i need to publish all states and positions of each Object?

It depends on your model's kinematic structure, as mentioned on an answer to another question, I suggest you get familiar with Gazebo's model concepts before trying to control models ;)
