Q:

build executable with msg

I'm trying to build a source file using a message belonging to the same package.
In Package A

bb.cpp
cc.msg

The problem is that bb.cpp includes the header file of cc.msg - cc.h
when I start to build as 'winros_make'
it looks executables are built before the messages in there.
i think messages should be built first and then executables be.
there are any way to build message first? so executable can access the header file of them.

A:

You can add a dependency line to your CMakeLists.txt which declares that your executable depends on building messages:
add_dependencies(your_program ${your_package_EXPORTED_TARGETS})

For a more detailed explanation, see the building messages howto
