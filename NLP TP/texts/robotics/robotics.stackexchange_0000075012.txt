Q:

ROS kinetic packages missing in ubuntu 16.04

Looking at the ROS binary package files, considerable amount of ROS packages are missing in ubuntu 16.04 (compared to 15.04)
http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu/dists/vivid/main/binary-amd64/Packages
http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu/dists/xenial/main/binary-amd64/Packages
Ubuntu Vivid 15.04 had 926 ROS jade packages and ubuntu Xenial 16.04 only has 548 packages.
Following are some missing packages of interest.

ros--object-recognition-linemod
ros--object-recognition-renderer
ros--object-recognition-tabletop
ros--moveit-*  - 16 packages
ros--arbotix-*
ros--dynamixel-*

Not sure if this removal (and possible merge) of packages is intended.

A:

Not all packages have been released yet for kinetic. Most of the probably will within the next few months.
Those packages are, afaik, all not maintained by OSRF, so it is up to the various maintainers to release them.
Alternative could be to try to install them from source.
You can check on this page what packages are currently released for kinetic.

I see, thanks. It would be more informative if this was mentioned in the install wiki - Debian wiki shows up a caution message. But http://www.ros.org/install/ recommends kinetic for latest, and there is no caution message in ubuntu wiki http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu

I agree this could be given some emphasis, but it's also partly common sense (imho): new releases of Ubuntu / Debian / Fedora also don't all immediately come with the full set of packages that earlier versions included. The same holds for ROS.
