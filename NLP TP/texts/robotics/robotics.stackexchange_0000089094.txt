Q:

My virtual machine can't ping itself

Hello,
I'm using Ubuntu indigo 14.04 with Oracle VirtualBox 5.2.18 and I have a problem with my Virtual machine which can't ping itself but can ping all the network. Also, the other computers can ping each other but can't ping the virtual machine.
My network is composed by : 2 virtual machines (chloe and another one) on the main station, the main station, a first router, the second router in client mode, an Advantech computer on a robot and Ubuntu on this computer (efim).
So, from chloe, I can ping all of this stuff but not chloe itself. I had the issue : "Destination Host Unreachable" while I'm just pinging chloe itself.
In the settings, I choose NAT for the Virtual Machine.
Moreover, I tried a
roswtf 

and I have the following warning :
  ROS_HOSTNAME may be incorrect: ROS_HOSTNAME [chloe] resolves to [192.168.0.6], which does not appear to be a local IP address ['127.0.0.1', '10.0.2.15', '192.168.1.2', '169.254.7.89'].

What I did after this is :
for main station
    export ROS_HOSTNAME=chloe
    export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://chloe:11311

for advantech
    export ROS_HOSTNAME=efim
    export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://chloe:11311

But after I have an error saying :
  ROS_MASTER_URI is not set for this machine

Anyone can help me please ?
Thanks.

So ping 192.168.0.6 in a terminal doesn't work?
If so, this is not really a ROS question I'm afraid.
If this is a ROS question, then please provide more details on your network setup. We'll need full IP/netmask and network topology (ie: what is connected to what).
A diagram may help.

Yes, ping 192.168.0.6 doesn't work in a terminal.
I have one diagram but I'm new and I can't add picture.

re: attaching images: I've just given you sufficient karma for that.
re: ping doesn't work: that would point to an issue with your network configuration. Are you sure that is the correct IP?

may you post output of "ifconfig"

A:

It's okay now, the IP was wrong so I changed it in the settings and now it's working.
Thank you !
