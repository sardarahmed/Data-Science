Q:

ROS2 : SDF to URDF

This question gets asked a lot. But no clear answer on a ROS2 solution it seems.
Is there any ROS2 tool to convert a sdf into a urdf ?

A:

Not quite an answer to the question, but in ROS 2 Rolling (which eventually will become Galactic) the package sdformat_urdf allows one to use SDFormat instead of URDF for a robot description in ROS (with some limitations): https://github.com/ros/sdformat_urdf . There are some examples here: https://github.com/sloretz/drake_ros2_demos/ (the examples also use Drake, but Drake isn't a requirement of sdformat_urdf).
