Q:

What is max_obstacle_height param in costmap_common of navigation stack?

Wiki gives this definition:The maximum height in meters of a sensor reading considered valid. This is usually set to be slightly higher than the height of the robot. Setting this parameter to a value greater than the global max_obstacle_height parameter has no effect. Setting this parameter to a value less than the global max_obstacle_height will filter out points from this sensor above that height.
I understand that any data read by this sensor above this height will be filtered out , why this parameter needed in a planar scanner ?
am i understanding this in wrong way ?
