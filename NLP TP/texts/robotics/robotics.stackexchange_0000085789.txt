Q:

How can I find the index of the cell from map coordinates?

Hi
I have the (x,y,z) position of the map. From that information, how can I find the cell index and also costmap value(free, obstacle ...) related to this coordinates ?
thanks

Hi David, I could not understand your solution proposal. Let me explain the case better. I have a position(x,y,z) of a map on Rviz. And from that position information, I want to first find related cell index(I m no sure, if gridcell or costmap).Than I want to change this cost value manually.

Do you have a Costmap2dROS object that you are manipulating in code?

No I don t have.
I try to get the position of the related grid from the position of the interactive marker that I put on the Rviz (map). And change the value of this grid.
