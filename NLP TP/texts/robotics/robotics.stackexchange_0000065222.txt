Q:

UR5 use moveit interface to move robot

Hi,
I would like to move the UR5 Robot with the move_group python interface. I used the interface with the pr2 Robot and it's working fine.
Here is the interface Tutorial page: http://docs.ros.org/hydro/api/pr2_moveit_tutorials/html/planning/scripts/doc/move_group_python_interface_tutorial.html
When i would like to use the python interface with the UR5 then I do it like this:
roslaunch ur5_moveit_config demo.launch
python move_group_python_interface_tutorial.py

The robot is loading in RVIZ perfectly. When it starts the interface it's looking like this:
============ Starting tutorial setup
[ INFO] [1421497007.277703461]: Loading robot model 'ur5'...

    self._g = _moveit_move_group_interface.MoveGroup(name, "robot_description")
RuntimeError: Group 'left_arm' was not found.

Of course, i know that i haven't got a left arm on the ur5. But what else i have write in there? Or is there any better idea how to move the robot with moveit?
Thank you very much for your help =)

A:

Note: I'm assuming you are using the ur5_moveit_config package from the universal_robot repository from ROS-Industrial.

I don't really understand what you are asking.
First you say:

Of course, i know that i haven't got a left arm on the ur5 [..]

which is true. But then:

But what else i have write in there?

Which doesn't really make sense. To solve this 'problem', you'll just have to make sure the code is using the correct group name, which is defined in the ur5.srdf file (more precisely, on lines 12 to 14). In this case, that name is manipulator, as is the case for all MoveIt configurations that were created by the ROS-Industrial project.
