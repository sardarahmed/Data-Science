Q:

OpenGL and the PR2

Can anyone suggest how to create an OpenGL function (no OGRE dependencies) that renders the PR2?  That is, I hope to construct a function that looks like:
void openGLRenderPR2 (JointState);
I imagine this would be of use to many people who are using visualization tools outside of rviz (and without OGRE dependencies).
Thanks!
Mike

A:

It is actually not that easy. You first need to read in the robot description from urdf, there is a library for doing so. Then you to load all meshes. rviz used to use assimp for doing that. Finally, you need a tf listener to get the current pose of all links specified in the urdf.
I implemented the functionality for rendering the PR2 in common lisp, stack cram_physics and I think Bosch's pr2_camera_self_filter contains some code for rendering the PR2 in C++.
