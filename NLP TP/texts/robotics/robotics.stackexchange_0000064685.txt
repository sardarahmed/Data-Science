Q:

Hydro on Yosemite catkin python-em

Would anyone be able to suggest why I get this error and how I could debug it to try make Hydro from source? In that directory there is __init__py __init__.pyc locale tests. This is at step 2.1.3 here.
-- catkin 0.5.89

A:

I seemed to have got around this issue by copying the file em.py that was just lying around in /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages into the em folder, and renaming it to __main__.py

Looks like you've made it now with those two question.

not quite, it failed at about package 170/200 after a lot of painstaking modification of files in packages that were attempting to be installed. I imagine packages will be fixed up eventually to work, fingers crossed.
