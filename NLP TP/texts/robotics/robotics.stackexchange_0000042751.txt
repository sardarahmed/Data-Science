Q:

ROS_Environments for Hector_SLAM

I'm in the process of learning ROS with a specific target of using Hector_SLAM. I'm using rosws and have made workspaces, directories, etc. I am now exploring Hector_SLAM with its multiple stacks and I am wondering a best protocol either:
A) making a unique workspace for Hector_SLAM
B) using an existing workspace but making a unique dirctory
Etc.
I would appreciate some thoughts here.

A:

You can do whatever fits your work-flow. For many people the simplicity of a single workspace is best.
I use multiple workspaces, because I maintain packages on several ROS distros. Never mix distros within a single workspace.
It is better to open a new shell when you need to switch workspaces.

Thanks for the input. I can see where multiple workspaces across different distros would be a great approach. I'm still trying to work out if projects with many stacks would be better serviced if kept in their own workspace or just within a dedicated directory within a shared workspace. Cheers!

When using tools like rosws, I would keep each workspace flat.
