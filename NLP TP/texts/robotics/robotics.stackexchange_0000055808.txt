Q:

ROS umet dependency libboost-1.46

Hi
I currently have ROS Groovy installed on ubuntu 12.04. I am trying to install another library which needs libboost-1.48-all-dev, however installing ROS has installed the libbost-1.46-all-dev.
Is it possible to upgrade the boost library without getting problems with ROS ?
Because the third party library won't install without libboost 1.48 being on the system

A:

If you want to change the version of boost used you will need to build ROS from source. When you do that it should work fine.
