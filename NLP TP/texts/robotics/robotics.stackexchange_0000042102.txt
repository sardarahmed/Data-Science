Q:

Get OutOfMemoryError when using OccupancyGridLayer to display map

Hi all,
I run my program on a real device with 1GB memory. I tried to use OccupancyGridLayer to display map message i got from robot. However, after about 10s processing, I got OutOfMemoryError and the app was forced to stop. Does anyone have the same problem? Is there any way to solve this problem?
Thanks a lot!

Could you include the map parameters for the map you trying to display (size in x and y, pixels/meter, etc)? Basically the MapMetaData that goes along with the OccupancyGrid message you are trying to display.

Hi, thanks for the reply. Here is the data:
width = 428
height = 580
resolution = 0.025
map load time = 0:0

I'm in the process of addressing this issue. See http://code.google.com/p/rosjava/issues/detail?id=131
