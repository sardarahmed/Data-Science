Q:

Datarange Float32 xyz-values in pointcloud2 for kinect

Hi everyone,
I'm working to get the data values of the xyz components out of the pointcloud2 in a bagfile made from kinect with openni_kinect. I was wondering however what the datarange for these values are, to be able to see if my results make any sense. Are these values in meters (so 3.4 for 3.4m) or different?

A:

Yes the units are meters. The standard units are defined in REP 103
If anything does not comply with REP 103 it should be heavily documented at all levels to avoid confusion.
