Q:

joint state publisher's zeros parameter

Hello!
Could somebody please provide me a correct yaml file for ros joint state publisher's zeros parameter?
In the description of joint_state_publisher it is written:
zeros (Dict mapping Strings to Floats, default: {})

Dictionary to specify some joints' 'zero position' (since hydro) 

I thought of something like this, but it's not working:
zeros:
joint1: {0.5}
joint2: {0.6}

Here you have the joint state publisher's code

A:

Two ways to get a dictionary (key, value) on the ROS parameter server: loading a correctly formatted yaml file, or in-line in a rosparam for the node (in this case, joint_state_publisher).

zeros:

joint1: {0.5}
joint2: {0.6}

If that is the actual formatting, then that won't work in either case. The whole zeros parameter should be a dictionary, not its individual elements (which you are doing by adding the curly braces ({, }).
In a yaml (note indentation):
zeros:
  joint1: 0.5
  joint2: 0.6

in-line in launch file:
<node type="joint_state_publisher" ..>
  <rosparam>
    zeros:
      joint1: 0.5
      joint2: 0.6
  </rosparam>
</node>

In both cases indentation is required for the parser to create a proper dictionary out of the yaml.
