Q:

RGBD Slam Stereo Setup

Hi - I want to use RGBD Slam using a Stereo Setup.
I changed already the topics in the launch file, but when I start the RGBD GUI nothing happens.
Here is my launch file:
<launch>
  <node pkg="rgbdslam" type="rgbdslam" name="rgbdslam" cwd="node" required="true" output="log"> 

    <param name="config/camera_info_topic"             value="/stereo_camera/camera_info"/>
    <param name="config/wide_topic"                    value="/stereo_camera/left/image_mono"/>
    <param name="config/wide_cloud_topic"              value="/stereo_camera/points2"/>

[...]
  </node>
</launch>

A:

I have been removed from RGBD slam for a while, so sorry if I lead you in a wrong direction. I think that your problem might be in the point cloud topic. Are you using the stereo_img_proc node? I think that using the /disparity topic worked for me.
