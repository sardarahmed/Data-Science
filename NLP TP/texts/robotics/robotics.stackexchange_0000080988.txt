Q:

P2OS for ROS Kinetic on Debian Stretch

Hello,
I'm working on a Pioneer-3dx and was hoping to use the sonar data (as we only have sonar on it yet) to make it follow a moving object. I know I could juste use RosAria to get informations from the sonar but I also need to simulate it on Gazebo, thus I was advised p2os.
The problem is that I can't find a way to get p2os on Kinetic ROS for Debian Stretch. If someone could help me or provide me a link, I would warmly thank him.

Did you try to sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-p2os*? There are debians generated for it.

A:

As far as I know, referenced in both the targeted platforms page and the installation instructions for Debian Kinetic, Kinetic only supports Debian Jessie. ROS Lunar and Melodic will support Debian Stretch, as can be seen on the install instructions for Debian Lunar. I believe you can compile Kinetic from source on Stretch, but I probably recommend going through that trouble.
After going through the Lunar install setup for Debian Stretch, you should be able to install via
$ sudo apt install ros-lunar-p2os*
