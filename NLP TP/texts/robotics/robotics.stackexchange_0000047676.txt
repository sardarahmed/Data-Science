but it's unable to display the color,here are my codes
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{

  ros::init(argc, argv, "talker");

  ros::NodeHandle n;

  ros::Publisher chatter_pub = n.advertise<std_msgs::ColorRGBA>("chatter", 1000);

  while(ros::ok())
  {
    std_msgs::ColorRGBA color;

    color.r = 255;
    color.g = 0;
    color.b = 0;
    color.a = 1;
 
    //draw.colors.push_back(color)

    ROS_INFO("%s","visualisation_kit");

A:

In your code, you are advertising the messages on the topic "chatter". From your description, it appears you want to publish on the topic "visualisation_kit":
ros::Publisher chatter_pub = n.advertise<std_msgs::ColorRGBA>("visualisation_kit", 1000);

A good tool to debug the input and output topics of your nodes is rosnode. In your case, for example, type this in a console window after executing your "talker" node:
rosnode info talker
