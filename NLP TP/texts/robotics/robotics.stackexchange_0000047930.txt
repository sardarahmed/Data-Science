Q:

NAO or ROMEO aldebran robot in V-rep

Hello guys,
I would like an opinion about the state of the art of 3D simulator.
I'm going to work with aldebaran robots NAO and ROMEO and I have to choose a simulation environment where to simulate those robots. The main candidates are:

Gazebo / MoveIt

V-rep

Webots

The real choice is between the first two simulators since they are completely open sources.
I would like an opinion from you about these two simulators and if there are existing models of the two robots above-mentioned.
In addition, I have to mention that I have to use those simulators also for motion planning (that I see this feature is included in V-rep while I have to use MoveIt for Gazebo).
I really appreciate if you give me an opinion with strength point / drawbacks of each of them from your experience.
Thanks in advance,
Neostek
P.S. Obviously, other simulators are welcome!

Hello there,
Since some time now, Aldebaran Robotics is delivering a SDK-simulator allowing you to connect with any simulator.
If you need more information, I'll be happy to help.
