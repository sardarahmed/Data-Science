Q:

Alternatives to cameras for a dirt sensor for an autonomous vacuum robot?

When I use a standard manual vacuum, I often notice that I have to pass over a spot several times because a single pass does not necessarily catch all the dirt.  My eyes/brain can easily perceive this information visually, but I don't know how an autonomous robot vacuum can detect whether a pass over a patch of dirt was successful or not.  What kind of sensor/action can I use to determine if the robot vacuum successfully picked up the dirt from a particular patch?  
I would prefer to avoid a visual camera if at all possible because it would necessarily have to be mounted above the robot and thereby limit the range of reachable locations.  Is there some other low-cost sensor that can accomplish the same task that can be placed low to the ground?

A:

If you want a robotic vacuum, and are not dead-set on building the base platform, you can always buy a Roomba and hack it.  The "Open Interface" of the Create works with any model Roomba.  
And yes, the Roomba has piezoelectric-based dirt detection.
