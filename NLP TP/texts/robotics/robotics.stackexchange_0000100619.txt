Q:

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cv_bridge' IN windows10 running foxy

I was following this tutorial https://automaticaddison.com/getting-started-with-opencv-in-ros-2-foxy-fitzroy-python/ to implement a simple ros2 image publisher and subscriber. everything was built but then when I launched the node it gave the error (cv_bridge not found).
I am on Windows10 running Ros2 (Foxy).
please help me solve this
PROGRESS....
after that, i found a cv_bridge git repo https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_opencv/tree/ros2
so i cloned it and colcon build it but then it is giving me the following error
Starting >>> cv_bridge

--- stderr: cv_bridge

A:

There is no need to install cv_bridge from source if you are using ROS on Windows.
Check rospack find cv_bridge if has been properly installed.
Please refer to this thread for more info: https://github.com/ms-iot/ROSOnWindows/issues/317
