This seems like a cross-post of ros-planning/moveit#2020. Please don't do that.

Hi gvdhoom,
Thank you for your valuable response.
I will adjust the topic, as there are several issues in various configurations that I experience when trying to set up basic environment.
Will that work for you ?
Regards,
Andrei

It's not really a valuable response at all. However, it is a necessary one, as cross-posting is counterproductive.
My suggestion would be to either close this post, or the one on the MoveIt issue tracker. If you have more information, expand the post you decide to keep.

@gvdhoom. The issue have been resolved. How do I close the current thread?

A:

Reinstalled OS: Bionic 18.04 armhf;
Following https://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-desktop-full ros-melodic-moveit ros-melodic-panda-moveit-config -y
echo "source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
sudo apt install python-rosdep python-rosinstall python-rosinstall-generator python-wstool build-essential

then I created a folder at ~ name_ws, copied github package to src, initiated rosdep init and rosdep update
somehow works;
resolved
