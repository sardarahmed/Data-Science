Q:

Is it possible to get GPS data from AR.Drone with Flight Recorder in ardrone_autonomy?

I'm using AR.Drone with Flight Recorder (witch enable geolocation using the GPS module).
I installed ardrone_autonomy and very pleased with it.
But there is no GPS data in topics published.
However, using QGroundControl, I can connect to AR.Drone and get GPS data in GLOBAL_POSITION_INT packet, so I can get GPS data in my program with MAVLINK.
The problem is that I can't use ardrone_autonomy and MAVLINK connection simultaniously.
When I start ardrone_autonomy, I loose connection in QGroundControl (MAVLINK).
So my question is about possibility of reading GPS data from AR.Drone with ardrone_autonomy or using ardrone_autonomy simultaniously with MAVLINK connection?

A:

As both @jjwiseman and @jcerruti mentioned, there is experimental support for GPS through "Parrot Flight Recorder" peripheral in ardrone_autonomy driver. It publishes data received from GPS and exposes a service to do GPS based waypoint navigation on-board. GPS Support section of gps-waypoint branch documentation provides more information.
Update: GPS support was added to the driver by patching the official SDK. Therefor, it's possible to trigger on-board GPS based waypoint navigation with the driver while simultaneously access video footage over Wifi.
