Q:

Generalized Voronoi graph (any package?)

hello,
I need to obtain a generalized Voronoi graph (GVG) from a grid map (like described here: http://www.sfbtr8.uni-bremen.de/project/r3/HGVG/hierarchicalVGraphs.html#Ref_2).
I have implemented my own node, but there still some tricks to solve and is not very efficient (i have used opencv libraries (cv::distanceTransform) but to obtain GVG from GVD there are lots of tricks).
Anyone knows any package that process the generalized Voronoi graph from the map?
Regards

A:

There is some code for dynamic updates of Voronoi & distance maps in alufr-ros-pkg, with some more information here:
http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~lau/dynamicvoronoi/
Maybe there is also code for Voronoi graphs in there.
