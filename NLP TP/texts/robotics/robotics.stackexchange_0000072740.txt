Q:

How to call a service with a char argument

How do you pass a char to rosservice call?
I have a srv file like:
uint8 id
string data
---

exposed as /myservice which I'd like to call like rosservice call /myservice m '!!str mydata' but this gives me a Python traceback to the autogenerated code for my srv class:
UnboundLocalError: local variable '_x' referenced before assignment

presumably because it doesn't convert "m" to the uint8 value 109. The docs declare char is deprecated because it's essentially the same thing as uint8.
Is there a way to explicitly declare this type, or do I have to pass in a literal int value?

A:

I am not familiar with the way you call the service.
I usually do it this way

rosservice call /myservice '{id: A,
data: ok}'

I tried that hash notation, but that gives me the error, "expected [id, data]. I guess it assumes a list notation for custom services?
