Q:

When will rosdoc_lite be released to Hydro?

I do most of my work on Hydro lately. It mostly works fine.
But, it's very annoying having to switch to a Groovy workspace for working on documentation.
Any estimate for when a Hydro version might be released?

A:

I just released it today.  It should be built in the next few hours into shadow-fixed and will go into the next hydro sync to public.
PS a better forum is probably ros-release for this sort of request.

Thanks, Tully! I'll do that for similar issues in the future. I considered opening an issue, but that seemed more "demanding" than I wanted.

We basically need a request for package release/call for maintainership process.  And I hope to use the ros-release list for that.

Seems reasonable.

I'll maintain rosdoc_lite, if you want. I might ask for help in a few areas, but I can do most of the release and maintenance work.

That would be great.  I'll set you up with permissions.
