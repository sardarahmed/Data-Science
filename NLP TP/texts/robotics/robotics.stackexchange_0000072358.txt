Hi,
Use the updated demo_stereo_outdoor.launch from 0.10.12, not the one installed by 0.10.10. Just download the launch file, you would not need to rebuild rtabmap from source.
The old launch file is broken because of the new RGBD/OptimizeMaxError parameter. Either set RGBD/OptimizeMaxError to 0 under the rtabmap node or use the launch file above.
cheers
