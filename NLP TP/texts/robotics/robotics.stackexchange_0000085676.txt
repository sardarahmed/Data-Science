Q:

How to auto deploy a robot?

Hey ,
I want to know how the robot can be configured to start on bootup .
There are a handful of scripts which i want running in a proper order

roscore
node that accepts cmd_vel and publishes tf
freenect node
node that launches the description of the robot (ie URDF)
node that launches the navigation related modules
nodes that pertain to IMU data

How do i run all of the above nodes at startup , how do i make sure that if any of them fails ,then it will be rerun ?

UPDATE

I have added respawn param and set it to true for the rosserial_python node , it still doesn't recover when crashing .

Please don't use screenshots for text. Images are not searchable, you can't copy and paste them, and you can't search them. Please update your question with a copy and paste of the error instead using the preformatted text (101010) button.

I think the rosserial_python/respawn problem should be handled in a separate question. It also needs more information, your image doesn't really show a crashing node, just a communication problem

A:

You can do a roslaunch to run all of these nodes and start the launch file with a script for exemple.
Moreover, if a node fail you can launch it again by setting the attribute respawn of the tag <node> to true like that :
<node name="listener1" pkg="rospy_tutorials" type="listener.py" args="--test" respawn="true" />

That will restart your node until it runs properly.
Check here to see all the attributes of the tag, some might help you !

How do i add respawn for freenect?
<include file="$(find freenect_launch)/launch/freenect.launch" />

we cant add a respawn parameter when we include other launch files .

Copy the content of the freenect.launch into your own launch file and add the respawn attribute to the desired nodes (don't modify the freenect.launch it's not recommended at all to modify from source)
