Q:

PCL Segmentation in ROS: Missing headers

I tried to split a pointcloud into segments by using PCL in fuerte but, for example, the file "min_cut_segmentation.h" is missing. I tried it with ros-fuerte-perception-pcl-fuerte-unstable getting the same problem.
Is there a way to use those segmentations from PCL within ROS ?
############### Edit 01: ###############
There is no error message in this case. The include files for (most) PCL-segmentation are just not there within ROS, but they are in the standalone version of PCL. As far as I can tell there seems to be no way to use those files out of the standalone version within ROS.
############## Edit 02:
http://svn.pointclouds.org/ros/branches/fuerte/perception_pcl_unstable/
Now it works

Please always copy-paste the complete error message and make sure you read the support guidelines.

A:

As far as I know, min_cut_segmentation.h is not in perception_pcl in ROS. You can find it in PCL 1.7 source code.
