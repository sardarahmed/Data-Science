Q:

DRCSIM: topics not listed in UserGuide

Will the following topics be available in the VRC (in particular /tf)?

/rosout
/rosout_agg
/tf
/tf2_buffer_server/cancel
/tf2_buffer_server/feedback
/tf2_buffer_server/goal
/tf2_buffer_server/result
/tf2_buffer_server/status
/tf_static

What do tf2_msgs and actionlib_msgs do? The ROS documentation is a little unclear.
Something to do with bringing up the robot, and trajectories (that are now "depracated"?)

Thanks,
Chris

A:

Yes, all of those topics will be available in the VRC.  The User Guide has been updated to include them.

The tf_static and tf2_buffer_server/* topics are provided by the tf2_buffer_server tool, part of tf2.  This is an experimental tool, without any user-facing documentation.  In a nutshell, tf2 is a more flexible, and, in some cases, more efficient implementation of tf.  The tf2_buffer_server/* topics constitute an actionlib interface, which is a sort of asynchronous request/reply mechanism.  You can use this interface to ask the tf_buffer_server for coordinate transforms without having to subscribe to /tf yourself.
