Q:

How to generate an external library to work in the ROS as the thirdparty file?

Dear all:
Today, I generated an external library using Eclipse, but I want to make it working as the thirdparty file, which is similar as gvars or libvcd in the ethzal_ptam package, but I did not have the file like configure file in them! How to do it?
Thanks!!
BTW: the whole process is below steps:
1. I generate an empty Shared Library project, and then write my class files(.h and .cpp, no main function), after compiled it, I got my library .so!
2. I copy the whole files(include the library) to the thirdparty in the ethzal_ptam, and copy the makefile from the gvars3, modify it similarly, it seems the Eclipse has make it successful, but when I use the function in that library, it could not work, how could I solve it?

A:

There is a wiki entry that describes how to use third party libraries.
However, I'm not sure what you want to do from your description. If you are actually writing the library code yourself, you could just make it a ROS library (unless you'd like it standalone of course, then wrap it as described above).
