Q:

Turtlebot Simulator SLAM problem

Dear,
I followed the tutorial about building a SLAM map using Turtlebot Simulator. After creating the package, I type:
roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo_tutorial build_map.launch
But it says:
ResourceNotFound: turtlebot_navigation
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/home/viki/sim_workspace/unversioned
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks
ROS path [3]=/opt/ros/fuerte/share
ROS path [4]=/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros
Would anyone help me? I am using VirtualBox OVA provided by Nootrix. Thank you very much.
David

A:

You need install turtlebot_navigation.
Use command:
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-turtlebot-apps
