A:

Could neither symlink nor copy file "/opt/ros/groovy/share/catkin/cmake/toplevel.cmake" to "/home/pr2admin/r_os/src/CMakeLists.txt":

This error reads like the user you're using does not have a right to write into the folder mentioned. Make sure you use the right user you're supposed to in your team.
Adding sudo wouldn't work unless your super user account is configured for ROS environment (see e.g. this for the reason).
