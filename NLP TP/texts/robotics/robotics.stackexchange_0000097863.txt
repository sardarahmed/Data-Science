Q:

Where can I get a program for "service call"?

I used a command as below.
ros2 service call /set_message hello_world_msgs/srv/SetMessage \ '{message: "Hello service!"}'
I'd like to know how this program works.
But I couldn't find a program for "service call" in my computer and Internet.
So, I'd like to know where I can get the program.
Could someone tell me where can I get the program, please?
My environment is below.
Environment
OS: Ubuntu18.04.5 LTS
ROS2: Dashing Diademata

A:

The service call part are just subcommands which are interpreted by the top-level ros2 command. In this case the ros2 command hands off execution to a python library defined by the ros2service package. You can see the source for this package here: https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/tree/dashing/ros2service/ros2service Take a look inside verb/call.py to see what's running for the specific example in your question.

Thank you for your reply.
I had a look a program.
Does the program made by c++ exists?

Check out the ros2 examples and demos repositories for sample programs in both C++ and Python. For example, a service calling example can be found here.
