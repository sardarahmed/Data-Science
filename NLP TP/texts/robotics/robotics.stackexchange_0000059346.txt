Q:

How to put the pieces together?

My goal is to use simple DIY robots, which only have wheels and IR receiver and emitters, to do distributed control algorithms for flocking and foraging. I went through tutorials for ROS, RViz, TF and URDF, yet I fail to understand how to put all the pieces together for a simulation.
Specifically, I know how to specify the robots in URDF, and after the Gazebo tutorial I'll know how to put a robot in a simulated physical world, but I'm not sure if I can put tens of robots in the same world. And more importantly, I don't know where does my algorithm for a single robot go, i.e. how do I code the behavior of a robot?
Thank you for your help in advance!

your question is so comprehensive that I cant answer . you should make your problem focusing on one point .

If I hava a robot in a Gazebo world, what's the most common way to make the robot move autonomously, say running in a circle? Do I just simply publish robot states?

A:

I suggest you look for some tutorials in Gazebo about how to control a a robot with examples to fully understand how it works, then modify the tutorial codes to adapt them to your model. That would be the way I would do it.
