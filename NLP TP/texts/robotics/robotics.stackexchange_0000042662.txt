Q:

openni_node.launch not found

I installed ROS on my Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit to work with RGBDSLAM. I followed all the instructions, installed ros-fuerte-openni-camera when it was not found. But after installing it, when I run roslaunch rgbdslam kinect+rgbdslam.launch, I get the following error
while processing /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/openni_camera/launch/openni_node.launch:
Invalid roslaunch XML syntax: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: u'/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/openni_camera/launch/openni_node.launch'

Please help me.
With regards
Don

A:

openni_camera/launch/openni_node.launch got deprecated with Fuerte. You'll have to do a bit of work to migrate. Take a look at the corresponding migration guide http://ros.org/wiki/openni_camera_deprecated#Migration_guide.

Note: there seems to be a bug in the launch script in the openni_camera_deprecated package. https://kforge.ros.org/openni/trac/ticket/51
