Q:

rosserial [ERROR] lost sync with device, restarting

Hello I am building a differential drive robot using differential_drive package and rosserial_tivac to interface with my hardware I have written my codes and iclude them all in one launch file
when i use roslaunch every thing is working fine and the following message appear in terminal
process[rosout-1]: started with pid [11918]
started core service [/rosout]
process[serial_gate_node-2]: started with pid [11935]
process[lpid_velocity-3]: started with pid [11936]
process[rpid_velocity-4]: started with pid [11937]
process[twist_to_motors-5]: started with pid [11938]

[INFO] [1534898277.126081]: Setup subscriber on rmotor_cmd [std_msgs/Float32]

Then when I try to publish a msg to the topic /twist that supposes to drive the robot. The motors start operating in the right direction but with a full speed which possibly means they didn't get the proper PWM value
and I am getting the following info appearing on my terminal
[INFO] [1534898288.361617]: wrong checksum for topic id and msg
[ERROR] [1534898302.098102]: Lost sync with device, restarting...

the codes witch I am using is from this repository if any one can help please

A:

I believe that the message "wrong checksum for topic id and msg" indicates the real problem. This usually occurs when your headers files checksum definition in ROS are different from the rosserial client versions. It should be solved by running the rosserial_client make_library command again in ROS and update it on rosserial client side. The "Lost sync with device, restarting..." occurs with me as well and I am still looking for an answer for that, although the communication works properly with this messages.
