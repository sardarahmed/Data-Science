Q:

base operand of '->' has non-pointer type 'const JointState'

Hi guys..
I am trying to write a simple publisher and subscriber, but having some problems with my subscriber...
The message type i am using is sensor_msgs::JointState msg (doc)  for my subscriber i have this callback function.
void ChatterCallback(const sensor_msgs::JointState& msg){
  ROS_INFO("i've heard: " ,msg->position);
}

but somehow i end up getting this error message saying

error: base operand of '->' has
non-pointer type 'const JointState'

which just doesn't make sense for me..

A:

I found the error.
    void ChatterCallback(const sensor_msgs::JointState::ConstPtr& msg)
{
      ROS_INFO("i've heard: [%f]" ,msg->position[0]);
    }
