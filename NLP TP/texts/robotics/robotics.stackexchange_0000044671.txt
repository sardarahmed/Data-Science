Q:

cmake error ( fuerte in fedora 17 )

while running this command
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/ros/fuerte -DSETUPTOOLS_DEB_LAYOUT=OFF

I got this
CMake Warning at build/cmake/rosunit/rosunit-extras.cmake:17 (message):
  add_pyunit() is deprecated.  For Python tests, use add_nostests() instead.

noob alert
how do I get past this !!  I have already have Diamondback and now I am trying to install fuerte ( on Fedora 17 ) without removing Diamondback
I am installing fuerte because I am confused whether the stacks openni_camera openni_tracker and openni_launch would work alright with Diamondback ... what I understand is the older stack openni_kinect is now divided into 2 - openni_camera  and openni_tracker  .. and their pages show install commands only for fuerte
also there is more support for fuerte now i think

A:

I went through the process of installing Fuerte on Fedora 17 yesterday and had to install A LOT of additional libraries. This particular dependency was resolved by installing wxWidgets, wxPython, wxPython-devel, if I remember correctly.

Only wxGTK-devel seems to be sufficient. I just ran into this error and installing this one package solved it.
EDIT: The make command failed requiring wxPython. Heh.
