Q:

Why do all nodes have to be linked to /rosout?

Hi there,
I was redoing this tutorial where you get to run two turtlesims and one of them mimics the other. Well, exploring the rxgraph we get this:

That's when I asked myself: why do all nodes have to be linked to /rosout? It doesn't make sense to me that /mimic is connected to it. What is the purpose for that?
Thanks!

A:

rosout collects all data from the ROS_INFO...-style macros to display not only in the terminal but also in rxconsole. Nodes connect to it by default to be able to publish there.
If you are only concerned about the chaotic rxgraph output the "quiet" option will remove those.
