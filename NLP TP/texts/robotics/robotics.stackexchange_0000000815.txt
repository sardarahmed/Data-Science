Q:

Arduino Motor control

I'm working on a rather low budget project, and need some way to control four or more motors using one Arduino. I've looked at motor shields a little, but I have a shield on top of it already, It does have female input on the top though, so a motor shield may work. Any suggestions?

A:

You'll have to determine yourself whether a motor controller shield is compatible and can be stacked on your existing shield.  
In some cases, you can use Arduino's SPI.  In other cases, you'll need to check whether the pins that your shield uses would conflict with the pins needed by a motor controller.
