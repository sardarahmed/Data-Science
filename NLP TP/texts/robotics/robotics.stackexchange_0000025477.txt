Q:

Working code of controlling Gazebo with Player

Hi all,
I understand that most of you are using ROS but I am trying to do some simple joint manipulations using Player. I have been trying to work with the available examples but at the moment I am having a lot of errors. By any chance any one has a working example for Player code with Gazebo.
I am trying to compile the simple.c program. I think the main problem is libgazebo.a and gazebo.h are not getting installed on the system. I will try to upload the exact errors.
Thanks.

I'm not using player, but have in the past.. what examples are you referring to? And what type errors are you receiving? (Could you update your question with this information?)

Ok i have added some detail but I will try to add more details.

A:

Joint control with Player is not implemented yet. The only working components of Player are the position2d, laser, and camera interfaces.

Thanks Nate. Is there any other way to do it through C++ code.

You will have to implement the player interfaces that you want. Download the gazebo source code, and look in the interfaces/player subdirectory.

Thanks. I will try to do it and post and problems that I find here.

I was hoping for something like libgazebo to be working though but let me try.
