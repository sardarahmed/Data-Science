Q:

i am trying to load my depth cam model in gazebo,and it is falling down immediately

the model

<sdf version="1.5">
<model name="my_model">
    <link name="camera_depth_frame">

A:

Since the model's static is not given, it's false, meaning that gravity will pull it down, and your camera ends up free-falling. A collision can help stopping it on the ground (if you have a ground with collision in your world).
Also you have 2 links in your model, if they are not static, you need to connect them with a joint (can be a fixed joint). Otherwise, one link may also fall away from the other if only one of them has a collision to hit the ground.
Note that if you plan to include this model into another non-static model later, the static flag will be overwritten, and the 2 links will be disconnected if you choose to stop them from falling by setting it static.
