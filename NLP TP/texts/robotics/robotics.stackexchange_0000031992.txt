Q:

How to change "Source" url on ROS Wiki for a package or stack?

Hello,
I would like the Source url for a package I have on the ROS Wiki to point to a location other than the trunk.  For an example of what I mean, look at the pr2_controllers page where the Source url points to a branch rather than trunk.  Is this done using the versioncontrol tag in the manifest.xml or stack.xml file or some other way?
Thanks,

patrick

A:

The source URL is controlled by our indexer, not any property of the stack itself.
You can view the index at:
https://code.ros.org/svn/ros/stacks/rosorg/trunk/rosdoc_rosorg/repos.rosinstall
It can be updated by you contacting me with whatever adjustments you would like.
In the future, we hope to have version-specific URLs, which we would enable for 'released' stacks, but this will take time to implement.

Thanks Ken--I'll leave it as is for now and adjust my svn organization accordingly.
