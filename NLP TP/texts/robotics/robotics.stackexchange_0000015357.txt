Plotting SE(3) points in a 3D graph

I have a data-set containing points in SE(3), i.e the 4 $\times$ 4 transformation matrices and the corresponding dual quaternions. Now, I want to plot these points in a 3D graph. How to generate this plot?

A:

A point in SE(3) has six degrees of freedom, so the three DOF's in a 3D plot would not be sufficient to capture this. I would split it up into two 3D plots. One of them would be quite straight forward, namely just plot the 3D position vector. The other plot should capture the information of the attitude part. There are multiple ways of representing this in 3D, such as Euler angles or axis angle representation, where the axis is of unit length and then scaled that by the angle. I myself would prefer the last one.
If your SE(3) is represented as a 4 by 4 matrix
$$
M = \begin{bmatrix}
R & p \\ 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$
with $R\in\mathbb{R}^{3\times3}$ a rotation matrix and $p\in\mathbb{R}^{3}$ the position vector. So the position vector $p$ is straight forward to extract. The axis angle information can be extracted from $R$ after some calculations
$$
\theta = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\mathrm{Tr}(R)-1}{2}\right)
$$
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -v_3 & v_2 \\
v_3 & 0 & -v_1 \\
-v_2 & v_1 & 0
\end{bmatrix} = \frac{R - R^\top}{2\,\sin\theta}
$$

A:

An alternative visualization would be to draw coordinate axes in the 3D plot to represent each SE(3) point. Provided you have a way to view 3D graphs, this allows the points to be all viewed without projecting down to a lower-dimensional space. e.g., you can do this in Matlab with the drawframe function from Brad Kradochvil's kinematics toolbox. It draws an arrow of a different color for the X, Y, and Z axes.

Or you can use the trplot() function from my Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB
