Q:

Using pi in an URDF file

We want to use the value of pi in an URDF file, since we have to rotate a model by 90 degrees. Is there any builtin macro for pi in URDF? At the moment we are simply using our own M_PI macro, but it would be nice to know what the intended way of doing such a thing would be.

A:

You can do this with xacro (a XML macro language): http://wiki.ros.org/xacro
From section 3. Math Expression

Since ROS Jade, Xacro employs python to evaluate expressions
enclosed in dollared-braces (${}).

>     <xacro:property name="R" value="2" />
>     <xacro:property name="alpha" value="${30/180*pi}" />
