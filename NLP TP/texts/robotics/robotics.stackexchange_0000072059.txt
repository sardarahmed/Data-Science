Q:

depth_image_proc xyzrgb

I am trying to create a point cloud using depth_image_proc xyzrgb. Everything seems ok but it does not publish the cloud.
If some one has time to look at this I would appreciate it very much. Hopefully it is simple. I have attached a bag file which reproduces the issue it is 183 MB. Thank you for your time. I've looked at this with rqt_bag and it looks fine to me. I do not believe the callback is being called for the Synch.
