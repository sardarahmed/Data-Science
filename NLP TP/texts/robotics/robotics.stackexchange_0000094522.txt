Q:

turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch doesn't move

Hi,
I am following the turtlebot3 tutorial.
In remote-PC, run
roscore
In turtlebot terminal, run
roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_robot.launch
then, back to remote-PC, run
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=buerger
rosrun rviz rviz -d rospack find turtlebot3_description /rviz/model.rviz
can see the rviz GUI and the scan points.
then run,
rqt
can see the topics like odom, scan, battery, cm_vel_rc100, imu .......
then run,
roslaunch turtlstrong textebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch
no error, see the wasd instructions. typing w, can see the acc refreshing with new speed.
currently:    linear vel 0.09  angular vel 0.0
currently:    linear vel 0.01  angular vel 0.0
but the robot doesn't move.
In topic "cmd_vel" is updated with new speed,
but in topic "cmd_vel_rc100 " the speed is still 0.
thank you

A:

if you type rostopic info cmd_vel in the terminal, do you see anything subscribed to it? same for rostopic info cmd_vel_rc100 is anything publishing to it?

Thank you, Joe.
I run the demo again, it worked.
Check the topic cmd_vel and cmd_vel_rc100.
the keyborad_tele node is publisher, and the ros_core is subscriber under the topic cmd_vel.
in the topic cmd_vel_rc100 only one publisher --- ros_core, no subscriber.
the topic of cmd_vel can be found with rqt_graph command.
Thank you again, I will check with these commands next time.

hi, I checked the cmd_vel and its showing correct values but robot doesn't move. All the hardware is setup properly.
