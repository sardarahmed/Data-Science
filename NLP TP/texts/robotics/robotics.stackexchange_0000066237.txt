Q:

Rotates rolling_window with the robot

Hi,
I've a doubt. Can I use a rolling window in local_costmap that rotates with the robot? Because I'd like use local_costmap rectangular oriented with the robot.
I tried to set local_costmap/global_frame: /base_link. Local_costmap rotates with the robot, but base_local_planner has some problems to navigate in correct mode.
Thanks

A:

The costmap_2d package does not support rotating costmaps.
The rolling_costmap forces the orientation of the costmap to remain stable. This makes it easier to shift the data as the window "rolls". The orientation is a lot more difficult to transform the data, and the costmap does not currently support it.
