Q:

Control a 2.4 Ghz AR Drone from the computer

I had a Doyusha Nano Spider R/C mini-copter, it's controlled by a 4ch joystick 2.4 Ghz.
I look for a low cost method to control it from the computer. The software is not a problem, but how can I transform the WIFI or the Bluetooth signal of the computer to an R/C signal compatible with the mini-copter receptor?
Or is there another solution that is low cost?

A:

The simplest way to do this, is to buy a more advanced PPM transmitter that has a trainer port, and use this PCTx device to control it from your PC through USB. They provice a simple library and some sample code to get your started. The control signals go from your 
software -> through the PCTx device -> PPM transmitter -> over RF to your copter

Compatible transmitters are listed on that link.
I'm not familiar with your particular brand of mini-copter, but im assuming it uses standard 4 channel RC-PPM control signals. If it doesn't, the above solution will not work.
You can also, if you are so inclined roll out your own PC based PWM transmitter. This would involve writing software to implement the PPM signal, which can get a bit involved. You might even need some sort of an oscilloscope or a signal analyzer to debug issues. Some people have created Arduino based solutions. Examples:

Again, the assumption is that your copter uses standard RC-PWM. If it doesn't you'll have to first figure out what protocol it uses and then try to emulate that using software and an RF Tx module.
Since your copter receives 2.4Ghz radio signals, there is no drop-in solition to directly use WiFi or Bluetooth.
