Q:

Electronic Speed Control (ESC) basics

Hi, I am new to ROS and I am making an autonomous buggy scale 1:10.
I am trying to understand how to communicate with the Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) of the Buggy's DC motor. I have also checked the page: http://wiki.ros.org/Motor%20Controller%20Drivers#ROS_Motor_Controller_Drivers. And my ESC is HW-WP-1040-BRUSHED, you can see it here: https://www.redcatracing.com/products/hw-wp-1040-brushed?variant=30993631281242
I am using a Raspberry 3B+ with Ubuntu 16 and ROS Kinetic. I have already achieved the connection with the steering servo using an Adafruit servo board.
Any source I can read from is welcome.
Thank you.

A:

So basically, I just tried the same PWM control for the servo but on the ESC. Have a look at this gits:

https://gitlab.com/bradanlane/ros-i2cpwmboard (works fine with my ESC)
https://github.com/liamondrop/ros-pca9685-board (this one needs WiringPi, couldn't make it work)

My ESC works in a very narrow range (340 on the pwm value means no speed, and 350 means top speed more or less).
I am going to try the proportional control offered in the first git.
Regards.
