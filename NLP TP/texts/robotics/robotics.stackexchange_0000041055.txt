Q:

cmd_vel.y=1 stop pioneer robot

Hello, everyone, I'm runing navigation tutorial thoes days, it seems all goes well now, I can mapping, localize and navigate the robot in stage, but there is a prolem, when the robot stucked by some obstacle, it will stop. I use
rostopic echo /cmd_vel

, and get result as blow:
linear: 
  x: 0.0
  y: 0.1
  z: 0.0
angular: 
  x: 0.0
  y: 0.0
  z: 0.0

What I known is that on Pioneer robot, the cmd_vel.linear.y have no effection on robot's move, but the move_base node just publihsed this value in cmd_vel...
Besides, I have configure the robot according to this page ,but only use stage as simulator and change the map file.
Any suggestion?

A:

I think you have set holonimic_robot: true in
RobotSetup#Base_Local_Planner_Configuration
which isn't true.
If it's not holonomic the local planner shouldn't set y-velocities.
