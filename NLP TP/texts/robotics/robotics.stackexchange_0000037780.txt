Q:

PCL failing compilation - Fedora 16 - Segmentation fault

I have been desperately trying to get some ROS packages working on Fedora 16 x86_64. I fixed some of the issues, but this seems like the only problem left.
I'm trying to compile pcl library and eventually gazebo..
So far...
rosmake pcl
Results in this error:
This is the end of the output of the log file:

I appreciate any help trying to fix it.
Thanks.

A:

Here, on my Fedora 16 system, I managed to setup gazebo and it runs without any problems. What version of PCL are you using? I have
$ svn info
