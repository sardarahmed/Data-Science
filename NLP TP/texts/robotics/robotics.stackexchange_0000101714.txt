Q:

Problems installing ROS1 Packages

I'm normaly working with ROS2, so probably my Problems originate from not having that much experience with ROS in general and especially not with ROS1, but I have a package that's only provided in ROS1 but that I need for generating some worlds. Hover, I really struggle to install it.
What I tried
First thing I tried was just running
rosdep install virtual_maize_field

which resulted in the following error:
ERROR: Rosdep cannot find all required
resources to answer your query
Missing resource virtual_maize_field
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/melodic/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/opt/ros/melodic/share

Next, I tried cloning the Repository and then trying to install it with rosdep via the path:
git clone https://github.com/FieldRobotEvent/virtual_maize_field.git
rosdep install --from-path virtual_maize_field

This resulted in a lot of packages being installed, but when I tried to run a script, I just got the response that the package could not be found.
[rospack] Error: package 'virtual_maize_field' not found

After that, I tried following this article, but that got me the same result as before; the package couldn't be found :/
Thanks in advance :)

A:

Your linked repository seems to have a ros2 branch there: https://github.com/FieldRobotEvent/virtual_maize_field/tree/ros2
Did you try it?
The code seems to be mostly non-ROS specific to be honest, it can be ported to ROS2.
Did you build it with catkin make? rosdep is for dependency packages
