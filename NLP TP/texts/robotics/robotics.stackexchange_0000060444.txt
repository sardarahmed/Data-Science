Q:

SPAM - can admins do something please?

Dear admins, this is getting out of hand. 4 thousand spam messages in less than 24 hours. Pretty clear the "ROS answers" is not stopping spam, like it was supposed to.
Forgive me, but I never, ever, in more than 10 yeas of online groups, drowned like this in spam.
Thanks.

If you ask me, captcha, solved or not, working with moderation for new users, while nothing else is figured out. I volunteer for this sort of moderation, if the system allows for it.

Please refer to the github issue for further discussion. As far as it seems what you are suggesting is the plan right now.
