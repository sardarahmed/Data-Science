Q:

How to run a node as a background process?

So I am trying to write a program in which a main publisher node will use the system function to run multiple subscriber nodes. I would like to use something like: "rosrun <pkg_name> <node_name> &", however this doesn't work for me and the subscriber node still runs in the same terminal window. How can I change the command so that it executes in the way i described? I can't seem to figure it out. Thanks!!

A:

Does the system() call block when it executes? If not, then the command is running in the background.
Keep in mind that "background" does not imply spawning a different terminal window or logging to disk by default. The process will use the same terminal as its parent.

No, even when I put the statement in a system call, the output from the node still appears in the terminal window and I cannot run other nodes

What do you mean by "cannot run other nodes" ? Does a second system() command fail? Does it stop the other node that's already running? Do you expect to be able to run other nodes in the same terminal?
