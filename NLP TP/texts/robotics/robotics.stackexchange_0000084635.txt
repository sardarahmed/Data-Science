Welcome! What commands are you running and what tutorial are you following?

A:

Your build is failing because the compiler cannot find the moveit/move_group_interface/move_group_interface.h file. This is probably caused by the include path's not being setup correctly in your CMakeLists.txt file. Can you post of the contents of this file in your question and we'll see if we can get this sorted out for you.
