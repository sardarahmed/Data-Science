Q:

Building OpenCV codes on ROS

Hi im new to ROS and openCV.
Im currently running on Ubuntu.
Im currently trying to use Asus Xtion Pro to detect lines using Hough transform detection codes. I have OpenCV 2.4.9 installed and ROS installed. How can i go about building codes to detect lines using my Asus Xtion pro.
Thanks in advance!

A:

See the cv_bridge Convert between ROS Images and OpenCV Images tutorial. This shows you how you can get a OpenCV representation of image data. Once you have that, you can perform all OpenCV operations on the image data, including hough transform.
