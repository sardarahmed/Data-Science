Q:

steered wheel controller wheel joints not working

I am trying to use steered wheel base controller for my four wheeled mobile base. I was trying to implement steering joints as position controlled and axle joints as velocity controlled.
My problem is, while publishing cmd_vel , axle joints are not working. Velocity command from ros control is always outputs as zero. But steering joints which uses position control is working when I published  yaw velocity.
Is it problem with velocity control I implemented or it is a problem with steered base controller ?
What all things I need to taken care while setting control frequency of controller manager?

A:

Got solution. The mistake is I registered position and velocity hardware interfaces for each joints.

So, it means we should not use position and velocity hardware interfaces,? Did you use this in Gazebo?
How did you define the transmissions in URDF for this controller?
