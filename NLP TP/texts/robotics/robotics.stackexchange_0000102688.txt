Q:

Is there an equivalent of rospy.wait_for_message in ros2?

Hi. Sorry for all mistakes, English is not my native language. I have following line of code in my ROS1 project:
trajectory = rospy.wait_for_message('/trajectory_node_list', MarkerArray, 1.0)

How this line should look in ros2? I have find this and this links with similar question but those two was about C++ and newest one was asked more than year ago, so maybe something changed from those time. Appreciate any help.
