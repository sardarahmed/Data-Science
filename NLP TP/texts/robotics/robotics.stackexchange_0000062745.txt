Q:

launch sbpl_lattice_planner (hydro ) errors

Dear all.
i 'm using  ubuntu 12.04  ,turtlebot1 and hydro,created  a catkin_ws workspace , installed  sbpl  through  sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-sbplthanks to Johannes https://github.com/meyerj/sbpl_lattice_planner and ahendrix https://github.com/trainman419/sbpl_lattice_planner , i download  Johannes's and catkin_makesuccessfuly,but when i
roslaunch sbpl_lattice_planner  move_base_sbpl_fake_localization_2.5cm.launch

it came out two errors,ERROR: cannot launch node of type [stage/stageros]: can't locate node [stageros] in package [stage] ,ERROR: cannot launch node of type [nav_view/nav_view]: nav_view . when i rospack  find stage and stage_ros in the path'/opt/ros/hydro/share/'
my questions are:

in the move_base_sbpl_fake_localization_2.5cm.launch,how to correct  the line  <node pkg="stage" type="stageros" name="stageros" args="$(find sbpl_lattice_planner)/worlds/willow.world" respawn="false" >to  fix  the   first error?
in the sbpl_lattice_planner/launch/move_base/nav_view_sbpl.xml,how to correct  the line node name="nav_view" pkg="nav_view" type="nav_view" respawn="false">to fix the  second error(i want to use rviz to  replace nav_view,but don't know how to do ),does the 'remap  from ...to ...'lines also need to  be changed ?
in the sbpl_lattice_planner/launch/move_base/move_base/move_base_sbpl.xml, does the line <param name="SBPLLatticePlanner/primitive_filename" value="$(find sbpl)/matlab/mprim/pr2.mprim"/> fit my turtlebot1 (it can only  forward ,backward and  rotation)?

thanks to your  time and suggestions !!

A:

Background: it looks like the launch file is running a simulator. You'll probably need to adjust it a lot to run it on a real robot.

is trying to start the stage simulator. You should be able to install it with sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-stage

is trying to start nav_view. You should probably just remove that node and run rivz manually instead.

Once you're comfortable running the sbpl planner in simulation, you should generate a new set of motion primitives to fit your turtlebot (or find a similar project and use their motion primitives).

@ahendrix,thanks . i removed that nav_view node ,sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-stage,and then only roslaunch the move_base_sbpl_fake_localization_2.5cm.launch,the first error still occur .in '/opt/ros/hydro/share/',there are only stage and stage_ros,not exist stageros.

It looks like the package for stage is now stage_ros and the node name is still stageros
Comment by jxl on 2014-09-22:
corrected  the package name, and launch again , occured the error like link, there is a patchlink,did you know how to use it

It looks like the simulation needs to be updated for the new version of stage. I suspect no one has run that simulation in a long, long time; you may just want to abandon it and move to a turtlebot simulation or a real robot.

ok, sir, i will try the planner on the turtlebot .thanks a lot !!
