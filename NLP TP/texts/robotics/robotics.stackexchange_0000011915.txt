Q:

bounded deviation for straight line motion

I came across the paper(link given below) which discusses about bounded deviation joint path for straight line motion. 
Planning and Execution of Straight Line Manipulator Trajectories (RH Taylor)
https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e01a/58608f4e68f31c7b9e7cdbddceae645727bb.pdf
In this method, the assumption is that the maximum deviation happens at or near the midpoint between the start and end point. 
1) Is this assumption true in all cases? 
2) Even if the assumption may not be true, will resulting trajectory be a straight line if this method is used for trajectory planning?
I hope someone shed some light on this. Thank you.

A:

1) Is this assumption true in all cases?

I think it is pretty difficult to conclude that the assumption is true in all cases, as it depends on so many factors such as robot geometries. However, as the sampled points are closer to one another, it is reasonable to assume that the maximum deviation happens near the midpoint (as can be seen from Figure 3 in the paper you mentioned).

2) Even if the assumption may not be true, will resulting trajectory be a straight line if this method is used for trajectory planning?

If you are referring to the second method discussed in the paper (bounded deviation joint paths), the resulting trajectory is not a straight line in the Cartesian space and that does not really depend on the validity of the assumption. The assumption is stated just for them to have a reasonable method to select more intermediate points if the particular trajectory segment exceeds the deviation bound. The generated trajectory will (only) follow the straight line closely enough that it does not deviates from the real straight line more than the specified maximum deviation allowed.
