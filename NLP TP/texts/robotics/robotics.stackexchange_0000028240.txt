A:

The source code for that cube is here:
https://bitbucket.org/chapulina/chapulina_gazebo_models/src/default/puzzle_ball_joints/
The cube was modeled as boxes connected by ball joints to the center. In the past, I've also tried simulating the real mechanism, where the contacts between parts hold them together, but I never got it to be stable enough.
Have fun!
