Q:

hector_imu_attitude_to_tf vs hector_localization

Hi, I'm using an IMU and a laser scanner and would like to create a planar map, but estimate the pose with 6DoF, for example for handheld mapping.
As far as I can see, it is not possible to estimate the height (z-axis value) with the available sensors, hence 5DoF remain.
My question now is: According to the hector_mapping tutorial (here), it is possible to calculate the roll and pitch angles and broadcast the resulting transform between base_stabilized and base_link with hector_imu_attitude_to_tf.
On the other hand, the package hector_pose_estimation within hector_localization apparently takes the pose estimate from hector_mapping on /poseupdate, fuses it with the IMU data and publishes the 6DoF pose.
So, are there any advantages/differences when taking hector_pose_estimation instead of hector_imu_attitude_to_tf for example for performing 2D handheld SLAM, or is it just the same?
Is hector_pose_estimation maybe capable of doing something else that I miss (looking at the source code it seems to be pretty complex)?
Thanks,
Philipp

A:

hi
can you do this ???
i do this, i fuse imu and Z to localization but when i fused poseupdate from hector_mappin, localization gonna to jumping around...

you don't need hector_imu_attitude_to_tf, because you can use /imu_raw topic in hector_pose_estimation and fusion the imu data to tf
and
you can fusion the height by publish z value on /height topic in hector_pose_estimation
