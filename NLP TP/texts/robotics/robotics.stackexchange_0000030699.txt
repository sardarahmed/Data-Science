Q:

Displaying an openni_tracker skeleton in RViz?

Hello,
Has anyone written a node to take the skeleton produced by openni_tracker (or something similar) and display it in RViz?  I'd like to see the skeleton alongside my robot's URDF model in RViz.  I'm guessing one would have to write a node to publish RViz-style markers for each joint but I don't want to reinvent the wheel if it's already been done.
Thanks!
patrick

A:

You can turn on the tf visuzizer to see the skeleton quickly.  It would be great to have a fancier marker style visuzlization, but it works well for debugging.

Just an update to say I wrote a little ROS package to display RViz visualization markers for the skeleton joints.  It can be found at http://www.ros.org/wiki/skeleton_markers.
