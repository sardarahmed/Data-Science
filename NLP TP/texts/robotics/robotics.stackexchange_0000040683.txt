Q:

openni_camera topics

I am new in ROS, therefore the question might be very simple. But I did not find any information about that. I use UBUNTU 12.4 and feurte and do something with kinect. The point is that, I want to have information about the published topics of openni_camera (any tutorial or document). I need to know what information do they have, and which of them should be for example recorded to be used later on rviz or other visualizer? What kind of TF message is been transferred?  Where can I find the general information about topics that every package publishes? I do not mean the names and type. I mean the real information they have!

A:

The information you want is on the openni_camera wiki page.
What to save depends on what you want to see. Those topics can use up a lot of bandwidth.
If you want the RBG camera data, save rgb/camera_info and rgb/image_raw/compressed.
If you want the depth camera, save depth/camera_info and depth/image_raw. Image compression does not work well on depth images.
Depending on what frame of reference you want to use, it probably makes sense to save the /tf topic, too.
