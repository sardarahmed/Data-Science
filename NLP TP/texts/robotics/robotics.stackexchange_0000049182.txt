Q:

urdfdom_model problem

Hi
I just followed the tutorial http://www.ros.org/wiki/urdf/Tutorials/Create%20your%20own%20urdf%20file , but when I typed
$ rosrun urdfdom_model check_urdf my_urdf.xml
  in the terminal, it displays:

[rospack] Error: stack/package urdfdom_model not found
  Do you know why?

  I highly appreciate your time and great help!

A:

You do need to have ros-groovy-urdfdom
sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-urdfdom

Than you just need to execute
rosrun urdfdom check_urdf my_urdf.xml

you dont need the urdfdom_model
And finally, when you are going to convert it to pdf, you do
rosrun urdfdom urdf_to_graphiz my_urdf.xml
