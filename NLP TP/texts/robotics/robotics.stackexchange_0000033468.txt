Q:

Filter robot out of laser scan

I would like to filter out the laser points that hit my robot. There are points above and below the scanner (green thing) that should be removed. I'm thinking I'm supposed to use LaserScanAngularBoundsFilter but am not sure.

A:

There is a robot_self_filter package that allows you to filter robot links from your sensor data based on URDF description of the robot.
