Q:

How to speed up walking animation of actors

I have many actors walking in the scene and I require them to walk a very long distance. They all seem to glide on the surface since the movement of their speed does not match the walking animation. Is there a way to speed up the walking animation.

A:

Sorry to ask here before doing a quick search, but to synchronize the movement of the actor with the animation, we need to add following <interpolate_x>true</interpolate_x> tag in between animation tags.
