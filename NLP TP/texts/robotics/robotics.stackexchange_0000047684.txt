A:

As in any other cmake project, you'd put target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME) <NAME_OF_LIBRARY_TO_LINK>) in your CmakeLists.txt.  There wasn't any ros-specific cmake macro for using an installed library in a node in rosbuild, and if I understand correctly, the new catkin build system does not use ANY ros-specific macros. I haven't actually used catkin yet, though.  Some useful links:

cmake documentation
catkin page
rosbuild cmake API (for pre-groovy distros)
