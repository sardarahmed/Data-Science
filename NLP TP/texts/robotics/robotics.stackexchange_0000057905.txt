Q:

Problems running turtlesim_node with hydro

I am trying to run turtlesim_node with hydro.  I am running Ubuntu 12.10 with roscore running.  Every time I try to run the node I get: /opt/ros/hydro/lib/turtlesim/turtlesim_node: symbol lookup error: /opt/ros/hydro/lib/turtlesim/turtlesim_node: undefined symbol: _ZN3ros7console5printEPNS0_10FilterBaseEPvNS0_6levels5LevelEPKciS7_S7_z
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Morpheus
