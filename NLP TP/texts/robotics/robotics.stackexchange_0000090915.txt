Q:

missing moveit files

Hi guys,
I'm new to ROS and recently went through the ROS-I training. I'm trying to keep going with the training exercises but I ran into a strange build issue when I moved Descartes packages into my workspace.
for reference the training material I'm referring to https://industrial-training-master.readthedocs.io/en/melodic/
My workspace builds and everything is great until exercise 4.1 and I add the Descartes packages in. When I try and build now I get the following error.
Errors     << ur5_demo_descartes:make /home/rosindustrial2/catkin_ws/logs/ur5_demo_descartes/build.make.011.log

It seems like I'm missing a move it file somewhere but I've tried to uninstall and reinstall moveit but no success. We have another identical laptop that a coworker used in the training and he does not have this issue. I did some looking and using the "find" command I can find the file this error says is missing in the same place on my computer as his computer.
any thoughts on whats wrong?
