Q:

Hi All:
I am new about ROS but middle in linux.
Here is one problem that encountered during the installation of Indiago ROS.
The main steps of installation are following the offical site as shown below:
http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu
First , I tried to install Indiago-desktop-full by typing the following commands below:
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-desktop-full
which shows the following messages:
paultsai@paultsai-VirtualBox:~$ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-desktop-full
[sudo] password for paultsai:

A:

Are you sure you are running Ubuntu 14.04.4? I recently tried to install ROS on 14.04.5 and got some similar errors to yours. I had to go back to 14.04.4 and everything went fine.
