Q:

poseEigenToMsg is not a member of 'tf'

I'm trying to use tf::poseEigenToMsg from this package:
http://docs.ros.org/hydro/api/eigen_conversions/html/eigen__msg_8h.html
But it doesn't appear to be a member of the namespace tf... I'm assuming this is an issue with either my cmake file, or a package.xml... but I'm not even entirely sure what to specify in each. I'm including tf_conversions in my cmake file, as eigen_conversions didn't work.
Any help getting this to work would be much appreciated!
Thanks

I'm pretty sure that function should be there, so make sure the error is not actually something along the lines of "no candidate for your exact input arguments".

Also: as always with these kind of errors: please include some snippets of code that show what you are doing exactly. Without that this is going to be difficult to diagnose.

A:

Thanks very much for the help everyone, I was not including the correct header. For anyone reading this in the future, It's
#include <eigen_conversions/eigen_msg.h>
