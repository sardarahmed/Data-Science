Q:

Visualize laserscan usig rviz

Is it possible to visualize a topic of type sensor_msgs/LaserScan using rviz? Currently it complains about not having any frame (which is true, I just have the scan data)... Is there a better way?
Thanks in advance.

A:

Which laserdriver are you using? Normally every sensor message has a frame attached. (You can find out this frame by using rostopic echo /scan -n 1 --noarr)
If no transforms are published, rviz will not show that frame as a possibility in the Fixed Frame dropdown-menu. But if you just type in the frame-name by hand, rviz should be able to visualize your laserscan.

I'm not sure what you're getting at, but i found this in the output: frame_id: '' The publishing node a bridge between another system and ROS so if something needs to be added I'm open to that. Thanks.

Have you written this bridging node yourself? The header of the message should contain a valid frame name/id (for example laser, try setting laserscan_msg->header.frame_id) and a timestamp.

Sorry, I am kind of lost when it comes to visualization and the like. What is the simplest thing that could pass as a valid frame? At this point the scanner is just sitting on the desk with no odometry or maps available. Is it possible visualize the environment around a fixed scanner?

Like i mentioned, laser would be a valid frame id. You can read this about the naming conventions for frames: http://www.ros.org/wiki/geometry/CoordinateFrameConventions#Naming

Now I get it, and it works fine. Thank you!
