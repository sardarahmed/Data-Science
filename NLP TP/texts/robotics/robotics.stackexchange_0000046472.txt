Q:

Cannot launch node

Hello!
I have a problem when I launch the ar_kinect.launch file.
I programmed a Phyton code an wrote this line into the ar_kinect.launch:
The ar_kinect.py file is stored in the bin file.
When I execute the launch file I get the following error message:
Error: cannot launch node of type [ar_kinect/ar_kinect.py]: Cannot locate node of type [ar_kinect.py] in package [ar_kinect]
What can I do?
Thanks for help.

Are you sure the python node you wrote is executable and has the right permissions? The tutorial on subscribing and publishing explains how to make your script executable.

@tbh, I guess you should convert your comment to an answer.

A:

Perhaps the python node you wrote isn't executable or doesn't have the right permissions. The tutorial on subscribing and publishing explains how to make your script executable.
Change permissions of the file with
$ chmod +x ar_kinect.py
and make sure you have the line
#!/usr/bin/env python
at the top of your python file.
