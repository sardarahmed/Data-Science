Q:

2D map with stationary LIDAR

I'm trying to make a 2D map of a room. This is a project for learning ROS in the first place, so there's no robot involved. I just want to be able to make a map from either my laserscan data or pc2 data. I'm using the Scanse Sweep LIDAR, and I'm able to view live data in rviz. Can I use gmapping, and input static odometry data, or is Hector mapping better in this case?
Thanks in advance

A:

With gmapping just adding a static frame for odometry isn't enough because you have paramaters like :
~linearUpdate (float, default: 1.0)
    Process a scan each time the robot translates this far 

~angularUpdate (float, default: 0.5)
    Process a scan each time the robot rotates this far 

your map would be updated only if you move, and I'm pretty sure there are other params like that. You can check #q63457, they already discussed about gmapping without odom.
So yes, hector_mapping is exactly what you are looking for.
