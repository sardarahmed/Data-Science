Q:

win-ros configure.bat - no module named genmsg

Hi,
I followed the instructions from http://mirror.umd.edu/roswiki/win_ros(2f)Msvc(20)Build(20)Environment(202d20)Fuerte.html. All works fine but
configure.bat returns:
Found Boost components:
   date_time;thread
-- Using these generator languages from the installation: gencpp;genpy
C:/opt/ros/fuerte/x86/share/genmsg/cmake/pkg-genmsg.cmake.em:33: error: <type 'exceptions.ImportError'>: No module named genmsg
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\python27\lib\site-packages\em.py", line 3288, in <module>
    if __name__ == '__main__': main()
  File "C:\python27\lib\site-packages\em.py", line 3286, in main
    invoke(sys.argv[1:])
  File "C:\python27\lib\site-packages\em.py", line 3269, in invoke

This is the only error, other parts and even later nmake work.
Any hints what might be wrong?
Peter

A:

Looks like you need a Python genmsg module installed somewhere.
