Q:

Vertex Buffer out of memory error with small STL file

Hello,
I am getting a :
Error [Visual.cc:1876] Unable to insert mesh[Vertex Buffer: Out of memory]
error when importing a very small (384 bytes) stl file. Any chance this is some kind of underflow problem? I have other files I've generated the same way (export from solidworks) that do not have this problem.
I've uploaded the file here:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/72r0t9apatlj1ft/xcone_convex.STL
It's a very simple pyramid shape. I can provide the .world file I am using if necessary.
I'm importing using:

  
    file://xcone_convex.STL
  

Anyone else having this problem? Can anyone else import this file? I've also verified that the file itself is intact by importing it into Matlab with no trouble.
Thanks,
Nick

A:

I believe the problem is that the STL file is in binary, and Gazebo only handles ASCII STL files.
I've created a ticket to address this issue. In the meantime, try converting to ASCII.

Is this the trick where you edit the first word 'solid' within the stl file and replace it with something of the same length, like 'robot'?

Thanks, changing to ascii fixed it. The strange thing is that I've been importing binary files for a while now without any trouble. In any event, happy to see it fixed, and so quickly!

Okay, now that I've tried to implement the fix, I've noticed that the fix does not in fact work. The STL file I was using before gives me the same error message, and the

The fix in the pull-request is not working for you, with the same STL file?

After looking into it more, it was my fault. The fix works great. Sorry, I had tried to delete that comment...

My stl file was in fact saved with the wrong units. As a result it overflowed the workspace (was too large). More than likely the problem is with your stl file, either corrupt or wrong units.
