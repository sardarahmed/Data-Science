This is what my ROSWTF command returns. This is all of a sudden. We were working with the turtlebot all these days. We were experimenting with lots of new programs that we wrote. Yesterday, the turtlebot did not take goals/initial pose given it from rviz. We didn't understand why and we were confused. We saw similar errors on the internet but none helped us. We use electric.
Also, one of our programs that takes messages from a topic did not respond even after the message was successfully posted to the topic. We checked that by using rostopic echo. For the previous case, we checked that the initial pose and the goals were also reaching the topics, using the same rostopic echo. For both cases, we also checked that the nodes are listening and posting on the related topics.
Please see if you can help. I will provide other details, if necessary.
Note: TurtleBot Tele-operation works very fine.

A:

The temporary solution is to reinstall the ubuntu installation. I did that. Now everything seems to work so fine.

I have similar errors with Fuerte on Ubuntu 12.04. Did you reinstall Ubuntu or ROS?
Comment by McMurdo on 2012-05-20:
I reinstalled ubuntu. Just reinstalling ROS did not work. I suggest you get back to 11.10. 12.04 is not supported by electric and fuerte is not yet full-fledged!
