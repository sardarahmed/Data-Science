Q:

Did I Break the Build?

I'm working on releasing my stacks to electric (since that's what they've been most tested on) and I got this email.

Internal failure release system. Please notify leibs and kwc @willowgarage.com:
Problem fetching yaml info for object_recognition None (https://code.ros.org/svn/release/download/stacks/object_recognition/object_recognition-None/object_recognition-None.yaml)
Traceback (most recent call last):

blah blah blah
raise Exception("Problem fetching yaml info for %s %s (%s)"%(stack_name, stack_version, url))

Exception: Problem fetching yaml info for object_recognition None (https://code.ros.org/svn/release/download/stacks/object_recognition/object_recognition-None/object_recognition-None.yaml)
None

http://build.willowgarage.com/job/debbuild-build-debs-electric-lucid-i386/1179/

Upon viewing the link there, I see my changes (#1 and #12) but I'm unsure if this is my fault. Is this something I should fix?
Also, (possibly unrelated) what relation does the above page have to this page: the electric build status page (as linked from the release wiki page)

A:

No, object_recognition had an invalid version it should have been null not None.  Fixed now.
