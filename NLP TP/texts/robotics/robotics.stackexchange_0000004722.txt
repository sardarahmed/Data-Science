Q:

Brush-less motor specs vs efficiency for multi-copters

I am looking for some figures surrounding the specs of brushless motors and their relative efficiency (in power usage terms) for multi-copter use. 
There are 4 basic specs for motors themselves:
 - Motor width (EG 28mm)
 - Motor height (EG 30mm)
 - "KV" - RPM per volt supplied (EG 800KV)
 - wattage (eg 300w)
This would then be a 28-30 800kv 300w motor. 
What i am looking for is a chart containing:
 - Motor spec
 - pack voltage (eg 14.8v)
 - Amps drawn @ various % throttle (10% to 100% say)
 - static thrust from various propellers (11x5, 12x6 etc etc)
Does such information exist?
I know its a BIT subjective as prop and motor designs vary slightly, but a baseline would be a start.

A:

You can use the eCalc Multicopter Calculator. You select a set of motors, propellers and battery size and the program will output lots of data: Thrust, Motor efficiency at hover, Current and Voltage at hover, Motor efficiency at maximum power, Current and Voltage at maximum power, etc.
