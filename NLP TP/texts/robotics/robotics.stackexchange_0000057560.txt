Q:

I don't have a robot, can i use ROS with my desktop until i get one?

I don't yet have an expensive robot or the time to build one, but I do like the idea of having access via an API, both in allowing a robot access to my API data, but additionally this could provide something along the lines of shared "robot time" for folks that don't have a robot but would like to actually work with one.
Another thought on this topic would be using something like the API interface that benkehoe posted a few days ago.
If possible - could I use my desktop system in the mean time and prepare some programs or computer vision locally by using the ROS distro?

A:

Simulate a robot in Gazebo and test your code on this robot.

Somehow I missed this important feature when I was going through the ROS website and tutorials.  I wish this was clearer to newbies who install ROS and run through the tutorials.
