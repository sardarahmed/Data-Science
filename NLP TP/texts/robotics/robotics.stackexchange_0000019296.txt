Q:

Picking up a cheap timer

I am currently working on ATmega328 timers. But it has maximum timer of only 16 bit. Even with a prescalar of 1024 and 16MHz clock, I can only produce a time interval of about 4 seconds. Although I can code ATmega 328 to get higher time intervals by some methods but I wish to have a 32 bit timer. 
Is there any microcontroller from ATMEL(I find them easy to use) which has this capability at the same or lower price? 
And what are some other timer options available for longer time durations(days or hours) ? 
Thanks! 

A:

Choosing a different controller is really unnecessary. Its absolutely common to implement long delays with 16 bit timers. The only thing you need to to is using a simple additional counter variable (software pre-scaler). 
Timer/Counter2 allows Clocking from external 32kHz low frequency crystal (watch crystal). So a good option would be, to use such a crystal connected to pins TOSC1 and TOSC2 (or similar).
The clock source can then be configured to increment the before mentioned hardware timer asynchronously. By setting the correct prescaler, you can achieve a Interrupt interval of exactly 1s for example. So within the ISR, you can just increment your global second counter.
Take a look at application note 1259 and/or the datasheet section for Timer/Counter2.
