Q:

Converting a bag with uncompressed Images to CompressedImages

I have an offline program that will bag.write sensor_msgs/Image and would rather compress them into a smaller format (e.g. JPEG) for easier streaming.  Compressing the bags with bz2 or lz4 is insufficient.  How do I do this offline (without using compressed image transport and publishing/subscribing) in C++ (for initial creation) and/or Python (post processing script on existing bags)?

A:

You will need to compress the image in your code like the compressed image transport does.
