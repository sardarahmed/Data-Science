Q:

ROS Groovy setup suggestions with Virtualbox

I'm new to ROS and I have Ubuntu 12.04 setup in a virtual box on my macbook pro retina display. I have 2 processors set aside along with 2GB RAM and 128MB video. I have 20GB disk with 1GB swap. And I have installed Guest Additions.
Anyways, I was just wondering if there were any other suggestions.
Thanks
Chet

A:

One thing I have done in the past is install ROS on OS X and the guest Ubuntu and let them talk locally. This way you can install packages that only work only on Ubuntu in the virtual machine, but run ressource intesive stuff on the Mac (e.g. rviz).
