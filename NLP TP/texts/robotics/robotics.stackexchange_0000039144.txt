Q:

rosjava errors on oneiric

When trying to make the simple example from the rosjava page I am running into several problems. The first is that rosdep is complaining that it cannot install 'ant'. This seems to be a solved problem (see https://code.ros.org/trac/ros/ticket/3783) but for some reason it is still a problem on my system.
Even when I make with a "rosmake --no-rosdep" I get problems with std_msgs for example:
check-gen-srv-skip:
gen-srv:
compile:
[javac] Compiling 3 source files to /home/stephen/.ros/rosjava/build/actionlib_msgs
[javac] GoalStatusArray.java:9: package org.ros.message.std_msgs does not exist
[javac]   public org.ros.message.std_msgs.Header header = new org.ros.message.std_msgs.Header();
