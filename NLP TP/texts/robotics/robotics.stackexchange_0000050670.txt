Q:

Reflexxes library for the PR2

I would like to work on integrating the academic version of the reflexxes library (www.relfexxes.com). Has anyone started working in this direction?

A:

It looks like MoveIt! may use Reflexxes Type II somewhere: http://moveit.ros.org/doxygen/add__time__parameterization_8cpp_source.html , and I know MoveIt! can be used on the PR2.
Beyond that, I'm not aware of any work integrating Reflexxes with the PR2.
