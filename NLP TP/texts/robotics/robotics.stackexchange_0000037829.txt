Q:

Settings to change the theme?

Hi all,
Since questions about this site should also be posed here: 
Is there an option to set the theme of answers.ros.org? 
The new theme doesn't suit me and I couldn't find anything in my profile.
Greetings 
Felix

Agreed. I find the heading font difficult to read which makes it hard to scan through the list of questions.

It's nice to see they updated the style, but I'm having a really hard time reading that font, and readjusting to the new spacing and such. Hopefully they'll take feedback into consideration and at the very least allow us to change it in our settings though I'm not sure if Askbot has that possiblity.

Thanks for posting this question. I didn't want to be "that guy". This theme is extremely difficult on the eyes. Search is broken-- it returns multiples of almost all of the search results. Also, in Firefox, going to your profile, then clicking on a link to one of your answers, causes a strange redirect to http://answers.ros.orgundefined19130/ where the number was something to do with the answer/question number.

Regarding the multiple results in search, see this ticket: https://code.ros.org/trac/ros/ticket/3844

We will be updating the skin back to ROS style shortly.  If you find any errors please ticket them here
