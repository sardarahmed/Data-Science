A:

You should just install Hydro as described here. This will install Hydro in addition to your existing Groovy installation. If you really want to, you can uninstall Groovy via "sudo apt-get remove ros-groovy-*" but you really don't need to. I have both versions on my computer and I switch back and forth when I need to by changing my .bashrc file from "source /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash" to "source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash" along with the catkin and package paths, then restarting the terminal.

Sounds good to me, as I have to work in both versions.
Does this mean that I have to maintain separate catkin_ws or can I have different Groovy and Hydro packages in the same Catkin_ws?

I believe the default recommendation is to use separate workspaces. I'm not sure if you could use same workspace but I don't see any reason why not.

You should NOT use the same workspace since CMake will use CMake config files from the location available in the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH when it is configured the first time. When you then switch the ROS distro those locations will not be updated. Therefore you would end up with a mixed up workspace.
