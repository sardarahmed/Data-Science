Q:

Error gazebo simulator in ros groovy

I am having problems when running: roslaunch gazebo_worlds empty_world.launch, in my ros groovy environment. I have two ros, fuerte and groovy installed in ubuntu 12.04 precise. When I switch to fuerte, it runs perfectly, but whenever switch to groovy, it produces an error message.
Error:

Having the same problem. Could be an ogre error as: source /opt/ros/groovy/stacks/simulator_gazebo/gazebo/setup.bash
[rospack] Error: stack/package ogre not found
Comment by ryann2k1 on 2013-05-29:
After checking, my system doesn't have ogre and when trying to install from ogre wiki, found out that it doesn't support for precise 12.04. any clue would be great?

"Msg Waiting for masterterminate called after throwing an instance of 'ros::InvalidNameException'"
I had a similar problem to this, but with the node name. There was a weird pointer allocation and I had to manually overwrite gazebo's ROS plugin to make it work. (in ROS package simulator_gazebo).

And I'm in Ubuntu 12.04 and have ogre running fine. It just wasn't in the right path. Try to look for it in your computer and if you find it change its path in the environment variable.
Comment by ryann2k1 on 2013-05-30:
are you running dual ros installation?, fuerte and groovy?
Comment by Neil Traft on 2014-07-09:
Has anyone found a fix? I have the same issue on at least 4 different machines... and yet there are other computers in my lab that work just fine. All machines had Ubuntu 12.04 installed from scratch and they all have different hardware specs. I followed the exact same instructions every time!
Comment by t.pimentel on 2014-07-24:
The recommended way to use Gazebo with ROS groovy (at least since June 2013, if I remember correctly) was not to use simulator_gazebo package that comes with ROS, but to install Gazebo as a standalone software from [http://gazebosim.org/ Gazebo Oficial Website].
Comment by Neil Traft on 2014-07-24:
Only true on Hydro and above; I'm using Groovy, which requires an older version of Gazebo that is packaged with ROS. However, I think I've figured out the reason: it appears that older version of Gazebo doesn't work very well on 32-bit operating systems.
Comment by Moda on 2014-07-28:
Gazebo had its forum, did you try to ask  your question there?
Comment by Neil Traft on 2014-07-28:
Yes, there were a couple of similar questions on the Gazebo Answers site. For reference, here they are: http://answers.gazebosim.org/question/3935/gazebo-15-crash-on-startup-invalidnameexception and http://answers.gazebosim.org/question/5221/launching-gazebo-fails-with-ros-groovy-pr2

A:

I can now confidently assert that this error (specifically the ros::InvalidNameException) occurs when running Gazebo 1.5 on a 32-bit operating system. The issue can be resolved by moving to 64-bit or to Hydro, but I don't know of a fix for 32-bit Groovy.
