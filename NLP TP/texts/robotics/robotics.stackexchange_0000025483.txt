Q:

remapping joint states from simulator

Is there a way of remapping the joint states published from Gazebo? I've tried via launch file when launching the gazebo and robot state publisher node.
Usually when I want to do this I remap using the joint state publisher, but since I'm running Gazebo, I do not need the joint state publisher.

Do you want a mechanism to remap gazebo topics, in a similar manner to ROS? If that is correct, could you please file a feature request on our bitbucket site?

Yes, that would solve what I'm trying to accomplish. I'll file a feature this afternoon, thanks!

This has been posted on the gazebo issue tracker as issue 301.
