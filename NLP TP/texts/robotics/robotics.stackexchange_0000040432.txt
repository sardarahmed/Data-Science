tnx ryan .
i think this way is correct.but i faced with this error when i want to run "turtlebot_node" ...
'failed to find rosdep daemontools for package turtlebot nod on os:ubuntu version :marverick'

A:

I suggest taking a look at the base TurtleBot stack. Specifically, turtlebot_node publishes encoder and IMU data, and an instance of robot_pose_ekf launched by "minimal.launch" within turtlebot_bringup combines the two.
