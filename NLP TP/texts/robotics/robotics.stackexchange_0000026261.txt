Q:

Is there an upper bound on the length of time that Gazebo can run?

Posted on the gazebo issue tracker.
(OR phrased another way) How long should (does) Gazebo run for?
If I, run Gazebo with the following world file, is there any reason that the server should terminate after a fixed duration of time?
(e.g. some sort of timeout that activates after X hours)
my.world:
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<sdf version="1.3">
  <world name="default">
    <physics type="ode">
      <gravity>0 0 9.8</gravity>

A:

I have let it run for hours and at times overnight. I've never tested it for multiple days. There's no pre-programmed limit that I've seen, but it always has the possibility of crashing or a memory leak dragging your system to a halt. If there's a crash that you see regularly, or if you can get a backtrace with gdb, I'd encourage you to file an issue on the gazebo issue tracker.
EDIT: Also, if you are recording a log file (gazebo -r) then you need to watch your disk space because the log files can get big very quickly.

I will file an issue, I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't missing something obvious. I'm seeing a crash regularly, and I'm trying to gather data about how it happens and the operating environment.  I also need to try with gazebo built from the "real" repo (tested with https://bitbucket.org/osrf/simulator_gazebo)

For reference 3 hours 12 minutes is the current run duration (must be a leak somewhere that my op environment is uncovering...)

If you are running custom plugins, they may be a source of memory leaks and bugs as well.

It could be an issue with the camera plugin. I'll test it on my machine.

I just tested it, and you have gravity pointing up, so that the camera and create fly away. I would guess that falling upwards for several hours could lead to a nan or something.
