Replace data.bag with just file name

Can you update your question by pasting the terminal outputs after running each commands, so that it will be easy to trace the problem.

A:

Your rosbag record command seems wrong. Your command should be like this

rosbag record -O data /scan /tf

Then try creating a map.
