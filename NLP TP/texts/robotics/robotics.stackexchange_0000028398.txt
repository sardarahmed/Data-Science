Q:

Using a gui-overlay plugin to choose GAZEBO_MASTER_URI for a gzclient

Hi,
i have several gzserver running in docker containers. Im mapping the container-ports from 11345 to localhost:xxxx (e.g. 1000 < xxxx < 1100).
I would like to write an gui plugin which opens an dialog window, allowing to choose one of the ports in my range as GAZEBO_MASTER_URI for my running gzclient.
Anyone know if this is possible? Im actually browsing the sourcecode of the gazebo gui (https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/src/bcbea7608b1ad88067ef652e8e7a4b93ec1001cf/gazebo/gui/?at=default) but i could need some hints from someone more experienced.

A:

I think that once the GUI plugin has been loaded, it is too late to change the master URI because the transport system has already been setup.
One alternative I can think of, but adds complexity, would be to have custom GUI program (doesn't even need to link against Gazebo) where you can choose a port and that program launches gzclient with the appropriate port.

I was expecting that answer. Well just wrote a simple python script to spawn gzclients with different master URIs. This will be ok. Thanks for replying!
