Q:

Callback doen't respond

I have the following node :
    def set_set_goal_pose_callback(pose,em):
        print "i am here", pose.pose.position.x
    def listener()
        em=ratslam.experience_map_younes.ExperienceMap()
        sub_goal=rospy.Subscriber("/ExperienceMap/RobotPose",PoseStamped,set_goal_pose_callback,em)
        rospy.spin()

   if __name__=='__main__':
        rospy.init_node("RatSLAMExperienceMap')
        listener()

When I execute the node, the function set_goal_pose_callback isn't called.
What could I do?

Are you sure that you are publishing something to that topic elsewhere?

No I don't publish any thing on that topic

A:

If nothing is published on that topic then that callback won't be executed. You need to publish information on that topic.
