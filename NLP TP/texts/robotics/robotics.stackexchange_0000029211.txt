Q:

Velodyne lidar lasers see through checkerboards

I created a velodyne lidar with this tutorial: http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=guided_i1
In my tests I also need checkerboards to be present, but lidar laseds just pierce then and return inf range value.
Any suggestions how to fix this?

A:

Is your Velodyne a ray sensor or a gpu_ray sensor?
If it's ray, the sensor detects objects by their collisions, so you need to add collision of the same shape as your checkerboard. If it's gpu_ray, the sensor detects objects by their visuals, and collision is not needed.
