Q:

How to fix RRTstar crashing on moveit?

Hi all
I am a beginner user of MoveIt. I have switched between every OMPL algorithm (switching among them in the context tab) but the RRTstar never runs and Moveit crashes. Any suggestions?
My Ubuntu version: 16.04
ROS Kinetic

A:

My OMPL version turned out to be old, therefore I solved the problem by simply removing and reinstalling it (NOT from source!).

If this really solved your issue then it would be good to report that on the issues I mentioned in my answer.
