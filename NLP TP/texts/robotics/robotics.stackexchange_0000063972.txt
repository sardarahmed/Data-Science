Q:

Layered costmap

Hello,
I am a newbie to ROS and especially the 2d_nav stack. So please pardon me if my query sounds to petty.
I have been reading the literature about the Layered costmap recently. I would like to use something similar. To be precise, I would like to add one layer and use the information in this layer during the planning process.
However, I am not very clear yet how the layered costmap works. Are there different layeres existing and the information at all layers is combined to form a final layer which is basically combination of say the inflation radii at different layers? Or information about each layer is maintained and fe to the planner? Or its something else?
Please let me know if you have any information about this.
Thank you in advance.

A:

David Lu et. Al published a paper on the layered costmaps which describes how the costmap update works at a high level (with pictures too). I've recently added a link to it in the source code as well.
