Q:

QR Code detection?

I am developing a project which makes use of visp_auto_tracker, among other packages.
The visp code allows to keep track of a QR o flashcode:
visp_auto_tracker
But it doesn't make any difference between QR codes (the package doesn't read them).
Is there any ROS QR Code detection package OR project available?
If there isn't, i'm planning to make a Java node that deciphers QR code from an image and present the result with a ROS message (or something similar).
Any help is appreciated.
Many greetings ROS community.

A:

There are some packages that do QR or generic barcode detection, but they are usually part of a stack and thus hard to use on their own. It would be nice to have a generic package for barcode detection.
The package I know of is cob_marker, which is part of cob_object_perception stack. It does require RGB-d sensor such as Kinect.
I have also written my own package for the task I had, namely simulating the Player's laser barcode driver. It only uses camera and estimates the barcode location based on a preset barcode size (not very precise). zbar_barcode_reader
