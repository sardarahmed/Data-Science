Q:

how to send published data to another program

I have a c++ program that uses a transform listener to publish data as topics. I want to know how I can (if possible) use this data that is published as input to another program. This means as the first program is publishing the data the new program is also receiving this data.
If you need any more clarification feel free to ask and any help would be appreciated.

I would take a look at this: http://wiki.ros.org/tf/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20tf%20listener%20(C%2B%2B). It is a tutorial on how to subscribe to frame transformations.
