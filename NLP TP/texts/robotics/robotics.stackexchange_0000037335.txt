Q:

PR2 Velocity Control

Is it possible to control the velocity (effort) of a PR2's gripper? So instead giving the position of the gripper, calculating the IK etcetc, I would like to give the velocity of the gripper as a vector and the arm will move accordingly until told otherwise.

A:

There is CartesianTwistController in robot_mechanism_controllers which should do exactly what you want. I don't know if there is a working configuration/launch file for PR2 though. But I think it shouldn't be too hard to configure.
