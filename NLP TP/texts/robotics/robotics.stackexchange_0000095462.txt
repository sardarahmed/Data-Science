Q:

What is ament_cmake job?

created a rclcpp package:
removed <depend>ament_cmake</depend> from package.xml
removed find_package(ament_cmake REQUIRED) from CMakeLists.txt

However, the package still builds fine.
The question is what does ament_cmake do in the CMakeList.txt exaclty? I thought it makes the colcon builds but I am able to build without it

A:

the main role of ament_cmake is to provide CMake macros that will make your job easier when developing multiple packages that depend on each other. None of it is required to build a CMake based ROS package.
An example of such macro is ament_target_dependencies, it condenses the following cmake logic into a single call:

target_compile_definitions()
target_include_directories()
target_link_libraries()
setting link flags on the target

Another (the most?) important macro it provides is ament_package.
This is what will handle the registration of your package in the ament index, generate the CMake config files for the project to be find_package'able, install the extra CMake config files you provide, install the package.xml of your package etc
You can find some information about ament_cmake in the section "Build type: ament_cmake" of https://design.ros2.org/articles/ament.html

Thank you for your quick reply.
Since we still at it, I have another question about ament. I know that ament_python is for building packages using python's setup.py and (for now) users can not mix ament_cmake with ament_python in the same package.
The question is what does ament_cmake_python do? and an explanation with a use-case/example would make me happy.
Sorry, there is just some lack of information/use-cases out there about some of ament functions.
