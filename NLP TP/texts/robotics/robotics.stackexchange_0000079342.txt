Q:

How to install pr2 teleop on indigo

I tried to git clone the package from here. But after doing catkin_make I got the following error.
Could not find a package configuration file provided by "app_manager" with
  any of the following names:

    app_managerConfig.cmake
    app_manager-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "app_manager" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "app_manager_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "app_manager" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
pr2_apps/pr2_app_manager/CMakeLists.txt:3 (find_package)

Please help. Thanks in advance.

A:

Please see #q252478 for instructions on how to build things from sources. Just git clone-ing is not enough.

Edit: pr2_teleop has also been released for Indigo (see the wiki page), so unless you have a good reason to build from sources, why not just use the provided binaries? A sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-pr2-teleop is always easier than building it yourself.
