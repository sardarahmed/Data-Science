Q:

ROS_INFO_ONCE in Python

Is there an equivalent to ROS_INFO_ONCES in rospy?
I found rospy.loginfo_throttle() but nothing like rospy.loginfo_once(). Is this really not implemented or just hidden somewhere?

Not quite sure, but I think that they do not exist in python. They are implemented in C++ using macros which are not that easy to translate in python.

A:

In python, there is no log once, but since Lunar we can use. Please refer http://wiki.ros.org/rospy/Overview/Logging

To have the actual code here: Since Lunar, there is rospy.loginfo_once.
