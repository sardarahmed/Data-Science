Q:

Link to PR2/Startrobot is down

I'm following the tutorial on this page:
http://wiki.ros.org/2dnav_pr2_app/Tutorials/RunningNavigationStack
As it says, I need to follow the steps according to this link:
http://pr.willowgarage.com/wiki/PR2/StartRobot
The problem is that the link isn't working. Normaly this isn't a problem, but I don't know whats written on that page.
Does someone knows how I can acces this page via another route? Or does someone has another solution?
Please let me know.
Kind regards,
Bert

I'm not sure if it's exactly the same, but this tutorial should contain similar information: http://wiki.ros.org/pr2_robot/Tutorials/Starting%20up%20the%20PR2
