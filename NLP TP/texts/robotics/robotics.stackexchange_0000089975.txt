Q:

I want to translate ROS Tutorials in Korean

I am a student in Korea and studying ROS.
I have been studying ROS with ROS Wiki in Korean.
But some tutorials are not translated, and other tutorials are written in 2013, 2012...
So I want to translate ROS tutorials in Korean, but I don't know how to translate them.
Please let me know how to translate them.

Hi, welcome to the ROS community and nice to hear you want to help translate wiki content.
Translating is not really that different from regular editing, and for that you first need an account. There are two steps:

register for an account here
request write access by commenting on this github issue

At this point you can access the wiki and edit pages.
To translate a tutorial (or any page really):

make a copy of the page and place it in the ko sub dir (use Copy page from the More Actions dropdown (on the right side of the page, under Page)
translate
save
