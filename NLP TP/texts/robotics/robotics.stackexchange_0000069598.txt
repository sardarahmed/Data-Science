Q:

Any Examples of URDF/MoveIt for Parallel Robots?

I'm working on providing MoveIt support for a parallel (Delta-style) robot.  Are there any examples of current parallel-mechanism robots that are being used with ROS?
I have seen discussions from 2011  and 2013, but no links to actual code.
I understand that we'll need to "cheat" a little in representing the robot in URDF, and provide our own FK/IK routines.  I think I've got a good handle on the required steps, but it would be helpful to review any other example implementations, if available.

Are you intending to do the low level control of the delta with ros as well? Or just plan in Cartesian space for the eef?

Hi,
do you have any updates on this?
Comment by danish-answers on 2017-01-19:
great, I have been looking into the ragnar. Can you give me a hint what was the hack you made? i understand that URDF does not support parallel robot.

The URDF is created with all floating joints. The tool plate is defined relative to base_link (a hack). The robot publishes 4 driven joint positions. A custom state_publisher node performs kinematics to compute the positions of all 8 links and the tool plate, and publishes the resulting transform

thank you very much. tat was helpful

I have a further question. Is MoveIt Integration available for Ragnar?

A:

We've actually completed this work, and published the ROS package for the delta-style Ragnar robot back in December 2015.

The package has been deleted / is not accessible anymore. Any reason?

Comments under questions of 5 years ago with accepted answers don't have great visibility.
re: any reason: you'd have to ask Blue Workforce.
There are some forks of the package available though, see Jmeyer1292/ROSRagnarEDU/network/members fi.

For what it's worth: Blue Workforce, the manufacturers of the Ragnar robot and owner of its driver repository declared bankrupcy and [were acquired by OnRobot](https://www.therobotreport.com/onrobot-acquires-blue-workforce-assets-robotics-developers/) in 2019.  So perhaps you'd have more luck reaching out to OnRobot about this repository.
