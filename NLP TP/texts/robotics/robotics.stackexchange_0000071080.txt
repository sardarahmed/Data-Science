Q:

What's the SLAM method in stereo_mapping of rtabmap_ros?

hello,
I want to  learn the stereo_mapping method  of the Rtabmap_ros in the http://wiki.ros.org/rtabmap website . But I just learned that it is  a RGB-D Graph SLAM approach based on a global Bayesian loop closure detector. I want to know what's the specical mechod  of slam ,such as KF-SLAM 、PF-SLAM or Graph optimization？And are there  any  papers about that slam method?
Thank you very much for your help!!!

A:

It uses graph optimization (TORO, g2o or GTSAM) to correct the map on loop closures. You can find the related papers on top of the project page: http://introlab.github.io/rtabmap/
However, there is no paper about the SLAM front-end (stereo odometry) yet :P
cheers
