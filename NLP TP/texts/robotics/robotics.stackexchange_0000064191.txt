Q:

How to get rotaion matrix or quaternion?

Hello all,
I am doing some arm planning about my robot. I have a point B(x2,y2,z2) in space where I want the end-effector A(x1,y1,z1) to go.
In my opinion, I had better get the quaternion of point B first, then get the IK using point B and quaternion, after that I can use  arm_navigation_msgs::GetMotionPlan to do a plan.
but I am unsure how to produce the quaternions.
or any other good method to plan end-effector from A to B?
Thanks in advance.

A:

May be this link will be helpful. You will have to use createquaternion function in tf namespace.

I saw function:
static tf::Quaternion tf::createQuaternionFromRPY   (   double      roll,
double      pitch,
double      yaw
)           [inline, static]
I need first get roll, pitch, yaw, do you think there is a function in ROS which I can get roll, pitch ,yaw? Thank you

Thanks for your answer.  This link text is helpful. I have to get roll,pitch,yaw at the point B first, and then use the function what you have suggested to get quaternion.
