Q:

Model State in Gazebo

I am trying to use '/gazebo/Model_states' topic to get the model states.
shouldn't the include be like
#include gazebo_msgs/ModelStates.h

and  callback function be like
void ModelStatecallback(const gazebo_msgs::ModelStates::ConstPtr& msg)
{
}

Is anything wrong in this ?  When I tried this I get following error.
/opt/ros/electric/stacks/ros_comm/clients/cpp/roscpp_traits/include/ros/message_traits.h:121: error: ‘__s_getMD5Sum’ is not a member of ‘int’

/opt/ros/electric/stacks/ros_comm/clients/cpp/roscpp_traits/include/ros/message_traits.h:138: error: ‘__s_getDataType’ is not a member of ‘int'

Any help is appreciated.

A:

I have had it working for my robot by using
#include <gazebo/ModelState.h>

I think there is also an extra '_msgs' and 's' in your function, so try it as
void ModelStatecallback(const gazebo::ModelState::ConstPtr& msg)
{
}

Check out the ROS Gazebo and ModelState definition pages for more details.

Hi Thomas, I already tried that combination as well but it does not work either.The 'ModelState definition' link that you posted  says 'This message is deprecated.Please use the version in gazebo_msgs instead' so I tried 'gazebo_msgs' and I want to know the position of a model so 'ModelStates'.
