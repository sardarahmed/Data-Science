A:

what don't you understand? What have you tried that hasn't worked?
There's nothing in your question that actually helps us answer it, and you've been asking the same kind of question over and over, and it doesn't seem like you've taken the community's input about how to solve your problem.
I suggest you read https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/
Most of your previous questions have demonstrated a lack of basic understanding of ROS, TF, and general programming practice; it looks like you're just copying and pasting code together, and that almost never produces the kind of result that you're looking for.
The problem that you're trying to solve requires programming; I suggest that you pick a programming language that you're familiar with (ROS has very good support for C++ and Python), or start with an introductory programming course and get familiar with the language before you attempt a more complex program, then go through the ROS tutorials before you try to tackle the final problem.

rostopic hz isn't going to help you plot the pose.

Take the rest of my advice above, and maybe you'll be able to figure it out. Otherwise, I can't help you.

You need to extrapolate from the existing tf subscriber and publisher examples to write the code you need. I think you want a TF subscriber, and a pose publisher, and you need to figure out how to incorporate those into a single program.
