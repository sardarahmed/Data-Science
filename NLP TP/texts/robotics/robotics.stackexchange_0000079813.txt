Q:

Point Grey Camera Driver Issue

I'm trying to use my point grey camera "Firefly MV"  working with ros
Running Ubuntu 16.04 on Nvedia TX1
Camera works fine using the pointgrey software (binaries) on this machine.
Launched the cmd:
roslaunch pointgrey_camera_driver camera.launch
[ERROR] [1490413273.037167925]: Failed to load nodelet [/camera/image_proc_debayer] of type [image_proc/debayer] even after refreshing the cache: Could not find library corresponding to plugin image_proc/debayer. Make sure the plugin description XML file has the correct name of the library and that the library actually exists.
[ERROR] [1490413273.037276049]: The error before refreshing the cache was: Could not find library corresponding to plugin image_proc/debayer. Make sure the plugin description XML file has the correct name of the library and that the library actually exists.

log file: /home/ubuntu/.ros/log/cf5bdaaa-1051-11e7-b5d5-00044b6696c8/camera-image_proc_debayer-3*.log
I'm thinking it's something to do w/ image_proc, So i've cloned the image pipeline git into catkin_ws/src and ran catkin make but the problem persists.
Any help would be greatly appreciated!!

What does it give you when you launch this: rosrun pointgrey_camera_driver list_cameras

It listed the camera properly.

A:

Hey guys I solved my own question - I ended up finding the binary for image pipeline.
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-image-pipeline

How did you solve the issue? I have the same issue that I have been trying to solve for a few days now.
$rosrun pointgrey_camera_driver list_cameras

What was the solution, please?
Comment by machinehum on 2017-10-16:
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-image-pipeline
That's all - I just didn't know there was a binary.

So the driver http://wiki.ros.org/pointgrey_camera_driver works well in TX1 now?
Comment by machinehum on 2017-10-17:
I got it to work
