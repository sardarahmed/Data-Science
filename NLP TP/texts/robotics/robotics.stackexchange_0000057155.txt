Q:

retrieve turtlebot orientation

hi everybody,
kindly help me out to retrieve exact turtlebot's orientation.
i have used yaw to determine the orientation but when the robot move the yaw become inaccurate.
the yaw command the i used is as follows:
   yaw=atan2(2*(x*y+w*z), w*w + x*x - y*y - z*z);

kindly,give me an advice on how to retrieve the exact turtlebot's orientation.
thank you.

A:

If you're getting Odometry msgs, you can use the function tf::getYaw with the odometry msg directly to get the yaw.
documentation is here: http://mirror.umd.edu/roswiki/doc/diamondback/api/tf/html/c++/namespacetf.html#a33e93f413622e296d0a2a93b252bbb4b
tf::getYaw(odom_msg.pose.pose.orientation)
