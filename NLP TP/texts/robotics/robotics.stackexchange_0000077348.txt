Q:

ros::param::getCached will not update and gives errors

Can't seem to make full use of ros::param::getCached....while I CAN retrieve a value that is set on rosmaster, I get this error continuously:
[DEBUG] [1479155346.850264931]: XML-RPC call [subscribeParam] returned an error (-1): [ERROR: parameter [caller_api] is not an XMLRPC URI]

[DEBUG] [1479155346.850767245]: Subscribe to parameter [/boob]: call to the master failed

This message comes from some python validator on the roscore side I think...and there my debugging ability will fail me.
Can I get some insight into what might be going on?  My ROS_MASTER_URI is not remarkable and my general ROS nodes operate correctly.

A:

I would add that doing some subsequent research, these errors happen and I fail when using:
ros::param::getCached()
however:
somenodehandle.getParamCached()  DOES seem to work.
so I think maybe the docs should specify that ros::param::getCached() is probably not to be used.   If you want updated parameters, one needs to go through a valid nodehandle.

Hm. If you feel this is a bug or an oversight, you could report this to the ros_comm issue tracker.
