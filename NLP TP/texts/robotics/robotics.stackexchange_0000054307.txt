Q:

rqt_plot waiting for message

Hello everyone
I am using rqt_plot in order to draw a couple variables (all floats) that come in several messages.
Problem is, some of the messages only come after some time.
So imagine I have
msg1/data,
msg2/data and
msg3/data
At start, only msg1 and msg2 are being published. After some time msg3 will also be published.
I wanted rqt_plot to draw all 3 values, but if I configure it to all msgs
rosrun rqt_plot rqt_plot /msg1/data /msg2/data /msg3/data
It will hang waiting for the first msg3 to be published:
WARNING: topic [/msg3/data] does not appear to be published yet. Waiting...
Is there a way to avoid this?
To make rqt_plot non blocking in waiting for messages?
Thanks
Miguel

Do you think this happens with specific type of topics or happens with any kind of topics?

Hi Saito
It happens with all kinds of topics, I think.

I came across this same issue.  rqt_plot saves whatever you last had displayed in a config file for "convenience" the next time that it is used.  You can fix this one of two ways easily:
(1) Clear all topics prior to exiting
(2) launch rqt_plot using: rosrun rqt_plot rqt_plot -e (the -e option stands for 'empty')
Hope that helps.  I found this very annoying myself.
