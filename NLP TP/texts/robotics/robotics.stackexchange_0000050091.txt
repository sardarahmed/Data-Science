Q:

Compilation error on Arduino sketch with ros_lib

I tried to run the ros_lib HelloWorld program on an Arduino Uno, but got the following error:

In file included from /home/turtlebot/sketchbook/libraries/ros_lib/ros.h:38:0,
                 from button_example.cpp:5:
/home/turtlebot/sketchbook/libraries/ros_lib/ros/node_handle.h: In member function ‘void ros::NodeHandle_::logdebug(const char*)’:
/home/turtlebot/sketchbook/libraries/ros_lib/ros/node_handle.h:414:13: error: ‘DEBUG’ is not a member of ‘rosserial_msgs::Log’

Background: I have groovy installed on my netbook . I used the instructions here with the rosbuild option to build rosserial_arduino on the netbook. I then moved the ros_lib libraries to the relevant Arduino folder and tried to run the example sketches on the Arduino.

Did you find a solution? I am stuck with the same error.

A:

Go to sketchbook/libraries/ros_lib/rosserial_msgs and open Log.h using a text editor.
Rplace ROSDEBUG with DEBUG save the file and your done.
