Q:

roslaunch command is not running

I created the package my_package inside the SRC folder and then i make a launch folder. In launch folder i make a launch file name name.launch then when i run the command
roslaunch my_package name.launch

when i pressed enter the following error occurred.
RLException: [name.launch] is neither a launch file in package [my_package] nor is [my_package] a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

I tried starting rosrun in other terminal and then run the command roslaunch but still the same error is showing

If you made your code by using cpp or py, you should modify CMake file.

A:

You need to build and then source your workspace before rosrun and roslaunch will be able to find files inside your packages. Follow these tutorials to understand the basics of how workspaces are created and used in ROS 1:

When you create a package you can do it with catkin_create_pkg <package_name> <package_dependencies> and do it inside the SRC folder. Then go to your catking folder through terminal and use catkin_make or catkin_make_isolated or catkin_build to build the package. Then you should be able to launch your code.
Also make sure to go to your carkin_ws and do source devel/setup.bash .
@Geoff answer is very helpful, although tutorials can be difficult sometimes.
