Q:

Is there a conversion tool for video to rosbag file?

We have some data stored as video (RGB images and audio). Has anyone created a tool to convert this into a ROS bag file, as two synchronized streams of images and sound? The application here is audio-visual integration.
If not, any code/functions/packages that'd be helpful to create such a tool?

A:

I'm not aware of such functionality at the moment, although it should be fairly easy to write with the Rosbag Code API and the OpenCV read/write functionality from video in the high gui. This needs to be converted to a rosimage using the cv_bridge. I'm also interested in writing a package that does this for video in both directions, so if you need help.
There is an option of doing this with rosbag play/record and a second image_saver node, but as far as I know there's no integrated solution.
For audio you could have a look at Morgan's audio_capture stack.
