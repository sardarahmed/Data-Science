Q:

colcon build ros1_bridge not producing executable

UPDATE: my original question was about colcon build parameters, but thanks to the answer I discovered that the problem was not there.
Hence I have adjusted a little bit the question for future reference.
Hi,
I'm basically following the ROS2 official documentation for installing from sources (reference here).
When I build the workspace using
colcon build 

It looks like ros1_bridge executables are not installed.
If I source everything using
source install/setup.zsh

The output of ros2 pkg list shows ros1_bridge, but, checking ros2 pkg executables there are no executables.
I have the following directory
.ros2_ws/install/ros1_bridge
  |_ include
  |_ lib
     |_ libros1_bridge.so
     |_ python3.5
     |_ ros1_bridge
        |_ EXECUTABLES should be here but are not present.
  |_ share

Do you know why?

A:

Is it possible that when you built the workspace for the merged install directory the ROS 1 environment was not sourced?
For the ros1_bridge libraries and binaries to be built, there must be some ROS 1 libraries and messages available in the environment. There are instructions in the README: https://github.com/ros2/ros1_bridge#building-the-bridge-from-source
I was able to reproduce the "missing" files in both merged and isolated install spaces and produce complete installations of the ros1_bridge in both when sourcing a ROS 1 workspace.

Thank you, I didn't noticed that part in the README and probably for some reason I had the ROS1 environment sourced when I compiled the first time.

@alsora do you mind updating your question title to be ros1_bridge specific. I think it has the potential to help others who encounter the same issue but the title won't be searchable for someone having issues with the ros1_bridge rather than with --merge-install.

Sure! I have also sent a PR to that repo, since using Colcon there was not even a warning message that something was missing... That's why I was searching the solution somewhere else rather than in the ros1_bridge docs
