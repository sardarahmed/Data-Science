Q:

I want to change the speed of ABB IRB2400 in rviz by varying state_display_time property using cpp code ?How can i do this?

I am looking for a function to be included in my cpp code to change stste_display_time when neeeded.

Edit: Is it possible to change the speed of manipulation in RVIZ (ROS Indigo) ?  I am using an ABB Robot manipulator and I would like to very the speed of manipulation. One way I found is by varying state_display_time using changedstatedisplaytime() function. But in my understanding state_display_time variable is only available up to Groovy, Is that right?  Can anybody have any alternate way of solving this problem. Thanking you in advance.
