Q:

ROS Sensors Driver Android Application Issue

I am trying to use the ROS Sensors Driver application for android devices, but have been unsuccessful in my attempts to get the app to work.  Does the android_sensors_driver work on a virtualbox version of ubuntu running  ROS?  I have followed the directions exactly how they are stated here: http://wiki.ros.org/android_sensors_driver/Tutorials/Connecting%20to%20a%20ROS%20Master but I am not able to successfully get ROS to recognize android-sensors-driver as a node.  According to the virtualbox wired connection, my IP address is 10.0.2.15.  I have tried the following
http://10.0.2.15:11311/
http://ROS:11311/                             because ROS is displayed when roscore is running
http://10.0.2.2:11311/                   because of a suggestion on an online forum
but nothing seems to work.   Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.

Can you include the exact commands you're running and the error output you're seeing in your question?

The terminal now recognizes the sensor drivers When I test individual node connectivity:
viki@ROS:~$ rosnode ping /android_sensors_driver_imu
rosnode: node is [/android_sensors_driver_imu]
pinging /android_sensors_driver_imu with a timeout of 3.0s
unknown network error contacting node: timed out

A:

You need to forward port 11311 to the virtual machine.

After you do that, you need to connect to your HOST machine's IP:11311.  http://HOST_IP_HERE:11311/

Thanks!  I'm now trying to test the connectivity of the nodes but I'm getting the following:
viki@ROS:~$ rosnode ping /android_sensors_driver_imu
rosnode: node is [/android_sensors_driver_imu]
pinging /android_sensors_driver_imu with a timeout of 3.0s
unknown network error contacting node: timed out

Also should my ROS_MASTER_URI also be http://HOST_IP_HERE:11311/ ?  Do I change it as well or leave it as it is?  Whenever I change that parameter to include the host ip, I get the following:  ROS_MASTER_URI [http://.......:11311/] host is not set to this machine

Hmmm that is tricky.
You can probably get around this by using hostnames for launching roscore and setting ROS_IP=HOST_IP.  For instance, ROS_MASTER_URI=http:://virtual-machine-name:11311/; ROS_IP=HOST_IP; roscore.
Then connect via android using MASTER_URI=http://HOST_IP:11311/

Sorry for the newb question, but when you say "virtual-machine-name" are you referring to the name given according to the initial VirtualBox start menu, which in my case would be "ROS Groovy Galapagos"?
