A:

It's probably because of your pc specs.
I have met a similar issue when I started using gazebo and I had to change pc to make it work. Be sure you don't have a low-end graphics card and a cpu technology that can handle the computational requirements of gazebo.
The most probable cause is the graphics card though.
