Q:

Setting GPS waypoints in tum_simulator

From the following tutorial: https://github.com/dougvk/tum_simulator I've been able to simulate flying an ardrone in gazebo. I can receive gps coordinates/ latitude from the /fix rostopic. However, I can't see a way to set gps-waypoints?
I've tried using the gps-waypoint branch of ardrone_autonomy and enabling nav_data_gps in a number of places in the launch files but nothing seems to work.
Is this possible?

did u solve that autopilot problem? if so, could u tell me how please?

I didn't unfortunately. I ended up using the x and y coordinates of the drone as if they were lat-lng coordinates and manually moving towards points by rotating towards the correct direction and moving forward manually.

This was only really a solution as I was flying in straight lines and rotating at right angles however. I'm sure you could work out more complex flight paths using a bit of maths though.

A:

I've done precisely that a few months ago. I managed to create a separate controller that publishes appropriate velocity commands to the topic and reads the position. So you would have to create a closed loop. As far as I know there are no libraries for autonomous flight compatible with tum_simulator.
