Q:

Opencv solvepnp() and ROS tf

I am using solvepnp() to get the pose of a checkerboard. But with a static marker  and a moving camera the rotations and translations are not correct.
solvepnp() gives a rotation in Rodriguez angles and a translation. Through a rotation matrix I convert this to quaternions. And broadcast this to tf as the transformation camera to marker. But is this the correct way?

A:

Nominally your approach sounds correct. You want to find the pose of the checkerboard int the frame of the camera and then publish a transform from the camera to the checkerboard.
