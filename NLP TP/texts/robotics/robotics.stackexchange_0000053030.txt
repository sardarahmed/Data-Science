Q:

Issue with URDF tutorial in ROS Groovy

I just started on the tutorial here and ran the code for the example urdf -
roslaunch urdf_tutorial display.launch model:=01-myfirst.urdf

This gives me an error which goes like this -

New config files have an .rviz extension and use YAML formatting. The format changed between Fuerte and Groovy. There is not (yet) an automated conversion program.

What should I do with this error? I didn't find any alternate way yet. Could anyone let me know about this? Thanks.

A:

I found this file -
https://github.com/ros/urdf_tutorial/blob/master/urdf_tutorial/urdf.rviz
and copied the file in the urdf_tutorial folder.
I then edited the display.launch file (using gedit) and changed "urdf.vcg" to "urdf.rviz" in that file.
It now works without any issues.

Coming to the xacro portion of the tutorial, the same change must be made to the 'xacrodisplay.launch' file (urdf.vcg -- > urdf.rviz).
