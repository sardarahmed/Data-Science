Q:

Usage Map from ROSCon 2014?

Hey for those of you who were at ROSCon 2014 in Chicago there was a slick looking demo showing how many usage statistics of different packages, number of bugs, etc. I think it also showed a map of users geographically. I think it might have been demoed during a lightning talk, not sure.
I am NOT referring to this map: http://metrorobots.com/rosmap.html
Anyone know what I'm talking about or where it's located?
