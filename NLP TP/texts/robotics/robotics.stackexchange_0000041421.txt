Q:

Ros install on OSX help?

I am trying to install ROS on my Mac. Using the instructions provided for the mac homebrew installation (obviously). I get through to step 3.1 and then get hung up on running cmake step. The configuration however does not finish. I get several warnings but only one error. Here is my report. -- +++ catkin -- Found gtest: gtests will be built.

Is wxwidgets installed?
Comment by allenh1 on 2012-06-18:
Which OS X are you running (lion, snow leopard, leopard, etc)

A:

It is failing because you don't have wxWidgets installed.  Even with wxWidgets installed, I am not sure the rx stack works on OS X right now.  You can skip building it by deleting the rx folder.  I would recommend Electric at the moment for OS X anyways.
