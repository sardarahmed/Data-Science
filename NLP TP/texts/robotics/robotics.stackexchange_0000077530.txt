A:

If both messages have headers, then look into the Time Synchronizers in the message_filters package.
That would allow you to handle (time synchronised) pairs of incoming msgs in a single callback.

I tried the code in time synchronizer which subscribe to two sensor_msg data types that is working.But when i tried to subcribe to two Int8 msg of type std_msgs A lot errors are showing.

Well, both msgs need to have a header. Int8 doesn't have a header, so that could explain the errors.
Any synchronisation strategy will need some piece of information with which it can determine which msgs 'belong together'. The stamp is one way of doing that. Without it, it won't work.

Could you please mention that you've posted those 'errors' to another question in the future? Thanks.
