Q:

openni_tracker failed because of InitFromXml failed

Hello ,I am a new user of ROS openni.
Now I'm using ubuntu 12.04 and my ROS dist is groovy.
when I run the command rosrun openni_tracker openni_tracker,the only thing I got is a error message:
InitFromXml failed: Can't create any node of the requested type!
I followed several solutions on the ROS community,still get the same error message
I googled a lot ,but not a correct solution for me.Any help will be appreciated ,It really drives me crazy.

Can anybody help me?

A:

You should install install NITE-Bin-Dev, as for me , I install NITE-Bin-Dev-Linux-x64-v1.5.2.21
Then run the install.sh in it.
Hope it helps.

I have this same error with 14.04 on ROS Indigo. I have downloaded NITE-Bin-Dev-linux-x86-v1.5.2.23 and run the install.sh. Is there anything else that I can try?
