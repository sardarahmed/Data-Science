Q:

transformation from map to laser

Hi, I have a robot system which has frame odom and laser. tf publish the transfermation from odom to laser. I am building my own localization node which publish the frame "map" and the transformation from map to odom. When I use rviz, if I select odom as fixed frame, I can see the laser data. If I select "map" as fixed frame, rviz complains that there is no transformation from map to laser. I thought since I defined the transformation from map to odom, and the existing system has the transformation from odom to laser, rviz should be able to  figure out the transformation from map to laser. But this does not seem to be the case. What's wrong?

Try rosrun tf view_frames which will produce a graph showing the connections between the TF frames.  Use evince frames.pdf to view the graph.  Are all the frames joined up as you expect?

I can see map->odom->base_link->base_footprint. But laser it not there.

Please note that the transformation from odom to base_link is inside tf. However, the transformation from base_link to Laser is described in tf_static.

I found the root cause was the time when running bag files. I need to set use_sim_time to be true. fine.
