Hello,
I am a newbee.. I have recently installed ubuntu precise and Ros groovy (full desktop) by following the instructions on the ros wiki. Next I am trying to install the Gazebo. I have done the following commands:
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu quantal main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-latest.list'
wget http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
wget http://packages.ros.org/ros.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gazebo
. /usr/share/gazebo/setup.sh
echo "source /usr/share/gazebo/setup.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
gazebo
when i run the last command, I get the following error:

I am glad you made it work, you should mark your answer as correct, in case if others run into the same problem, they know how to fix it. And maybe add to the title something regarding ATI graphics cards, so it will make more sense. Cheers :)
