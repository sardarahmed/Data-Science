Q:

MoveIt Move only one Joint

Hello everybody,
Can someone tell me, how to move only one joint with MoveIt -  Move Group Interface and not the end-effector pose.
Has someone experiences and can give me a some tips?
Thanks!

A:

Get the current joint values from your moveGroup (C++ version):
std::vector<double> joints;
joints = moveGroup.getCurrentJointValues();

Set whatever joint you want to change:
joints.at(y) = x.x;

Send the move command:
moveGroup.setJointValueTarget(joints);
moveGroup.move();

+1 This is probably the simplest way to do it.
However, note that this actually sends target values for all joints in the group, using the current values as target. This is slightly different (depending on the driver) compared to requesting only one joint to move.
