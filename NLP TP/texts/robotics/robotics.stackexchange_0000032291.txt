Q:

Training/using the BiGG detector

I am trying to evaluate the REIN framework. As a starting point, I am trying to replicate some of the results presented in REIN - A Fast, Robust, Scalable REcognition INfrastructure
. First, I am trying to get the BiGG detector trained and running, but I am having problems. I followed the tutorial on training and using BiGG. I trained the detector on 4 objects using the "manually selected 3D bounding box" method. This created 4 files in the database/models/BiGG/ subdirectory. The files are a few hundred KB each (I don't know if that's expected).
The trouble begins when I try running the BiGG detector. It seems to load all 4 models ok, then notifies that it starts doing detections. Next, the bigg detection nodelet continuously outputs the line Detections: 9 regardless of what's in front of the camera, doesn't publish anything on /bigg/detections, and starts consuming more and more RAM at a rate of ~30-40MB/sec until all the system RAM is depleted.
I think the REIN framework looks very promising, so I would really appreciate help getting some of the detectors such as BiGG running so that I can try REIN out.

A:

REIN is not being developed anymore. We are working on a non-ROS specific version of it. Previous object recognition pipelines (like BIGG) will be ported back to it once stable. A release is expected for July/August 2011.
