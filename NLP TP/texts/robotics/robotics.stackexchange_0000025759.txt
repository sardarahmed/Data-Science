ROS Answers SE migration: corobot urdf

Is there the possibility to simulate the corobot in gazebo?
Where can I find the corresponding urdf file?

Try it: http://www.ros.org/cgi-bin/mt-4.3/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1&tag=CoroBot&limit=20

A:

I think you'll have to make the URDF yourself. The link pointed to by Daniel Vaz is only for ROS control of a real corobot.
