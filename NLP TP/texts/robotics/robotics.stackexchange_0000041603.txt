Q:

Bad Gyro Callibration

I am receiving the following error while running the Turtlebot dashboard:
Level: Error
Message: Bad Gyro Calibration Offset: The gyro average is outside the standard deviation.
Gyro Enabled: True
Raw Gyro Rate: 311
Calibration Offset: 311
Calibration Buffer: [311, 310, 310, ..., 310] (Values range from 310-311.)
I saw the other two questions regarding this and tried the solutions suggested to no avail. I have cycled the power, unplugged and replugged the power board several times and nothing has worked. I am also receiving this error with two different Turtlebots. Both are assembled using kits from Clearpath Robotics.
Possible solutions?

Did you ever get this issue resolved? I have basically the same problem.  I also noticed the raw gyro value would change if the robot was turning, which seems to indicate the gyro is NOT malfunctioning.

I seem to have found the right combination of calibration numbers to make the gyro report correct values.  I still get an error message on the dashboard saying bad gyro calibration, but the robot model in rviz is turning almost exactly as much as the physical turtlebot.

Contact support@clearpathrobotics.com; we'll hook you up with replacements. :)
