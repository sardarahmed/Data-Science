Q:

acceleration measurement error

Dear all,
I have an IMU.
Even if I have made the calibration of the accelerometer, it still gives me the wrong distance value of the robot when I integrate the acceleration twice.
And after the movement(when I stopped the robot), the acceleration is always different from zero.
How can I fix these problems?
Thanks for your helps.

A:

Double integrating over the acceleration measurements is typically so noisy that the data can't even be reliable enough to use. I would recommend that you find another method to calculate distance because it will be incredibly difficult to get any reasonable data from your calculations.
