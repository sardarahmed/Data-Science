Q:

When doing mapping with slam_toolbox, can we move robot with goal setting?

During ROS1, we can have gmapping and move_base node to do slam. While mapping, we can move robot around by setting goal in rviz window.
However, I am not sure how to do this in ROS2 with slam_toolbox. According to nav 2 tutorial, this is possible. Unfortunately, my robot was not moving at all after receiving the goal_pose.
