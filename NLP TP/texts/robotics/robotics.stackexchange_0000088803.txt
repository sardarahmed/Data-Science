Q:

What amount of odometry drift would be considered having an accurate base?

I'm working on some projects and it occurred to me that I've never seen any documents where people specify their robot base odometry drift to benchmark what a typical amount of drift would be and what's the point where I can say I have "good" odometry.
For instance, when I move my base in a 20 meter perimeter square, in forward direction I have about 20cm drift (1%) and in the lateral direction, I have about 50cm (2.5%) drift on a differential drive base.
Can anyone share here their specification or documentation of others?

Arrr, I'd think ye should be lookin fer' some researrrch, mat'ee. Calibration papers be adverrrtisin' all manner o' statistics.
