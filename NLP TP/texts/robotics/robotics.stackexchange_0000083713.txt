Q:

rviz to plot a plane with known (x,y,z) points

Hi guys,
I have a list of (x,y,z) points all of which lie on the same plane. I need to visualize this plane on rviz with these points.
I googled on how to make a plane on rviz and someone mentioned making a cube but reduce a dimension so that it becomes a plane. Now, for a cube, we give a point which will become its center. But I have a bunch of (x,y,z) points that I need to visualize as a plane in rviz. How do I go about doing this? Any thoughts would be welcome.

A:

The other answers contain some good pointers, but I would recommend you try out davetcoleman/rviz_visual_tools. It already provides you with the infrastructure to get RViz to render planes (in addition to all sorts of other geometric shapes).

I found this git repo which builds on davetcoleman/rviz_visual_tools and gives me a python implementation of publishing markers.

The Python lib is a good find, but notice that the last commit was already almost 2 years ago. rviz_visual_tools has seen some development since that time, so you might want to check whether the Python lib is missing something.
