Q:

how to make template images for pr2_plugs_actions

Hi,
Does anyone know how to build PCA-SIFT descriptors in pr2_plugs_actions/outlet_template?
We want to add new outlet template in our building.
Thanks

A:

Hi, if you want to add a new outlet template, you might want to look at pr2_plugs_actions/outlet_templates/configs for examples of existing templates and generate a new one. I am not sure I understand the PCA-SIFT part of the question. The last time I saw outlet detection, it was using one way descriptors. If you want to replace that with PCA-SIFT, take a look at outlet_template_t class from outlet_pose_estimation package.
