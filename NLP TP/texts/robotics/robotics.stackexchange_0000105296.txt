Q:

Hope to disable collision between Robot model and object model While the Lidar could still detect the Object in Gazebo

Right now I have added this code to the collision element of the Object model sdf file, which allows the robot could go through the object very very slowly. Is there a way to make the robot have no collision with the object while I could still use Lidar to detect the objects in the Gazebo?

<collide_without_contact>true</collide_without_contact>

A:

If you are on Gazebo Classic (e.g. Gazebo 11), you can try to use collide_without_contact:

See here for the spec,
See here for an example.

Unfortunately, this seems not implemented yet for 'new Gazebo' (i.e. 'Gazebo Sim', e.g. Gazebo Fortress or Garden or Harmonic).
A possible alternative (both for Gazebo Classic as well as Gazebo Sim) is to use a collision bitmask:

See here for documentation
(It is a Gazebo Classic documentation page, but I think the usage is identical in Gazebo Sim),

See the gz-sim GitHub repository for an example demo world.
