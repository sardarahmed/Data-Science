Q:

How can I use radar for the obstacle detection?

How can I use the radar in my local_costmap_params to detect the obstacles? I am displaying data in mm in topic /radar.

A:

Check the costmap configuration part of this tutorial.
You will need to convert the radar data into LaserScan or PointCloud and then add the sensor under the obstacle_layer in your costmap config files. Should look something like this:
point_cloud_sensor: {sensor_frame: frame_name, data_type: PointCloud, topic: topic_name, marking: true, clearing: true}
