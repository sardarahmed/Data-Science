Q:

proliferation of dynamic_reconfigure servers due to image_proc or image_transport

Hi-
I've noticed recently that it has become increasingly difficult to make use of the dynamic reconfigure gui because there are too many servers in the dropdown list. It seems now every image transport is adding two servers to the list, one for "compressed" and one for "theora".
When the PR2 is running there is more than a whole screen's worth of dynamic reconfigure servers just for the image processing stuff. Trying to find or quickly switch between servers in the drop down menu is really annoying... I've resorted to making my servers of interest start with 'a_' so that I can find them first, but this seems hacky/unsustainable.
Is there any way to set a flag that tells some of those image transport nodes that I don't want them to advertise their servers? Or to tell the gui to ignore a set of nodes? (Maybe the servers could advertise a priority, like the different ROS_INFO/ROS_WARN levels, or they could belong to groups that are easier to manage.)
Ideas?

A:

You could write a Trac enhancement ticket for dynamic_reconfigure for this. Maybe something along the lines of Eric's suggestion. We are currently planning Fuerte changes, maybe this could be included.
