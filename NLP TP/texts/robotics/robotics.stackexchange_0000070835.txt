Q:

roscd: command not found

Hi
I faced this error: "roscd: command not found" same as rosnode except for roscore.
I have already setup my .bashrc by "source /opt/ros/jade/setup.bash"
Thanks

Yes I have checked all the possible solutions in the net but none of them worked.

Can you check printenv | grep ROS output?

Sorry for late reply. I have installed ROS again and it works now.
