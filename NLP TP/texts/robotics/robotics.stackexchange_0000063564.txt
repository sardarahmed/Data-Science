Q:

simultaneous Rosbag record and playback

Can I playback .bag at the same time as it is getting recorded ? Can I map my laser scans in real-time ?

A:

No; you cannot play back a log file while it is being recorded - and it doesn't make sense to try.
If you want to run mapping online, just run mapping on your robot.

You can record on a running system, it does not prevent other downstream processes from receiving.
