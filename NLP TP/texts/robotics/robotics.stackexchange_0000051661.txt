Q:

what is proxy controller?

Hi,
In joint_trajectory_action_controller, there is a proxy controller mode. I am wondering what is proxy controller? What's difference between proxy controller and normal pid controller?
Thanks for any help in advance!

A:

A proxy controller allows to converge to a reference signal without overshoots, especially when the reference is far from the current state. The cpp file has a more detailed description.
I created an issue to move the documentation to the header with proper Doxygen tags, so it can be easier to find.

Hi Adolfo, I try to read the cpp file, but I found it's hard for me to understand it especially I have no idea about the concept of proxy controller. Could you please give me a link which describing the concept and principle of proxy control? Thx a lot!

I'm not a user of this feature, and can't say if the implementation maps a reference publication 1:1, or whether the authors introduced custom modifications. You might consider contacting the original authors, or someone familiar with this specific implementation. That's as much as I can help.

It appears that as of Hydro, control_toolbox has moved to https://github.com/ros-controls/control_toolbox. The version for groovy is https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_control/tree/groovy-devel/control_toolbox
