Q:

Remapping arguments of topics

Hi all:
I have a question about remapping topics in launch files. I have a controller which is subscribed to the topics: /pelican/pose and /pelican/twist, expecting a Pose and a Twist respectively. Gazebo publishes both information in the topic /gazebo/model_states, so I expected do do the following remappings:
/gazebo/model_states/pose[1] to /pelican/pose
/gazebo/model_states/twist[1] to /pelican/twist
Doing the remap of /gazebo/model_states works well, but the ones before do not work. Anyone knows how can I do that, or something similar?
Thank you in advance

Could you post your launch-file?

A:

You are trying to remap the content of the message not the topic, which you can't do directly.
You'll need to write a simple node that subscribes to gazebo/model_states and publishes the desired topics.
Another option, if you don't want to write the simple node, would be to try to use the topic-tools/transform node.
Edit: this also won't work...
