Q:

Problem with launching ur_gazebo

I am checking out this tutorial on ur_gazebo. I have all the requirements installed. However, when I try roslaunch ur_gazebo ur5.launch, it gives me some errors and says (Full output attached at the end)
[spawn_gazebo_model-4] process has finished cleanly
[joint_state_controller_spawner-7] process has finished cleanly
[arm_controller_spawner-8] process has finished cleanly

Still I can see gazebo working as expected (I think). I can run the moveit config, plan a path using rviz and execute and in gazebo it seems to be working fine. What am I missing here? I have no prior experience in this so an explanation on this is much appreciated.
roslaunch ur_gazebo ur5.launch output:

A:

it gives me some errors and says

[spawn_gazebo_model-4] process has finished cleanly

[joint_state_controller_spawner-7] process has finished cleanly
[arm_controller_spawner-8] process has finished cleanly

these are not errors, but merely informative messages telling you that those nodes have cleanly exited.
Everything seems to be working as it should.

[spawn_gazebo_model-4] process has finished cleanly

this node is only responsible for spawning (adding) the robot in the Gazebo world. As soon as it's done, it's no longer needed.

[joint_state_controller_spawner-7] process has finished cleanly

As the name implies (_spawner), this one also only is needed to load a controller. Once the controller is loaded, it's job is done.

[arm_controller_spawner-8] process has finished cleanly

And the same for this one.
Nodes can shut down and not be in error. That's perfectly OK.

Edit:

The thing is they exit without me killing them with ctrl+c

they are supposed to.

You can see there are a few errors in the roslaunch output

If you are referring to the "no p gain specified for pid." then those are also not fatal and things will still work.
The Gazebo plugin has changed, but has remained bw-compatible. Refer to ros-industrial/universal_robot#443 for some more context.

Edit:
Thank you for the elaboration. I thought I was doing something the wrong way.
