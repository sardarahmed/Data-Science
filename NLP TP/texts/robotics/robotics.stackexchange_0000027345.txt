Q:

What is the topic ~/world_stats?

I am following this tutorial . It teaches me to write a program to listen on the topic ~/world_stats.
I did and it worked. However, when I run $ gz topic -l, I cannot find a topic named ~/world_stats. So what is ~/world_stats? and what does the tilde '~' mean here? And what is
'ConstWorldStatisticsPtr'?
The following is the listener.cpp files for your reference:
#include <gazebo/transport/transport.hh>
#include <gazebo/msgs/msgs.hh>
#include <gazebo/gazebo.hh>

#include <iostream>

/////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Function is called everytime a message is received.
void cb(ConstWorldStatisticsPtr &_msg)
{
  // Dump the message contents to stdout.
  std::cout << _msg->DebugString();
}

/////////////////////////////////////////////////
int main(int _argc, char **_argv)
{
  // Load gazebo
  gazebo::setupClient(_argc, _argv);

  // Create our node for communication
  gazebo::transport::NodePtr node(new gazebo::transport::Node());
  node->Init();

  // Listen to Gazebo world_stats topic
  gazebo::transport::SubscriberPtr sub = node->Subscribe("~/world_stats", cb);

  // Busy wait loop...replace with your own code as needed.
  while (true)
    gazebo::common::Time::MSleep(10);

  // Make sure to shut everything down.
  gazebo::shutdown();
}

A:

~/world_stats gives you statistics about the world, such as the time elapsed and the paused state.

The type of the messages being published is gazebo::msgs::WorldStatistics. Here you can see all the message fields. ConstWorldStatisticsPtr is the same as boost::shared_ptr<const gazebo::msgs::WorldStatistics>.

The tilde ~ is shorthand for the default world. If you're running the default world, when you do $ gz topic -l, you'll see a list of topics all starting with /gazebo/default and one of them is /gazebo/default/world_stats, which corresponds to the ~/world_stats you're subscribing to.

You can run $ gz topic -e /gazebo/default/world_stats, to see all fields of the message printed out as the simulation is running.
