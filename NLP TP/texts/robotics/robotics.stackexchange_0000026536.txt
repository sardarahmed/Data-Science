Q:

atlas does not react in gazebo

Hi,
I'm knew to ROS and Gazebo. I'm trying to get familiar to the Gazebo and ROS with the DRC Environment. Therefore, I was trying the Tutorial in http://gazebosim.org/wiki/Tutorials/drcsim/2.2/sending\_joint\_controller\_commands\_over\_ros .
I can compile and build the Tutorial properly. Even, if I echo the published joint commands, I see the proper values that have been set. But the received JointStates don't change. I always get the same values for the position. As I don't have an nvidia Graphics Chip, I'm using the atlas_cpu_lidar.launch Launch-Files. Gazebo and RVIZ, both don't show any changes from the initial state of Atlas.
But somehow, if I try to teleoperate Atlas with "roslaunch atlas_utils keyboard_teleop.launch" I can make Atlas move.
Thank You

A:

Try using AtlasCommand message instead. I had the same problem when the controller was updated. Plus you should check this tutorial http://gazebosim.org/wiki/Tutorials/drcsim/2.6/atlas_sim_interface because the Atlas needs to be in user mode to be controlled.
Hope it helps,
