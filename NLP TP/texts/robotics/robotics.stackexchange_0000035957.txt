Q:

Launch file not well-configured

I am using polar_scan_matcher package to use along with my own package called pcd_robot. The pcd_robot is publishing a topic of "/scan" and instead of using data from their dataset, I want to use the laser scan data from my own one. This can be done by tweaking some lines in the launch file. The original one looks like this:
<launch>

  <param name="/use_sim_time" value="true"/>

  <node pkg="rviz" type="rviz" name="rviz" 
    args="-d $(find polar_scan_matcher)/demo/demo.vcg"/>

  <node pkg="rosbag" type="rosbag" name="rosbag" 
    args="play $(find polar_scan_matcher)/demo/demo.bag --delay=5 --clock"/>

  <node pkg="polar_scan_matcher" type="psm_node" name="psm_node" output="screen">
    <param name="max_error" value="0.20"/>
    <param name="search_window" value="100"/>
  </node>

  <node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="base_link_to_laser" 
    args="0.0 0.0 0.0 0 0 0 /base_link /laser 40" />

</launch>

Hence, I have edited it and commented the unused rosbag input data. The altered launch file is as follows:
<launch>

  <param name="/use_sim_time" value="true"/>

  <node pkg="rviz" type="rviz" name="rviz" 
    args="-d $(find polar_scan_matcher)/demo/demo.vcg"/>

  <!--
  <node pkg="rosbag" type="rosbag" name="rosbag" 
    args="play $(find polar_scan_matcher)/demo/demo.bag --delay=5 --clock"/>
  -->

  <node pkg="pcd_robot" type="publisher_node" name="publisher_node" 
    <remap from="/scan" to="scan"/>

  <node pkg="polar_scan_matcher" type="psm_node" name="psm_node" output="screen">
    <param name="max_error" value="0.20"/>
    <param name="search_window" value="100"/>
  </node>

  <node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="base_link_to_laser" 
    args="0.0 0.0 0.0 0 0 0 /base_link /laser 40" />

</launch>

However, when I run "roslaunch pcd_robot try.launch" I got an error saying that "Invalid roslaunch XML syntax: not well-formed (invalid token): line 10, column 58
"
Is it something wrong with my launch file or my command, perhaps?

A:

  

The node tag doesn't end (> missing) and is not closed (< /node>).

Something like this doesn't work though: <!-- -- -->

@arebgun: But if we refer to "http://www.tizag.com/xmlTutorial/xmlcomment.php", it is normal to have a block comment like that..Please correct me if I'm wrong..
Comment by arebgun on 2011-11-24:
You can't have a double dash (--) inside an xml comment tag which is pretty annoying.
Comment by alfa_80 on 2011-11-24:
Thanks, it is somehow true your suggestion, another strange thing is it is only working when I completely deleted the commented lines..

I've tried like this, it doesn't work either:

I've tried like the one you type above, I got the same error.
