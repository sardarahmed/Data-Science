A:

openni_kinect is deprecated, you should use freenect_stack instead from here
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-freenect-stack

And make sure the Kinect is connected, and if you are using Kinect V2, it should be connected to Intel USB3.0 port.
Once you install it, you need to start publishing the kinect camera topics by running the freenect_launch file:
roslaunch freenect_launch freenect.launch

Then open another shell to visualize the rgb image or any other topic:
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/rgb/image_color

Yes and if that doesn't work then make sure the Kinect is getting 12v of power. Pretty obvious but it happens to the best of us hehe
