Q:

sound_play change language

I want to change the language of sound_play. Since it is based on festival, I have downloaded the relative language package and setted it as default for festival. In festival it works, but sound_play still speaks in its default english.
How can I change the default sound_play language?
Is it also possible to change language when sound_play node is running?

A:

I found the solution. The method "say" in sound_play.h takes a voice as argument and if it is omitted, the default is the English one.
