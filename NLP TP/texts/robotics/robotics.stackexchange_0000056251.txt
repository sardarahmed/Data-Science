Q:

How to get current pose for DENSO VS060

I tried to get current pose of DENSO VS060 after executing command below
roslaunch denso_launch denso_vs060_moveit_demo_simulation.launch
What I did in python was
group = MoveGroupCommander("manipulator")
temp_pose=group.get_current_pose()

Then I saw error message
time is not initialized. Have you called init_node()?

So I used the command below.
rospy.init_node("move_group")

Then RViz freezed.
Would you please tell me how to get current pose of robot?

Thank you!
Now I understand that I made stupid mistake.

A:

What happens when you use a different name for your node? move_group is already used by MoveIt.
