Q:

Bluetooth in a ROS package

Hi,
I'm new in the ROS world. I just wanna know how I can use Bluetooth in a ROS package.
I added Bluetooth libraries in the source file by:
#include <bluetooth/bluetooth.h>
#include <bluetooth/hci.h>
#include <bluetooth/hci_lib.h>

and then I tried to retrieve the resource number to open the socket by:
dev_id = hci_get_route(NULL);
sock = hci_open_dev( dev_id ); 

but when I try to build this package I got errors saying:

undefined reference to `hci_get_route'

undefined reference to `hci_open_dev'

so this means the Bluetooth library is still not included. How I can add this?
Any help will be appreciated.

A:

You're including the right headers, but you also need to tell the compiler to link against the bluetooth library.
In CMake, you can link against libraries with the target_link_libraries command:
target_link_libraries(my_target bluetooth)

(you'll need to replace my_target with the name of your target)
This is the equivalent of passing -lbluetooth to the compiler when building with gcc manually.
