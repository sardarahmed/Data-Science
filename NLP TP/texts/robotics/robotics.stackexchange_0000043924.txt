Q:

How to generate Bonsai Tree, Octomap

I want to have a colored octomap of my office.

Then, how do I create a graph with my kinect?

Thanks for the reply and sorry for the dummy question. I am not used to the jargon yet. Also, I believe that differences in several versions of octomap make older documents obsolete. I have been lost a lot of times.
