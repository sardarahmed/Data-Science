Q:

kinect.launch for TurtleBot Not Working

When I type "roslaunch turtlebot_bringup kinect.launch" in order to start my kinect for map building, I get these messages published over and over again. What do you think is the problem?

A:

Your problem is in the error:
Cannot load nodelet /openni_camera for one exists with that name already

This suggests that openni_camera has already been launched.  When you launch the map building demo it already starts the kinect for you, you should not start it seperately.  If you're still having trouble please post all the things which you have launched and we can look for the conflict.

I am launching it in the turtlebot

it seems like the camera isn't coming up are you launching kinect.launch on the turtlebot or the desktop?

I just went through the tutorial, but no images are displayed when I select the camera or point cloud data.

"ssh -X turtlebot@192.168.1.11" "export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.1.11:11311" "rosrun turtlebot_dashboard turtlebot_dashboard&" "roslaunch turtlebot_bringup kinect.launch" Then I open rviz in a seperate terminal, because I am just trying to see data from the kinect right now, not make a map.

Even if I do not launch the demo, I still get the same error. Here is what I do :
