Q:

navigation_stack send goal

hi, i try to move my robot in gazebo via the navigation stack. but i have no idea how to send goals to him, andhttp://www.ros.org/wiki/navigation/Tutorials/SendingSimpleGoals does not work, there comes just a compiler error
`/usr/bin/ld: CMakeFiles/simple_navigation_goals.dir/src/simple_navigation_goals.o: undefined reference to symbol 'vtable for boost::detail::thread_data_base'
  /usr/bin/ld: note: 'vtable for boost::detail::thread_data_base' is defined in DSO /usr/lib/libboost_thread.so.1.46.1 so try adding it to the linker command line
  /usr/lib/libboost_thread.so.1.46.1: could not read symbols: Invalid operation
  collect2: ld returned 1 exit status`

are there some other easy examples or have you one ? it can also be in python.Or you can help me solve the compiler error (:

Check your boost version to be sure that you have thread_data_base included.

i have boost 1.46.1 and i have libboos-thread1.46.1 in /var/lib/dpkg/info.... where shuld be the thread_data_base ?

A:

The error message you get says that you should try adding boost to your linker command. Try that. Just uncomment the two boost related lines in your CMakeLists.txt, i.e. add the following:
rosbuild_add_boost_directories()
rosbuild_link_boost(${PROJECT_NAME} thread)

the old error is gone but i get another, it is:
Cannot specify link libraries for target "simple_navigation_goals" which is
not built by this project.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
CMakeLists.txt:28 (rosbuild_link_boost)
-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
any ideas ?

@coon you should ask this as a separate question.
Comment by yangyangcv on 2012-10-08:
@coon you need to put the line rosbuild_link_boost(${PROJECT_NAME} thread) under the line rosbuild_add_executable()
