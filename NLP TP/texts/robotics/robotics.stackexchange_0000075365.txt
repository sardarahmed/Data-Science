Q:

Invoking "make cmake_check_build_system" failed

Hi... I am to ROS and i would be posting lots of questions. :)
Th thing i am trying to  do is that i want to create multiple packages inside single catkin workspace.
I created my package "my_first_pkg" inside "catkin_ws/src". It worked fine. Then i tried to add another package in the same "catkin_ws/src" with the name "my_second_pkg" using "catkin_create_pkg".  Then i run following command
catkin_make
it gives me following error.
Invoking "make cmake_check_build_system" failed

Hi.
Thanks for the reply. I found the error. There was problem with the other packages in the same workspace. One of the other package had wrong cmakelist.txt file..
Thanks :)
