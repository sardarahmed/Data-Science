Q:

Difference between various ros distro?

I have a doubt on why there are so many distributions of ros2 or ros and what are the major factors that changes between them?

A:

Have a look at the official documentation about Distributions:

What is a Distribution?
A ROS distribution is a versioned set of ROS packages. These are akin to Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu). The purpose of the ROS distributions is to let developers work against a relatively stable codebase until they are ready to roll everything forward. Therefore once a distribution is released, we try to limit changes to bug fixes and non-breaking improvements for the core packages (every thing under ros-desktop-full). That generally applies to the whole community, but for “higher” level packages, the rules are less strict, and so it falls to the maintainers of a given package to avoid breaking changes.

Active development goes into one distribution at a time. Each distro has an EOL (end-of-life) date — some distributions are "LTS" (long-term support) and have longer lifespans.
The "Rolling" distro is a special, continuously-updated distro that always has the very latest packages, but is less stable. If you use Rolling, you must be prepared to handle frequent breakages due to package upgrades.
Significant changes to core ROS features in each distro can be found in the release's page on the wiki, for example Humble: https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Releases/Release-Humble-Hawksbill.html#new-features-in-this-ros-2-release
Additionally, each package may have its own release notes. Individual version bumps for each package are called out in Discourse under the Packaging and Release Management category.
