Q:

sw_urdf_explorer for 32bit Windows

Has there been a version of sw_urdf_explorer tested for 32bit versions of Windows yet? I know that this might be a possibility but the documentation says that it's only been tested on 64bit (and I see that it won't even install on 32bit machines).
Currently the machine I'm on is a 32bit Windows 7 machine... and it will take a very long time for IT to upgrade to 64bit (if they will allow it at all).
Thank you

If you tag your question correctly, you might attract the attention from more people in-the-know.

The title field isn't included? I'll update that.

A:

Not that I know of. I seem to remember Stephen Brawner (the author) explaining at ROSCon'13 that it's mostly because of a math library he's using. IIRC there isn't a 32bit version of it (or he can't use it).

Ok. I guess that makes sense. Thanks for the heads up.
