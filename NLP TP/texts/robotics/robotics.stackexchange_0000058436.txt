A:

Hi,
search for the package "player" in wiki.ros.org and install the package. It is notified in the error message
 Error: package/stack drrobot_jaguar4x4_player depends on non-existent package player
Just follow the same way if more errors turn up.
Later if other errors turn, the error message gives the place where the error occurs, for example the line number in some file.cpp. Even that might help you in figuring out the error.
While installing take care that you are installing the package for the correct version of ROS.
Good luck
