Q:

wideanglecamera tutorial not working with Gazebo 6.7

Hello,
I am trying to run the wideanglecamera tutorial with Gazebo 6.7.  The camera shows up under the insert menu and I can insert the sensor which then appears as a box in the GUI.  However, when I hit Ctrl-T to list the topics, there is no ImageStamped topic to choose like there is if I insert a normal camera.
There are no errors in the terminal window from which I launched Gazebo.
Any thoughts on how I can debug this?
Thanks!
patrick

A:

looking at the Changelog, the wide angle camera feature was added in gazebo 7. The tutorial needs to be updated to reflect this. It's actually in a branch and never got merged.

Just confirming that the wide angle camera works in Gazebo 7.

It also doesn't appear that the 'wideanglecamera' type is listed in the SDF options.
