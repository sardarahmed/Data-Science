Please update your original question and mark the answer to your question when available instead of posting new questions as "answers".  This is not an e-mail thread, it's a Q&A/Stackoverflow forum.

A:

Your log says that Gazebo couldn't find the file libgazebo_ros_controller_manager.so. It's in the package pr2_gazebo_plugins (in the stack pr2_simulator), so make sure that pr2_simulator is installed and run a rosmake pr2_gazebo_plugins.
