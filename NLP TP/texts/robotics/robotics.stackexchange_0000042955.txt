Q:

depth of kinect

Hello, I use the ununtu and openni.
I'm looking at the kinect depth value.
(http://www.ros.org/wiki/kinect_calibration/technical).
There is "Disparity to depth relationship".
Is it open-kinect or openni or both relationship?
I want to know depth value and compare the actual distance.

The hompage' host used libfreenect driver.
Can anyone tell me how to obtain depth value or disparity value in ubuntu, openni
driver?
Is it possible extract the distance or disparity in a particular point ?
Thanks.

A:

You can get the distance values out using the PointCloud interface.  For technical details on disparity to depth calibration see the kinect_calibration wiki page.
