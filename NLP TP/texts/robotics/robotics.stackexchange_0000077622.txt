A:

The ROS Velodyne driver is different from other LIDARs in that it does not publish standard LaserScan messages, but VelodyneScan ones. These have to be converted to the standard PointCloud2 message format using an additional step. How this works is described on the velodyne_pointcloud wiki page.
