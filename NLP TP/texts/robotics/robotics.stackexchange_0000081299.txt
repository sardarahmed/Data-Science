Q:

what is the coordinates in robot_localization

Hi Tom/all:
As suggested in robot_localization document and REP 103, the imu data is required to be adhere to frame like "x forward, y left, z up", and odom data  should adhere to frame like "x east, y north, z up" (which is ENU coordinates).
Is that so? The relevant input data should go with the coordinates mentioned above or we need to broadcast transform from imuMsg->frame_id to baselink and odomMsg->frame_id to odom.
By the way, what coordinate should GPS data adhere to ?
I have no idea whether I'm right. I do appreciate it if someone can enlighten it to me.

A:

All the data is transformed into its target frames before being fused. Pose data will get transformed in the frame dictated by the world_frame parameter, and twist data will get transformed into the frame dictated by the base_link_frame parameter.
GPS data should adhere to the standards in the sensor_msgs/NavSatFix message.
