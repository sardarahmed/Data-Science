Q:

Eigen Conversion invalid matrix template parameters

I am trying to run the Darpa Arm Robot in electric, has anybody else tried this?
The install instructions are given only for cturtle, but from a bit more reading I believed that the incompatibility with diamondback and electric had to do with converting from eigen2->eigen3.
After a few code changes, I have got all but one package to build, BarrettCompat.
Has anybody else run into this sort of error?

quick google on the error yields: http://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=74&t=98536

A:

The compilation errors mentioned were solved
here
The Dashboard UI runs, but there are still errors running the controllers and loading robot models into gazebo.

That's fair, although I should really ask separate questions, one relating to the Eigen conversion and a larger question about an up-to-date darpa arm sim stack.

marking question as answered as it appears you have found your solution for the Eigen errors posted in the original post
