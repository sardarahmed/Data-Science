Q:

Moveit planning scene collision padding

Moveit's planning scene has collision checking functions, some with and some without padding.  Is the padding configurable and how big is it by default?

A:

For PlanningScenes maintained by the PlanningSceneMonitor, the parameters can be configured by ROS parameters.
The code that parses the parameters can be found here: https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/blob/kinetic-devel/moveit_ros/planning/planning_scene_monitor/src/planning_scene_monitor.cpp#L1412
However, greping further through the code suggests that default_object_padd_ and default_attached_padd_ are not implemented though. They can be queried through getDefault*Padding, but are never used anywhere.
So you can set the default robot padding, scale, and their corresponding link versions through the parameters and these should be supported.
To set the parameters for a scene that is not maintained by the PSM, you have to set them for its RobotState directly:  https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/blob/kinetic-devel/moveit_ros/planning/planning_scene_monitor/src/planning_scene_monitor.cpp#L198
By default the padding seems to be 0.0 everywhere.

I'm still not 100% sure what is the best way to add this parameters.
I created a paddings.yaml file and loaded it through rosparam in my launch file, and make sure it's sitting in the correct namespace like //robot_description_planning/default_attached_padding ?
