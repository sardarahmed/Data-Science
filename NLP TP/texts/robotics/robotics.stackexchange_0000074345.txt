Q:

Installing a Hydro package in Indigo

Hello,
I am quite new to ROS. I have the following package:
ethzasl_icp_mapping
which is available for hydro but not for indigo. How can I install this package with indigo?
Thanks in advance.

A:

There is a indigo-devel version available on the github, have you tried using this ?
Just git clone it in you catkin workspace and then use git checkout to switch to the hydro-devel branch

Thanks for the reply. So, in simple terms, I need to get the indigo devel branch and get it to my catkin workspace folder and execute catkin_make?
I don't understand why we need to switch to hydro-devel branch.

indigo develstand for indigo-development and is the branch that the developer tested on indigo. If you don't switch to it, it might work, but if it doesn't, then it's not a bug. It's the wrong branch. Otherwise, in simple term, yes you're right :)

Thank You so much. But just to be clear the last part of the answer should be git checkout to switch to the the indigo-devel branch, right?

it's git checkout and then the name of branch. If you press tab, it should auto-complete

Yes. I will. But I would like to mention that I haven't actually tried this one.
