Q:

Installing ROS on a tethered system

I'm developing a tank styled robot with an Odroid-N2 on the robot and a topside computer from which it's controlled BMO a joystick and web based GUI. Do I need to install Ubuntu and ROS on both controllers/computers?
Are there any versions of Ubuntu + ROS that are recommended for the above configuration?

Hello, Did you use succesfully ROS with the Odroid -N2 ?

A:

If the computer on top is only used for the web based GUI and the joystick, you could use something like rosbridge to send data from the topside computer to the Odroid via socket connections. Then, you won't need ROS on the topside computer.
However, if the system is tethered, I'd recommend to properly set up ROS on both computers, as this is an absolutely typical use case in ROS. Many robots consist of multiple computers. Make sure to follow the NetworkSetup instructions and check out the links in there.
As this is a ROS feature that has been tied into it from the beginning, there is no recommended version to use other than choose an up-to-date distro like melodic (or at least kinetic, as this is still supported. indigo is EOL).

Hi everybody, if in this link https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-n2-with-4gbyte-ram-2/, it says that Ubuntu 20.04 is supported so, it means that can I install ROS noetic?
