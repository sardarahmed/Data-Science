Q:

Methods of Making Your TurtleBot3 Speak

Has anyone gotten a TurtleBot3 listening for speech and then responding? If so, what libraries have you used?
Note: I'm currently using ROS Kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04

A:

I'm not aware of a existing setup for the Turtlebot3, but if none turns up, for the recognition part see this previous answer. For the "speak" part it's probably easiest to use/adapt the method described here: sound_play.

Thanks Stefan. I've tried using pocketsphinx which ended up working well, but at the cost of some poor recognition of my dictionary. Have you used sound_play? If so, what would be the advantages of using that over pyttsx?

Didn't use it, but pyttsx looks like it's just fine for what you're doing. I guess a slight advantage of sound_play would be that you can publish what to say on a topic, but that's easy to reproduce with pyttsx too.
