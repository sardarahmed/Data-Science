Q:

Problems with catkin with ros noetic

Hello everyone, I updated ubuntu from 18.04 version to 20.04 version and consequently I installed ros noetic.
The problem is: I must install some files running a .sh file, one of these files is python-catkin-tools, but I read that ros noetic doesn't work with python 2, so in the .sh file I changed that line with python3-catkin-tools, but when the script is running, it stops with this error:
pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: The 'osrf-pycommon>0.1.1' distribution was not found and is required by catkin-tools.

If it can help you with the answer, the last line of .sh file is "catkin build"
Is there a fix with which I can avoid this error? Or I must reinstall ubuntu 18.04 with ros melodic?

Ok I installed catkin_tools with
with pip3 install --user git+https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools.git

But now the error is:
catkin: command not found

I also tried with "catkin_make" instead "catkin build", but it's the same problem

Try opening a new shell/terminal.
Note: this is no longer really a ROS/Catkin problem, as installing packages using pip into your $HOME with --user is normal practice with pip.

A:

Please see catkin/catkin_tools#594. This is a known issue.
And see #q353113 for a work-around (note: this is really a work-around, not a fix).
