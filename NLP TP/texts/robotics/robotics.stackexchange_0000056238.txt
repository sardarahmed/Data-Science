Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Need Packages

Hi,
where can i get following packages:

Eigen
arm_navigation_msgs

If i try to clone arm navigatin from kforge.ros.org i get an error:
hg clone url:/armnavigation/armnavigation armnavigation

i had to write url because for me it's not allowed to post links url stands for http : //kforge.ros.org
is kforge.ros.org down?

Is there any reason you cannot install the binary packages? Also, adding information on your OS, version of ROS and what you intent to do might help people answering your question. Also: please know that arm_navigation is sort of EOL in groovy (hydro doesn't have it anymore).

I have ubuntu 12.04 LTS and ROS Groovy. If i try to install the armnavigation package i get the error "connection timed out" and i don't know where to get the Eigen package.

A:

I assume you have followed the ROS installation tutorial?
Just to clarify: is there any reason you cannot do sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-arm-navigation? And yes, kforge.ros.org is being phased out (if it hasn't been shutdown completely already).
