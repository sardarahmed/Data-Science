Q:

Jacobian of a 6DOF arm

I have a robot with 6 DOF. I read a lot of tutorial on how to compute the Jacobian, but usually all examples are for planar robots with 2DOF.
I don't understand how can I get the Jacobian of a 6 DOF robot.
I know that Torque = J_transpose * Force.
I want to compute the force of my end effector when I apply some torque. For this reason I need the Jacobian.
Thank you very much

A:

Write the forward kinematic equations $$\vec(x) = F\vec(\theta)$$
Taking the partial derivatives of each $\vec (x)$ term with respect to each joint variable $\vec(\theta)$ will give you $J$.
