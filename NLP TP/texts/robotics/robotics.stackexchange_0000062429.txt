Q:

rosdep update is requested repeatedly

Hi,
I followed the tutorial Installing on Raspberry PI/Raspbian from source and have a problem at point 5.6. When I try the command "sudo rosdep check --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro groovy" I get the error "ERROR: your rosdep installation has not been initialized yet.  Please run: rosdep update". The command "rosdep update" has no effect and error message comes again. I run "sudo rosdep init" before.
Thanks for help.
UPDATE 1:
rosdep update
Hit https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/raw/master/rosdep/osx-homebrew.yaml
Hit https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/raw/master/rosdep/base.yaml
Hit https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/raw/master/rosdep/python.yaml
Hit https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/raw/master/rosdep/ruby.yaml
Hit https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/raw/master/releases/fuerte.yaml
Query rosdistro index https://raw.github.com/ros/rosdistro/master/index.yaml
Add distro "groovy"
Add distro "hydro"
Add distro "indigo"
updated cache in /root/.ros/rosdep/sources.cache

With the sudo command (sudo rosdep update) it works and I could run after some fixes in the file "gbpdistro_support.py" the following command:
sudo rosdep check --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro groovy --os=debian:wheezy
but got another problem:

I have built and installed the collada package  successfully how it was described in point 5.5.
UPDATE 2:
The result is not much different.
sudo rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro groovy -yr --os=debian:wheezy
executing command [sudo apt-get install -y ros-groovy-urdf]

UPDATE 3:
I need the package "collada-dom2.4-dp-base (>= 2.4.0.16+rpi1)" but there is no source or package via apt-get available.
sudo rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro groovy -yr --os=debian:wheezy --skip-keys=collada-dom

Please show your commands and the console output from running them.
Comment by BennyRe on 2014-09-09:
To install system dependencies use rosdep install instead of check.

A:

WIth your manually installation of collada-dom you'll want to tell rosdep to skip that key as you've manually installed it.  Try using "--skip-keys=collada-dom" in your rosdep install invocation.
Edit re update 3:
Unless you're very lucky, you cannot install binaries on top of your custom compiled version of collada-dom. Any package which builds on top of that you'll want to build from source and not install the binary debian packages.
