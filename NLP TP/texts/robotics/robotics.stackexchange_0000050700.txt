Q:

Blender fails?

Hello, I don't know why this is happening but I've posted the terminal output below. I'm running Xubuntu 12.04 desktop inside VirtualBox. I've enabled 3D acceleration in the VM settings? Blender tries to start but then the screen just becomes garbled/distorted? Roscore appears to start without any problems. Any ideas or thoughts are greatly appreciated. Also, I apologize in advance if this is the wrong forum for this question but I couldn't find anything similar for blender or morse. Thanks.

I have the same issue, did you find an answer???

I believe it was a hardware issue. Blender/MORSE didn't like the AMD cpu & ATI video card combo. I run the VM on another machine that has an Intel cpu & an NVIDIA video card without any problem. You can get away with an AMD cpu & an NVIDIA video combo but I haven't seen a whole lot of success with AMD & ATI combos.

In the end I had the first error of pulseaudio (PulseAudio returned minreq > tlength/2..........) with an update I needed from the sound driver, I downgraded it afterwards. Anyway, I was doing a new installation in my machine, I had the error with the ros sync, because the simulation without ros seemed to be working well, nevertheless, I need further testing but right now I have it working.

Hello!
Running 3D applications from a virtual machine is generally speaking a bad idea. Even if you get a correct display, performances are likely to be poor.
Based on the error message (Major opcode of failed request: 14 (X_GetGeometry)), it looks like the VM 3D driver does not support an OpenGL primitive required by Blender.
Besides, you should update both Ubuntu and MORSE to their latest version (the 3D drivers have improved a lot over the last 2 years).
Last point: we usually recommend MORSE users to use answer.ros.org to ask questions related to MORSE + ROS. For 'MORSE only' questions, it is usually preferable to drop a mail to morse-users@laas.fr or to fill a bug on MORSE GitHub repository.
