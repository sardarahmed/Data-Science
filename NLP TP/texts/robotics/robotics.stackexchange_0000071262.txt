Q:

RGBDSLAM -- points of interest

Hi,
I need to get all of the points of interest detected with rgbdslam including depth.
So what are the topics to use with RGBDSLAM to get all of the points of interest (SIFT) detected during the creation of the 3D map ?
I think all of these topics will help me:
/rgbdslam/online_clouds          /rgbdslam/pose_graph_markers
but I'm not sure what are published in these topics. Are they SIFT points (and where is the origin of x, y and z in this case ?).
Thanks for reply

A:

Rgbdslam doesn't send the features. The topic you mention is for visualization of the poses only.
I've recently wrote a addition to send ORB features on a custom topic, but haven't published it, because I thought there wouldn't be any demand. If you have some ROS and C++ skill, I can create a branch for you that should be easily adapted to SIFT.
[Update:]
Checkout the new branch feature-msg-output on github. It works for sending out ORB features on the topic /rgbdslam/features.
The message msg/Feature.msg defines a uint8[] descriptor. For SIFT (or SURF) you probably want to change that to float32[] descriptor
In node.cpp, method Node::toFeatureMessage() you need to reflect that change, by replacing unsigned char with float. And replace the CV_8UC1 in the if-condition by CV_32FC1.

Hello Felix,
Thanks for reply.
Yes I have ROS and C++ skills. Tell me where to get this new branch, I will test it and give you feedbacks.
Thanks again !
