Q:

Working with Gazebo9.x instead of Gazebo7 with ros kinetic

Hello ROS developers,
I'm currently working with ROS kinetic and Gazebo7. I want to add some animated human actors to a Gazebo7 world, but i can't, and the reason is that these [tutorials] (http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=actor&cat=build_robot) are for Gazebo >= 8.x.
I tried to install Gazbo9 (https://medium.com/@abhiksingla10/setting-up-ros-kinetic-and-gazebo-8-or-9-70f2231af21a). It worked but some of the packages (e.g. turtlebot_teleop "for controlling the turtlebot2 in simulation using keyboard") doesn't work anymore. Can anyone give me some help?
Thank you

It’s not recommended to mix Gazebo versions with ROS1 distros. Not sure why teleop will be affected unless a plugin does not longer work.

Yes, mixing causes a lot of problems.
Comment by osilva on 2022-01-03:
If possible I’d suggest don’t mix them up. Restart and keep separate distros.

Yeah, thank you so much, I've already switched to melodic and gazebo9.

Hi @self_seghiri

Gazebo is an independent project like
boost, ogre or any other project used
by ROS. Usually, the latest major
version of gazebo available at the
beginning of every ROS release cycle

Source: http://gazebosim.org/tutorials/?tut=ros_wrapper_versions
However packages developed for a particular ROS distro target particular Gazebo versions so installing different version may work for some packages but as you have seen first hand it creates issues with others, thus is not recommended to mix.
Guideline:

ROS Kinetic: Gazebo 7.x
ROS Melodic: Gazebo 9.x
ROS Noetic: Gazebo 11.x
ROS2 Dashing: Gazebo 9.x
ROS2 Eloquent: Gazebo 9.x
ROS2 Foxy: Gazebo 11.x
