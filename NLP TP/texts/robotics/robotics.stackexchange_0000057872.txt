Q:

improve odom by laserscan

How can I improve odom of a robot by a laserscan- what package can i use?I don't have static, global map. I found laser_scan_matcher, but I don't know if it's still supported.
Maybe i should play with dynamic costmap and amcl? or maybe there is sth better?
Thanks in advance

AMCL needs a static map to match against. I've not used laser_scan_matcher but it does look promising, and there's a hydro branch in the source repo.  Is using a laser scanner your only option for improving odometry?

I think it is this option, but maybe i am wrong. What kind of improvement there exist (i know about IMU and this laser-scan-mach)

If you have a cmaera, visual odometry is pretty common (track visual features using cameras). Here's a ROS package that does visual odometry: http://wiki.ros.org/viso2_ros

You can also setup hector_mapping to provide odometry. In the "correct_odometry_publisher" branch there are some changes and this example launch file that has already been used for faking odometry on a robot to provide it to AMCL.

This looks nice, but It provides odmo, not enchances one, right? I assume I'd have to make my own node to make this 2 odom sources "work together".

You can fuse two sources of odometry together with a Kalman filter, which if configured properly will improve your base odometry. robot_localization package provide a very nice and easy-to-integrate EKF implementation: http://wiki.ros.org/robot_localization
