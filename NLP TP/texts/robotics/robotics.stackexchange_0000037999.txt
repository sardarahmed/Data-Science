Q:

Kinect: how do I convert depth image to pointcloud?

I want to send kinect data wirelessly to a desktop computer. Point clouds consume a lot of bandwidth, so I want to send the depth images instead. But on my desktop computer, what is the easiest way to convert those depth images into point clouds? Do I have to make my own node and just grab the correct point cloud functions out of the kinect driver or has someone already done that?

A:

There also now appears to be a new package depth_image_proc in the image_pipeline stack for Fuerte that will take a Kinect uint16 image and transforms it into a point cloud.

are there any tutorials on that package? I have been trying so hard to find a way to use that package on my rosbag data, but still got no luck. Really frustrated
