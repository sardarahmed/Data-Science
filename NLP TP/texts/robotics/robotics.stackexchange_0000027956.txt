Q:

gz log file won't run

Hi,
I am trying to run diagnostics on a Gazebo log file that won't play back using gazebo -p state.log. I get the error:

[FATAL] [1479922107.060392505]: A ROS
node for Gazebo has not been
initialized, unable to load plugin.
Load the Gazebo system plugin
'libgazebo_ros_api_plugin.so' in the
gazebo_ros package) [Err]
[Plugin.hh:165] Failed to load plugin
libgazebo_ros_gpu_laser.so:
libGpuRayPlugin.so: cannot open shared
object file: No such file or directory

Running dpkg -S libgazebo_ros_gpu_laser.so gives me:

ros-indigo-gazebo7-plugins: /opt/ros/indigo/lib/libgazebo_ros_gpu_laser.so

and  dpkg -S libGpuRayPlugin.so gives me:

gazebo7-plugin-base: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gazebo-7/plugins/libGpuRayPlugin.so

I see that its suggested to run gz log -i -f state.log in order to confirm that the log file is valid. I get:

Log Version:    1.0
Gazebo Version: 7.4.0
Random Seed:    1989963430
Size:           192.607 MB
Encoding:       zlib

It was also suggested that I run the command tail -1 state.log and check to see if that outputs
</gazebo> which it does.
Now I'm out of ideas on what to try next.
System info:
Gazebo 7
ROS Indigo
Ubuntu 14.04
