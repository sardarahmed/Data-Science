Q:

Is there a way the robot go through goal point without stopping?

Hello,
I want to limit the travel path of the robot to some extent.
So, I set goal minutely and published the goals to move_base using SimpleActionServer.
This plan was successful that the robot go through the route I envisioned, but the robot stopped at each goal points.
Is there a way the robot go through goal point without stopping?
I've found that teb_local_plannner has a parameter called free_goal_vel, which seems to be close to what I want.
But I don't want to use teb_local_plannner, because teb_local_plannner seems to retreat frequently.
Now I use base_local_planner.
Thanks in advance.

A:

There isn't a super clean way to do this - but you can approximate this behavior. Have the node that is sending goals to move_base monitor the progress and when you get "close" to your previously sent goal, send the next goal. The new goal will supersede the old one seamlessly. You can determine the robot's position either through TF or by monitoring the feedback topic of the move_base action.

Thank you @fergs.
I will try to implement node the way you taught me.

This kind of logic is implemented in yocs_waypoints_navi package so you can take a look there.
