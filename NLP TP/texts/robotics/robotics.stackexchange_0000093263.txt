Q:

How is world to map coordinate determined?

In autoware world-map is defined in a launch file.
I was curious as to how these coordinates are determined in first place? for instance in demo bag and associated data they are defined as
14771 84757 -39 0 0 0 for static transform.
I am guessing these are UTM coordinates with 0 0 0 for roll pitch and yaw.
In utilities I do see a node defined in map_tf_generator.cpp which finds (negative)average of the map points. Is this used to fill values in launch file?
And isn't the map generated in base_link frame?  or is it generated in some other frame?
Any explanation or pointing of documentation in this regard would be helpful.
Thank you

A:

When you generate a map, each frame of the map is created using the origin of the /base_link frame but the combined PCD map (from ndt_mapping) is broadcast using the /map frame since it is a fixed frame and /base_link is not. The /world frame is assumed to be in MGRS (Japanese Rectangular Plane) coordinates and the origin of the /map frame (in the PCD map) is some offset from the origin of the MGRS plane. That offset is the static /world -> /map transform.

Do you know how can I find out the values to use in the /world -> /map static transform once the pcd is generated?

Hi Josh, I have same question as above. May I know how can I measure the values from world to map? Like 14771 84757 -39 0 0 0 in demo data and 0.0001 0 0 0 0 0 in BorregasAve.
