Q:

Rviz not displaying robot

Hi everyone,
I got rviz up and running now after changing OGRE_RTT_MODE to FBO. PBuffer would not open and Copy would not show any additional displays (such as camera). Currently my turtlebot is not being displayed and my camera is not displaying an image. I am assuming that the rviz doesn't see the turtlebot at all.
WORKSTATION:~$ export OGRE_RTT_MODE=FBO
WORKSTATION:~$ rosrun rviz rviz

Any ideas? Any additional info needed?

Do other "constant" things display, e.g. when you add a Grid or Axes?

A:

It is working now. I had to just keep restarting it until it did. It is currently showing images from the camera and pointclouds. Currently I just need to lower the amount of data it is collecting as it is experiencing some horrible lag. I know I saw some articles about this here so I am going to look around.
