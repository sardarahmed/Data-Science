Q:

RViz segfaults unless a monitor is connected, any way to prevent this?

So I connect to my robot running Ubuntu 10.10, Diamondback via VNC.  Everything is fine except RViz.  It gives no output except for "Segmentation Error" unless a monitor is plugged in by VGA.  Beyond this point I can just unplug the monitor and continue to work over VNC.  But it's fairly frustrating.  Anybody got any suggestion as to how to prevent this?  Thanks in advance for any ideas.

A:

Ubuntu will not initialize X Windows (the windowing/graphics system) if there is not a monitor at boot.  This means that VNC and remote desktop will not start either (nor network manager, which is a pain sometimes).
So, in order to "fool" your computer into thinking that there is a monitor, get a VGA cable, and make a loopback or dummy connector for when you run headless. Connect pins 1 to 6, 2 to 7, and 3 to 8 using 50-200 ohm resistors (tutorials seem to vary, 200 is on the safe side).
Your new "dummy" will show up as a 1024x768 VGA monitor, good to go.  X windows will now start at boot.
DISCLAIMER: I don't claim that this will work, but other people on the internet do.  Try at your own risk.

I did try the vga dummy but I get a max resolution of 640x480, the other option was 320x240. How do I get at least 1024x768 resolution?

This wasn't the case for me - VNC was starting fine, but RViz wasn't.  But thanks for the VGA trick.
