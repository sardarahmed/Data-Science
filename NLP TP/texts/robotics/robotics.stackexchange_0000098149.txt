Q:

Info about interfacing Fanuc R-2000iC/165F with ROS

Hi, I already got the answers through direct contact, but as requested, it is worth to share the answers (thanks @gvdhoorn !)
I wanted to know if a package is already available for the R-2000iC/165F and also R-2000iC/210F, or alternatively build it myself.
For the 165F version, it is now available in fanuc_experimental
The 210F version should have the same Xacro as the 165F version, but needs to have joint limits changed (and inertia if needed). I will PR it as soon as I have tested and confirmed working.
The process needed to build a URDF from scratch:

try to get a SolidWorks model. It will be infinitely more efficient to convert
don't use SolidWorks or any other tool, it's not needed and will complicate the work
if you can get a SolidWorks model, use any SolidWorks viewer and
export the parts of the links to individual STL files (binary STL)
use a mesh editing tool to transform their origins to where the
joint origins are (you can do this using the diagrams showsn in the
'basic specifications' section of any operating manual of your robot
which shows the lengths of joints
use existing support package xacro files as a template (for the structure. If it is a variant, do not create a separate package. Variants of a series/model go into a single robot support package.

Hope this helps others

A:

You may be interested to know that I pushed a new support package for the R-2000iC/165F.
See ros-industrial/fanuc_experimental/fanuc_r2000ic_support.

Edit: ros-industrial/fanuc_experimental#59 may be a nice PR to look at, it adds support for another variant of the R-2000iC: the 270F.

Oh, I only now see you already noticed that.
