Q:

Can anyone give a better understanding of this piece of code?

I have a question regarding the following lines in the node given here :
class ImageConverter
{
  ros::NodeHandle nh_;
  image_transport::ImageTransport it_;

........
.......

public:
 ImageConverter()
    : it_(nh_)
  {
.....
....
}

I know that the constructor is assigning the value of nh_ to it_, but are they not variables of different type? If they are not, how can we know that?

A:

The constructor is not assigning to it_; it's invoking the constructor for it_ and passing nh_ as the argument to that constructor.
In general, the C++ initializer list syntax calls the constructor for each item. (and for scalar types construction is the same as assignment)
