Q:

output_frame on ar_track_alvar

Hello, I would like to test detecting AR Tag with ar_track_alvar launch using IndividualMarkersNoKinect with my IP Camera. Since I published my own image_raw topic and camera_info topic, I have no ideas where to put the output_frame for that ar_track package..
Can you guys help me?
thanks!

A:

The package documentation says

Output frame (string) -- The name of the frame that the published Cartesian locations of the AR tags will be relative to

So you should use the frame of the camera as output frame for alvar.
In my project I use
<arg name="output_frame" value="/camera" />

because my image gets published to
<param name="frame_id" type="string" value="camera" />

(I'm using the uvc_camera package for my cam.)
