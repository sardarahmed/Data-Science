Thank you for the answer, but when I try to have the visualization and I call:
roslaunch schunk_svh_driver    svh_controller.launch    standalone:=true gui:=true

a window is opened but there isn't the image of schunk hand and there is "Global Status: Error".

you dont read much, or?
RVIZ shows nothing like the screenshot when i load it
You need to configure it yourself to show the robot model and maybe the TF tree or use the provided config file at "etc/urdf.rviz"

Sorry, but it's not clear to me..Must I write a launch file?

A:

Ok, I solved my problem. It is necessary to changes parameters in "displays" of rivz. In particular in my case the problem war the value assumed by "fixed frame": it is necessary to copy the right values of parameters by file at "etc/urdf.rviz"
