Q:

What is the difference between multi-link flexible manipulators and continuum robots?

I read the review[1] on flexible manipulators, the modeling method of multi-link(even if single-link) flexible manipulators seems very different from the continuum robots like OctArm(multi-section), hyper-redundant manipulator and etc which based on the backbone curve or constant curvature model.

A:

Continuum robots do not have rigid elements while multi-link flexible manipulators use "traditional" rigid links between flexible joints. One long continuous flexible material vs. a series of short flexible material segments interconnected with rigid material.
