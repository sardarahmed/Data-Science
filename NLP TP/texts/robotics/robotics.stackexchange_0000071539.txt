Q:

User level in robridge

Hello, I would like to know how to assigned authorization to None-ROS client, like a browser, which is connected through rosbridge.
If I am right, I can realize it by using the 'level' field in rosbridge.
(Otherwise what is it used for?)
I read the protocol document, but I couldn't get the answer.
Isn't it implemented?

A:

By default there is no authentication enabled in rosbridge so any browser can connect. You can enable only authorized clients to connect by using rosauth (see GitHub for source code and this paper for details). The current implementation only checks for authentication, not authorization (i.e., different user levels). Although a field is passed along indicating the user lever specified from the client. This could be extended of course.
