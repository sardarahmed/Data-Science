Q:

ROS support for iRobot Create 2?

Hi, I just got an iRobot Create 2, see the link http://www.irobot.com/About-iRobot/STEM/Create-2.aspx
I tried to use ROS on it; soon, I find it is not that straightforward. Here are what I did so far. I installed ROS Indigo on a virtual machine with Ubuntu 14.04. Then, I looked for the package related to this iRobot Create 2 on the ROS.org, this is what I found http://www.ros.org/browse/search.php?distro=indigo&q=iRobot
Then, I installed the create_driver in my Indigo ROS. I think this driver is for iRobot Create not iRobot Create 2. Here, I want to ask for help. Does anyone here have some experience on how to make iRobot Create 2 move via ROS Indigo? Thanks! If you are interested or also stuck as me, we may team up to figure this out.

Hi,
we have a working ros indigo node for the Create2.
https://github.com/MirkoFerrati/irobotcreate2ros
You will also find a joystick demo that allows you to move the robot via teleoperation.
We are still missing some features, but you should be able to move, use the LCD screen and read sensors and odometry out of the box!
Bye,
Mirko

Miko, I see that your source code have  directory called gazebo
What do you use gazebo for?

In the package we also provide a urdf model of the irobotcreate, inside the folders model and gazebo you can find the xacro files, while in the iRobot folder you can find the urdf.
