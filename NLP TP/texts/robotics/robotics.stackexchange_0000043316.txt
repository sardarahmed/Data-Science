Q:

Error opening file: mylaserdata.bag

Hi all,
I just use the Hokuyo laser range-finder to try to make my own map following 2.2 of this website (http://www.ros.org/wiki/slam_gmapping/Tutorials/MappingFromLoggedData#record). However, when I typed rosbag play mylaserdata.bag, it failed!!!! And the terminal displays:
[FATAL] [1345180506.412656994]: Error opening file: mylaserdata.bag

How can I deal with it? Any help is appreciated!

Sorry if this is too obvious, but is the file mylaserdata.bag located on the same folder where you are executing "rosbag play mylaserdata.bag"? if it is not then you should provide the path to the bag file when executing rosbag play

In GUI, do you see the file name as mylaserdata.bag.active?

A:

I tried to reproduce the error and for me this only occurs when the file doesn't exist.
Please navigate to the folder where the bag-file lies. e.g:
cd /path/to/file

(I don't know where this is in ur case.)
And make sure, you have read access there!
then use:
rosbag play mylaserdata.bag 

Maybe ther is also a typo. (Check the name you used when recording the file)
