Q:

Robot moves forward only

Hi everyone,
Robot goes into narrow place but it can't go back to first position. It is trying to escape with moving  a bit backward (then forward) infinitely at corridor's end. How can I make it escape all the way backwards?  My Local Planner : base_local_planner/TrajectoryPlannerROS
Gmapping's Hokuyo Laser is in the front of robot. And There is a small rplidar on the robot's rear for avoiding obstacles:
obstacle_layer:
     observation_sources: rplidar_back_scan scan
     rplidar_back_scan: {data_type: LaserScan, sensor_frame: /base_lidar_back_link, clearing: true, marking: true, topic: /rplidar_back_scan}
     scan: {data_type: LaserScan, sensor_frame: /base_laser_link, clearing: true, marking: true, topic: /scan}

Here is Rviz screenshot:

Thank you.
EDIT1: Am I need to merge lasers? (And how to merge?) move_base updating costmap with all laser's scans but Gmapping uses only front laser.
EDIT2: I've set escape_vel to 0.0. Now robot just stopping at the corridor's end.

Maybe you can try to modify the escape_reset_theta parameter.

Thank you. But escape_reset_theta and escape_reset_dist parameters aren't useful. Now it is 0.01. If I set this to 1.0, robot tries escape one meter for every obstacle.

And with the oscillation_reset_dist  parameter?

I've tried before, It doesn't make sense too. :/

A:

I have found solution. From David Lu's this answer: how to remove forward bias in move_base
I've changed local planner to dwa_local_planner/DWAPlannerROS and setted min_vel_x to negative value. Now robot goes backward succesfully.
