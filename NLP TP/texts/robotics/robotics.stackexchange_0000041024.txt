Q:

Pointcloud to LaserScan

Hello all,
I am trying to use the pointcloud_to_laserscan node. I am publishing a pointcloud2 type file to the topic "cloud_pcl" and to fram "laser". How do I set up the roslaunch file? I've never done this before...
Thanks,
-Hunter A.
Launch File:
<launch>
<!-- Fake Laser -->
    <node pkg="nodelet" type="nodelet" name="kinect_laser" args="load pointcloud_to_laserscan/      CloudToScan openni_manager" respawn="true">
    
        <param name="output_frame_id" value="/camera_depth_frame"/>
        <!-- heights are in the (optical?) frame of the kinect -->
        <param name="min_height" value="-0.15"/>
        <param name="max_height" value="0.15"/>
        <remap from="cloud" to="/cloud_pcl"/>
    </node>
</launch>

A:

Have a look at the turtlebot_bringup launch file to see how it's done for the Turtlebot.

I added the launch file I am using. The cloud is being published to "/cloud_pcl". What do I need to adjust to make this thing work?

I could also use a SLAM for pointclouds. Does one exist?
