Q:

Subscribe from C++ external file

Hi!,
I am a new user of Gazebo and maybe this is a trivial question but I was trying to subscribe a topic from a c++ file, so I basically followed the custom messages tutorial. If I have a plugin and want to subscribe a topic the line that I need is:
subJointStates = nodeController->Subscribe("~/robot/JointState",&UpdateJointState,this);

When I tried to subscribe from the c++ file, I can't use "this", since I don't have a class, I have tried replacing "this" with a boolean value,  because the declaration of Subscribe wants a boolean.
I tried both of them
subJointStates = nodeController->Subscribe("~/robot/JointState",&UpdateJointState,true);
subJointStates = nodeController->Subscribe("~/robot/JointState",&UpdateJointState,false);

But, looks like it's not working, should I try a different way to subscribe from a C++ External File?
Thank you,
Victor

A:

My mistake!!, sorry, I realized that "~/robot/JointState" calls
`gazebo/<node_parent_name>/robot/JointState`

However, I was in another node, so "~/robot/JointState" was pointing to:
`gazebo/<another_node_name>/robot/JointState`

Just in case, if some beginner as me gets confused by a simple error.
