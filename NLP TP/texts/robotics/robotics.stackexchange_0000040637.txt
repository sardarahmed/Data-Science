Q:

Problem Building ROS on Debian

Hi All,
Just got a Raspberry Pi and building ROS on it (Yes is takes an age...but works) any way I get the following error (So close yet so far):
[ 91%] Building CXX object ros_tutorials/turtlesim/CMakeFiles/turtlesim_node.dir/src/turtle.cpp.o
/root/ros-underlay/ros_tutorials/turtlesim/src/turtle.cpp: In member function âbool turtlesim::Turtle::update(double, QPainter&, const QImage&, qreal, qreal)â:

/root/ros-underlay/ros_tutorials/turtlesim/src/turtle.cpp:163: error: no matching function for call to âmax(qreal, double)â

Fixed it - added static_cast() around the offending types...
