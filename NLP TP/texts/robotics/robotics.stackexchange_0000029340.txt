Q:

Dependency issue while installing gazebo packages

Hello,
I am trying to install gazebo to Ubuntu 20.04 as part of pixhawk4 development setup. I ran the ubuntu.sh script provided in the standard installation procedure.
I get the following error and my installation stops due to dependencies issue of libignition-transport8-dev library. Can anyone help me how to resolve this issue.
Error on terminal

Preparing to unpack .../205-libignition-transport8-log-dev_8.4.0-2~focal_amd64.deb ...
Unpacking libignition-transport8-log-dev:amd64 (8.4.0-2~focal)

Thanks,

I am seeing the same issue since the 8.4.0 release a couple of days ago.  Identical error:
dpkg: error processing archive /tmp/apt-dpkg-install-G02N6D/349-libignition-transport8-log-dev_8.4.0-2~focal_amd64.deb (--unpack):   
trying to overwrite '/usr/include/ignition/transport8/gz/transport/log.hh', which is also in package libignition-transport8-core-dev:amd64 8.4.0-2~focal

Could it be a bug? Do we need to report it somewhere else?

A:

Looks like someone reported as a bug: https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-transport/issues/371
