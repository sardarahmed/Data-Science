"black" or "blank"? One is a colour, the other describes something that is empty / clean.
I don't see a black window in your screenshot.

See whether #q251876 helps.

Same problem. When I try opening controller manager crashes with the following error:
File "/opt/ros/melodic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rqt_controller_manager/controller_manager.py", line 386, in data
return self._icons[ctrl.state]
KeyError: 'initialized'

A:

Try adding a plugin.
