                        > lsd_slam_core
                        > lsd_slam_viewer
                   > sandbox

I don't create LSD_room.bag. So I don't know that what it provides. Shouldn't I change image_raw and camera_info? Should I use this command directly?

Ok. It runs now.

A:

Run the commands exactly as listed; the supplied arguments should be correct for the bag file that they provide.

I don't view color-depth map and point cloud. I can view only a red shape on viewer window.
