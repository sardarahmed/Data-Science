A:

Short answer: No
Long answer: Depends on the respective package, as well as what you mean by "learn everything".
The wiki is a community effort and thus the respective packages wiki pages are more or less up-to-date.
To really learn ROS, you definitely need to program ROS nodes, and you need to understand the theory behind the higher level functionalities (navigation, manipulation, object recognition) from a more scientific point of view to really know how to use it.
