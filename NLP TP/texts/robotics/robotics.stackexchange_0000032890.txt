Can you give an example what you mean with "more than 2 responses". A service consists of 1 request and 1 response per srv file.

A:

Posting your actual .srv file would help, but I think you just have a bit of terminology issues. If you have two lines in your response section of the service definition, you would have two fields in the response message. For instance, if servicename.srv is:
int8 someRequestStuff
---
int8 firstThingToReturn
int8 secondThingToReturn

In this case, you could:
resp = servicenameResponse()
resp.firstThingToReturn = 1
resp.secondThingToReturn = 2
return resp
