Can you please be more specific ... post the errors, what is not compiling and are you using homebrew or macports?

@Kevin, The install just cannot find the Boost Library every time its called in the installion of the ROS core libraries.. I am using Homebrew

A:

There are many issues with OSX and fuerte right now. Not everything compiles. Try editing CMakeLists.txt and add the directive to include and link the boost libraries.
