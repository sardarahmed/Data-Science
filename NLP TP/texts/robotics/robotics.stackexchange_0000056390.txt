Q:

Network Setup Problem

Hello everyone,
I want to setup a connection between my robot and my laptop. I had done it successfully like a thousand times before but this time something went wrong and now, I am unable to locate the problem. Here are the details:
This is the error message:

Unable to contact my own server at
[http://192.168.10.200:59534/]. This
usually means that the network is not
configured properly.
A common cause is that the machine
cannot ping itself.  Please check for
errors by running:
    ping 192.168.10.200

For more tips, please see
http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/NetworkSetup

IPs of the machines:

IP of the robot: 192.168.10.200

My IP:           192.168.10.199

On my laptop, exports are as follows:

export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.10.200:11311

export ROS_IP=192.168.10.200

Every ping combination works and also netcat tests are successful.
Furthermore, when I start both machines with this configurations and start roscore on my robot, I am able to see the topics on my laptop by typing
rostopic list

This means that the robot and my laptop can indeed communicate. However, when I try to run a node from the laptop I got the error message given above.
I performed an exhaustive search on almost all the combinations of ROS_xxx environment variables (which are related with network setup) and /etc/hosts file entries on both machines with no luck.
Hope someone guides me through these complicated configurations.
Thanks in advance.

A:

ROS_IP should be the IP address of the machine that it's set on, not the IP of the master.
Thus, on your laptop ROS_IP should be set to 192.168.0.199
