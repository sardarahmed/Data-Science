Q:

Including entire services directory

I have a srv directory that has all the services I have created. In my main node I am including each individual .hpp manually. Is there a way to include all the .hpp files in one include statement, or do I need to do it for each individual service I created?

A:

No, C++ does not allow that.
However, you may create a file named my_services.hpp with all the includes.
#pragma once

#include "srv_pkg/srv/service_1"
#include "srv_pkg/srv/service_2"
#include "srv_pkg/srv/service_3"
#include "srv_pkg/srv/service_4"

Then in all the places where you need to use the services you can just use #include "my_services.hpp".
An alternative would be to use a script to automatically add all the include directives to your files, but I really think that's a bad and error-prone solution.
