Q:

colcon test failed in python package

i want do create some tests for my ROS packages. So i started with an example package to begin.
I've created a python package with following command:
ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python --maintainer-name "test user" --maintainer-email test@user.com --license "Apache License 2.0" --description "This is a simple test example" test_package

then I build the package with colcon:
colcon build --packages-select test_package && source install/setup.zsh

I startet the test cases over the colcon test command for my package with:
colcon test --packages-select test_package

As output i get:
Starting >>> test_package
--- stderr: test_package                   

=============================== warnings summary ===============================
/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pydocstyle/config.py:6
  Warning: Using or importing the ABCs from 'collections' instead of from 'collections.abc' is deprecated since Python 3.3, and in 3.9 it will stop working

-- Docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/warnings.html
---
Finished <<< test_package [1.07s]

Summary: 1 package finished [1.28s]
  1 package had stderr output: test_package

Why are the standard test fails? Did i do something wrong?
I thought it would still work for a few weeks without any warnings
I'm working on Foxy and Ubuntu 20.04

A:

The test invocation did not fail. There are no test failures. You can check the results using colcon test-result --all.
What you are seeing is a Python warning coming from the pydocstyle package. The Debian package provided by Ubuntu (https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/pydocstyle) version 2.1.1-1 doesn't contain newer fixes from upstream.
You could install a newer version via pip install --upgrade pydocstyle but that comes with the downside that the pip-installed version won't be updated automatically (by apt) and will overlay potential newer Debian packages released in the future.

Thanks for your answer.
is there already a tutorial or example package that gives me some overview?
