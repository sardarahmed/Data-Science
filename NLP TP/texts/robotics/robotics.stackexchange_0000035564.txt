Q:

How can navigation be aborted even if goal is not reached?

Hi,
how can I cancel navigation with move_base and stop the robot by sending a message or a service call even if the goal sent to move_base is not reached yet?
Regards,
Sabrina

Or from the command line,
$ rostopic pub move_base/cancel actionlib_msgs/GoalID '{}'
