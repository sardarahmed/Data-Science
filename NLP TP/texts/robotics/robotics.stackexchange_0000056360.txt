Q:

Simulating Turtlebot with Gazebo

Hello all,
I'm interested in programming Turtlebot in gazebo environment. I've finished the basic stuff on its tutorial page however I'm interested in doing more advanced stuff.
For example, I want to get data from either its virtual Kinect or a real one and then program it with C++ to function it as an obstacle avoiding robot.
Can someone point me in the right direction ?
Thanks.

You'll need to go through the tutorials for gazebo and navigation to bring those capabilities together.
You'll want a more complicated world (from gazebo tutorials) and navigation (from http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_navigation
