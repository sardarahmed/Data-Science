Q:

Point Cloud point to map coordinates

Can someone please explain how can I transform a point (from a point cloud) to coordinate space of the map (which is built using gmapping)?
I've read the TF tutorials (http://ros.org/wiki/tf, http://ros.org/wiki/tf/Tutorials) but I still don't understand them well.

A:

The methods to transform points (and various other types) are members of the TransformListener class (C++, Python). transformPoint is the method you're looking for.

Should I use base_link as frame id to make a correct transform?

That depends what you're trying to accomplish. If you want the point to be in the /map frame, then you should transform into map.

transformPoint() works for geometry_msgs/PointStamped. I suspect @ZeroCool is interested in sensor_msgs/PointCloud2.
