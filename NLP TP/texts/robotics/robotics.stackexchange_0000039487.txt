Q:

Ecto with basic project

Hello !
I use ecto with ubuntu 11.10  and fuerte.
I am a novice with ECTO. T tried to use the following tutorials:
http://ecto.willowgarage.com/releases/amoeba-beta4/ecto/using_ecto/client_usage.html and I have the follow error message:

Unknown CMake command

"ecto_python_env_gen".

-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

I think it's because the wrong use of the CMakeLists.txt but I don't know why.

A:

Not sure whether you are using the debs or are compiling from source. In any case ecto_python_env_gen got removed from ecto so you should not face that anymore :)
If you find any other bug, please file a bug report on https://github.com/plasmodic/ecto
