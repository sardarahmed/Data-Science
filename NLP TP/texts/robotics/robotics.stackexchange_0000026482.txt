Q:

how to? move to a postion

hello all
I have successfully implement the move_base package onto the gazebo. My goal is to move the robot to a specify position in x,y,z coordinate without too much worrying about avoiding the ostacles. Any ideas in which package I could use?

You could either give a command through the terminal using rosservice call /gazebo setmodelstate pose, or you could write a code using this service and run it.

What do you mean by "successfully implement the move_base package onto the gazebo"?
If you are using ROS, you can create a map of the environment for navigation purposes.
