Q:

Local Planner Creation

Hi,
I'd like to create a local planner which implements the vfh algorithm and substitute it in the navigation stack.
Any suggestion from where I can start or about previous work about it.
I saw that I should use the interface BaseLocalPlanner of nav_core.
But how can i substitute it when it is finished?
I can't figure out wher to specify which local planner I want to use.
Thank you in advance.

A:

You can start by taking a look at the CarrotPlanner local planner, it is one of the most simple and you can build from there.
To specify a planner different from the default ones, you can add one of these lines to a launch file, where you launch the move_base node.
  ## alternative global planners ##
  <!-- <param name="base_global_planner" value="goal_passer/GoalPasser"/> -->
  <!-- <param name="base_global_planner" value="carrot_planner/CarrotPlanner"/> -->
  <!-- <param name="base_global_planner" value="SBPLLatticePlanner"/>-->

  ## alternative local planners ##
  <!-- <param name="base_local_planner" value="pose_follower/PoseFollower"/> -->
  <!-- <param name="base_local_planner" value="dwa_local_planner/DWAPlannerROS"/> -->
  <!-- <param name="base_local_planner" value="eband_local_planner/EBandPlannerROS"/> -->

For example:
<node pkg="move_base" type="move_base" respawn="false" name="move_base" output="screen">
  <param name="base_global_planner" value="goal_passer/GoalPasser"/>
  <param name="controller_frequency" value="10.0" />
</node>

Thank you for your suggestion, it is really helpful. But isn't the carrot planner a global planner?
Comment by Procópio on 2013-04-21:
Indeed.  Sorry, in that case you can begin with the PoseFollower and also take a look into the other local planners to have an idea on how to build your own.

@Procópio Silveira Stein I need to be able to navigate in an environment with moving people and avoid them do you have any idea how to accomplish it? Thanks
