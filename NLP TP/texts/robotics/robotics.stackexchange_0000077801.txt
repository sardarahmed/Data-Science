A:

Just follow the same steps as creating a new layer in costmaps. Instead of sample_layers.h and sample_layers.cpp copy the code from rotate recovery because It adheres to the nav_core::RecoveryBehavior interface found in the nav_core package.
Now configure the Cmakelists.txt and package.xml file.
create a recovery_plugin.xml file and add it to the package.xml file under  tags.
