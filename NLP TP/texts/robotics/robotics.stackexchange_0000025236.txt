Q:

Roslaunching URDF cameras

Currently I'm using fuerte on 12.04 ubuntu. I have been using cameras (with gazebo_ros_camera plugin) successfully. However for it to work, I had to modify the parser_deprecated.cc file :
from
  _sdf->GetAttribute("type")->SetFromString("depth")

to
 _sdf->GetAttribute("type")->SetFromString("camera")

Apparently parser_deprecated.cc only supports depth camera. My question is am I missing some other way to successfully use cameras (URDFs) without modifying parser_deprecated.cc ? Is there away to actually get the system to use parser.cc (instead of parser_deprecated)? Does depth camera also provide electro optical data as well as depth data?

A:

parser_deprecated will be fixed in the next couple days. Thanks for the input.
SDF is the preferred method to specify sensors, models, and other object in a Gazebo world. Files specified in SDF use the parser.cc class. However, ROS has no hooks for SDF.
The depth camera provides RGB and depth data. If more/different information is required, then we should create a new sensor based on a specification.
