Q:

should catkin_make_isolated generate some initial setup.* files without packages in src?

I am trying to write an automated script to setup a catkin isolated workspace chained with a rosbuild workspace (to be used by freshmen students here). Since there are no packages to begin with, no setup files are generated by catkin_make_isolated.
Any thoughts on how this can be achieved?

A:

Currently catkin_make_isolated is not designed to do anything with an empty workspace. You can try to figure out some reasonable default behavior and open a pull request. We will be releasing catkin in a week or so, which would be a nice window for getting a change in.
The other thing you could do is to put catkin in the workspace, that way it isn't empty.
