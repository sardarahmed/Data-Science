I'd argue that only publishers should be latched on topics which use case is indifferent of knowing they are latched. Could you think of some example?

One usecase is rosbridge node which is a subscriber of topic message but also publisher to the web clients. The problem was that one rosbridge client which came late couldn't receive the topic message if two rosbridge clients attempt to subscribe a latch topic.

A:

I'd think comparing the time of ones own (successfull) subscription to the timestamp in the message could serve as a workaround, if the mechanical details are checked. Like that the subscriber initialization probably returns before the subscription at the rosmaster is completed.

This assumes that a message's time stamp is (near) the current time, when it was sent, which isn't necessarily true.

One workaround we found is using rospy api. http://wiki.ros.org/rospy/Overview/Publishers%20and%20Subscribers#Connection_Information.
