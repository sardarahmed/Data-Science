Q:

Couldn't find executable named publish below /home/jcardenasc93/catkin_ws/src/publisher

Hi I'm trying to create a simple publisher program following the tutorial 'A gente introduction to ROS' Jason M. O'Kane. So the problem is that when I try to compile the program rosrun publisher publish I get an  error: Couldn't find executable named publish below. My CMakelist.txt is modified as in the tutorial and I add the excecutable in it:
## Declare a cpp executable
add_executable(publish pubmes.cpp)
## Specify libraries to link a library or executable target against
target_link_libraries(publish ${catkin_LIBRARIES})

I don't think that was bash configuration because in another example I could compile the 'Hello ROS' program without any problems.

Compiling and running are two different things.
rosrun will try to run your program, but you'll have to have compiled it first, which is typically done with catkin_make.
Make sure you have build your workspace first, and have sourced the correct setup.bash, as explained in the book.
