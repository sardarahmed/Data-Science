Q:

usb_cam ros kinetic on raspberry pi 3 B

Hi,
My Raspicam v1 is not working on Raspberry pi B. I tried various methods to start it with command raspistill -v -o img.jpg and also with raspicam_node package of ROS, but still it did not show any success.
I have Logitech camera. So can I use usb_cam package of ROS on Raspberry Pi 3 B.
ROS Version : Kinetic
Raspberry Pi version: Raspberry Pi 3 B
Thanks & Regards,

A:

Is it an official rapi cam or one with interchangeable lens? Did you activate the camera support with raspi-config?

It is an official raspi cam. It does not have interchangeable lens.
And I have activated the camera with raspi-config.
Still I am not able to connect the raspi camera. It shows camera is not connected while capturing the images with command raspistill -v -o img.jpg.

Did you check the orientation of the fpc on both sides. Or maybe your module is damaged. Does the gpu have enough Ram

Hi,
I have no idea that if the camera module is damaged or not because when I connect the  raspi camera module it with Raspberry Pi the light on camera is on.
