Q:

What is first ? Publisher or Subscriber?

Which among the following nodes should be started first? Publisher or Subscriber.
What happens if start subscriber first then publisher?
Note: Subscriber is working as intended (printing the received message) when started after publisher. But it misses receiving initial messages.
And, When the subscriber is started first, It doesnâ€™t work as intended.

What do you mean "it doesn't work as intended" when the subscriber is started first?

A:

In general it should not matter. You can start publishers and subscribers at any time.
However, note that ROS is expecting messages as a constant message stream, e.g., like from a sensor. They are not buffered in some central instance.
This explains why it misses receiving inital messages. It just wasn't there to listen.
Also note that nodes take a short time to start up and connect in the background. If you start a publisher, publish 1 message, and quit. In the very short time that this code runs, in the background your node is talking to the master trying to connect to a subscriber. This won't happen until your node has already quit.
Either wait until the number of subscribers on your publisher is > 0. Or use a service or something that is meant to be used for that.
