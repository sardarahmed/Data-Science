Q:

Problem visualizing Kinect data

I am using ros-fuerte-desktop-full on an Ubuntu 12.04 VM guest on an iMac OS 10.7.4 host. I have 3d acceleration set for the vm in VirtualBox.
I have tried the steps found here and here and neither worked for me.
I also tried suggestions found here, with no luck.
When running openni_launch, I get numerous errors of the form:
Exception AttributeError: AttributeError("'_DummyThread' object has no attribute '_Thread__block'",) in <module 'threading' from '/usr/lib/python2.7/threading.pyc'> ignored

I also get a "service already advertised" error
process[camera_base_link3-21]: started with pid [5040]
[ERROR] [1342713651.658142929]: Tried to advertise a service that is already advertised in this node [/camera/depth_registered/image_rect_raw/compressed/set_parameters]
[ERROR] [1342713651.673904205]: Tried to advertise a service that is already advertised in this node [/camera/depth_registered/image_rect_raw/theora/set_parameters]

and some calibration warning, but I don't think they're the problem
[ WARN] [1342713653.543366768]: Camera calibration file /root/.ros/camera_info/rgb_A00362821517049A.yaml not found.
[ WARN] [1342713653.544051626]: Using default parameters for RGB camera calibration.
[ WARN] [1342713653.544360723]: Camera calibration file /root/.ros/camera_info/depth_A00362821517049A.yaml not found.
[ WARN] [1342713653.544473754]: Using default parameters for IR camera calibration.

However, I do see that the Kinect is found because:
[ INFO] [1342716950.352185341]: Number devices connected: 1
[ INFO] [1342716950.354223440]: 1. device on bus 001:03 is a Xbox NUI Camera (2ae) from Microsoft (45e) with serial id 'A00362821517049A'
[ INFO] [1342716950.356082261]: Searching for device with index = 1
[ INFO] [1342716950.562713795]: Opened 'Xbox NUI Camera' on bus 1:3 with serial number 'A00362821517049A'
[ INFO] [1342716950.686668429]: rgb_frame_id = '/camera_rgb_optical_frame' 
[ INFO] [1342716950.686886788]: depth_frame_id = '/camera_depth_optical_frame' 

After creating my PointCloud2 display in rviz, it shows "Status: Warning" and "Points
Showing [0] points from [0] messages" and "Topic No messages received".
Following instructions to open the data in image_view does not work for me, either.
Help?

A:

I am not aware of the current state, but openni used to not work in virtual machines.

I just found this post, and now I believe you are correct. Apparently it just won't work on VM at the moment. I guess I'll have to try something else.
