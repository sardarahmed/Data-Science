Q:

gazebo wg_world.launch doesn't show world

Hi, I'm running ros fuerte on ubuntu 12.04 in a virtual machine.
I'm trying to run gazebo examples, in this case i want to run this tutorial
"3D Willow Garage Map", but i get this error and an empty world. Somebody knows something about this?

A:

you can try launching a empty world of gazebo and later try to open the world in gazebo from insert models.

Hi, @joseescobar60 I did what you said and i can open the wg world, but I think that this world is imported from share folder in stageros package instead of import it from world folder. I need to open it from there because i have another custom worlds that i need to use.
Comment by Chik on 2013-01-09:
After inserting models to gazebo (e.g. a woman) I can teleop Turtlebot to collide with the inserted model. But strangely, in rviz the robot cannot sense the model. Somehow the inserted model only exists in gazebo but not in rviz. Do you experience this problem?
