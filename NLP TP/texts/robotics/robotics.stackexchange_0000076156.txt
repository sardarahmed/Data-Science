Q:

Creating a 3D map with Velodyne data

Hello,
I am very new to ROS so excuse my simplicity. I have Velodyne Puck point cloud data that I would like to use to create a 3D map. My issue was that I was moving the puck as I collected the data and I have no odometer data. Would I use a ICP program? And if so any recommendations? I saw that Willow Garage has one, I assume that it is a good package.
Thank you so much.
John

Hi did you get any solution for that, I am trying the same with velodyne data. I want to create an 3D point cloud with velodyne data, i also use blam but its speed is slow so i am searching for better option,did you have any suggestion on that??
thank you

Hello Nikka,
Sorry for the late response, I was away for the holidays. I have been trying to use BLAM, I am not getting good results at all. The successive point clouds are not registering properly. I am going to try and adjust the number of iterations that ICP algorithm takes, hope that will help.

Hello Kailegh,
Have you found something that worked better than BLAM! ?

I think Google Cartographer has gotten really impressive results

A:

I saw someone use B(erkeley) L(ocalization) A(nd) M(apping), you can try BLAM.
BLAM! is an open-source software package for LiDAR-based real-time 3D localization and mapping. BLAM! is developed by Erik Nelson from the Berkeley AI Research Laboratory (BAIR).

i ve tried it recently, it works but not too accuaretly, i have had some issus, looop closere works a bit bad in my opinion, maybe works welll in close places, but in open and at a reasonible speed is not the better thing i have tried

Thanks for the input. I have been making some progress. What I need to do at this point is extract the pcap format packets out of the bag file. I am looking around, I will see if I can find a way to do that.

that is the easiest part man, use velodyne driver, roslaunch velodyne_pointcloud VLP16_points.launch pcap:=PCAP_PATH    if you make progress in the 3D map please let me know, I am interesting in testing different methods

Hello Kailegh,
I got sifdetracked but I am back. I have made some progress, I got BLAM! installed (not trivial) and it is working pretty good now. I am trying to select and export a group of points in RVIZ that were created by BLAM! so that is where I am at right now. Have you had any luck?

i tested blam I did not like the results, I got too many erros from it, odometry was not trustful
