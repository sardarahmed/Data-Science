Q:

Kinect v1 VS Kinect v2

From a technical standpoint what are the differences between the Kinect v1 and the Kinect v2 ?
I'm interested both in the hardware equipment and the format of the data.

A:

Kinect 1 is a structured Light sensor, Kinect 2 is a Time of Flight camera. 
Structured Light gives you better performance on edges where a ToF camera smoothes the data due to multipath-measurements.  ToF has less problems with ambient light. 
What is your use case?
