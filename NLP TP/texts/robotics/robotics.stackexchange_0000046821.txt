Q:

camera_pose_calibration not working in fuerte

Hi there,
I would like to extrinsically calibrate a webcam and a asus xtion pro live sensor.
Therefore I would like to use the camera_pose_calibration. Everything is intrinsically calibrated and I get the two images. But the checkerboard detector is not working.
while launchup the following message pops up:
can't locate node [image_cb_detector_action_old] in package [image_cb_detector]

My try to just copy the image_cb_detector_action to image_detector_action_old resultet in a tracked checkerboard but no working calibration.
[capture_exec-14] process has died [pid 9092, exit code 1, cmd /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/camera_pose/camera_pose_calibration/src/camera_pose_calibration/multicam_capture_exec.py panda_cam camera/rgb request_interval:=interval_filtered __name:=capture_exec __log:=/home/pclinux/.ros/log/b9d2f746-5150-11e2-a6a7-b8ac6f40a936/capture_exec-14.log].
log file: /home/pclinux/.ros/log/b9d2f746-5150-11e2-a6a7-b8ac6f40a936/capture_exec-14*.log

Is there another working solution for extrinsic calibration for two sensors? (doesn't need to be ROS) I would appreciate any suggestion.

opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/camera_pose/camera_pose_calibration/src/camera_pose_calibration/multicam_capture_exec.py have you figured out why this occurs?  I've had both of these occur, as well as others: http://answers.ros.org/question/115111/errors-in-camera_pose_calibration-launch-for-3-kinects/

A:

I applied some fixes I found here, although with these fixes I have not been able to get it to work yet. I am not sure if these fixes are still required or not (some of missing tabs were already removed in my version).

I used your repository and it worked without a problem. Did you use a good ir lighting source?

Did you manage this lightning problem ? I always see black on ir image.
