Q:

Producer-consumer problem in ROS

Hello everyone,
I have a newbie problem here. I am trying to implement a ROS Architecture which is similar to a producer-consumer problem. I have one node which is publishing images and a group of nodes that would take the image and do some processing in it. The behaviour that I want to implement is the following: If a consumer node takes one image, I do not want the others to receive that same image. Using the default image_transport publisher, I suppose that all the subscribers will receive the same image at a time. How can I avoid this?
Thank you in advance

A:

I think using a service for this might be an easy solution. The producer node would not publish, but queue images and provide a service consume_image that returns the next image or fails when empty.
Consumer nodes call this service whenever they are ready to process the next image.
