Have you tried with Fuerte? Or are you limited to electric for some other reason?
Comment by tfoote on 2012-05-11:
What is in your CMakeLists.txt?
Comment by David B on 2012-05-12:
I have tried diamondback it's ok!!

I'm not sure what you mean.

A:

You should not name your target executable test as this is a special target for CMake to compile and run unittests. If you have no unittests defined, nothing happens. Rename your binary target and try again. Maybe you have to rename your package as well.
