Q:

rosmatlab- publisher

I am using rosmatlab package for making a bridge between Matlab and Ros. I want to publish some interger data. But I couldnot find any proper Documentation for it.
I am having problem with the syntax of
ros.publisher.publish();
Thanks.

A:

Hi,
you should follow the documentation from mathworks to launch a roscore and create a node in matlab.
Then you can add a publisher to your node by using, in matlab :
publisher = rosmatlab.publisher('your_topic_name', 'std _ msgs/Int32', your_node);
