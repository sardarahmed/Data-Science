Q:

how to run rosjava_tutorial_pubsub?

I might have missed something, but based on the wiki and tutorial of Rosjava, I can not figure out how to run the tutorial code of Rosjava_tutorial_pubsub.
I compiled rosjava with Gradle (earlier have tried to install from Ubuntu repository as well as compiled with Rosmake).

There is no run.py in rosjava_bootstrap, so that I cannot use the command from the tutorial: rosrun rosjava_bootstrap run.py <*****> <****>

Also, Rosrun won't find any executable from rosjava_tutorial_pubsub.

Any idea or link that can help?
Thanks.

A:

The run.py script is no longer used since the switch to Gradle. Instead, rosjava_tutorial_pubsub creates an executable jar using Gradle's Application plugin. See the documentation which describes how to execute the Talker and Listener nodes from the pubsub tutorial:
http://docs.rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/rosjava_core/html/getting_started.html#executing-nodes
Also make sure to follow the documentation on installing and building rosjava_core:
http://docs.rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/rosjava_core/html/installing.html
http://docs.rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/rosjava_core/html/building.html
