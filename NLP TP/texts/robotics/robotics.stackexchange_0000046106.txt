Q:

Bumpers/contact sensors broken in Gazebo (Fuerte)?

Does ANYONE have contact sensors working with Gazebo and Fuerte? If so, how did you get them working? I have sensors defined in the urdf of my model (and all the links have <collision> blocks), and the topics for the sensors are being advertised, but whenever I try to subscribe to the topics, I get a variation on this each clock cycle I'm subscribed to the topic:
Error [ContactSensor.cc:237] Contact Sensor[sensor_name] has no collision[link_name_geom]

At least part of the issue seems to have been fixed (Gazebo bitbucket issue 141), but I don't think the fix has made it to the released version yet. Also, issue 244 might still create problems, and a comment on issue 141 makes it sound like the bumper plugin might have problems as well. (Sorry about the lack of real links.)
