Q:

Angles for quaternion converter

I was referring to an API documentation on Quarternion related stuff. I want to use the last constructor which is written "Constructor from Euler angles". The constructor itself is as below:
btQuaternion::btQuaternion ( const btScalar & yaw,
                             const btScalar & pitch,
                             const btScalar & roll   
                           )  

My question is regarding the angles. Should the angles in the input argument be in degree or radian?
