Q:

unable to use image_view with eletric

Hi all,
I seem to have the same problem as described here
http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.science.robotics.ros.user/14394
I run uvc_cam and then try to view the image but end up with
  rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/image_raw
init done 
opengl support available 

(<unknown>:2222): GLib-GObject-WARNING **: invalid uninstantiatable type `(null)' in cast to `GtkWidget'

(<unknown>:2222): GLib-GObject-WARNING **: instance of invalid non-instantiatable type `(null)'

(<unknown>:2222): GLib-GObject-CRITICAL **: g_signal_connect_data: assertion `G_TYPE_CHECK_INSTANCE (instance)' failed

It works fine in diamondback. Any ideas?
Cheers,
Andreas

Sounds like a bug to me. Maybe in opencv2, perhaps in cv_bridge or image_view.

A:

Hi Andreas,
This does look like a bug. Please open a ticket to track it.
In your ticket include:

What OS and version are you using?
What desktop environment (Gnome/KDE/other?). In particular do you have Qt installed?
Did you install image_pipeline with the Debian packages or from source?
Likewise for OpenCV - did it come from the debs or did you build it yourself?

It looks like your OpenCV is using its new Qt backend for HighGUI, while image_view is wrongly assuming the GTK backend. This is a bug in image_view, but I don't understand why it's showing up - in our debs, OpenCV links against GTK but not Qt.

Hi Patrick, thanks for the hint. I built OpenCV myself because I needed the GPU version of the libraries.  I now built them without Qt and it works. So it's no bug. Cheers
