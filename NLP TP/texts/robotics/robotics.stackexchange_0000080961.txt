Q:

How to install cv_bridge?

Hello everyone!
I am running ros jade on Ubuntu14.04 with opencv3.2. I meet a problem with cv_bridge, as below:
/usr/bin/ld: warning: libopencv_highgui.so.2.4, needed by /opt/ros/jade/lib/libcv_bridge.so, may conflict with libopencv_highgui.so.3.2
So I think I have to recompile the cv_bridge package or vison_opencv package.
I have download the newest vison_opencv package, but I do not know how to use it or install it. So can anyone tell me how to do this?
Thank you!

A:

A most simple one would be installed from the Ubuntu terminal:
sudo apt-get install ros-(ROS version name)-cv-bridge
sudo apt-get install ros-(ROS version name)-vision-opencv
It would automatically download from the Debian and installs the latest version (basically update from the old version if you already have one) in the system.
Otherwise,  visit the official ROS page of that required package and download the zip file. Move the extracted package inside the catkin workspace and install it.
I hope it helps!
