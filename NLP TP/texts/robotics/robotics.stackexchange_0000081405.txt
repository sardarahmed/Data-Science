Q:

Cross compiling ROS Barebones on ARM for QNX

Hello,
I have a toolchain installed for QNX 7 and I followed the instructions here to cross compile it. The environment variables are all set to the QNX libraries which are set by a toolchain. This is on Ubuntu 16.04 for ROS Kinetic barebones install.
When I run this command from my catkin_workspace I get the following error,
-- Using Python nosetests: /usr/bin/nosetests
/opt/qnx/install/target/qnx7/armle-v7/usr/bin/python: 1: /opt/qnx/install/target/qnx7/armle-v7/usr/bin/python: Syntax error: word unexpected (expecting ")")
CMake Error at cmake/safe_execute_process.cmake:11 (message):
  execute_process(/opt/qnx/install/target/qnx7/armle-v7/usr/bin/python
  "/opt/qnx/install/ros_catkin_ws/src/catkin/cmake/parse_package_xml.py"
  "/opt/qnx/install/ros_catkin_ws/src/catkin/cmake/../package.xml"
  "/opt/qnx/install/ros_catkin_ws/build_isolated/catkin/catkin/catkin_generated/version/package.cmake")
  returned error code 2

I need to use only the message publisher/subscriber of ros for my application.
Any inputs or ideas would be hghly appreciated.

A:

Is
opt/qnx/install/target/qnx7/armle-v7/usr/bin/python 

this the path to your python? And if you run the code an your dev(x64) machine then this should show to your local python not the arm python interpreter.
