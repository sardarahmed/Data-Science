Q:

Can I do RGBD-6D-SLAM on an empty room?

As I know RGBD-6D-SLAM uses surf feature to do the job, what if the room I'm going to reconstruct is empty and thus featureless.
Can RGBD-6D-SLAM still able to reconstruct it ?
Thank!

A:

it depends, if something is completely featureless it is not possible to reconstruct it even for a human. I have worked in pretty empty environments and sometimes it is enough with the texture in the floor and walls. Anyway, you won't probably get very good results. I am talking from my experience
