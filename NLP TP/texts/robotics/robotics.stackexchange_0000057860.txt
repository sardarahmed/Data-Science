Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Use of entropy

Hello all!
I am studying slam in a real indoor environment using a Pionner robot and a hokuyo laser. After getting a map i can see if the data association is correct or not but i would like to compare analitically the whole process. Gmapping has a publisher with the entropy over the robot pose. Does anyone do anything with the entropy? IÂ´m trying to study the values of the entropy but it use to be constant.
In case i not use the entropy, is there an easy way to get values of the uncertainty of the position?
Thanks in advance
Regards

A:

It looks like the entropy over the pose is computed in a reasonable way: https://github.com/ros-perception/slam_gmapping/blob/e8a121619fdb744f151a81fae9ab7325a5faa399/gmapping/src/slam_gmapping.cpp#L519
Is it not giving reasonable values? You can try using slam_gmapping from source and adding publishers for different kinds of uncertainty (try mean square error if you don't like entropy).

What you say is true, but I think there is another question: it seems that the entropy calculated in Gmapping has not been used? It really confused me.

@jbinney Could you please explain what is meant by "adding publishers for different kinds of uncertainty (try mean square error if you don't like entropy)"? So instead of the line entropy += it->weight/weight_total * log(it->weight/weight_total); we compute the mean square error of the weights?
