Q:

I want to implement hector SLAM on the raspberry Pi 2

Hi everyone I am very new to robotics and embedded systems. My goal is to build a small indoor ground robot that uses a Neato XV - 11 Lidar to build a map of its surroundings.  I am using a Raspberry Pi 2 for interfacing the robot with the Lidar.
I am completely lost on where to start. I was able to find the following package for hector SLAM http://wiki.ros.org/hector_slam but I'm not too sure where to go from there. How do I install ROS on the Raspberry Pi 2? What version of ROS should I use and why? How do I send information from the Pi to my laptop? Do I need to install ROS on my laptop as well?
I just need some advice on how to start and where to look.
Thank you

Hi ,
I used raspberry pi 2 to make a robot with SLAM before.
Due to "rviz segmentation fault" error, I change my platform to tegra TK1.
But some kindness people have told me how to solve it(and I am still not solve it now).
so I can only share with you my notes.
Demo on youtube
My blog (with step of how to use hector slam)
Blog 2
And your first step should be how to install ROS on Raspberry Pi 2.
Hope that can help you :))
