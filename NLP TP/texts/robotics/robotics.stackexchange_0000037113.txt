Q:

Relative pose between two tf::Transforms

Hello,
how can I get the relative pose between two tf::Transforms? I know that tf::TransformListener can do this if you call lookupTransform with identical target- and source-frame, but with different target- and source-times, but how can I achieve this without any messages if I only have two tf::Transforms (each representing a different point in time) of an odometry-source for example?
Thanks in advance!

A:

Basically invert one and multiply the other.
tf1.inverseTimes(tf2) should do that.

Is it tf1 wrt tf2 or tf2 wrt tf1?
