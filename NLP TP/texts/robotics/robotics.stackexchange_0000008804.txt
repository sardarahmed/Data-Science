Q:

See CC3D actual configuration

I just received my first hobby-grade quadcopter.
It's the Eachine racer 250 and comes preassembled with transmitter and receiver also included.
It comes with some kind of CC3D flight board, most people say it's not the original one, but can be configured with the same software.
It is actually flying very well right out of the box so I'm not sure if I want to touch the FC config.
I'm mostly interested in learning to fly in manual/acro mode, the transmitter seems to have a switch with 3 flight modes, first 2 looks like low/high rates in self-level mode, I expect the third to be the acro mode, but I'm not sure right now, I couldn't test it because of the weather, it could be a third higher rate?.
So, is there any way I can look at the actual FC config without changing anything? what software do I need? and are the flight modes actually set on the FC or transmitter so I could be able to see and edit them? 

A:

Supposedly the OpenPilot Ground Control Station (GCS) will allow you to download your existing configuration.  In general, you probably want to search for something that will allow you to "back up CC3D configuration" from the UAV.
