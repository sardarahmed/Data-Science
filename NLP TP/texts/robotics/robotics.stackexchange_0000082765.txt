Q:

unable to find gui node in gazebo ros package

Hello, I am trying to execute drone simulator in gazebo7/ros-kinetic
I've installed 'tum_simulator' from https://github.com/angelsantamaria/tum_simulator
Next, I tried to test the following launch file
<launch>
  <param name='/use_sim_time' value='true' />
  <node name='empty_world_sever' pkg='gazebo_ros' type='gazebo' args="$(find cvg_sim_gazebo)/worlds/emtpy.world" respawn='false'  output='screen'>
  </node>
  <node name='gazebo_gui' pkg='gazebo' type='gui' respawn='false' output='screen'/>
</launch>

When I execute the above launch file
then, it says 'cannot launch node of type gazebo/gazebo'
I heard there is some change between ros-kinetic, gazebo 7 and the prior version
Thus I found I need to change pkg argument from gazebo to gazebo_ros
Now, it says 'cannot launch node of type [gazebo_ros/gui]: can't locate node [gui] in package [gazebo_ros]
and I can't find what should I do to execute such launch file
plz, tell me what should I do?

A:

Hello,
If you installed the tum_simulator, you should have launch files examples in "tum_simulator/cvg_sim_gazebo/launch".
You can launch them with roslaunch  :
roslaunch cvg_sim_gazebo ardrone_testworld.launch

In this version the gui client and server are both launch by default. If you only want the server then you neep to add the option <arg name="gui" value="false"/> in the launch file :
<?xml version="1.0"?>y_no_gui.launch  (press RETURN)
<launch>
  <!-- We resume the logic in empty_world.launch, changing only the name of the world to be launched -->
  <include file="$(find gazebo_ros)/launch/empty_world.launch">
      <arg name="world_name" value="$(find cvg_sim_gazebo)/worlds/empty_sky_AR.world"/>
      <arg name="gui" value="false"/>
  </include>

  <!-- Spawn simulated quadrotor uav -->
  <include file="$(find cvg_sim_gazebo)/launch/spawn_quadrotor.launch" >
    <arg name="model" value="$(find cvg_sim_gazebo)/urdf/quadrotor_sensors.urdf.xacro"/> 
  </include>
</launch>

You may also want to look at that answer.
