Q:

Problem building the ROS android tutorials

So I am trying to build android_tutorial_pubsub and when it gets to actually building this, or any of the tutorials, It seems to search the ros dependencies for "None".  Has anyone else come across this issue and found a solution>
I am rather out of ideas.  I have included the full output here:
rosrun rosjava_bootstrap make.py android_tutorial_pubsub
Buildfile: /home/local/RESQUARED/kyle.visner/hg/android_tutorial_pubsub/dependencies.xml
[artifact:dependencies] There were no dependencies specified
[artifact:dependencies] There were no dependencies specified

get-dependencies:

Any help would be appreciated.
