Q:

import hector quadrotor in a different gazebo environment

Hii,
I want to import hector quadrotor in a different gazebo environment. My question is how can this be done? Also, what should be the format of the environment's CAD model. Else, are there different gazebo environments to choose from?
Please help

Could you clarify what you mean with "gazebo environments"? I first thought you meant "worlds" (ie: simulation models of the world), but then I thought you might be asking about different simulators (ie: alternatives for Gazebo, like V-REP and others).

Yes. I meant worlds

A:

I have figured out the way of changing the gazebo environment (world) for hector quadrotor. The hector_quadrotor_tutorials itself comes with variety of gazebo worlds. These can be found in src/hector_gazebo/hector_gazebo_worlds/launch.
