Q:

Quadrotor navigation in gazebo

I am a beginner user of gazebo, and am confused how to navigate my quadrotor. I have used hector_quadrotor package.
I tried using rosrun pr2_teleop teleop_pr2_keyboard (after installing  pr2_teleop package), but it still gives error "Pr2_teleop" package not found. Is there some other easier way to navigate/control the quadrotor model?

A:

Try running
rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py

(To install : sudo apt-get install ros-$YOURDISTRO$-teleop-twist-keyboard)
It should work now. It will give additional yaw control. Or else, You can create a separate node which publishes /cmd_vel topic so that the quad can use to navigate.
If you can't create a node, publish the velocity using "rostopic pub" utility
rostopic pub -1 /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist -- '[0.0, 0.0, 0.3]' '[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]'

This will give linear vertical velocity.
To check: Use rqt_plot. Make sure that your initiated node publishes the /cmd_Vel topic to Gazebo model.
