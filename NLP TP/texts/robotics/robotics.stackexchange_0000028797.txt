Q:

How to joint together many boxes on model editor

I'm using Gazebo 9.9.0.
I have modeled this on model editor:

Is there any way to joint together those  12 boxes to have only one box?

A:

You can make a model containing all of the boxes.
Inside Gazebo, you would place one box, then right click on it and choose 'Edit model'. Then shape and position the box and add the rest of the boxes. Once you are satisfied with the model, press Ctrl+S or choose 'save' from the upper menu. Your model will be saved into your models folder and you will be able to insert it into your worlds any time from the 'Insert' tab.

If your boxes fly away from each other, you can either put 'fixed' joint between the boxes inside the model editor, or set them static.

If you set the boxes to 'static' they won't move even if they are not all part of the same model.
