Q:

embedded development with tiva-c

Hello,
I am using tiva-c board, and using its hardware quadrature encoder and publishing odometry from the tiva-c. My question is where to go from here? If we want do develop embedded ros, are we confined to arduino and tiva-c boards or are there better and more advanced alternatives?

A:

rosserial is designed to connect an embedded board to ROS on a full-featured Linux computer. If you're not using a larger computer and Linux, then you don't need to be limited by rosserial.
