A:

Just build you app using whatever pieces of Qt you need then tie to ROS as follows.
Add the find_package(Qt COMPONENTS ... REQUIRED) in your CMakeLists.txt file and  the appropriate lines for moc and resource files as needed. For example;
FIND_PACKAGE(Qt4 REQUIRED)
INCLUDE(${QT_USE_FILE})

file(GLOB QT_FORMS RELATIVE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR} *.ui)
file(GLOB QT_RESOURCES RELATIVE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR} *.qrc)
file(GLOB_RECURSE QT_MOC RELATIVE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR} FOLLOW_SYMLINKS *.h)

QT4_ADD_RESOURCES(QT_RESOURCES_CPP ${QT_RESOURCES})
QT4_WRAP_CPP(QT_MOC_HPP ${QT_MOC})
QT4_WRAP_UI(QT_FORMS_HPP ${QT_FORMS})

And link as needed
add_executable([some_binary] ${QT_SOURCES} ${QT_RESOURCES_CPP} ${QT_FORMS_HPP} ${QT_MOC_HPP})

target_link_libraries([some_binary] ${QT_QTCORE_LIBRARY} ... ${QT_QTGUI_LIBRARY} ${catkin_LIBRARIES} )
