Q:

ros2_control manage hardware_interface::return_type::ERROR

Hey guys,
I am currently working with the foxy branch of ros2_control and trying to figure out how is the error management done by the controller_manager ?  If I understood correctly, when hardware fails the hardware_manager should return  hardware_interface::return_type::ERROR but the controller_manager keeps running. What is the best way to deal with this and either restart the hardware or the controllers ?
Thanks,

A:

Hi,
there is not and will not be any error management done by controller_manager for foxy. We integrated error management into rolling and we had to do many API and ABI breaks to do so. Therefore, it is not possible to back port this features to foxy.
