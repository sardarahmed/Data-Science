Q:

Using real-world Kinect with Gazebo

I'm new to the ROS community.  I have a general question:   Is it possible to use a data from a real-world kinect to guide a simulated robot (e.g. PR2) in Gazebo?  If so, how hard will it be to do this?
My hope is that the interface will be a drop in change for a real robot (someday) and that I can test a gesture-based control algorithm against a simulated robot.
Thanks in advance for any feedback.

A:

I think there shouldn't be a problem with that; the real-world Kinect just publishes its data on a normal ROS topic, Gazebo publishes and subscribes also to normal topics, and your node can use both.
There is only one potential snag: gazebo uses simulated time, while the Kinect will probably use wall time. You'll have to be careful about where and how you use timestamps.
