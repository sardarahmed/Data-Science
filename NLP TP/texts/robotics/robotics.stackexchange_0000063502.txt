Q:

What are the units for the Husky turn rate? [husky_plugin.cpp]

I have modified the husky_plugin.cpp code such that it publishes its velocities to odom.twist.twist, for example:
odom.twist.twist.angular.x = odom_vel_[2];
When I command max turn rate, the odom topic reads 2.5, this is verified by the common.launch file for the husky:
param name="capped_turn_rate" value="2.5"
However, when I measure the turn rate of the vehicle in Gazebo at full speed, this "2.5" maps to roughly 10 rotations per every ~36-37 seconds. My guess was it is in units of degrees per update (40 Hz), however this does not change with  update rate. What unit is this angular velocity cap in?

A:

This is almost certainly radians per second. (2.5 radians per second is about 23 RPM)
REP-103 defines metric units and radians as the standard units for ROS.

I agree, however, where does the discrepancy between reported and measured coming from? Gazebo reports that it is running at full speed, in which case I would expect ~14 rotations in the same amount of time.
