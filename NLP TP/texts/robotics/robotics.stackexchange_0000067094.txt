Q:

uv coordinates to world map coordinates

I'm working with turtlebot and I've built and saved a map using gmapping. I'm wondering if there is a funtion that transforms uv coordinates from map picture into world map coordinates. Or if there isn't what would be the simplest way to do so.  Thank you for your anwsers.

A:

I found resolution(which tells you m per pixel- 0.05 in my case) and origin parameters in map.yaml file which can be used for conversion.
