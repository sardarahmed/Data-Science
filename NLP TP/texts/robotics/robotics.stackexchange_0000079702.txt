Q:

Mac Pro install ROS indigo failed in "qt_gui_cpp" error: code requires Qt 4.x

hi all:
I'm trying to install ROS indigo into Mac Pro with macOS Sierra 10.12.3.
I follow this tutorial(http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/OSX/Homebrew/Source), however, it does not looks like such easy for me.
now, I have a trouble about qt4, the error is showing below:
CMake Error at /usr/local/Cellar/cmake/3.7.2/share/cmake/Modules/FindQt4.cmake:1318 (message):
  Found unsuitable Qt version "5.8.0" from /usr/local/opt/qt5/bin/qmake, this
  code requires Qt 4.x
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  src/qt_gui_cpp/CMakeLists.txt:3 (find_package)

-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
See also "/Users/howe/ROS_Howe/build_isolated/qt_gui_cpp/CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log".
<== Failed to process package 'qt_gui_cpp': 
  Command '['/Users/howe/ROS_Howe/install_isolated/env.sh', 'cmake', '/Users/howe/ROS_Howe/src/qt_gui_core/qt_gui_cpp', '-DCATKIN_DEVEL_PREFIX=/Users/howe/ROS_Howe/devel_isolated/qt_gui_cpp', '-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/Users/howe/ROS_Howe/install_isolated', '-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release', '-G', 'Unix Makefiles']' returned non-zero exit status 1

Reproduce this error by running:
==> cd /Users/howe/ROS_Howe/build_isolated/qt_gui_cpp && /Users/howe/ROS_Howe/install_isolated/env.sh cmake /Users/howe/ROS_Howe/src/qt_gui_core/qt_gui_cpp -DCATKIN_DEVEL_PREFIX=/Users/howe/ROS_Howe/devel_isolated/qt_gui_cpp -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/Users/howe/ROS_Howe/install_isolated -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G 'Unix Makefiles'

I checked my qt4, and tried all solutions in rosanswers forum, None of them worked. while, the qt4 info is showing below.

==> Caveats
We agreed to the Qt opensource license for you.
If this is unacceptable you should uninstall.

Qt Designer no longer picks up changes to the QT_PLUGIN_PATH environment
variable as it was tweaked to search for plug-ins provided by formulae in
  /usr/local/lib/qt4/plugins

thus, could anyone help me on this problem?
thank you for reading and thanks advance

A:

while, I figure out how to install qt4
brew tap cartr/qt4
brew tap-pin cartr/qt4
brew install qt

while now the problem is I need to install qt4-no-webkit, when I go through gazebo installation
here is the discussion:
