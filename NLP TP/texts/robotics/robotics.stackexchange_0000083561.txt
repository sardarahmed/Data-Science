Q:

Where is the /catkin_ws/src/ folder

I am following the tutorial here http://gazebosim.org/tutorials/?tut=ros_urdf to clone the file into  /src folder, while I cannot find any src folder. Catkin has already been installed with ROS, so the workspace should be there I guess?

A:

You are supposed to make the workspace yourself first.
See wiki/catkin/Tutorials/Creating a workspace for catkin.
And note: the path is not /catkin_ws, but ~/catkin_ws. The first is an absolute path in the root of your FS, while the second is a sub directory of your home directory.
