Q:

Sensor that will produce a sinusoid phase locked to a high RPM Shaft

Is there a sensor that will produce a sinusoidal signal phase locked to a high RPM (7000 RPM) shaft? I am attempting to build a coaxial helicopter based on the architecture described in this paper which requires increasing and decreasing drive torque once per revolution, and I would like to do this modulation in hardware.

Perhaps a hall effect sensor would work for your application?
