Q:

How to make clean to my stack?

I have a stack with a lot of packages.
When I copy the whole directory to another ubuntu machine, I have to rebuild all packages.
But if I don't make clean package one by one, it will get stuck when the package with dependency that haven't make clean.
How do I make clean to all my packages in one stack?
Thank you~

A:

rosmake --target=clean

For any directory this should work:
for i in $(find . -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type d); do cd $i; make clean; cd -; done

rosmake --target=clean *  :: from that directory will work fine as it will ignore dirs that are neither package nor stack and other files in there. But remember rosmake will try to clean all deps which might be a pain if ros is installed in userspace. Therefore thanks for the loop make script!

It isn't a stack then.

If I didn't use roscreate-stack but using only a directory to contain all packages, what's the simplest way to clean all packages?
