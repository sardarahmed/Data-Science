Q:

Smooth step function Simulink

I'm trying to implement a smoothed step function in Simulink.
I tried to put a filter after the step function:

The result is not what I wanted.
How can I smooth even around 1 the function?
My deal is to not have a dramatic change on behavior.
A possibile idea is to have something like:

Thanks in advance

A:

There are a variety of functions that can give you an "S" curve like you want.  Check out the Sigmoid function.
I usually use something like this:
$f(x) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}$
And it can be adjusted for varying amounts of "steepness".
$f(x) = \frac{x}{\left(1 + |x|^{k}\right)^{1/k}}$
Here is one in the range you specified:
$f(x) = \frac{1}{(1.0 + e^{-10x+5)}}$
