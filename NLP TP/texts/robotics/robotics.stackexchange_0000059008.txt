Q:

Robot running with gmapping can't achive given goal

Hello, every earnest folk
background : Anyone successfully let robot running with gmapping ? I have made my robot run with amcl and a given map , and it did something  very well ,such as going to the goal ,avoiding obstacle . In recent , I want to run my robot with gmapping , and I use old base_local_planner and costmap (including local & global) parameter .
gmapping params :

  <param name="particles" value="50" />

  <param name="maxUrange" value="200"/>
  <param name="delta" value="0.05"/>
  <param name="maxrang" value="220" />

  <param name="srr" value="0.2" />
  <param name="srt" value="0.4" />
  <param name="str" value="0.2" />
  <param name="stt" value="0.4" />
  <param name="map_update_interval" value="0.3" />
  <param name="transform_publish_period" value="0.5" />

  <param name="linearUpdate" value="1" />
  <param name="angularUpdate" value="0.5" />

  </node> 

problem: robot can't achieve the goal given by rviz or rqt plugin written by myself . When I set a goal ,robot always performs recovery behaviors ,but the area around robot don't have any obstacle ,and the map showed in rviz is clean .
question 1: Are there some parameters about move_base need to be modified ?
question 2: In theory robot can running with gmapping , But in practically  ... ?
ps: ubuntu 12.04 & groovy

@dornhege  can you run your robot with gmapping ?

A:

1.my robot motor has some problem so that it can't walk forward along line .
2.After I called clear_unknown_space service , the robot's behavior looks well .
