Q:

Where is " joint_command_handle.hpp" in MoveIt2(v2.1.0)

Hello everyone,
I have one error after "colcon build" with MoveIt2 (v2.1.0) on ROS2-foxy-desktop/Ubuntu 20.04/Docker container.
I have already check the Dockerfiles in "https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/tree/main/.docker".
I want to build moveit2 from source codes, because I want to run the moveit on arm64v8.
In file included from /opt/ws_moveit/src/fake_joint/fake_joint_driver/src/fake_joint_driver_node.cpp:10:
/opt/ws_moveit/src/fake_joint/fake_joint_driver/include/fake_joint_driver/fake_joint_driver.h:12:10: fatal error: hardware_interface/joint_command_handle.hpp: No such file or directory
  12 | #include <hardware_interface/joint_command_handle.hpp>

Could you please suggest the issue ?
Best regards,
JiGoRo

A:

You're probably running into ros-planning/moveit2#283.
ros2_control is still being developed. There are frequent API (and ABI) breakages. MoveIt2 didn't keep up, so the build broke.
ros-planning/moveit2#284 was submitted which should work-around it for now.

Thank you for your great support !
I'm happy to get this information about ros-planning/movei2#284
I have succeeded to build and run moveit2 on arm64v8.
