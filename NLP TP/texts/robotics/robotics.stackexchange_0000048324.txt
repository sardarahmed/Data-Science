Try using openni.launch that comes with openni_launch package.

I have actually tried this but it does not solve this problem

The error says that nodelet already exist with same name. Try doing rosnode list and see whether these nodes exist without even launching kenect.launch.

A:

I got the same problem, here is how you fix it.
 1- open up a new terminal and type `roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch`
 2- after it launches,  kill it by typing `ctrl^c`
 3- in this terminal, type `killall XnSensorServer` (it might tell you `no process is found`)
 4-in another terminal. launch the`roslaunch turtlebot_bringup kinect.launch`
 5- If it still does not work, go back to step 1 and repeat. Sometimes it takes a few times. 

Hope this fixes your problem. post back with the results.
regards.
Khalid
