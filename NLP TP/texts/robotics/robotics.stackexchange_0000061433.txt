Q:

from nav_msgs::path to base_local_planner::Trajectory?

Hello everyone,
I am writing a plugin of BaseLocalPlanner and I want to set a path to my move_base.
My problem is that move_base::make_plan give me a nav_msgs::path and move_base use base_local_planner::Trajectory to execute a path.
so from my move_base::Path the x, y, and theta velocities of the trajectory are missing
Is there a way to use my nav_msgs::path to generate a base_local_planner::Trajectory?
thanks

A:

The process of converting Paths to Trajectories is what the BaseLocalPlanners do.
Edit: Sorry, I misunderstood the question at first. Converting Paths to Twist Commands is what BaseLocalPlanners do.
In general you cannot convert arbitrary paths to Trajectories since a trajectory is the result of applying a certain velocity command for a given period of time. Paths can be arbitrarily complicated, and therefore cannot be translated to Trajectories. What is it you are trying to do with the Paths?

I don't find any function for this . I find only function to convert a goal into trajectory. Do you have the name of the function used?

My move_base subscribe to a path and I want that my robot follow up this path.
