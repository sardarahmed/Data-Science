Q:

PointCloud alignment

I'm getting some strange behavior with pointcloud_to_laserscan where after doing some tests it appears that part of the pointcloud isn't being used to update the laser scan.  Although the pointcloud is displayed correctly within Rviz I notice that within pointcloud_to_laserscan I'm getting a significant number of NaNs which are then ignored.  Could this be something to do with 16 byte SSE alignment ?

The point cloud /camera/depth/points appears to be shown correctly within Rviz, with the points which don't make it through pointcloud_to_laserscan being displayed.

It's originally coming from /camera/depth/points, then going through cloud_throttle.  It looks as if the throttle isn't doing much, and I can also directly feed in /camera/depth/points and get the same result.

What is producing your PointClouds? Do the input clouds contain NaNs?

A:

The pointcloud_to_laser scan node only takes a slice of the point cloud.  Which is parameterized by min_height and max_height defaulting to 0.1 and 0.15 by default.  [source]
