Q:

Creating a ROS optional Library

I want to write a library (in this case a boost based cross platform serial C++ library) that when in a ROS environment is built with rosbuild and easily depended upon by other ROS packages, but in the event that ROS is not present the package will build using cmake and make only.  The only thing I am looking for is a best practice for checking for ROS environment and tips for righting a graceful cmake file to accommodate this type of setup.

A:

With the new cmake/catkin based system coming out in fuerte you can use cmake's find_package and if package_FOUND variables to do this logic.
