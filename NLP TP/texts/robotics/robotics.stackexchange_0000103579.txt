Q:

E: Unable to locate package ros-galactic-ros-gz

I am trying to install (ignition) Gazebo Edifice on my Ubuntu 20.04 system which already has ROS2 Galactic installed on it.
I'm using the command sudo apt-get install ros-galactic-ros-gz as mentioned here. But apt says it's not able to find the binaries as shown below.

How should I go about this?

A:

Found on galactic branch of the ros_gz github repo that I've to install using sudo apt install ros-galactic-ros-ign
