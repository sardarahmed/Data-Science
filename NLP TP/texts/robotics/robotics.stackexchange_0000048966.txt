Q:

joystick control/navigation using python in ros

Hello Hackers,
I'm a beginner in ros. I want to get some data from joystick. I'm a python fan - don't much know the cpp.
I would like to connect my joystick in a usb port, and want to create a node(/package) that gives the datas from joystick ,so that I can directly use it to control my robot.
My Doubts

How I can link the joystick motion control into my robot?
Is it any additional drivers/installation needed to sopport my joystick?
Is it I can able to imperilment it using python?
Is it any additional requirements/specifications needed for the joystick?

A:

That's actually a good demonstration of the advantages of ROS supporting multiple languages. There is a C++ joystick node ready to use that should work with nearly all joysticks/gamepads out of the box: joy.
Provided you have a roscore running, it's very likely that starting
rosrun joy joy_node

in one terminal and running
rostopic echo joy

in another will print out the joystick state. If that's not the case look at the Configuring and Using a Linux-Supported Joystick with ROS tutorial.
Using the joystick data in your python node is just a matter of subscribing to it and performing some processing based on it. A example of doing that is this joy_teleop.py node.

Is that really working in groovy? "rosdep install joy" does not install anything for me.  Otherwise pygame supports juystick and it is easy to write a Python node that uses that.

Hi TommyP,  How can you write it using pygame library - Is it there any tutorial available for this

Install the driver with sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-joystick-drivers.
