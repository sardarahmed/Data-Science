Q:

Is "urg_node" supported for groovy?

I have ROS groovy running on my machine. I need to get a Hokuyo urg-04lx work there. Can I install urg_node on Groovy or do I have to change my ROS distribution?

A:

According to the wiki it is supported from Groovy through Kinetic. To install the source, you can clone the repo, checkout the groovy-devel branch and then compile it. I don't believe that you can use apt to install as this is quite old (the most recent commit for the groovy-devel branch was 5 years ago).

Thank you Jayess,
But as you see there is no link for groovy install. Should I try installing all the dependencies?

The link was there, you just have to click on any other tab besides Groovy.
