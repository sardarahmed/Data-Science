A:

Its the same as ROS1, in the costmap parameter configs give a list of ordered points to the footprint parameter, exclusive of the robot_radius parameter.

On another topic- you seem to have alot of questions related to nav2. You may want to join us in our weekly working group meetings.

I do not know if you are joking or not. If you are not joking I accept your invitation.

He's not joking. We want to make nav2 better. We'd love to hear about how you are using it, and ways that we can improve it.

Indeed. Also @lorenzo I'd love if you were able to write a tutorial page for our documentation about using the nav2_util lifecycle bringup scripts to launch lifecycle nodes from the commandline. I've seen in your ticket you've used it a couple times and I'm especially surprised to see users using it. If that's valuable, it would be exceedingly valuable to have a tutorials page on it

If I will succeed I would be glad of writing a tutorial page about.
