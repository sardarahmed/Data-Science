Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Pick function

Hi,
Please let me know, what is the disfference between:

pick() function
And simple scenario in which i use attach and detach object after reaching to the defined pick and place positions respectively.

How pick is different from simple attach and also Please let me know what would be the most likely (grasp/grasps) in the pick function?  where should i get the detailed information about the arguments of pick function?
Thanks!
-I am working on ABB IRB4600 robot / ROS indigo and  intend to perfom simple pick and place task using moveit!
