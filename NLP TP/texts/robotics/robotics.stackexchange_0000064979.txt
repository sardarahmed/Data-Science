Q:

launching the image_view node of kinect camera

Dear all,
For Kinect, to view depth images on the topic /camera/depth/image, we use this command
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/depth/image

Now my question is how do I include image_view node in launch file of my package?. Including a node in a launch file is straightforward but I do not know to include image:=/camera/depth/image in my launch file. Dose anyone know how?
Thanks,

A:

Remapping is done with the remap tag. Running image_view from within a launch file would look something like this:
<node name="image_view" type="image_view" pkg="image_view">
  <remap from="image" to="/camera/depth/image"/>
</node>

Thanks. But there is still a problem. Not any window pops up to show the output of camera and there is no errors!! so what is the problem?
