Do not add people's names to comments just to notify them. If you tag your post correctly, people will see it and if they have time and know the answer, they will help.

sorry @longzhixi123, I don't have the answer to that.If I were you, as Felix suggested, I'd google the error.Maybe you would like to try to compile the code here http://goo.gl/MKTYg to see if it works fine. If so, it means librt is fine and you may want to check cmake file to verify linking with lrt

A:

Add rt to the libraries to be linked.
Change

SET(LIBS_LINK GL GLU ${G2O_LIBS} ${QT_LIBRARIES} ${QT_QTOPENGL_LIBRARY} ${GLUT_LIBRARY} ${OPENGL_LIBRARY} ${OpenCV_LIBS} -lboost_signals)

in CMakeLists.txt to

SET(LIBS_LINK rt GL GLU ${G2O_LIBS} ${QT_LIBRARIES} ${QT_QTOPENGL_LIBRARY} ${GLUT_LIBRARY} ${OPENGL_LIBRARY} ${OpenCV_LIBS} -lboost_signals)
