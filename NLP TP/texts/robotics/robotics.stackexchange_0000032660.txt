Q:

vslam node crashes after some time

I am running vslam on a stereo image data set , i am sending the 4 topics synchronously and also all the images are rectified and undistorted .I can see the camera trajectory and the point cloud in rviz .
but i have these 2 problems :

The point cloud in rviz shows some random trajectory of camera somewhere in between .

And after sometime the vslam node crashes saying.
[Stereo VO] Inliers: 77  Nodes: 24   Points: 2484
[NormRot] Bad quaternion: -nan -nan -nan -nan

i have some videos , i am not taking the feed from camera. , i split the whole thing into as many frames as possible and then also it's not working

Try moving your camera very slowly. My trajectory connects when I move my machine at the speed of a snail.

exactly :( , but it 's strange that it works absolutely correctly with the bag data .
Comment by ccm on 2011-07-03:
I experienced that problem too. The trajectory goes haywire(especially when the camera makes a turn) and when the trajectory becomes too random the vslam node will crash.

A:

The vslam node is experimental, so crashes will happen. ccm's comment is appropriate.  Patches are welcome.
