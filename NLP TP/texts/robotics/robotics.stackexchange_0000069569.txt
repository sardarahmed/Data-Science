Q:

How to introspect input and output buffers

If a transport is too slow, I would expect the output buffer of the publisher to fill up, and would like to check if this is happening in a running system.  Is there a way to check this using something in rqt or on the command line?

A:

You could instrument your code to expose this information but introspection of the queue usage is not visible externally by default.

Thanks! In hindsight this is not terribly surprising.  Do you know offhand of a nice way to instrument for this?
