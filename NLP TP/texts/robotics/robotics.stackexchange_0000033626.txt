Q:

How to make rostopic listen to custom messages

I've created my own message type, and have a C++ program generating messages. When I attempt to listen to the messages using rostopic echo, I get the following message.
ERROR: Cannot load message class for [mocap_msgs/LocalMocapFrame]. Are your messages built?
My messages are built and compiled. Why do I still get this error message?

A:

Are you sure that rostopic is running with the same ROS_PACKAGE_PATH and that the messages are built correctly?  A quick test:
#!/usr/bin/env python
import roslib
roslib.load_manifest('mocap_msgs')
import mocap_msgs.msg

print mocap_msgs.msg.LocalMocapFrame

sounds like a bug

Excellent. Thank you. Two things: 1) It should be mocap_msgs.msg.LocalMocapFrame 2) The problem was a missing dependency in the manifest. However, rosmake-ing the package showed no errors. Is that a bug?
