Q:

ROS Indigo/Jade on ARM 64 bit?

Hi all,
Tomorrow Nvidia Jetson TX1 will be available in USA, it will be a big step for robotics...
Have anyone tried to compile ROS on 64 bit ARM systems?
I do not know if all the dependencies can be satisfied... I'm really curious to start testing it.

I'm running ROS Indigo on TK1
Comment by Myzhar on 2015-11-16:
Jetson TK1 has a 32 bit ARM and I use it without problems since about one year and half. My doubt is about the Jetson TX1, based on the Tegra X1 that is a 64bit SoC.

A:

Most ROS packages should work on ARM64. We already support 32 and 64bit x86 and most things work on armhf. So filling in the matrix is a minimal step forward.
You're right that the system dependencies are usually the limiting factor. I would expect at least up through desktop to work. With more arm64 boards coming out soon we expect to have more experience and demand for those system dependencies so hopefully they will all get filled in.
