Q:

Alternatives to Object Recognition Kitchen

I'm having a hard time getting ORK to work. Are there any alternative packages in ROS Hydro for object recognition? I've searched the package list for some time but I can't find anything ...

A:

In the roboearth project there is an object detector.

you can learn your own object from a 3d pointcloud and then recognize them.

This seems to be only available in ROS FUERTE ...

You could try to run it on hydro. But I just noticed that the repository link is broken...
