Q:

How to know the frame id

Ubuntu 12.04, fuerte and Rviz
I would like to visualize the data generated by the /odom topic by gps_common package
and
the data from the laser range finder.
So I would like to know how the frome ID can be found out in general?
Thanks,
Sai

There is no output after rostopic echo /odom...Any other way to find the frame ID?
Comment by weiin on 2012-08-30:
if there's no output for echo /odom, you will not be able to visualize any data. I suggest you echo the /fix topic instead
Comment by sai on 2012-09-02:
When the /odom topic started to publish the data i.e. when it got the right data from GPS, then   rostopic echo /odom  gave the frame_id

A:

rostopic echo /odom
EDIT:
In general, the frame_id in the header of any topic (if it has a header) can be found by rostopic echo. For example, laser scans usually publish on /scan topic. So rostopic echo /scan will show you what is in frame_id. (You can use rostopic echo /scan |grep frame_id to show only that line with the id.
