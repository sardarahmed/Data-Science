Q:

rosjava dependencies

In the version of rosjava before using Gradle, Java files for all messages in packages depended on in manifest.xml would be created in ~/.ros/rosjava.  I am trying to convert an old package to use the new Gradle build system but I get the following errors for all of my imports:
error: package org.ros.message.geometry_msgs does not exist
Also ~/.ros/rosjava is not created.  Is there something extra I need to do with Gradle to make Java files created for these non-rosjava packages?

A:

Follow the installation and build instructions here:
http://docs.rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/rosjava_core/html/index.html
You have not built and installed rosjava_messages.
