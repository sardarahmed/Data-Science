Q:

Robot localization without any sensors

Is it possible to localize a robot without any sensors, odometer and servo motors?
Assume robot has dc motors and no obstacles.

A:

If you know the wheel radius and the speed of the robot, you will be able to calculate its location at any time relatively to its initial position.
travelled_distance = Speed * time;
current_position = initial_position + travelled_distance;

This is a simplified 1-dimensional equation than can help you. But keep in mind that without sensors and odometry the localization can't be very accurate.
