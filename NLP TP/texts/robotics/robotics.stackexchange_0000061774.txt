Q:

How does ROS calculates the actual robot path?

Hi All,
I am interested in knowing how does ROS determines the actual path traversed by the robot. What is the mathematics behind it. I could get some answer following hector_trajectory package but in Rviz there is an option robot_path. How to get accurate trajectory of the path followed by robot?
Thanks

Are you interested in the path that was driven by the robot or the path that the robot plans to drive?

The path that was driven by the robot. I understand how the robot_pose_ekf can be used to correct the path.

A:

Extract from base_local_planner wiki
ROS path planning is based on Trajectory Rollout and Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) algorithms which are proposed in below papers.
Brian P. Gerkey and Kurt Konolige. "Planning and Control in Unstructured Terrain ". Discussion of the Trajectory Rollout algorithm in use on the LAGR robot.
D. Fox, W. Burgard, and S. Thrun. "The dynamic window approach to collision avoidance". The Dynamic Window Approach to local control.
