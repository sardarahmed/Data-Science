Q:

rosserial_arduino error on terminal

When I write this command on terminal:
rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyUSB0
but I change my port from USB0 to ACM0 as I work on ACM0
it appears to me that:
[INFO] [WallTime: 1374151755.600608] ROS Serial Python Node
[INFO] [WallTime: 1374151755.601022] Connecting to /dev/ttyACM0 at 57600 baud
[ERROR] [WallTime: 1374151755.603582] Error opening serial: could not open port /dev/ttyACM0: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/dev/ttyACM0'
and I rum roscore in a new terminal
I am on groovy

A:

Your serial port doesn't exist. Are you sure your arduino is plugged in?
ls /dev/ttyACM* and ls /dev/ttyUSB* may help you find it.
