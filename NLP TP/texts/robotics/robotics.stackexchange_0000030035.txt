Q:

roscore on windows

Hi, I want to run roscore in Windows. Otherwise, I need one more system.
What do I do first? I don't mind that roscore is working without logging.

A:

roscore itself won't work as it uses roslaunch, which hasn't been ported to work with Windows processes.
You can, however, run rosmaster manually, which is the heart of roscore.  You'll have to follow the instructions for ROS Python on Windows (same link that makokal pointed to).
