Q:

Modify package.xml

Hi!
I just have a question when writing the ROS wiki page for my package. If I modify package.xml file (such as add author, change maintainer, ...), the ROS wiki page will automatically update or I need to do something else?
Thanks

A:

AFAIK, when you release your package, after pull request and merge progress, if you have doc: information in distribution.yaml, jenkins will update the wiki header periodically.
