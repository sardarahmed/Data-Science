Q:

Basic in environment(world) control

Hi there ! ,
Do you have any recommended method in order to
create the world that we can interact with it .
such as

turn on , off the lights
open , close the doors

manually and automatically with the script (py,C++ is alright) .
i have read through the tutorial and i cannot find the way to deal with it directly .
So , i decided to post here to be the reference for the guy who is new to the gazebo like me.

Actually , I intended to make the simulation of the smart home system. This may help my robot in controlling the smart things inside the home such as turning on , off the lightbulb.

A:

This is how I achieve the light control .
Send message by using the  STANDALONE PUBLISHER in GAZEBO REPO
and change the message type in the while loop to gazebo::msgs::Light (Need to include light message)
destination of accessing : existing light in .world file => So it has a name.
You can put the name onto the message's name field.
in order to control the light , I used lightMessage set range field . ( 0 = off , others = on )
then you can include ROS Node required file to do the controlling scheme.
