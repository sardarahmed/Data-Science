Q:

Linking OpenCV library (ROS2, C++)

Hi!
I'd like to use the OpenCV library in a C++ project - ROS2 (building with colcon build).
I added in the CmakeList the following command:

find_package(OpenCV 3.4.0 REQUIRED)

And when I #include any OpenCV header in my main code, I have no errors, but when I call any function of it, I have linking errors. It may be missing something in the CmakeList, but I don't know exactly what...
I appreciate any help. Thanks!

Are you linking the OpenCV library in the 'target_link_libraries' section?

A:

Add OpenCV in ament target dependencies-
ament_target_dependencies(executable_name 
  rclcpp 
  OpenCV
..
..
..
other _packages
)
