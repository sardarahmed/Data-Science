Q:

How to install gazebo from source in ROS groovy?

Hi,
I noticed after installing ROS Groovy that it still comes with the old Fuerte version of Gazebo 1.0.2 ( is this normal? ) which is buggy.
Is there any tutorial how to install from source a new stable version of Gazebo in ROS Groovy?
Thanks,
Andrei
EDIT: My system had more Gazebo versions installed which caused conflicts, I had to remove all ROS and GAZEBO components and make a fresh install of Gazebo and ROS binary versions.

@joseescobar60 looks like you just got above 16 karma which means you can now vote. Can you look around and find things worth up-voting. We have a karma credit crunch at the moment which is preventing the community participation bootstrap process.
