Q:

any example of rosserial_embeddedlinux over serial port?

The examples of rosserial_embeddedlinux are all about TCP connection, sometimes there're needs to communicate between ROS and an bare linux system without ROS. And it's weird when I click the FAQ it pops all 24840 questions in ROS Answer to me, So I decide to raise the 24841 one. Any help?

You can use something like https://github.com/wjwwood/serial/.
Here is a simple example of how to use it to communicate with arduino (without using rosserial_arduino)

Thanks for your answer. However I prefer rosserial because I suppose it not only perform transparent transmission but also some protocol to ensure reliable communication.
