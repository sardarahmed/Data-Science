Q:

Get package path with rospy

Hi,
I'm using ROS with rospy and I need to get the package path to load some data files, because I can't use relative paths while it's not always expected to run the nodes from any fixed location.
So, does anyone know how could I get the absolute path of a package?
Thank you in advance,
XNor
