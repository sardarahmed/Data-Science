Q:

rqt with topic monitor

Hi!
I'm new to the ROS community, and is currently working on drone related projects. Somebody hinted me to check the syntax and available messages to be published/subscribed with the use of rqt with topic monitor.
What does that mean? Will appreciate if someone could point me to the right material too!
Please advice
Thanks!

A:

rqt is a framework for building ROS visualization tools.
You may wnat to bring up the base rqt UI and play with available plugins to get a sense for what they can do.
You may also want to go through the ROS Tutorials, one of the last and most-overlooked tutorials is Navigating the Wiki, but it's also one of the best places for learning about specific ROS tools and packages.
