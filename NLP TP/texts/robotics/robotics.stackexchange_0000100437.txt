Q:

Publisher publishing message only on state/msg change

Hi,
Is it possible to publish ros2 message only on state change ? I was wondering if there is any flag that can set while creating a publisher, so that it will automatically handle publishing only on state change. I can always save the previously published message locally and compare them before publishing but just wondering if there is a better way.
Thanks

A:

No, there is no built-in way to do that. You will need to compare the messages yourself.
