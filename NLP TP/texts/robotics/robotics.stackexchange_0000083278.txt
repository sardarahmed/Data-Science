Q:

cannot roslaunch rbx2_bringup pi_robot_with_gripper.launch

Hi everyone. I'm learning ros_by_example step by step. When I have installed the packages required by the book and tried the command roslaunch rbx2_bringup pi_robot_with_gripper.launch sim:=true there are some mistakes like
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [arbotix_python/arbotix_driver]: arbotix_python
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/indigo/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/home/shantengfei/catkin_ws/src
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/indigo/share
ROS path [3]=/opt/ros/indigo/stacks` `ERROR: cannot launch node of type [arbotix_controllers/gripper_controller]: arbotix_controllers
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/indigo/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/home/shantengfei/catkin_ws/src
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/indigo/share
ROS path [3]=/opt/ros/indigo/stacks

I tried with the similiar method like this.But it did'nt work.I have put source /home/shantengfei/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bashin my ~/.bashrc and the ROS_PACKAGES_PATH is /home/shantengfei/catkin_ws/src:/opt/ros/indigo/share:/opt/ros/indigo/stacks.Could someone give me a solution?Thanks.

Well as stated in the answer you found, it means ROS does not find your package, either because it's not installed or because you did not correctly linked it. Did you fixed your other issue, the one for which you asked a question not long ago. it seems to me that this one is linked to the other.

Thanks for your reply. I can find the  rbx2 package using roscd/roslaunch, so I think taht this package has be installed.the formmer question is another package that was installed recnetly since I build the workspace I can find the same name folder in ~catkin_ws/build.

The package that isn't found is not rbx2, it is arbotix_python, can you look specially for this one and tell me if you have it ?

Sorry I didn't install the package.After I installed the package,it works!Thanks!But another problem I asked still unsloved.Could you please  give me some suggestion?

A:

Full answer with a few clarifications, based on the comments :
As stated in your link, this error means that ROS can not find the package  arbotix_python either because it is not installed or because it has not been correctly linked.
Please note that this package has nothing to do with the packages from which you launch your launchfiles. Putting launchfiles in a package is simply a way to be able to easily call them ( using roslaunch <package_name> <launch_name> ) but you could also put your launch file in any directory, open a terminal in this directory and call roslaunch <launch_name> it would work perfectly.
Also note that when calling arbotix_python/arbotix_driver, if the package arbotix_python is found but not the node arbotix_driver then the error is : Canno't find node arbotix_driver in package arbotix_python
