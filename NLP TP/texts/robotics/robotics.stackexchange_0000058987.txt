Q:

Where is the source code of the default rviz plugins?

I am trying to find some code examples for rviz plugins to be able to port an old plugin that broke after some changes in Groovy. I was able to find the headers in my Hydro installation at /opt/ros/hydro/include/rviz/default_plugin, but no idea where the sources are. Can anyone help me?

A:

The default plugin sources are available here (make sure you select the branch you're interested in).

Thanks very much! I guess it didn't make much sense to look for the sources inside an installation made through the package manager...

Can you please explain what you mean by "didn't make much sense to look for the sources inside an installation made through the package manager"? I am trying to find the source code for a rviz plugin tool that I installed. The plugin works fine but I am only able to view header files in my  opt/ros/noetic/include/jsk_rviz_plugins directory. I am trying to modify this rviz plugin for my own use so I need to edit the .cpp source files. Please help
