Q:

Rosbuild does not work on groovy source install

Hi all,
I'm running into frustrations getting a rosbuild package to build correct.
My machine was setup following these instructions.
However, I added a new package and rosbuild gives me the following output:

[rosmake-0] Starting >>> mavlink_ros [ make ]
[rosmake-0] Finished <<< mavlink_ros [SKIP] No rule to make target None
[ rosmake ] Results:
[ rosmake ] Built 24 packages with 0 failures.
[ rosmake ] Summary output to directory
[ rosmake ] /home/ubuntu/.ros/rosmake/rosmake_output-20130626-183602

If it's any help, here is the output I get from "rospack find mk"

[rospack] Error: stack/package mk not found

Any insight as to what is going on?

Don't you have to use catkin?

A:

rosbuild cannot work without a Makefile.  Please see the tutorial for creating a package
You should also make sure that you have the ros-groovy-ros installed which will bring in mk and all the other required packages to be able to build.

That was exactly my problem. It appears http://packages.ros.org/web/rosinstall/generate/raw/groovy/perception does not include mk amongst other packages.

That was an oversight in the perception variant.  I've added core ros as a dependency.  That URL now has core ros, including mk.
