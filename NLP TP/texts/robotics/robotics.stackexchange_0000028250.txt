Q:

Publishing to a Gazebo Topic by Terminal

Can I pub a test message to a specific Gazebo topic using a terminal line command?
I am looking for something like the command rostopic pub for ROS, but for Gazebo.

A:

there is a command  line tool but it's not exactly the same as rostopic pub. You can send commands like modifying model/camera/joint properties, etc but you can't publish commands to arbitrary gazebo topics.
type gz help for more info

I already did it and no options help me.
Is there any code example  (in C++) of a simple publish (to a exist random topic) for gazebo?

Calling gazebo::setupClient(); is absolutely necessary, even if gazebo is already running.
