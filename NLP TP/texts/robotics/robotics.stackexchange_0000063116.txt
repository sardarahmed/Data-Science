Q:

Kinect openni_launch TF2 exception warning

Hi all,
I tried to run other package with openni_launch of ASUS Xtion. In the launch file of other package, it subscribes to /camera/depth_registered/points, /camera/rgb/image_raw, /camera/depth_registered/image, and /camera/depth/camera_info.  When I launched roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch, it was fine. But when I launched the other package, I got this following warning repeating over and over and could not subscribe to kinect rostopics.

[ WARN] [1412634733.035488109]: TF2
exception: Invalid argument
"/camera_rgb_optical_frame" passed to
lookupTransform argument target_frame
in tf2 frame_ids cannot start with a
'/' like:

Anyone who has seen this warning before? I am using ubuntu 14.04 and ROS indigo. I did openni-related apt-gets and installed openni_launch. The version of my ASUS Xtion is old one, so openni_launch package is comparable with it, and I was able to subscribe all of rostopics properly, which is fine. It looks like TF2 related problem, but I do not know exactly why it happened.
Thank you.

A:

Its because the launch file in openni_launch hasn't been updated to remove the slashes from the cameras frame_ids. You can edit the launch file openni.launch and remove the "/" from "/camera_rgb_optical_frame" (I cant remember exactly, but I think that launch file actually includes another file with a whole lot of parameters - which is the one you want to edit).

You're right! After I removed $(arg tf_prefix) prefixes in openni.launch file, it worked fine. Thank you James!

Hello, I could not solve this problem, Will you kindly explain it in more clear way? I could not find $(arg tf_prefix) in openni.launch. In my openni.launch file it is like this <arg name="rgb_frame_id"   default="/$(arg camera)_rgb_optical_frame" />           Thanks

Hi Zari, in the default value,
default="/$(arg camera)_rgb_optical_frame"/>
there is a '/' right after '='. You need to remove that. Hope this helps.
