Q:

Cannot use rosdep to install image_view in ros hydro

*Hi all , I am running Ubuntu 13.04 and I cannot install image_view using rosdep install image_view. It returns the following :
ERROR: Rosdep cannot find all required resources to answer your query
Missing resource image_view

A:

Hi,
If you have already initialised and updated rosdep with:
sudo rosdep init 
&
rosdep update
and it still doesn't work 
Try using 
"sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-image-view ".
