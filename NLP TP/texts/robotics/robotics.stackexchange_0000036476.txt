Q:

Dynamixel Controller Problems

Currently I am running the AX-12 servo with the Dynamixel_controller package. I can successfully initialize the servo following the tutorial found here. When I attempt to start the controller it produces the follwoing
 ... logging to /home/tyler/.ros/log/1427d53c-25e6-11e1-8030-00216a81ee0a/roslaunch ubuntu-31628.log

 [INFO] [WallTime: 1323822107.421650] /dev/ttyUSB0 controller_spawner: waiting for      controller_manager None to startup in global namespace...

I'm not sure why the controller_manager name is None and why it hangs up at this point. The tutorial I am following for this step can be found here.

A:

Looks like the tutorials might be a bit outdated. Here what you need to do get going:

First we need to launch the controller manager node that will keep track of all loaded controllers (it also lets you stop, start and restart controllers). You can look at the example launch file in dynamixel_tutorials package. Make sure to set the correct min and max motor ids. Let's leave it running in a terminal window and proceed to the next step.

Define joint controllers. Look at the dynamixel_tutorials example joint configuration.

Now open another terminal window and launch your joint controller. An example launch file is again in dynamixel_tutorials package. Make sure that the manager command line argument is the same as the namespace parameter of a controller manager launched earlier (dxl_manager in this example). Same goes for the port command line argument, it should match the name given in the controller manager parameters (pan_tilt_port in this example).
