Q:

where is catkin_make error log file location?

After doing catkin_make, the output has an error but it is too long so I cannot see from the start. I would like to know where or how to I can find the error log file. I search everywhere but I cannot find the answer so I ask here. Sorry if this question is silly.
Thank you.

A:

catkin_make doesn't output the build to a log file. It only prints it to the screen. You'll have to increase your console's scroll buffer so you can scroll back. Or you could pipe the output to a file with catkin_make ... > path/to/file.log.
