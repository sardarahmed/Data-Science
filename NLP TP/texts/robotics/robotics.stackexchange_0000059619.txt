Q:

Gmapping outputs wrong map in tutorials

I followed the tutorials at the page of hector slam
but the final map seems not right, you can find my map at  www.dropbox.com/s/9072yf1f41nk18e/capture.png
Are there any other parameters I need to set?
I also use the bag "Team_Hector_MappingBox_RoboCup_2011_Rescue_Arena.bag" in gmapping following its tutorials
Also got the wrong map.
What should I do to solve this problem?
What's more, how to generate a map simultaneously without a bag file?I just have a notebook and a hokuyo laser scanner(ulg-04lx), can any one give me a tutorial?

A:

The example bagfile we provide won´t work with gmapping as I don´t provide odometry data while walking ;) , which gmapping requires. Please edit your post with details such as

computer type

operating system (e.g.    Ubuntu
12.04 64 Bit or so)

information on how you installed  hector_slam (from .debs or compiled
yourself)

I suspect that for some reason things run too slow, so the mapping process can´t keep up with the incoming data. This can happen when accidentally building code without optimization using catkin (see further info here) and/or when running the system on a very slow CPU.

My notebok is Thinkpad X201 with Ubuntu 13.04.
I installed hector_slam just as the tutorials(sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-hector-slam)
When I run the bag, I checked out the CPU status, it consumes about 9% of CPU. What can I do in the next step?
And what should I do if I want to generate a map without a bag file, just with my notebook and laser scanner.
Thank you for your reply!
