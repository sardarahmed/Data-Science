Q:

Are pr2_ethercat and pr2_ethercat_drivers going to be migrated to use the new ros_control?

I'd like to know if pr2_ethercat and pr2_ethercat_drivers are going to be migrated to use the new ros_control (http://wiki.ros.org/ros_control). And if so, when is it planned to happen?

A:

Sorry for the late answer.
They will be if someone with a usecase gets the job done. In the end what would need to be done is to create a hardware abstraction for the PR2 that internally leverages the EtherCAT drivers.
