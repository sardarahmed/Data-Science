Q:

roscreate-pkg problem

I'm following the tutorial on ros.org and I have a problem with this command:
roscreate-pkg beginner_tutorials std_msgs rospy roscpp
'beginner_tutorials' is created and than I got this:
ERROR: dependency [std_msgs] cannot be found
Can anyone help me with this issue?

A:

Try removing std_msgs and then rosmake, if u get the same error for other dependency then there must be problem with path of ros location. You might have not linked ur workspace folder to "/opt/ros/" location. Therefore it is not able to find std_msgs.
