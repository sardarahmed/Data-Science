Q:

Do Dynamixel Servos give position feedback in velocity control mode?

Some of these servos have as high as 4096 positions/revolution accuracy (0.088째). So I think if I command it to go to a particular position, say 100째, the actual position will be between 100.088째 and 99.912.
But if the servo is in velocity control mode (continuous rotation) will I be able to get information on the position at some instance in time with the same +/- 0.088째? This is because I have to synchronize the positions with the frames published by a camera.
I would deeply appreciate it if someone with experience with these high-end servos can share their thoughts.

A:

Of course, you can get present position of Dynamixels through present_position register.
I recommend to use DynamixelSDK or Dynamixel-workbench packages.
