One question about, how could you import the color into gazebo? I have a .obj file model with textures defined in .mtl file, then I convert it into .dae collada file, but gazebo doesn't load the color.

A:

Yes, it is. The kitchen model is a single .dae (COLLADA) file that is available here in the gazebo_models repo.
The easiest way to use it in rviz is probably to copy the model into a ROS package and then publish it as a rviz Marker by using the Mesh_Resource approach.
