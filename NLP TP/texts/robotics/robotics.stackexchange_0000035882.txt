Q:

Input file for polar_scan_matcher package

I am trying to use a package called "polar_scan_matcher". I would like to know how do I supply/input my laser scan data as it is in ".txt" file (it should be in ".bag" file, I guess) and it contains not only raw laser scan data, but also other data that are not needed for this package (Or else, it will be an error).
My implementation plan is to write my own node that will subscribe /pose2D topic from the package.

A:

You'll need to write some code that builds LaserScan messages from your .txt file. I suggest the rosbag API as the place to start; it gives you tools for writing messages into bagfiles.
