A:

Yes it should. You probably can also use urg_node which is a bit newer, but likely makes not much of a difference for the LIDAR you use.
See also the urg_node-vs-hokuyo_node Q/A.

I am just developing a prototype so i don't need more accuracy, a basic steady navigations is enough. Will hokuyo URG satisfy the basic requirements of ROS navigation stack ?

Yes, many robots navigate successfully using this sensor and the ROS navigation stack.
