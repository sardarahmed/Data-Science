Q:

rosserial_arduino helloworld error

Hi,
could use some help to make rosserial_arduino work and have an arduino work with ROS for me. Have followed all the instructions, tested it on 2 different Arduino's but got the error below and I am out of ideas what I might be doing wrong. I am working on Fuerte, did get Fuerte branch from github (kforce giving errors), was able to rosbuild without errors, have copied ros_lib to sketchbook as instructed. But when compiling the helloword sketch I keep getting error below. Any clues? Thanks

A:

I gave up on Fuerte. Have it now running, using Groovy with Catkin. Now it works for both my Arduino Uno and Arduino ATMega.
