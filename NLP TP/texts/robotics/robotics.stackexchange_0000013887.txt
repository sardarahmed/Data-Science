Q:

Tracking a ball returning its x,y,z coordinates

I'm a Mechatronics Student Engineer, and still new with the computer vision field and am now working on a project that needs to Tracks a small ball and need to determine it's (x,y,z).
1st) Kinect was bad for detecting small objects.
2nd) Stereo with 2 cameras not hardware synchronized isn't accurate.
3rd) Single Stereo Camera is very expensive and I don't have any information of how dealing with it.
So how Can I track a ball to return its coordinates(x,y,z) ?

A:

I did this for my project usingb 2 webcams,to get x,y,z it is a very hard topic you need to be well informed in computer vision,even you get a stero vision camera you need to threads,so you wont be dealing with low fps ,since you are using computer vision in 2 camera frame,getting depth from stero vision is hard,also the accuracy in stereo vision is less than a kinect,and takes a big amount of time,i recommend you use kinenct or a 3d camera,and it is not the camera that is important the more important thing is your code and your method to track the ball,there are alot of method to track it ,in kinect or any other3d vision system getting x,y,z is easy since you know the depth,otherwise if you want to use normal or fast camera,if you are not well informed  in computer vision ,i recommend you change the project
