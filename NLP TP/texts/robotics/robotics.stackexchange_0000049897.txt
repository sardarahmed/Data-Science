Q:

HOW TO USE MIT-ROS-PACKAGE!

HI,
I'm trying to use the demo packages created by MIT(http : //www.ros.org/wiki/mit-ros-pkg/KinectDemos), however, I don't know where to get the packages, I saw a address listed like: Version Control: https://svn.csail.mit.edu/mit-ros-pkg, should I use “svn co https://svn.csail.mit.edu/mit-ros-pkg” or "apt-get install https://svn.csail.mit.edu/mit-ros-pkg"?

@davinci, silly number limiter! In the step "Validate certificate from MIT CSAIL's svn",  in the terminal, it seems that I should enter the Client certificate filename(it shows like: Authentication realm: https://svn.csail.mit.edu:1443
Client certificate filename: ), so how to deal with it? THX!

https://svn.csail.mit.edu/mit-ros-pkg/ does seem to work, perhaps try that? Otherwise contact the maintainer of the package.

@davinci, I find that at the website of  https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/stacks, the motion_planning_common do not exist, maybe it has been removed, but how can I sole this problem?THX!

@DavidXiong, have you managed to install the package properly? Have you tried to solve the ( Authentication realm: https://svn.csail.mit.edu:1443 Client certificate filename: )?
