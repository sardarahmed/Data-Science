Q:

How can I check if turtlebot3 bump an obstacle?

In turtlebot2, I see it is based on the research robot, iClebo Kobuki, so it can subscribe to a bumper event 'mobile_base/events/bumper', how to do it in turtlebot3?
Thank you so much!!

A:

Turtlebot3 does not have any bumpers, so the first thing you need to do would be to physically add those in some way, then hook them up to spare inputs on the openCR board, read them and publish the state of them to that topic
