Q:

[Rviz]Is screen capture programmable on Rviz?

I want to move camera viewpoint of Rviz and print screen by using C++ coding.
So I'v tried to find the way of this, I succeed move camera viewpoint but I don't get how to capture the screen by publishing massage.
Can ROS print the screen or capture Rviz camera view by publishing message?

Same question as http://answers.ros.org/question/142351/publishing-virtual-camera-images-from-rviz/

A:

I have made our last recording using http://www.maartenbaert.be/simplescreenrecorder suggested at the Rviz wiki page. It is really stable, even when running lots of ROS packages in the background, and also has a nice preview function of the recorded video.
