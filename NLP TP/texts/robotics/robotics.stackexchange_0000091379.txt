Q:

Robot moves forward in rviz and backward in gazebo

Hi,
I can't figure out why my robot moves forward in rviz and backward in gazebo when I publish to a positive value /cmd_vel linear.x, and moves backward in rviz and forward in gazebo when it's a negative linear.x value.
I think the ideal thing is to have the robot move in the same direction in both rviz and gazebo
Any help is appreciated.
Thanks.

Flipping the base_link by 180 degrees fix the error.

So did you flip the base_link according to the base_footprint?
Do you think this may cause problems later when navigation stack etc are involved?
