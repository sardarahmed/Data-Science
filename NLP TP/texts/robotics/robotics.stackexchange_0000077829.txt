Q:

ROS_PACKAGE_PATH dont include kinetic/stacks

I have Ubuntu 64b 16.04 and ROS Kinectic.
echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
/home/viclinux/catkin_ws/src:/opt/ros/kinetic/share
as you see, I do not have .../kinetic/stacks folder. Is it important? What is wrong?

A:

I don't know when exactly the stacks folder actually vanished, but it does not exist anymore at least since indigo. So it is not needed in the package path anymore.

You can register and then edit it youself. I've done this for now: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/catkin/CreateWorkspace
Just to be sure: @William is there still any case where you could have /opt/ros/kinetic/stacks?

I would guess it might have disappeared when we stopped building binaries for rosbuild packages. Perhaps it would exist if you manually created a binary package for stack of rosbuild packages, but I'm not sure. @Dirk Thomas
