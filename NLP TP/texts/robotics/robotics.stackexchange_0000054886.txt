Q:

Trying to run face_recognition package

Hi, total noob here trying to follow the tutorial for the face_recognition package.
Anyways, so I cloned the face_recognition from the github site, but now how do I add it to my ros packages so that commands such as roscd, rosrun will recognize it?

A:

If you place the newly downloaded package under ROS_PACKAGE_PATH then you just run the command "rospack profile", "roscd" should be able to find it.
