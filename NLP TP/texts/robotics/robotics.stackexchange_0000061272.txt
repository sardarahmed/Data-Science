Q:

Computer vision in ROS

I am new in computer vision but I need to implement a robot with these kind of abilities.

It has to identify objects with a particular color and size.
For this purpose I have a RGB camera which gives me a topic of the type: sensor_msgs/Image

I imagine that ROS has its own version of OpenCV for these cases.
What I have to do is a pretty simple task but I have no idea of image processing.
Any idea?
Where can I find libraries and documentation explaining them?
(I am working with ROS Hydro)
Thank you

A:

Check out CV Bridge. This converts ROS images to OpenCV images. From then on it's straight-forward open cv code.

Is there any library to process images that belongs to ros?
(without needing to convert it with CV Bridge)

Something as powerful as Open CV: No. I would consider Open CV the image library for ROS.
