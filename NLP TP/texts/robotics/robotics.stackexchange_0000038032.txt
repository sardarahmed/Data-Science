Q:

Hudson Pre-Release: 401 HTTP error when attempting kforge pull

I am trying to run a Hudson pre-install on the 'gestures' stack. Hudson's console output is at http://build.willowgarage.com/job/prerelease_unstable_gestures_lucid_i386/2/console.
The salient part seems to be this HTTP 401 error that prevents Hudson from pulling the stack out of kforge into a stack overlay:
------------------  Begin Excerpt --------------------------
Install the stacks to test from source.
=========================================
Failed to execute 'rosinstall --rosdep-yes stack_overlay /opt/ros/unstable stack_overlay.rosinstall'

Installing https://kforge.ros.org/gestures/gestures master to /tmp/install_dir/stack_overlay/gestures

=========================================
error: The requested URL returned error: 401 while accessing https://kforge.ros.org/gestures/gestures/info/refs

fatal: HTTP request failed
ERROR: Failed to install tree '/tmp/install_dir/stack_overlay/gestures'
 Checkout of https://kforge.ros.org/gestures/gestures version master into /tmp/install_dir/stack_overlay/gestures failed.
------------ End Excerpt -------------

401 is 'user authorization required'. Do I need to open the kforge project somehow?
thanks!
Andreas

A:

The default behavior for Kforge is for a project to be private. You need to add the user "Visitor" as a "Friend"-level user for the project repositories to be publicly accessible.

You need to set the checkout to pull from the https url not the ssh url.

Did set it to https for the stack (see original msg). The pkgs are git submodules. Guess stack is pulled w/ https, then submodules are attempted via ssh. As you say. that can't work. Will see how to control that.
