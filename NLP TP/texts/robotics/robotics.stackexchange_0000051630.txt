Q:

quadRotor odom. options (single camera?)

Hi all,
I have a quadrotor with the following sensors:
: sparton IMU
: hokuyo URG
: forward facing camera
: downward facing camera
I've messing around with hector_slam using the IMU and the laser range finder.  The problem is that when It goes down a relatively featureless environment (such as a bare hallway) it doesn't notice that it is moving.  This of course causes problems with the mapping.
I know that it is technically possible to use IMU data to create odom data, however I also know that it can become completely unusable due to error in a few seconds.
My main question is if any of you know of a way which takes a single camera and finds odom data.  Any suggestions for a possible solution would be great.
(I'm on fuerte)
Thank you,
Price

A:

To use a single camera u need to use some VSLAM algorithm to estimate the position of quadrotor and build a map. PTAM is one such algorithm. http://ros.org/wiki/ethzasl_ptam
You can try this package.
Hope it helps..
