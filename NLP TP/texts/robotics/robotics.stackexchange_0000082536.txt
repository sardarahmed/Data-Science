Q:

Intel Euclid GPS Compass

Hello community,
I'm evaluating the Intel Euclid SDK with ros and I miss some details to access the GPS  or magnetometer features.
Are there any special nodes for this features available for ros usage ?
Thanks in advance
Cheers
Chrimo

A:

I found this information:
sudo /etc/init.d/cg2100_control.sh start
sudo gnssStelp NAF LBSSTARTPF 0 15 1000 1000
but no further documentation how to use api for programming a ros node.

What do you mean by

how to use api for programming a ros node

?
Are you asking how to write a ROS node,  how to use the topics, services, etc. provided by the node, or something else?

I need to know something about the hardware api... e.g. how the gps or magnetsensor is connected to the system. e.g. i2c, intel integrated sensor hub. Intel Euclid has currently not released any hw specs.
If I find something about hardware interfaces, I'm able to prepare own ros node

It's difficult to find information on the Euclid, but this site is not going to be the place to find platform-specific information. Maybe try https://robotics.stackexchange.com if you couldn't find information from the links that I posted on your other question.

Intel delivers proprietary binaries only. They told me, "we are working at some nodes for ros" :-)
