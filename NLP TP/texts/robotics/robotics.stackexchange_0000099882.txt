Q:

How to subscribe from ROS Publisher in Arduino?

I am currently working on arduino <-> ROS and now my problem is that I cannot receive published data in arduino.
I followed rosserial subscribing, publishing tutorials but it seems received message looking at serial monitor is only 0s.
Below is my code used to subscribe in Arduino
ros::NodeHandle nh;
void receiveANGLE( const angle::FSS& msg) {
angle2 = msg.Data;
}
ros::Subscriberangle::FSS sub("FSS", &receiveANGLE);
FSS is the topic I am sending from ROS publisher and it is perfectly sending datas properly. Also, angle is my package name and FSS is also name for my message which is int32.
if i look at angle2 in serial monitor, only
0
0
0
0
0
0
values are seen.
what could be the problem??

A:

i figured it out...
It was really embarrasing, the thing was i didn't fully understand how the entire communication system is formed and ran.
I first thought just by publishing using ROS and uploading in Arduino, I will be able to get published data in Arduino. However, I had to run " rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py _port:=ttyACM0 _baud:=57600"  command for topic from ROS to be connected and subscribed from Arduino. In short, I thought serial connection from ROS and arduino will just be formed by uploading Arduino codes but I had to set up the connection for them.
srry for late upload...
