Q:

laser_scan_matcher run problems

Hello
I installed and downloaded successfully the scan_tools stack . Than tried to run the demo example. Have done rosmake rviz rosbag tf without any error. Than when I tried to run de demo by roslaunch laser_scan_matcher demo.launch
I got the following error.
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [rosbag/rosbag]: can't locate node [rosbag] in package [rosbag]
Any help?

What ROS distribution are you using? What operating system?

Same problem with ar_pose!
The launch file has the same format as in rosbag tutorials. Does something have changed in rosbag?

A:

I had the same error using a launch like:
<node pkg ="rosbag" type="rosbag" name="rosbag" args="play -l $(find package)/data/file.bag"/>

And it seems now it works as:
<node pkg ="rosbag" type="play" name="rosbag" args="-l $(find package)/data/file.bag"/>

Right. The reason is that the rosbag binary is installed in /opt/ros/fuerte/bin as of Fuerte while rosrun and roslaunch only consider binaries in /opt/ros/fuerte/share/rosbag. I'm not sure if this behavior was intended but I at least cannot find it documented anywhere. Consider filing a ticket.
