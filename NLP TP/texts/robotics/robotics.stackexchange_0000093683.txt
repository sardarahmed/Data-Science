Q:

parametera entering approach with rosrun and roslaunch

Hello, my question is regarding what I noticed during my work with kinect2_bridge.
While I was launching the node via roslaunch, I was adding parameters this way:
'roslaunch kinect2_bridge kinect2_bridge.launch publish_tf:=true'
However this doesn't work with rosrun, which rosrun I used:
'rosrun kinect2_bridge kinect2_bridge _publish_tf:=true'
If I delete underscore before 'publish_tf:=true'  the parameter will not be added.
Thanks in advance!

This is how parameters are handled when used with rosrun. Take a look here.
