Q:

Pre-release test for a new package

I was wondering if it is possible to run a pre-release test on a package that's never been released before.
I've been following the tutorial on ROS wiki up to the point where bloom asks if it should open a pull request to rosdistro, at which moment the tutorial tells you to abort everything.
So the question is, how would the prerelease website know about your package to put it in the list of repositories available for testing, if you don't even have a pull request open. Where does it get the list of repos in general, from the actual .yaml file of rosdistro? I'm really confused.
Thanks.

A:

If you have never release a package before but want to run a prerelease you have to manually create a pull request adding your repository to the rosdistro. Just don't fill in the release version. Then you can select your repo with the version latest from the prerelease website.

Not filling in the release version results in an invalid distribution.yaml. Which makes me think it wouldn't work that way.

What makes you think that the file would be invalid without a release version?

Travis CI was complaining. But doesn't seem to do it now :)
