Q:

pointer for sensor_msgs::LaserScan

So,
I have sensor_msgs::LaserScanPtr&  scan_msg being passed in a function.
the first line is
BOOST::ASSERT(!scan_msg);
the second line is
BOOST::ASSERT(!scan_msg->ranges);
Problem:
it has a compilation error : ! not defined for shared pointer
so, I make a change
BOOST::ASSERT(!scan_msg->ranges.get())
Now it has compilation error : get not defined for ranges .
What am I supposed to do to see if ranges is not empty ??? (I have considered operator precendence and applied all the parenthesis I could, to no avail).
~Cheers!

A:

The ranges field is just a std::vector. Try this:
if (scan_msg->ranges.empty()) { ... }
