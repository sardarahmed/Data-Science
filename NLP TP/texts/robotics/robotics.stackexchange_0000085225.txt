Q:

Dockerized ROS2 development environment

Is there a sandboxed development environment for ROS2? (The/one ROS1 equivalent: rosdocked )
I identified 3 different use cases with potentially different docker Images:

ROS2 core package development
ROS2 application development
ROS2 + ROS1 application development

A:

For the first 2 use cases (ROS2 core package development, ROS2 application development) this Dockerfile from the official docker image repo can be used as base.
A first useable draft can be found here. (Is sufficient for me right now.)
