Q:

Using own bt_navigator in Humble

Hello ROS 2 Navigators,
I am working in ROS 2 Humble Nav2 stack, There's a tutorial in Nav2 for Writing a New Navigator plugin but I can't find navigators parameter in the Nav2 Humble Version, I want to get to know that, Is it possible to use own bt navigator instead NavigateToPose in Humble?

A:

No, only Iron and newer has the plugin-based navigators -- please upgrade!
