Hi,
If you plan to use WiFi you will have to make sure that you can ping all components on the network. In other words, properly set up your network. I would say there must be a set up guide for the Arduino/shield on the web to do so.
Then, start sending UDP packages (or the protocol that suits your application)  from your Arduino to one node in ROS.
Cheers
