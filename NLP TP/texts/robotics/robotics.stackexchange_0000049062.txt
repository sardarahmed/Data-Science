Q:

Package for simple USB web camera in groovy?

Which package is recommended to use in groovy for a web camera? And how do I install it? I seem to remember there being a package called usb_cam but I cannot find that anymore.

A:

Nothing specific about Groovy, but here's a good overview of most of the available USB camera drivers.
An up-to-date list of all Ubuntu packages available for Groovy is here. At the moment, it says camera_umd is available (green) on Oneiric and Precise, but not Quantal (red).

Well, I cannot find any of them in my groovy installation (full desktop).

I don't think full desktop installs any drivers. You can look for ros-groovy-DRIVERNAME packages to install, or else build them from source.

OK, good to know that this is the method. In groovy I seem to never know if I just is missing a deb or if I am supposed to build from source.

if there is a deb and you do not want to change anything -> use the deb
if there is no deb or you want to change the code -> checkout git repo and build from source
