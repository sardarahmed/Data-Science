Q:

Project 'davis_ros_driver' tried to find library 'pthread'. The library is neither a target nor built/installed properly

When I run the code

catkin build davis_ros_driver

from https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_dvs_ros, I met an error:
CMake Error at /opt/ros/melodic/share/roscpp/cmake/roscppConfig.cmake:173 (message):
  Project 'davis_ros_driver' tried to find library 'pthread'.  The library is
  neither a target nor built/installed properly.  Did you compile project
  'roscpp'? Did you find_package() it before the subdirectory containing its
  code is included?

This problem has been bothering me for a week. I tried many solutions, such as changing the Cmake version to 3.10.0 and 3.12.4, but it still didn't work, so I feel very desperate. I hope someone will help me.
Any suggestions from everyone will help me. Thanks
Melodic  ros    Ubuntu18.04

Hi @luna wu, have you looked at this: https://answers.ros.org/question/297753/cannot-build-a-package/

Yes, I have tried this :
Using compile options via CMakeLists.txt worked for me add_compile_options(-pthread)

But it didn't work for me.

I tried to replicate your error a couple times but I was unable to reproduce, it compiles with no issues. Perhaps start with a fresh installation of ROS Melodic and Ubuntu 18.04 as the owners of this library are not very responsive.

Thank you very much for your attention to this issue.
Because of too many problems ,I  reinstalled the Ubuntu 18.04 version, and the recompilation was successful without any errors.

Glad it worked. Please document as an answer so others may benefit in the future.

A:

Since I did not solve this problem , I reinstalled the Ubuntu 18.04 version, and the recompilation was successful without any errors...
I think, sometimes, reinstalling the system is faster than solving the problem
