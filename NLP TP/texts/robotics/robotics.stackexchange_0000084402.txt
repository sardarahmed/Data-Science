Q:

tf_eigen build error

Hi,
I'm building my workspace with catkin build but I keep getting the following error
/home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/src/mavros/mavros_extras/src/plugins/odom.cpp:20:33: fatal error: tf2_eigen/tf2_eigen.h: No such file or directory
#include <tf2_eigen/tf2_eigen.h>

tf2_eigen is in the list of packages which are done building:
Starting  >>> tf2_eigen                                                                                  
Finished  <<< roslaunch                                 [ 0.7 seconds ]                                  
Starting  >>> tf2_py                                                                                     
Finished  <<< tf2_eigen                                 [ 0.7 seconds ]     

I have no idee what I did wrong because I didn't touched the odom.cpp file.
Thank you for your help!

A:

Solved!
While looking at the CMakeLists.txt I saw tf2_eigen was not in the find_package list. I don't know if it needs to be there but adding it solved my problem.
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
  mavros
  roscpp
  mavros_msgs
  sensor_msgs
  geometry_msgs
  std_msgs
  visualization_msgs
  urdf
  tf
  tf2_eigen
)

EDIT: Can't accept my own answer :(

Accepted for you. Now you should have enough karma to do it next time.
