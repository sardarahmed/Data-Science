Q:

customising the path planning algorithm

I am trying to change the path planning algorithm which is used for the robots to find the shortest path to reach the goal in rviz. i want to customize it with my algorithm so as to find the shortest path efficiently . so, i want to know which package is responsible for path planning of robots.[NOTE: I am currently working on simulated jackal robot.]

A:

Path/trajectory planning is performed using the navigation stack which itself consist mainly of the move_base node and a (local/global) costmap.
move_base loads a local and a global planner plugin.
So what you want is probably to load your selfmade global planner here.
You can refer to the Tutorial Writing a Global Path Planner as Plugin for ROS.
There are also a lot of other questions here regarding your concerns:

Question 1
Question 2
Question 3
...

I recommend to first investigate how the navigation stack works in general before trying to implement your own plugin interface.
