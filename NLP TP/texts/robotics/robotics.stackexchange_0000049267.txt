Q:

robotis.launch trouble finding AX 12 dynamixel motors

Hello...
I am trying to run pi_tracker.. But,when I use "roslaunch pi_tracker robotis.launch" I encounter none of the motors are detected..
I have tried to detected the motors using the dynamixel_motor package and can successfully detect and identify motors.
Currently I am connecting 3 motors(id 1, 6, 7). The usb2dynamixel is currently set to TTL..
How could this problem solved ?
Thank you...

Hi @Rizqa,
If you are using the current version of the robotis package [from here](http://code.google.com/p/gt-ros-pkg/source/browse/ repo=hrl#git%2Fhrl_hardware_drivers%2Frobotis), then it appears that it is no longer reading ROS parameters to set the baudrate and port.  The defaults are 57600 for baudrate and /dev/ttyUSB0 for the port.  You probably need to change the baudrate to 1000000 which you can do by editing the lib_robotis.py file:
$ roscd robotis/src/robotis

Then edit the file lib_robotis.py and change the baud rate to 1000000.  This worked for me.
