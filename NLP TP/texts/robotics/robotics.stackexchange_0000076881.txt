Q:

Speech Recognition Packages for ROS Kinetic Kame

Hi, folks !
I need a speech recognition package for Kinetic Kame. I have looked at some packages like pocketsphinx but they are not for Kinetic Kame. Do you have any advice about how speech recognition works on Kinetic Kame ?
Thank you !

I would be interested in this as well...any more information?

A:

As I see it, you have 2 alternatives. There's a Python version:
https://github.com/UTNuclearRoboticsPublic/pocketsphinx
And a gstreamer version:
https://github.com/mikeferguson/pocketsphinx/pull/16
The Python version is supposedly faster and definitely easier to define new commands for. It uses an out-of-the-box CMUdict dictionary. Unfortunately, afaik, it can't be re-trained to match your specific needs.
The gstreamer version is a bit harder to use but it allows re-training, for example, if you have a strong accent.
There's also Google speech-to-text, which costs $ but its performance is amazing and it recognizes >100 languages/dialects.

Tried the version from mikeferguson, works for me.

That's good. I prefer my Python fork because it's easy to define your list of keywords and supposedly faster. Very good accuracy now that my sampling rate is correct, too. Should be a drop-in replacement for the original package.

If you're seeing lines of output when you speak, it means Pocketsphinx is running but it may not recognize your speech. Do you have a strong accent? You can download different language models (e.g. Indian) here. link

thanks but I think it is not because of accent, because we have tried it with different accents.
You re also right Pocketsphinx is running , but as I mentioned, I just see this interesting lines
