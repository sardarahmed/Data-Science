Q:

disable roslisp

Is it possible to compile ros without roslisp?
SBCL is not available on armfh, and I'd really like to run ROS on this device. :)

same problem here. was anybody able to solve this?

A:

It turns out the roslisp is not required, and even though the ros-desktop package fails to install you can still install pretty much everything you need on ARM.

Any tips on how to do this? I have an armel processor running an old Debian, just trying to get ros-base 'variant' built, don't see any docs other than the basic install from source pages on the wiki. Thanks in advance

yes, go to your catkin workspace inside the source folder and delete sbcl and everything, which does not compile, from the source-folder manually. afterwards ROS Hydro worked for me very fine on my PandaBoard armhf.
