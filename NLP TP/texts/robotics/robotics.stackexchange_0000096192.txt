Q:

Sourcing setup.bash in ROS2 foxy

Hi all. After installing ROS2 foxy in Ubuntu 20.04 from "fat' archive (binaries), when I try to source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash, ros2 is not recognized:
$ source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash

$ ros2

ros2: command not found

However, I can source /ros2_foxy/ros2-linux/setup.bash:
$ source ~/ros2_foxy/ros2-linux/setup.bash

$ ros2

usage: ros2 [-h] Call `ros2 <command> -h` for more detailed usage. ...

Is there any issues with my configuration? Or is foxy intended to be sourced only from ~/ros2_foxy/ros2-linux/setup.bash?

A:

The directory /opt/ros/foxy comes from installing Foxy from Debian packages. If, instead, you installed Foxy from the fat archive, then sourcing the setup.bash file from the extracted location is all you should have to do. I.e. you don't have to source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash, instead source ~/ros2_foxy/ros2-linux/setup.bash is equivalent.

Ok, but does that mean that the directory /opt/ros/foxy should not be present after my installation? Because it is there...

I wouldn't expect the directory /opt/ros/foxy to exist unless you installed a Foxy Debian package (e.g. apt install ros-foxy-*).
