Q:

Where to catch exception from rmw?

There are some issues about exceptions from "rmw publish" (e.g., https://github.com/ros2/rmw_fastrtps/issues/317).
Is exception from "rmw publish" a bug and it is not necessary to catch exception in my code? Or my code is responsible for catching exceptions from rmw?
What are ROS2 agreements about exception handling?
I cannot find any ROS2 guides about where exceptions are expected to be catched: in my code (where rclcpp::Publisher::publish called), somewhere in rclcpp or in rmw layer. There are no instructions in ROS2 tutorials about exceptions (https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Tutorials/Writing-A-Simple-Cpp-Publisher-And-Subscriber/).

A:

rmw is a C API (not C++) and as such there can be no exceptions raised. If any RMW implementation does raise an exception (which it shouldn't) please fill a ticket in the corresponding repository since that needs to be fixed within the RMW implementation.
