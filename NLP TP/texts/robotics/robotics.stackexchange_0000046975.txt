Q:

Rosmake takes too long

I am used to compile with Makefiles and with the help of pkg-configs, where compilation time is usually under a second.
However, when I have to include some ROS stuff into my project I usually have to create a new ros pkg to be able to compile it (using rosmake). I can't just include it on my Makefile because there is not a pkg-config available for some components (move_base_msgs for example).
The problem is that when compiling with rosmake it usually takes over 10 seconds and some times it is even close to 20 seconds. This happens with simple projects with few dependencies such as these three:
Is there a way to reduce compilation time with rosmake? or to call some libraries from my own (and faster) Makefile? Thanks

A:

rosmake is a wrapper around make, it basically parses the manifest.xml, builds a dependency tree of projects, and for each project invokes make. This allows convenient invocation of make in many projects spread around the filesystem.
If you want to just build one project however, you can just as well call
$ roscd someproject
$ make

Typical ROS projects use only a small makefile that invokes cmake, but you are free to use other Makefiles. However with the typical ROS cmake approach, you get the benefit of convenience macros e.g. for message generation.

Thanks for the tip, yet, using make in the project folter takes around 7 seconds vs 11 seconds using rosmake someproject. It is still a bit far from my expectations
