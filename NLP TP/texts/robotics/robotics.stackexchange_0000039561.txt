Q:

How do you use depth_image_proc?

Since there is no tutorial for this, how do I use these nodelets to convert a Kinect depth image into a PCL point cloud?
kinect -> point_cloud_xyz -> cloud

or do I need to use convert_metric?
kinect -> convert_metric -> point_cloud_xyz -> cloud

and if I want and xyzrgb pcl cloud (note this is a simplification and I don't know if I need convert_metric)
kinect -> register -> point_cloud_xyzrgb -> cloud

I would greatly appreciate an example roslaunch file if anyone has it.
Thanks

A:

Here's one that I use: https://gist.github.com/2400165 .  It assumes depth_registration is turned on.  In answer to your question, you do need convert_metric, to convert from mm to m.
