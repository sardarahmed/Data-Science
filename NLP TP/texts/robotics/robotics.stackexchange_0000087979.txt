Q:

How to migrate ROS PKG for Kuka youbot from Hydro to Kinetic

Hello,
For Kuka youbot, I am trying to install (by source) its Hydro driver (youbot_driver) and ROS wrapper (youbot_driver_ros_interface) in ROS Kinetic. but I receive this error as follows.
ResourceNotFound: youbot_description

ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/kinetic/share/ros

ROS path [1]=/home/alireza/catkin_ws/src

ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/kinetic/share

Dose anyone know how to solve this issue?
There are the links:
[youbot driver](git clone http://github.com/youbot/youbot_driver.git -b hydro-devel)
[youbot ros wapper](git clone http://github.com/youbot/youbot_driver_ros_interface.git -b hydro-devel)

You should try cloning the youbot_description package into your workspace as well.
