Q:

a way to use an arbitary stack

Hello.
I'm new for ROS.
I have a question about how to use and implement a stack.
I've already read all of the tutorials of ROS.
But I couldn't find the way to implement an arbitrary stack.
For instance, I'd like to use an OpenCV with ROS.(My PC has NOT been installed OpenCV)
In this case, first I install ROS(electric).
Second, I get the stack, vision_opencv via internet.
Next, what should I do?
Sorry for my beginner's question.
Thanks in advance.

A:

There's a vital, but subtle, distinction between a package and a stack. It goes like this: a stack is an installation-level construct, while a package is a user-level construct.
That is: a package never "uses" a stack: it only uses other packages. Groups of packages that "belong together" are distributed as stacks.
To have one package use another, you add the appropriate <depend> tag to your manifest.xml; you can then #include headers provided by the package you're using, link against libraries, and so on.
For the specific example of OpenCV, you want to add
<depend package="opencv2"/>
to your package's manifest.xml, and then you can use OpenCV just as if you'd installed the library and dealt with the various compile flags yourself.
