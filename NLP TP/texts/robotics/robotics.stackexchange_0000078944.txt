Q:

AR drone 2 Timeout cmd_vel

Hello everyone !
I have a question about the AR drone 2.
Is it possible to reset the cmd_vel every X ms from the package ardrone_autonomy ?
I know it's possible on the Bebop, just modifying timeout_cmd_vel = MY_VALUE in the yaml file (bebop_autonomy/bebop_driver/config/default.yaml).
Thanks for your help !!

A:

According to this wiki, there isn't a parameter that does that.
