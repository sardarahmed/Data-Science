Q:

Not receiving any data from my robot

Main Problem
I am currently trying to check if I am getting any data from the ARDrone 2.0 that I have on my desk. It is connected to the wifi and I can do a roslaunch ardrone_autonomy ardrone.launch. However, since my executable listener node was not receiving any camera feed, I decided to check the data myself on rqtplot. To my shock, no data was appearing on the rqt_plot in terms of the topic /ardrone/bottom/image_raw. When I check the other image feeds, I got the same lack of data being published, even though rqt_plot can subscribe to these topics.
I even tried running:
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/ardrone/bottom/image_raw

But am getting no output (the window just shows what's behind it). How should I go debugging this ?
NOTE
I also noticed the fact that the terminal where I launch rqt_plot, I get the notes of the type:
TopicCompleter.update_topics(): could not get message class for topic type "ardrone_autonomy"/Navdata on topic "/ardrone/navdata"

And so on for every other topic besides the camera feeds. Does this have anything to do with the problem?
Environment
Currently working on a Raspberry Pi 3, with ROS-Kinetic installed on an Ubuntu MATE 16.04 LTS. I had to manually build the project using catkin_make and downloading this special repository of https://github.com/PhilippeMorere/ardronelib.git, since the normal repository does not work for ARM architectures.

A:

This is a simple problem where the ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash hasn't been sourced as of yet. Once this is done, all the message classes will be completed.
