Q:

shadow-fixed bin repo not synchronized?

Taking hrpsys package as an example, as of today:

Nice debbuild page shows 0.0.1-6.
In the list of available package binaries at packages.ros.org, ros-groovy-hrpsys remains 0.0.1-1precise-20130823-1025-+0000 that looks outdated.

In addition, I found a package is missing; although openhrp3 looks built as 0.0.1-6 as well, it's not even listed in packages.ros.org.
I just guess it's related to the migration that happened soon after Aug. 23? Or am I missing something and are they actually built and available somewhere? Thanks!

A:

packages.ros.org currently requires a manual sync for updating both shadow-fixed and public.  It's migration is still ongoing.  It should be resolved in the next few weeks, but until then they syncs will be slightly slower.

Thanks. Is Hydro in the same situation (ie. slower, manual sync) ?

All packages, until the hosting has finished migration.

Is this still the case? debbuild page is showing husky_* packages in shadow-fixed, but I can't apt-get them. Is there some way that the manual sync may be triggered?
