Q:

no factory exists problem with Gazebo ros control tutorial

Hi there,
My ros distribution is indigo and my ubuntu distribution is 14.04.
I'm currently learning ros control. And it speed learning curve really makes me frustrated.
Here is my question, I tried the Gazebo ros control tutorial at http://gazebosim.org/tutorials/?tut=ros_control.
When typing "roslaunch rrbot_control rrbot_control.launch" it worked at the first time. But things get weird when I come back several days later( Accurately yesterday..... ). I got errors when loading the control_plugin.
[ERROR] [1466858294.522754886, 17.133000000]: Could not load class effort_controllers/JointPositionController: MultiLibraryClassLoader: Could not create object of class type effort_controllers::JointPositionController as no factory exists for it. Make sure that the library exists and was explicitly loaded through MultiLibraryClassLoader::loadLibrary()
[ERROR] [1466858294.522799828, 17.133000000]: Could not load controller 'joint1_position_controller' because controller type 'effort_controllers/JointPositionController' does not exist.
[ERROR] [1466858294.522831954, 17.133000000]: Use 'rosservice call controller_manager/list_controller_types' to get the available types
But when I call the service as the third error suggested I find the effort_controllers/JointPositionController exist.
And when I type "rospack find effort_controllers" I can find the package under ros/indigo/share/
Furthermore at file effort_controller_plugins.xml it actually contain:
 name="effort_controllers/JointPositionController" type="effort_controllers::JointPositionController" base_class_type="controller_interface::ControllerBase">

The JointPositionController tracks position commands. It expects a
EffortJointInterface type of hardware
interface.
 
I try to remove and re-install the effort_controllers use "apt-get" several times but the errors still exist.
Please help me out of this.
Thanks in advance.
Erli

A:

I solved this problem just several minutes ago. It turns out the error appears because the .so file is collapsed. So I download the source code from git and re-generate the .so file use catkin_make. The last step would be copy the .so file to /ros//lib folder, and problem solved. And then PROMBLEM SOLVED!
