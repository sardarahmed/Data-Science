Q:

error with package imu_9_dof

I'm new to ROS and i'm trying to do a project starting with the imu sensor stick. While trying to convert the raw data (raw, pitch & yaw) from the IMU 9dof sensor to ros data, I've got a problem with this line:
   imu.orientation.x = tf::createQuaternionFromYaw(0.0);

And this derived the error:
   error: cannot convert ‘tf::Quaternion’ to ‘geometry_msgs::Quaternion_<std::allocator<void> >::_x_type {aka double}’ in assignment.

Any help is appreciated. Thanks :)

A:

Something along these lines should work:
tf::Quaternion q = tf::createQuaternionFromYaw(0.0);
tf::quaternionTFToMsg(q, imu.orientation);

See tf::quaternionTFToMsg().

Thank you! Right now I am working my imu sensor stick with an Arduino board. I've got the data from the imu printed out (roll, pitch and yaw). However I have to convert the raw data(roll, pitch and yaw) to ros capatible data and publish these data. So do you have any suggestions? Thank you again! :)
