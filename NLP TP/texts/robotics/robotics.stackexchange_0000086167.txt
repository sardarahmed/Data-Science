fuzz testing for message filters?

Message filter is one of the important components in ROS, which monitors data from different sources and do the synchronization via registered callback functions, is there any exiting fuzz testing tools or thoughts for this component?

I am currently working on something which enables one to do ROS node level fuzzy testing. However it is too early for making it public right now. Stay tuned on discourse.ros.org for threads in the "project" category ;-).

There are unit tests for this library, but I doubt that any of them are fuzz tests: https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/tree/lunar-devel/utilities/message_filters/test
