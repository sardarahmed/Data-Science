Q:

Depency on SBCL installing ROS from source (ARM Hardware)

Hi people,
i tried to install the new ROS Indigo Beta from source on my ARM Hardware (just the Bare-Bones). Everything runs fine until installing the depencies through "rosdep install". There is one package "SBCL" where no binary is found for the ARM Hardware. I already know this issue from Hydro (and I think even in Groovy). I can remove the packages which depend on SBCL manually, but I think it would be better to find a solution for solving this depency for Indigo Igloo as LTS version. This would be a big step for supporting ARM Hardware. I think even the Desktop Install could work then from Source.

UPDATE
I now have experimental debs available for Indigo on Trusty armhf, including builds of sbcl: http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/UbuntuARM
ORIGINAL ANSWER
The trouble here is that there are no builds of SBCL for the Ubuntu arm variants, and it at the time when I did builds of ROS Hydro for ARM, it looked like it would be difficult to port SBCL to arm and build the required binary packages.
The SBCL news page indicates that SBCL has recently been ported to ARM Linux, so it may be possible to build debs for armhf now.
If you have time to build debs of SBCL for Ubuntu ARM, I'd be more than happy to include them in my ROS ARM repository and build debs against them.
EDIT
I have deb builds of SBCL that will be part of the upcoming Indigo for ARM release: http://packages.namniart.com/repos/ros_support/pool/main/s/sbcl/
