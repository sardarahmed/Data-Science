Q:

will ros-dynamixel support dynamixel pro servos?

there seem to be some differences in the protocol
see
http://support.robotis.com/en/product/dynamixel_pro/communication/instruction_status_packet.htm
and
http://support.robotis.com/en/product/dynamixel/communication/dxl_packet.htm
however, on the dynamixel pro communication site robotis states

Dynamixel protocol 2.0
Previously both Dynamixel and Dynamixel PRO implemented a different protocol. TO verify protocol version please refer to both instruction and status packet.

unfortunately i couldn't find any information if the ros-dynamixel package will support the pro servos

so by looking at the code i figured out that they are currently not supported

A:

i emailed the package maintainer.
he does not have access to a dymixel pro servo. since they use a quite different protocol the pro series is not supported currently and it's unclear when they can add support for it.
