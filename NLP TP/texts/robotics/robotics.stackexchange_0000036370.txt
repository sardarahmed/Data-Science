Q:

gmapping simulation

Hello,
I'm trying to simulate a map useing turtlebot data. I've been able to build the map if the messages that I publis are tf and scan, but I don't want to record tf because gmaping publishes there.
Insted of this, I try to make the map from odom, scan and joint_states, the topics that only one node publishes on them and affects to gmapping. The thing is that I allways get the same problem:
WARN 1323440435.058256895: MessageFilter [target=/odom ]: Dropped 100.00% of messages so far. Please turn the [ros.gmapping.message_notifier] rosconsole logger to DEBUG for more information.
WARN 1323440435.059003292: MessageFilter [target=/odom ]:   The majority of dropped messages were due to messages growing older than the TF cache time.  The last message's timestamp was: 1323433160.494893, and the last frame_id was: /kinect_depth_frame
What do you think I could do? It is obvious that has something to do with the time of ros. Is there any option to record the time when recording the data and then play back the time also?
Thanks.
