Q:

Unmet dependency problem while installing electric: "but it is not going to be installed"

While installing ROS as per the given steps in your installation page i get the following errors:
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree

Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:

There is a problem with your ubuntu packages. Can you check that your packages are up2date (sudo apt-get update) and that you enabled universe/multiverse and security updates?

A:

Hi there,
I had exactly the same problem on Ubuntu natty (11.04) and was finally able to solve it. In my case there was a conflict with libeigen3-dev which didnt match the expected version (Depends: libeigen3-dev (= 3.0.1-1+ros4~natty) but 3.0.2-3+natty1 is to be installed). I found the solution here (japanese) using google translate.
I had to:

Uninstall pcl and eigen: Sudo apt-get remove libpcl-1.1 libeigen3-dev

Comment out all lines in: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/v-launchpad-jochen-sprickerhof-de-pcl-natty.list (may be maverick for you)

Run: sudo apt-get update

Install the ros-electric-desktop-full

Hope that helps.

@Ben_S Works as a dream ! .... Cheerio
Comment by BillCheetham on 2012-02-27:
After doing this, is one able to then reinstall Eigen and PCL easily? I would not like to break my PCL installation, which I use daily, for a whim with ROS.
Comment by Arkapravo on 2012-02-28:
@BillCheetham No, Update manager blocks PCL installation/updation - however that doesn't bother me !
