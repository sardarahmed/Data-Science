Hello

I follow robotigniteacademy control course but I would like to try those on my own env
When  I'm trying to launch my model "roslaunch rrbot_control rrbot_control.launch" I can see [ERROR] Could not find parameter robot_description on parameter server
Everythin I need on this moment is move once of my joints
I need move any joint by terminal

The right location to ask this question would be here: https://answers.ros.org/questions/
When i download and open the rar file it appears to be empty.

A:

So this is a guessing game, but in my experience the robot's controller needs the description of the robot to work.
I would suggest to look for a description.launch file or if you don't have it a description package for your model.
Loading a description in a launch file looks normally like this:
<param name="robot_description" command="$(find xacro)/xacro.py $(find robot_description)/robots/robot.urdf.xacro" />
