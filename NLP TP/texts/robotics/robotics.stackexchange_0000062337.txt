Q:

Writing a TeleOp-Node for a generic joystick

Hi guys,
I' ve got an USB -Simulator RC-Transmitter that works very nice under Linux. Since I want to use it for my ROS-Robots I wanted to create a node as a driver.
The tutorial is really easy but running the command:
$ jstest /dev/input/js0

I get the following output from my TX:

How should I interpret numbers like:

Axes:  0:     0  1:     0  2: 20606

Means 20606 microseconds? Millivolts? Or something else?
Thanks

A:

Ok...I didn t find out what those number mean nor if they are milliseconds or millivolts or something like that.
Anyway: I modified this tutorial and it works like a charm. Just take that number as it is and scale it to your needs.
Regards
