Q:

RViz camera view: other coordinate frame convention

I'm currently doing some experiments with fovis_ros and a kinect . This works pretty well, but fovis uses an other type of coordinate frames where +X is to the right, +Y is down and +Z is forward. The thing is that none of the camera views in RViz are able to let the camera rotate around the Y axis instead of the X axis. This makes it kinda hard to get a nice view in RViz. It seems that RViz was only made for the coordinate frame conventions documented on this page: ros.org/wiki/geometry/CoordinateFrameConventions
Any of you guys encountered the same problem? Is there anyone with a solution for this problem?

A:

Depending on the launch file you use for your kinect, it might be that there is already a static_transform_publisher running that publishes a tf between camera_link and camera_rgb_optical_frame. You can check that easily by running
rosrun tf tf_monitor

If you want, you can easily give this camera_rgb_optical_frame as base link frame id to fovis_ros:
rosrun fovis_ros stereo_odometer _base_link_frame_id:=/camera_rgb_optical_frame

fovis_ros will then publish movements through tf and odometry messages using /odom as fixed frame and /camera_rgb_optical_frame as the moving (child) frame.
If you set the fixed frame in rviz to /odom you should see the camera frames moving while moving the kinect.

Thanks! That did the trick for now. Although it would be nice if there was some kind of setting in RViz itself.
