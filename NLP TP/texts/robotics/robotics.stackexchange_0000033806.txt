Q:

Failed to display hokuyo node message on Rviz in Virtual machine

I use parallel Desktop 6.0 on macbook to install ubuntu 11.04.
I run the following instructions:
  rosrun hokuyo_node hokuyo_node
  rosrun rviz rviz -d `rospack find hokuyo_node`/hokuyo_test.vcg

result:

Orbit views:

Obviously it is not correct.
Because the laser data point is not only a line.
When I try the same laser range finder at the other computer,it works normal.
Like this screen shot:

How to fixed it?
Thank you~

Can you clarify what exactly is incorrect about what you see?  I'm having trouble from the screenshot.

A:

This looks to me like an instance of the bug described here, where point clouds are not being rotated correctly.
The other reporter was also running Ubuntu on a Mac.
