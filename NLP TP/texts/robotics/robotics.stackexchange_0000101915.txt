Q:

Is there a non-graphical rover simulation node?

Is there a simple node that subscribes to cmd_vel and publishes reasonable (for a rover) Pose and Twist messages?  Something like turtlesim but with real Pose messages and no GUI.

A:

ros_control has an open_loop parameter. That takes the cmd_vel messages and uses that to calculate the odometry (instead of using encoder data). Is that what you're looking for?
