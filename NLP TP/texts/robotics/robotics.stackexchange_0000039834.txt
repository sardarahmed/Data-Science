Q:

Door detection for topological map

Hello I'm working with topological maps, and at this moment I need some implementation for door detection. Because this is challenge problem and is not my core of reasearch could someone suggest any implementation ready or nearly-ready to run? (in the sensor we have laser 2d and mono and stereo camara! )
Thanks,
Filipe

A:

The easiest, most "I'm trying to solve some other problem", and fastest way is probably to add ARTags to your doors. They're implemented in the brown-ros-pkg.
