Q:

Calibrate Gazebo Camera

Hi!
I have a robot in a gazebo environment. This robot has a camera (I use the libgazebo_ros_prosilica.so controller).
I have to use ar_pose to get the robot position in gazebo world through camera acquisition. But I have a big problem: how can I calibrate that camera? There is some ar_pose internal tools or I have to search for more esoteric solutions?
Thank you!

A:

Intrinsic calibration is not really required in gazebo since we do not inject any distortion to the image.  You can see how the projection matrix is setup in GazeboRosCamera::PublishCameraInfo().
Extrinsic calibration is also not necessary as you should be able to access the exact pose of the camera sensor in simulation through either the ROS API or using tf.
But if you really wanted to run through the calibration procedure, you'll have to create a checkerboard in simulation and run through camera calibration, or you can see how the pr2 cameras are calibrated here.
Please let me know if any of the above is unclear.
