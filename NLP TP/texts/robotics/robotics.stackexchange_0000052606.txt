Q:

Can I use OMPL for path planning/tutorial

Hi,
I want to use the OMPL ros package to do some motion planning with a create and hokuyo laser scanner. But the ompl_ros_interface tutorial seems completely focused on moving a robotic arm. Is there a good place to start? I've been reading the OMPL's website tutorials as well.

A:

Hi there, are you doing motion planning for a vehicle or something that moves in 2D?
You don't need OMPL to achieve so, the ROS navigation stack does that for you with more time optimized algorithms.
A great example of that is the Turtlebot who navigates in a known environment (it can also be an unknown environment so no worries.)
You can check how it works in this youtube video: https://youtu.be/PJH2oMeSjFQ
