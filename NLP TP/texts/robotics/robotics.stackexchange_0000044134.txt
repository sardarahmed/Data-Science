Q:

"ERROR: Stack's declared dependencies are missing calculated dependencies"

I run this command: rosrun release create.py wu_ros_tools 0.1.0 electric
using the electric version of the release script.
The stack file I'm using is here in my repository.
However, after the above command checks out the repo, I get this error.
ERROR: Stack's declared dependencies are missing calculated dependencies:
geometry
visualization
diagnostics_monitors
common_msgs

...but I DID declare those stacks, didn't I?

Might there be local changes in your working copy?

Must've just de-synched. Works now.
