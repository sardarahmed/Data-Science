Q:

Include Autoware Auto msgs

Hi all,
I am implementing a new vehicle interface for Autoware my simulator, running on a different node, will receive autoware msgs ( VehicleControlCommand or  HighLevelControlCommand). How can I include autoware_auto_msgs in my project?
Thanks, Simon

A:

autoware_auto_msgs (the 1.0.0 version, anyway) has been released to the ROS build farm. To use them in a project outside of Autoware.Auto, simply add <depend>autoware_auto_msgs</depend> to your package.xml file. If you are not using ament_cmake_auto (which I highly recommend) then you also need to add find_package(autoware_auto_msgs REQUIRED) to your CMakeLists.txt file.
