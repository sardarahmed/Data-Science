Q:

Python: Getting a package's absolute path

I'm trying to navigate in the code having paths that are not hardcoded. I would like to know if there is a ROS/Python way of referring to a package's path. Something like navigateToPackage("package_name") is what I am after. Is this a supported feature? Does it exist?

A:

You can get the path of packages with the rospkg  python library: http://docs.ros.org/independent/api/rospkg/html/python_api.html
import rospkg
rp = rospkg.RosPack()
package_path = rp.get_path('package_name')
