Q:

Control a robot with 2 motors and a H-bridge with Arduino and ROS?

Hi all.
Does any one have a project which makes you connect an arduino to ROS, in order to control a robot with two motors connected to a h-bridge, just as a beginner project to get started?
Thanks, best regards!

Hey unfortunately not. I have tried to learn more c/c++ programming meanwhile and maybe I should look into it again.
Any way if you figure it out or find more information please share it here for all to see. Thanks.
