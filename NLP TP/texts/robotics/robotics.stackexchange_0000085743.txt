Q:

How can I build a specific ROS2 package only?

I have pulled all ROS2 repos into my overlay workspace using
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros2/ros2/release-latest/ros2.repos
vcs import src < ros2.repos

How can I build one specific package and its dependencies only? Let's say I want to build rcl with ament build --only-packages rcl this will not work because of the directory structure in src where rcl resides in src/ros2/rcl.

The location of rcl in the src folder doesn't matter when using --only, because it matches package names, not folder locations.

I'd also add to @tfoote's answer:

You cannot currently do that, --end-with rcl will build all packages that would have been built before rcl whether or not rcl depends on them.

Means its not possible to combine --start-with with --end-with then?
