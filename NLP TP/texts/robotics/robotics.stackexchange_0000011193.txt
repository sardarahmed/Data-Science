Q:

Reading Intention for exoskeletons motion estimation

I'm interested in exoskeletons and wearable rehabilitation robotics. I wonder how we can estimate/predict the intention of human body/part motion. I want to prevent the exoskeleton from interfering with human movements.  Intention reading is the process of predicting how the movement will take place and how it will happen at the beginning of any movement.
There is an exoskeleton example (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdoblvmTixA) which detects muscle activation with EMG and generates artificial muscle attraction. But this is only a open and close action. And it will begins after the movement. Also EMG system has a lot of disadvantage like sliding probes, affecting from other/crossing muscles. I want to estimate every motion like turn,twist, amount of contraction. I'm open to suggestions or issues (The troubles you have experienced.)
This matlab webinar which is about "Signal Processing and Machine Learning Techniques for Sensor Data Analytics" shows how to classify different actions. But this example predicts kind of motion after the motion completed. I need to know motion information at very first.
I want know how can I estimate different motions at the beginning of limb action. Which system (EMG,EEG,IMU,etc.) and processing technique will be better or which combination should I use.

A:

You have many options: encoders at exo joints to provide absolute angles, IMU on limbs for estimating motions, force sensing shoe soles for force distribution, force sensors at joints, crutches usually used by pilots wearing rehab exo can also have those sensors, e.g. at the bottom of the crutch, at hand handles, etc.
