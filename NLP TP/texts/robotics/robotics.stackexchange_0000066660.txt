Q:

Open python scripts in QtCreator

Using Qt creator for cpp catkin projects is straight forward. However, I have a scripts folder in my package that contains python scripts and it is not shown. As Qt creator can edit and run python scripts, I would like to be able to use it for both cpp and python. How can I do that?

A:

To open an additional folder from your package add these lines to CMakeLists.txt
FILE(GLOB random_name "scripts/*.py")
add_custom_target(random_name2 SOURCES ${random_name})

In this example I added my scripts folder containing the python scripts
