Q:

Converting SolidWorks STL files into urdf file

I have the solidworks stl file of my robot, but how can I convert it into urdf file? I have tried simmechanics_to_urdf, but it seems don't work at all. For example, the stl file is test.stl (asscii), which pkg and node can do this job. Thank you.

dornhenge is right that you can just use it in a URDF directly, but it won't have any flexible joints. What part of simmechanics_to_urdf were you having trouble with?

A:

You can use an STL file directly as a mesh in a URDF link. There might be some issues when exporting the STL from SolidWorks. You need to choose the correct units and export as binary IIRC.
