Q:

3D Mapping from a quadcopter with KINECT

I have a quadcopter robot that has a KINECT on it and i want to do 3D mapping with it. 

Is KINECT reliable on a moving robot (i.e., can it give me stable images and maps with this movement)?
Is there an SDK for producing 3D maps from KINECT data?  Will SLAM algorithms work?
Is the arduino board on the copter (ATmega 2560) powerful enough to handle this?

A:

With respect to the Arduino + Kinect, see my answer to Start making robots with Kinect (short version: not happening without something with more CPU power than a Raspberry Pi, which you then have to carry onboard with sufficient additional battery power).
The other obstacle in your case is that the specifications of the Kinect are not well-suited for any sort of aircraft. The effective range of the depth sensor is 1.2 - 3.5 meters. It won't be able to detect a wall right next to it or recognize it from a distance. Your copter would have to be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles in that 1.2 - 3.5 meter viewing range. Even then, it could get blindsided by something too close to ever be detected in the first place. You would have to add additional sensors for obstacle avoidance and only use the Kinect for mapping when you know it's safe to do so.
