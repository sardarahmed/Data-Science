Q:

What UAV kit(s) would be suitable for a beginner roboticist with programming experience?

I'm really new to robotics, however I am a programmer familiar with several different languages. I don't have a ton of money to spend and I was wondering what is a really good starter kit. 
My criteria is for the kit to be inexpensive and powerful, in that its functionality is extensible -- something that would allow the builder to be creative and possibly invent new ways to use it, not just a glorified model kit.  
Being extendable to smartphones is a plus.
I'm not looking for something easy or introductory, just something powerful, flexible, and cost effective.

A:

I think your question is a bit too open-ended.  To get more specific recommendations, I think you'd have to provide some idea of what facet of robotics you want to get involved in.  The mechanical buildling aspect?  Motor control? Microcontroller programming? Use of various sensors?  As an example, I can ask what do you mean by powerful in your question ... motor torque or onboard computing capabilities?  Robotics is a broad field.
If very new to robotics, I would suggest you start out by buying the latest issue of Servo and/or Robot magazines (and then possibly subscribing).  Just glancing through these magazines will give you a lot of information regarding the current hobbiest/enthusiast robotics market, and in the magazines there are many advertisers for kits of all types.
A popular, lower cost, easy-to-learn, yet flexible, microcontroller that can be used for robotics is the Arduino.  There are prebuilt kits for integrating with smartphones. Check out the information here:
