Please always add the tag 'knowrob' for knowrob related questions to make sure the right people get notified.

A:

I had the same error once... are you on ROS Electric? Just updating KnowRob to the latest svn ( http://code.in.tum.de/pubsvn/knowrob/tags/latest ) solved it and in Fuerte it works fine for me.

No. Im on Fuerte, But solved the problem. Anyway thanks., But I have some problems with the semantic map. I want to use my occupancy map of the environment and yaml file for owl. But don not know how to use that information to create semantic map. Any help or tutorial about it?
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-08-15:
As already answered in your other question, semantic maps cannot be directly generated from an occupancy grid. There's just no semantic information in there. You will have to invest some work to understand the basics and create your semantic map manually.

Astronaut, how did you solve the problem? I get the lights() is not available with this renderer error. I am using ros fuerte and the svn knowrob. Thanks in advance.

The 'lights()' warning is no error and should not be a problem. If the visualization does not start, please open a question and list both the commands you enter and the results you get.

ok I will do as you suggested.
