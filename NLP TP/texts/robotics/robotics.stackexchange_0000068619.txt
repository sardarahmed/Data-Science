Q:

Invalid package manifest "package.xml"

Hi!
I found a some entries but none seem to help with my problem. I am currently following the instructions to install turtlebot on this site:
http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot/Tutorials/indigo/Turtlebot%20Installation
when running following command under point 2.2:
rosdep install --from-paths src -i -y

I get following stack trace:
nicolas@myworkstation:~/rocon$ rosdep install --from-paths src -i -y

ERROR: Rosdep experienced an error: Invalid package manifest "/opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/package.xml": Error(s) in /opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/package.xml:
- The manifest must not contain the following tags: depend, build_export_depend, buildtool_export_depend
Please go to the rosdep page [1] and file a bug report with the stack trace below.

rosdep version: 0.11.2

There must be a problem with my package.xml file.
It seems that the package version 2 might cause the error but I honestly don't know how to fix it. Does anyone have any ideas?
Thanks in advance!

Can you post the package.xml that causes the problem?

A:

Your rospkg version is likely outdated. Please see http://answers.ros.org/question/207802/rospkgmanifestinvalidmanifest/
