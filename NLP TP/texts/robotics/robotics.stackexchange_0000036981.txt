Q:

Why opencv2 has two kinds of programming styles?

For example
  cv::imshow(WINDOW, cv_ptr->image);

and
  cvShowImage( "Image", pImg );

How to know which style should I use?
Thank you~

A:

The first is OpenCV in C++, the second is OpenCV in the basic C functions. The first example is calling the C++ version of OpenCv with namespaces and all of the functions included in the namespace. The second style is simply the OpenCV function in C. The C++ is just a wrapper for the C code, so you're essentially calling the same functions either way. Which you use is really up to you. I like the C functions better, mostly for the sake of simplicity and documentation.

The latter isn't a C macro; it's a C function. It's two kinds of programming styles because C and C++ are two different languages.
