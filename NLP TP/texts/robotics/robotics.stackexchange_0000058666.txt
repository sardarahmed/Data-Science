Q:

Test MoveIt Package

Hi,
I try to make a moveIt package. I follow the tutorial and finish it without problems, but when I try to launch the new package with "roslaunch new_moveit_package demo.launch"
[demo.launch] is neither a launch file in package [new_moveit_package] nor is [new_moveit_package] a launch file name
Any idea??

Try the part "Create plugin" of this Tutorial.
if you did correctly the moveit assistante tutorial, it should work

A:

This sounds like your newly created package is not in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. See these Q/As for more info on that: 1, 2, 3. You either have to put your new package into a folder that is already in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, or add your package folder to it.
