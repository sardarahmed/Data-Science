This sound very much like a homework assignment.

@Mike Scheutzow  This is not an assignment. This is the data set about the 2D laser I searched on the Internet. Because I used to run the gmapping algorithm with data in rosbag format, but I found these datasets in some papers, I don't know how to convert these files to files in rosbag format

A:

These files were created by the Carmen "Robot Navigation Toolkit" project. They are compressed ascii files.
The Carmen web site: http://carmen.sourceforge.net/
Info about the Carmen "log" file format: http://carmen.sourceforge.net/logger_playback.html
The Carmen API to read log files: http://carmen.sourceforge.net/doc/group__logger.html
