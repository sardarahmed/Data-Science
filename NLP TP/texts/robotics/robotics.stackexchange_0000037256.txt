Q:

How to link URLs with parentheses correctly?

Linking a URL with ) in it doesn't work as that's the same character that ends the link tag.
I tried some basic escaping, unsuccessfully.
Is there a solution to this?

A:

I've been having trouble with that, too.
Turns out you can escape '(' with "%28" and ')' with "%29", the ASCII hex values. The close parenthesis is all that's really required, but the other helps to make things look less "unbalanced".
EDIT:
Even with that escape, it can be tricky. Sometimes the link works while editing, yet fails after the edit is committed.
We should probably open a ticket on this behavior.
