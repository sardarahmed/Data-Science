Q:

How to visualize the data of "5-Megapixel camera" and "LED Texture Projector Triggered with Narrow-Angle Stereo Camera" in rviz?

I want to use rviz to confirm the functions of "5-Megapixel camera" and "LED Texture Projector Triggered with Narrow-Angle Stereo Camera" works well,
but I cannot find the correct topic to visualize the camera data, does anyone know how to view in rviz?
EDIT:
I found a page that may be useful for this question.
Now my understanding is, projector illuminates the objects. To visualize the data of "LED Texture Projector Triggered with Narrow-Angle Stereo Camera", I should start the projector first, then I can view narrow_stereo_textured data on rviz. Is this correct?
Thanks in advance.

1.To check whether "5-Megapixel camera" works well on PR2. Just use dashboad, select the "camera" and choose "Prosilica".

2.And for "LED Texture Projector Triggered with Narrow-Angle Stereo Camera". To start projector, reference this page.
Use this
rosrun dynamic_reconfigure reconfigure_gui
