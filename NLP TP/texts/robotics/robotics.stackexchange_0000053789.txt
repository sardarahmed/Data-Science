Q:

starting up roscore automatically on boot

Hi guys,
I have got a basic ROS running on a some hardware successfully, thanks to helpful pointers from this community (love you guys for that). Right now I am facing another seemingly difficult issue. I am trying to get the roscore process to autostart at boot so that I can get my robot to move about freely in the room. I have tried updating rc.local, crontab, and init.d update and also the autologin script. All of them fail to work. I am using Raspberry Pi hardware with raspbian wheezy linux and I need to start roscore as root on this hardware at boot up automatically. Please guide me towards accomplishing this.
Thanks and Regards to all,
Praseen

You can find quite similar question if you scroll main page a little down. Please see Autostart a launchfile after/while boot question and the accepted answer.
Hope it helps.
