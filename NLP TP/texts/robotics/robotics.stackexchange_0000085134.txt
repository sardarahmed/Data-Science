A:

After doing some research I concluded that, as of now there is no direct method to do so. Thus, for now Im parsing the urdf file using TinyXml (xml parser).
I get the values of all the necessary attributes of urdf and save them as variables using TinyXml. And then I use those variables in the piece of code where Im defining all the properties of the collision object and adding it to the planning scene.
