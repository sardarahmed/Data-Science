Q:

catkin 'ized' Vicon Package

Greetings, I am looking for a recent vicon interface node and have not found a stable one. The following link,
http://answers.ros.org/question/11456/vicon-motion-capturing-which-ros-package-is-the-best/#
lists three, where 2 are old versions / non-catkinized and 1 no longer exists in the wiki.
Any suggestions as to where I can find an updated vicon data publishing node?
Regards,
Jim

If I understand you correctly, this has been answered before. See vicon with ROS INDIGO.
