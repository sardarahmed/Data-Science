Q:

catkin_make error

I'm in the process of running catkin_make, but right before make is successful, I am receiving the following error with a gradle plugin:
:gradle_plugins:generatePomFileForMavenJavaPublication
:gradle_plugins:compileJava UP-TO-DATE
:gradle_plugins:compileGroovy UP-TO-DATE
:gradle_plugins:processResources UP-TO-DATE

:gradle_plugins:publishMavenJavaPublicationToMavenRepository FAILED

What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':gradle_plugins:publishMavenJavaPublicationToMavenRepository'.

Failed to publish publication 'mavenJava' to repository 'maven'

Try:

make: *** [all] Error 2
Invoking "make" failed
Since the error mentioned permission being denied to the folder, I tried changing the permissions.  I even used "chmod -R 777 filename(s)" but when I used catkin_make, I still received the same error.
Are there any possible workarounds or fixes for this issue?  Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.

A:

It's trying to upload to file:/opt /ros/hydro/share/maven/ which indicates something is going wrong. catkin_make should only ever attempt to upload to your devel workspace (e.g. ~/my_workspace/devel/share/maven). Are your environment variables pointing to the right places? What does env | grep ROS show for you?

No my env. variables were not pointing to the correct places.
I changed the ROS_MAVEN_PATH and ROS_MAVEN_DEPLOYMENT_REPOSITORY from /opt/ros/hydro/share/maven to ....../devel/share/maven using the export command, and my build was successful. Thanks!

Hey musk,
I am confronting the same error. Can you explain how you mean by saying I changed the ROS_MAVEN_PATH and ROS_MAVEN_DEPLOYMENT_REPOSITORY from /opt/ros/hydro/share/maven to ....../devel/share/maven
