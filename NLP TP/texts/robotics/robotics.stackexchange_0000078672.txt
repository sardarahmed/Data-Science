Q:

virtual machine master to robotic armv7 node communication issues

running a virtual machine as the master and having trouble  getting rostopic to get data.
always asks if my messages are built.
Is there a way to confirm that they are built?

Edit: I noted my question was vague without details...
I  attempt
rostopic ech /turtle1/cmd_vel

Response:
ERROR: Cannot load message class for [geometry_msgs/Twist]. Are your messages built?

Some googling says I should be able to run sudo netcat from both directions, but I can only do it one way..... still working on it.....
if I run (on virtual Machine MASTER (lvbuser001-VirtualBox)): sudo netcat -l 1234  
and run (on ARMv7 (chip)): sudo netcat lvbuser001-VirtualBox 1234
it works!
if I run (on ARMv7 (chip)): sudo netcat -l 1234
and run (on virtual Machine MASTER): sudo netcat chip 1234
it fails!

A:

Make sure everything discussed in wiki/ROS/NetworkSetup works correctly.
From the test you describe it could be that:

your VM is using a NAT-ed network connection (essentially one-way traffic)
you don't have a working DNS for all involved hosts
