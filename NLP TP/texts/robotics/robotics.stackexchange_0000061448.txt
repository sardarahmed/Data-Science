please post the error. did you forgot source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash ?

No i did not forget. It said that the file /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash doesn't exist

A:

you need to create your catkin workspaces (be sure that you are in regular user not the root user; if not type exit) :
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ catkin_init_workspace
$ catkin_make
$ source devel/setup.bash

It says that catkin_init_workspace command not found
Comment by ROSkinect on 2014-08-04:
probably you create the catkin as root user !
Comment by Moda on 2014-08-04:
So what should i do?
Comment by ROSkinect on 2014-08-04:
type "exit" if you are root user and then try to create your workspaces (it will be as regular user)

But is there a link with the fact that in my folder /opt/ros/hydro there is no file setup.bash?
Comment by ROSkinect on 2014-08-04:
so you didn't re install ROS correctly, try this echo "source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc  and    source ~/.bashrc then source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash

It doesn't work!
when i launch   echo "source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc it says that the file opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash doen't exist

so you should re install it: http://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Installation/Ubuntu .....follow all the instruction in this link and then move to this 4.Create a ROS Workspace : http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment    ....and then tell me if it works or not
