The maintainer is fairly lazy, but he did put some documentation on the wiki

Thanks for the reply. Yeah I had seen that before. The problem is if I pass the laserscan data to the subscribed topic I am not getting any data out from the published topics. No data. I would like to know how to initialize the package. How to visualize the output data in rviz.

Are you echoing the PositionMeasurement topics and visualizing the markers?

Yeah I am echoing the PositionMeasurement topic and Visualizing the markers. But I find no data coming out from it. By the way I forgot to mention my version of ROS. I am using ROS-Indigo and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Using Freenect to interface kinect and depth-to-laserscan to feed the leg detector input.

Did you just try the provided launch-file trained_leg_detector.yaml? Worked for me with openni2_launch.
Comment by srinimd2005 on 2016-06-07:
But openni2_launch is not working for me. It always says no camera detected for me. And yeah I am using the given launch file.

Are all of the topics connected in the rqt_graph?

At last I got it to work. I think it is the missing library for opencv. by the way now its running but my rviz keeps on crashing if i subscribe to camera topic.
