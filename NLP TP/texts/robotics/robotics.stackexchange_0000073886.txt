Q:

What is the correct way to commit clean a workspace before commiting?

Hi,
I work with svn and git and instead of committing my whole catkin workspace with built binaries etc, what is the best way to clean the worskpace before committing it. So that when someone else checks it out they just source devel/setup.bash and catkin_make?
Thx
EDIT: So far just not including the "build" file seems to do the trick - is this the best way?

A:

You shouldn't do it like this at all.
You should just commit the packages in the src folder.
Checking out a workspace including devel will not work, as the setup.sh (which is sourced by setup.bash) contains the global path to the workspace (i.e. /home//...).
Just explain how to set up the workspace properly...
