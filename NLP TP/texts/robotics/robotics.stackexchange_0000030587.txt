Q:

Is there a rosmake clean?

I know about rosmake --pre-clean.  But what if you just want to clean your package and not build it?  There doesn't seem to be a "don't build" flag in rosmake.
When I have a new package that I want to add to my svn repository, I develop it until it is working, then remove the bin, build, and other computer generated files, then do an svn add on the package.  I typically remove all these directories by hand...

A:

You can just do roscd your_package_name && make clean to clean out all the generated files from just that package. I typically use rosmake only when building new package the first time to make sure all dependencies are built or when dependencies change. After the initial rosmake, plain make command is much faster and only builds the package I am currently developing.

Thanks for the tip.  It still would be nice to have this functionality built into rosmake.  That would allow you to clean a whole stack or all dependent packages, etc.  And you wouldn't have to be inside that package dir either.
