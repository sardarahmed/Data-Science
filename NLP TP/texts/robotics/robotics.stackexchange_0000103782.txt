Q:

Spin not taking blackboard value instead it always taking 0

In ros2 behavior server Spin Action is not accepting spin_dist as a blackboard variable, the variable will be an Output port of another behavior tree node. Check the code below,
<MyNode input="something" output="${angle_to_rotate}"/>
<Spin spin_dist="${angle_to_rotate}" server_name="spin" />

Here Spin Node is getting initialized with 0 as spin_dist at once, not taking input from blackboard variable while ticking the Node at Run Time.

A:

The Answer is, Spin is getting input from blackboard at the time of initialization only, to make Spin to get input on Running we need to update the on_tick function of Spin Action.
  void SpinAction::on_tick()
  {
    double dist;
    getInput("spin_dist", dist);
    RCLCPP_WARN(node_->get_logger(), "Angle from spin action %.2f", dist);
    double time_allowance;
    getInput("time_allowance", time_allowance);
    goal_.target_yaw = dist;
    goal_.time_allowance = rclcpp::Duration::from_seconds(time_allowance);
    getInput("is_recovery", is_recovery_);
    if (is_recovery_)
    {
      increment_recovery_count();
    }
  }
