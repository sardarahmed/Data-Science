Q:

What happens to service client when service server crashes?

If I create a service server node and then, for whatever reason, the node crashes, what happens to all of the clients which were connected to the server?
If the server node respawns at some point, can the clients continue to use the service server automatically?

A:

If the service client is non-persistent (the default), the node implementing the server can change (eg. creash, respawn), and clients will properly reconnect when the next request is made. If the client is persistent, then you need to negotiate reconnections yourself.
More info for roscpp and rospy, respectively, can be found here:

You mean "persistent", not "non-persistent" in the second statement, right?

I believe he does

Thanks for catching the typo. Fixed now.
