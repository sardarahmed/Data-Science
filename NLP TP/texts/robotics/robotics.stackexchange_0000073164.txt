Q:

is neither a launch file in package

I'm trying to run the Leddar ROS package using "roslaunch leddar leddar.launch serial:=serial frame:=frame_id fov:=fov range:=range" but it shows me that "[leddar.launch] is neither a launch file in package [leddar] nor is [leddar] a launch file name"
and I had try to put in the actual serial port number to run it : "roslaunch leddar leddar.launch serial:=ttyS0 frame:=frame_id fov:=fov range:=range " but it still shows me the same error.
got anyone face the same problem before and how to solve it?
*the ROS package i was git clone from github. https://github.com/mcgill-robotics/ros-leddar
*leddar@leddar-desktop:~$ dmesg | grep tty
[    0.000000] console [tty0] enabled
[    0.499748] serial8250: ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4, base_baud = 115200) is a 16550A

Have you built and sourced the catkin workspace where you have the leddar package?
Comment by Zero on 2016-04-03:
Yes! I had built everything successfully but until to the running step shows this error.

A:

It looks like either you haven't built the package, or you haven't sourced your catkin workspace since building the package.
You can confirm that the package is correctly built and sourced by running rospack find leddar.

you are right, I just try to find the leddar package by running rospack find leddar  it shows that not found. So what can I do to source the package?
Comment by ahendrix on 2016-04-03:
After you've built your workspace with catkin_make, source it by running source devel/setup.bash

it shows me a new error said that failed to connect to serial with code: -1
Comment by Zero on 2016-04-04:
I cannot use the github's running instruction to run the package it will shows me failed to connect to serial with code: -1
but I can use rosrun -v leddar leddar.launch to run the package.  when I open the rviz there have problem said that For fram[leddar]:Fixed Frame [map] does not exist

It sounds like you have resolved the original issue with being unable to find the launch file. You should probably open a new question about being unable to connect to the serial port. (these are very different topics)

I'm having a similar issue. How do we run source devel/setup.bash? I mean, where is that file. That's a relative path, so it is not clear what folder to be in.
I think I have things installed, but I get the error regardless:
vagrant@ubuntu-bionic:~$ apt list ros-melodic-rosbridge-*
Listing... Done
ros-melodic-rosbridge-library/bionic ...
ros-melodic-rosbridge-msgs/bionic ...
ros-melodic-rosbridge-server/bionic ...
ros-melodic-rosbridge-suite/bionic ...

vagrant@ubuntu-bionic:~$ rosdep db | grep rosbridge
rosbridge_suite -> ros-melodic-rosbridge-suite
rosbridge_server -> ros-melodic-rosbridge-server
rosbridge_msgs -> ros-melodic-rosbridge-msgs
rosbridge_library -> ros-melodic-rosbridge-library

vagrant@ubuntu-bionic:~$ roslaunch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket.launch
RLException: [rosbridge_websocket.launch] is neither a launch file in package....

I searched the system, and I do not see any devel/setup.sh file anywhere:
vagrant@ubuntu-bionic:~$ locate ros | grep setup.sh
/opt/ros/melodic/local_setup.sh
/opt/ros/melodic/setup.sh
/opt/ros/melodic/share/catkin/cmake/templates/local_setup.sh.in
/opt/ros/melodic/share/catkin/cmake/templates/setup.sh.in

vagrant@ubuntu-bionic:~$ ls ~/catkin_ws
ls: cannot access '/home/vagrant/catkin_ws': No such file or directory

I installed everything with apt-get.

Too late to delete my previous questions. I decided to ask a new question instead:
