Q:

ROS2 requires colcon build for any changes in python script?

I have been using ROS-melodic so far and my python package runs as I changed in the code without any catkin make however I just realized ROS2 is not working like this.
Every time I change the code, it requires colcon build to reveal its modification. Why this is needed?
Is this is intended feature or I am doing it wrong?
FYI, I am using ROS2 foxy on ubuntu 20.04 laptop. Installed ros and workspace as described in the manual.

A:

You don't need to execute colcon build every time you change your python code if you include the option --symlink-install. So use
colcon build --symlink-install

Best regards
