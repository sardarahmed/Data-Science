Q:

Using the "Player" package

Hi,
I am trying to use the "Player" package with a package that I am working on, but I can't seem to find any documentation telling me how to use that package.
Right now, I have "player" listed as a dependency in my manifest.xml file of the package I'm writing, and that's it. Running "cmake ." in the directory doesn't give any errors. Running "make" tells me that it's not finding any Player packages.
Is there something I'm missing in CMakeLists.txt?
Thanks!

A:

I got Player and ROS to integrate without the Player package, with ROS Diamondback and Player 3.0.2.
Instructions are here: http://brice-rebsamen.blogspot.com/2011/05/first-exercise-with-ros-node-to.html
The key is to edit the CMakeLists.txt file so that ROS finds all of the Player libraries that are installed during compilation.
