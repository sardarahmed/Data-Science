Q:

How to speed up robotic arm?

I need  my robotic arm to ring a desk bell. I one on the maplins site  usb robotic arm.
It does seem very slow.  What can I hack on it to boost the downwards and upwards speed. I need it hit the bell tip/platform quickly once or twice.

This is purely a LOL project for work. Ever time we get an order we want the arm to ring the bell. :)

-EDIT
This is the gearbox assembly - And it much much to slow - What can i change in here to speed up one gearbox by at least 4 times?
The grabber gearbox is different though. The gear marker P7 is white and seems to move the grabbers at a faster speed.

A:

You might be able to speed up the arm's movement in a purely mechanical way -- non-invasively.
For example, you could extend the arm and use the rotation of the base to ring the bell.  Or, you could coordinate the movements of all the joints to make the gripper pass the bell at a maximum speed.
Another way to do it could be to have the gripper pick up a long rod and use that to ring the bell.
