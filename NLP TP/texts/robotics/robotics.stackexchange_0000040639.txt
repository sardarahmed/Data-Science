Q:

Brushless DC servo Motor

Hello
I am very very very new to ROS so i apologize if this is a dumb question.
I have several 48 Volt DC brushless servo motors for a large scale robotics project.
They take in 8 bit ascii command from an rs 232.
I have done some searching, but i was curious if anyone has seen any stack in ROS that would handle some input output on rs232 so i could read and write some commands to my motors. i.e read some joystick code in and output certain ascii commands based on joystick reads. Generic Joystick values coming from say the ubuntu joystick library
The motors have a proprietary program from the manufacture but it is terrible. We are using a linux system for the vehicle and i was curious if ROS has some solutions for us. As i said i apologize if this is not a correct post.
Thanks

A:

I think that William Woodall has written a pretty good serial library that can be used with ROS.  It is available as a unary stack on Github.
This library just handles the basic serial transactions, which you can then wrap in your own ROS node.
There is an example of interfacing with an AX2550 motor controller as part of the Auburn-Automow Github account, if you are looking for a good reference for using the library.
