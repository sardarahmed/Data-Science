Q:

time synchronizer for many topics ros

Hi all,
I have four different topics. I'm able to use timesynchronizer for two topics.
My question is can I use it for four topics at the same time?

A:

Yes, you can. In case you haven't seen them, a wiki for time sync is at http://wiki.ros.org/message_filters and a previous question with example is at http://answers.ros.org/question/60903/timesynchronizer-callback-problem/.
