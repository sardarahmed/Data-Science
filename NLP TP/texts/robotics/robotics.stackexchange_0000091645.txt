Q:

Running the Drop node from a launch file

I want to run the drop node from topic_tools package with others nodes in a launch file, how can i do this?
i saw this example:
<node name="listener1" pkg="rospy_tutorials" type="listener.py" args="--test" respawn="true" />

but i don't know what 'name' and 'type' should be.
thanks

A:

This is almost a duplicate of #q40304, but that is with throttle instead of drop.
The idea is similar though:
<launch>
  <node name="foo_dropper" type="drop" pkg="topic_tools" args="<intopic> <X> <Y> [outtopic]" />
</launch>

Where you'd replace <intopic> <X> <Y> [outtopic] with the appropriate values of course.
Refer to the wiki page for more information on the usage and command line arguments of drop.
