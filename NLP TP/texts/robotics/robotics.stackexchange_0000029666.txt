Q:

Where to get geometry 1.4.0?

Hi there,
I tried to clone geometry-experimental:
"hg clone https://ros-geometry-experimental.googlecode.com/hg/ geom"
and then switch to "geometry-1.4.0" branch:
"hg checkout geometry-1.4.0"
but it seems it does not exist.
I'd need eigen from that version which seems to be out of the unstable branch as well.

A:

Problem solved - it turned out I was cloning the wrong repository.
It shall be https://ros-geometry.googlecode.com/hg (and not experimental).
