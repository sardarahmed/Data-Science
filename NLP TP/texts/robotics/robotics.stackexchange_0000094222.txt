Q:

catkin_make: Could NOT find SDL

When I try to use catkin_make, it fails at map_server.
I got the following message
CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake-3.10/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:137 (message):
  Could NOT find SDL (missing: SDL_LIBRARY SDL_INCLUDE_DIR)
Call Stack (most recent call first):

  navigation/map_server/CMakeLists.txt:12 (find_package)

What do I do to solve this problem

A:

sudo apt-get install libsdl-image1.2-dev and
sudo apt-get install libsdl-dev
These solve the issue.

Also for melodic, you can use this to install other dependencies too. Enter your practice_ws directory and run this command:
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro melodic -y

Also, about your own packages, do not forget to add your dependencies to your CMakeLists.txt and package.xml. I've seen lots of packages which they don't have all dependencies listed. rosdep looks up for dependencies from your definitions in the package. Even if you are able to build your workspace, you might face with a runtime error when a dependent package isn't installed.
