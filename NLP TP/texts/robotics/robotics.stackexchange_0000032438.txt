Q:

Problems running ppl_detection in astar-ros-pkg

Hi,
I am trying to use the ppl_detection in the astar-ros-pkg:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/ppl_detection
As soon as I run the node, it exits and throws me a segmentation fault.
the error displayed is given below:
[rviz-7] process has died [pid 4034, exit code -11].
