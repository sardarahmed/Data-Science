Q:

ROS in VMWare, No information shown in rviz

I installed  ROS on a VMWare Ubuntu image on a MAC.
I am using a kinect camera, when I run roslaunch openni_camera openni_kinect.launch,
it is good. but there is nothing shows in rviz, no message could be received.
When I use a rosbag file, it is good. Could you help me out?

Looks to me like rviz is not the problem here.  Question states "When I use a rosbag file, it is good."  Doesn't it sound more like a problem with  openni?

A:

As others have reported lately, rviz does not usually work well in a
virtual machine. It seems to need access to real 3D graphics hardware
for adequate performance.
The usual workaround is installing Ubuntu in a separate partition with
dual boot.
