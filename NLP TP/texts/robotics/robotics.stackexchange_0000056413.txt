Please provide more details to your problem.

A:

roslib.load_manifest() reads the package manifest and sets up the python library path based on the package dependencies. It's required for older rosbuild-based packages, but is no longer needed on catkin.
The rosbuild version of the Python Publisher and Subscriber Tutorial explains it in more detail.
