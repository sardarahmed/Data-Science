Q:

Axis to pixel conversion

Hi all,
I have developed a GUI in Qt4.x that shows the 2d map of environment which is being published by "gmapping" node. Now i want to add in that gui the position of robot which i think can be taken from /odom but when i try to draw it in my gui it shows very little change in pixels. My question is that how gmapping converts the axis coordinates to pixel information in /map.
i am using electric on ubuntu 10.04 with Qt4.x
Thanks in advance.
Regards

A:

MapMetaData, published by gmapping (also included in the OccupancyGrid message), should have everything you need. Specifically, the map resolution in meters/cell, and the map origin.
