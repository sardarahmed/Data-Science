Publish rate higher than subscriber rate

If the publisher rate is set higher than the subscriber rate, will the message rate of the publisher slow down to match the subscriber rate?

A:

No, it won't. You'll just end up dropping messages at the subscriber.
If you write another subscriber which runs at a faster rate, it'll receive most/all messages (depending on ROS1/ROS2, and QoS settings)
