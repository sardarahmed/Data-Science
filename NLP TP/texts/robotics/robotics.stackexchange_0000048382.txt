Q:

Errors installing rosdep

I am following the rosdep installation/setup instructions as given on the ROS website for OSX/Homebrew, and having run step 2.1.2 (Resolving Dependencies) I get the following errors, in a process that otherwise appears to succeed:

They all seem to concern 'tf2', whatever that is.
Does anyone have an idea what's going here? I'm installing on OS X 10.8.2, with a brew version of Python, in case it's relevant.

Instructions at <www.ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/OSX/Homebrew/Source>, FYI. It seems I can actually post links in comments.

And here are the errors: https://gist.github.com/alexreg/4965426
Comment by Noldorin on 2013-02-16:
@kalectro: What does "made it into the generator" mean? Anyway the error still occurs. I'd like to figure out what's going on, although I will take your rm suggestion for now, thanks.
Comment by kalectro on 2013-02-16:
Step 2.1.1 will download all sources produced by a generator. If you want to know which source are being produced, open the link in a browser http://packages.ros.org/web/rosinstall/generate/raw/groovy/desktop
Did the rm suggestion work or not?
Comment by Noldorin on 2013-02-16:
I'm still not sure what a "generator" (maybe it's like a distribution type) is but alright, cheers! Trying to install with your rm suggestion now. The next step is constantly failing each time I retry, because it reports a certain package is missing usually.
Comment by Noldorin on 2013-02-17:
@kalectro: Do you think we could debug this issue anyway? I'm quite curious why it's not working.
Comment by Noldorin on 2013-02-18:
@kalectro: So I've actually noticed other errors in the log now, shortly before the ones I posted previously. I've updated the Gist so you can see -- basically the problem is that bad assumptions are being made about the directory structure of the tarballs for some of the tf2 stuff.

A:

It looks like tf2 made it into the generator, that is new. I do not know why you were not able to pull it but you can safely remove it from your src folder because you will most likely not use it.
rm -rf src/tf2*

Maybe it will also work if you just try again, the last commit was 8 hours ago.
