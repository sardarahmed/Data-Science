Q:

Using rosjava, I can subscribe but not publish to rostopics on separate machines

Pretty simple, as the name implies, I can't publish messages from rosjava over the network.
The Java side of things is a GUI that subscribes to a few topics (a video stream and some Float64's) with the ability to send input-based commands by publishing to topics. The rosjava node works as expected when run locally to the topics; I can both publish and subscribe.  But when the rosjava node is run from a machine separate to the one running the topics that I wish to publish to, it doesn't work.  The publishers seem to get registered correctly based on the output going to my console, and the subscribers work as I receive both video and data, but when I trigger an input that would attempt to publish a command there is no effect on the other end.

A:

It turns out that it was an issue with our network and hostname resolution.  Setting ROS_IP and ROS_HOSTNAME on both ends fixed the problem.
