Q:

Are meshes in a urdf limited to a number of faces?

Are meshes like .stls and .daes limited in the number of faces so that a urdf will be loaded properly in rviz?

A:

Theoretically: no.
Practically: yes.
There is no hard-coded limit to the size of meshes in RViz -- or more precisely: in Assimp, which is what RViz uses to load meshes.
Practically though, loading times will increase and framerates will start to drop for larger meshes, but it's hard to put an exact number of faces on that, as it's largely hardware dependent.
Perhaps also important: loading a urdf is (almost) separate from loading the meshes. Many consumers of .urdfs will load the XML, but will not bother with loading the meshes.

PS: also be aware that RViz is not the only consumer of URDFs. And it's also not special.
Consumers such as MoveIt for instance load the same data, and there collision checking performance is highly dependent on the number of faces in a mesh (as without capsules, collision checking will be face-based).
