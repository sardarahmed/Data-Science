Q:

Indigo Installation, Environment setup

BH
**Hello,
I have tried ,a couple of times, to install the indigo desktop full package library but when I reached to the Environment setup section and typed the source ~/.bashrc command, the response was that there is no setup.bash file. I searched the installation directories and saw that indeed no such file exists. It seems as if the installation completed without any failure, as I haven't got any errors and the packages installed altogether weigh 135MB.
Could someone suggest what to do? ****

A:

The file /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash is part of the package ros-indigo-catkin, make sure it is installed. That package is one of the most basic ones in ros, so I suppose something went wrong during installation and I advice you to purge ros (like mentioned in the answer before) and re-install ros.
