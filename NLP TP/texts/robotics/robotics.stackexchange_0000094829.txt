Q:

Undefined parameters [kinematics_file] while creating urdf

I'm following this tutorial on how to create a new URDF from an UR5 robot and a custom gripper.
https://gramaziokohler.github.io/compas_fab/latest/examples/03_backends_ros/07_ros_create_urdf_ur5_with_measurement_tool.html
but when i try to create the urdf using this command:
rosrun xacro xacro --inorder -o ur5_with_measurement_tool.urdf ur5_with_measurement_tool.xacro

i get this message:
Undefined parameters [kinematics_file]

i see that this parameter is new in the repo that i'm using....
https://github.com/fmauch/universal_robot
my question is... is it obligatory to have this repo in order to work with ur-robot-driver?
or should i move to the original universal-robot package and try it again?
Thank you in advance.
ROS Version: melodic

A:

No, it isn't.
If you don't use it though, you'll end up with the default URDF, which means the kinematic calibration of your robot will not be taken into account with FK/IK queries.

i see that this parameter is new in the repo that i'm using....

exactly.
So in order for this to work, you should/could provide that parameter and then you'd be able to follow the tutorial you linked.

Thank you for your answer, i moved to the original universal-robot package, and created a new URDF without any problem, but i'm facing a new issue..
When i try to see the urdf in rviz
$roslaunch ur5_with_measurement_tool display.launch

I get this error
$Could not find the GUI, install the 'joint_state_publisher_gui' package

Which package would provide me this?
I installed ros melodic from apt

They have very little visibility. Post a new question.
