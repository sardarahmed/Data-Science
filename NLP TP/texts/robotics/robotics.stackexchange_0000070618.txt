Q:

Breakpoints for python debugging with roslaunch?

Hi
Coming from a matlab background, Im very found of using breakpoints for debugging...
I know this can be done for python, but it doesn't seem to work when launching my node with roslaunch.
If I use rosrun (or roslaunch with screen output) my node is flooded with sensor data, which overwrites anything I would write as part of my breakpoint debugging.
Does anyone have any suggestions?

Hi. I have the same question. Did you find the solution about how to debug rospy code? I will appreciate your reply.

A:

You should be able to use a launch-prefix to get your python process into pdb

Hi, I read your link which is helpful to debug ros's code. But the documentation you supplied is about roscpp, is there any debugging tools that is for rospy?
