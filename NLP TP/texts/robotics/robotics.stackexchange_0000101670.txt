Q:

[Talos] How to play motion with the talos in gazebo

Hello guys,
I am using ros melodic.
whole package builds successfully with the procedure on the ros tutorial.
I tried to launch the talos_gazebo.launch, it spawns the robot successfully and robot is standing steadily at origin.
But I am getting following errors, (for detailed terminal output please refer output.log file or output pastebin)
Error parsing urdf. (which I think is not a major issue)
[ERROR] [1652021719.240644221]: Joint 'leg_right_flex_1_joint' marked as passive is not known to the URDF. Ignoring.

Error loading controllers
It fails to load the controllers from the talos_moveit_config/config/controllers_full.yaml. such as left_arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory, right_arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory etc. I do not see other error in the output of move_group.launch.
[ERROR] [1652021876.017916518, 18.457000000]: Action client not connected: left_arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory

[ WARN] [1652021973.351357007, 29.472000000]: Waiting for right_arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory to come up

Also when I tried to play some motion using /play_motion/goal msg, it gives following error.
[ERROR] [1652023226.329640663, 194.157000000]: No controller was found for joint 'torso_1_joint'

[ERROR] [1652023283.334157470, 200.350000000]: Motion 'test_head' could not be played.

Any help would be appreciated.
Also if you have any tutorial on how to get started with the talos robot or you have some path to progress quickly with talos robot simulation please let me know.
Thank you in advance!

Hello,
Regarding your question. The error that you see about flex joints being passive and not being in the URDF don't worry about it, those are a particular set of joints available with a certain experimental parameter to the URDF. Don't worry about it, it shouldn't affect your workflow.
Regarding your issue with MoveIt, TALOS Simulation starts without any controllers. You need to started the position controllers using

roslaunch talos_controller_configuration position_controllers.launch

This should start the position controllers on the robot and make those controllers available for MoveIt. You should now be good to use play_motion alongside.
Hope this helps.

Yes it worked. Thank you very much for the quick responses!
Any suggestions/advise on how to make it walk.
Thanks again.

Hello,
I don't think the walking controllers are public. You can write you own controller or use any existing controllers and try to interface it to make it walk.

Yes I will try it out. But really thank you for all your help!
