Q:

rosserial compile error: missing rosserial_msgs/TopicInfo.h

Hi, I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 with ros indigo.
I've dowloaded the rosserial source from git
git clone https://github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial
When I try to compile in catkin_ws I get the message that rosserial_msgs/TopicInfo.h is missing (see below).
Now I'm wondering where this file is. It's not in the repository.
Where can I get it?

I assume. I used git clone https://github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial in catkin_ws/src

Issue disapear due to fix https://github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial/issues/133

A:

It looks like this is a bug in rosserial_server; the build file is missing a dependency between the header generation and the compile step which is causing them to be run out of order.
This sort of thing will sometimes go away if you run it enough, but you should really file a bug on the rosserial issue tracker about it.
