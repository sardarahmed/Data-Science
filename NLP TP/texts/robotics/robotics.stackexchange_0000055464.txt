Q:

dynamic reconfigure with a variable-length list of parameters

Hi all,
I just went over the tutorials of dynamic_reconfigure. It says that for the type of a parameter the following options are available:
type - defines the type of value stored, and can be any of int_t, double_t, str_t, or bool_t 

Now, I'd like to have a dynamic parameter which is a list of doubles. I'd like to further dynamically reconfigure the length of that list. Is this possible?
The tutorial says no and I found no related answer/question here. Still, I think this to be a valuable feature and am wondering whether somebody else already thought about it.
Cheers,
Georg.

Hi! I was wondering the same thing and posted this question:

I don't think it's possible. I opted for a service with a custom message type.

Thanks for your suggestion. I also think this is not possible. So, I'm closing this question. :)
