Q:

Error compiling hector exploration node. Could not find hector_map_tools

Hello.
I'm new to ROS. I want to use hector exploration planner in my project which consists on a robot which must explore as many rooms as possible in a house. The robot doesn't have a map of the house. As I'm still learning the ropes, I want to use a package to do autonomous exploration and I found hector exploration.
I have downloaded https://github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/hector_navigation (branch catkin) unzip it in /home/myName/catkin_ws/src/hector_navigation-catkin/
Then I cd to /home/myName/catkin_ws and I executed catkin_make but it doesn't work and I don't know how to fixed. I already had other compilation problems but I could fix them. Now I have the following error:
Could not find a package configuration file provided by "hector_map_tools" with any of the following names:
hector_map_toolsConfig.cmake
hector_map_tools-config.cmake
Add the installation prefix of "hector_map_tools" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
set "hector_map_tools_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
files.  If "hector_map_tools" provides a separate development package or
SDK, be sure it has been installed.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
hector_navigation-catkin/hector_elevation_visualization/CMakeLists.txt:7 (find_package)
-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
Can somebody help me?
Thank you!

A:

hector_map_tools is part of hector_slam. You should be able to satisfy this dependency by installing it from .debs:
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-hector-slam

Alternatively, you could add https://github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/hector_slam.git ti your workspace and compile it from source.
