Q:

Clarification on ROS's port usage

According to this page: http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/NetworkSetup, for nodes on two computers to communicate, all ports must be open.

Doesn't this raise security concerns?
Is it really all ports?  Isn't it only ports above 1024 or perhaps a smaller subset?

A:

ROS clients typically bind to port 0.  This will generally return socket port numbers > 1024.  On a default Ubuntu installation, for example, you need superuser to bind <= 1024.
