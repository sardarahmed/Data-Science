Q:

How to correctly configure MoveIt! for each workspace?

I'm currently learning MoveIt and was trying to understand how to setup up my workspaces. I was wondering if MoveIt is installed system-wide or do I have to include it in every workspace I build?
I installed MoveIt using the getting started tutorial: https://ros-planning.github.io/moveit_tutorials/doc/getting_started/getting_started.html
I created a workspace manually (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12RJro5bo3i2zhSXONtlAkdYqLYCvwM11?usp=sharing), added robot URDFs from different sources, and tried to create configuration files using MoveIt but was unsuccessful. I was only able to load the rrbot urdf provided in the tutorials and for that too I could not set the default joint poses in the setup assistant.
This is the error I get when I try to adjust poses for the rrbot -
![Unable to set pose for rrbot](https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/ros/download.ros.org/downloads/se_migration/ros/16231640911731912.png)

This is the error I get when I try to include urdfs for other robots (BMDA3 Robot from https://github.com/ros-industrial/motoman_experimental) (nothing happens when I try to click 'Show Default Pose', 'MoveIt', 'Edit Selected' or 'Add Pose') - 

![Error while loading Motoman BMDA3 URDF file](https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/ros/download.ros.org/downloads/se_migration/ros/16231641115259853.png)

My setup is Ubuntu 20.04 with ROS Noetic.
Any help/advice/suggestion is greatly appreciated!
The error log associated with trying to seutp BMDA3 robot is as follows -

Hello @Speedracer1702,
I have given you enough karma, now you can post images. Can you please! reupload images by pressing edit button below your question.
Comment by Speedracer1702 on 2021-06-08:
@Ranjit, thank you! I have included the images but it would not allow me to attach the error log (I think it only accepts image files, even for attachments). The google drive link should work however, let me know if there are any issues with that.
Comment by Ranjit Kathiriya on 2021-06-08:
For that, you have to copy your text and directly add it over here and make the formate to code by pressing the button near to the image.
Comment by Speedracer1702 on 2021-06-08:
I thought about doing that but the log is really long (387 lines).
Comment by Ranjit Kathiriya on 2021-06-08:
It's okay you can post it.

A:

The tutorial has you install MoveIt from source. That means, it is local to that workspace. When you source that workspace (source /../../my_workspace/devel/setup.bash), the MoveIt version in there takes precedence over anything else. It should be able to locate any debians you have installed but it won't be aware of packages in other workspaces. (Unless you are using overlayed workspaces, which seems unlikely.)
You can also install the MoveIt debians (sudo apt install ros-melodic-moveit*). If you do not have MoveIt cloned into your current workspace, then the debian version will be used.
I don't know what to say about the "package not found" errors except it seems like your workspace is not sourced correctly. Did you build this Motoman stuff from source or install a debian with sudo apt ...?

I downloaded the motoman robot files from their git repo and then built my workspace. I believe I skipped sourcing the workspace (I feel stupid SMH). Everything works now! Thanks for pointing that out. Also, I installed the debian file and now it defaults to the system-wide installation folder (/opt/ros/noetic/share/moveit).
