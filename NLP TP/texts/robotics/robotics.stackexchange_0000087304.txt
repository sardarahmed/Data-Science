Q:

Laser reading not between range_min and range_max!

Hi,
i'm trying to use nav2d package on turtlebot3 for autonomous exploration(third tutorial). When i launch it, everything seems to work, except for the fact that rqt_console shows the warning "Laser reading not between range_min and range_max!".
Looking the messages published on /scan topic it says range max is 3.5 meters and actually some reading goes beyond this distance. The point is: how can i modify that value? Because i've tried modifying in Sensor.cpp the Custom laser range, but that doesn't work and also on yaml files i don't find any parameter referring to my laser range.
Thanks for help!!

A:

According the specification of the laser scan message any depth measurements outside of the min-max range should be treated as erroneous and ignored.
As such I would assume these warnings can be safely ignored.

Thanks for your answer. That's what i've done in the end and  actually everything works. Just out of curiosity, is there any way to modify that or it's a way to prevent possible readings' inaccurancy beyond laser's range_max?
