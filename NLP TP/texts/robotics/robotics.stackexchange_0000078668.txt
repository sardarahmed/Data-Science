Q:

active/connected rostopics to terminal list or file

Is there a way to get the active or connected (i.e. excluding leaf topics) ROS topics as a list to the terminal or a text file? The topics can limited to only the active topics from rqt_graph but are there any methods the rostopic or rosnode (or combination of the two) commands can generate a list? Can rqt_graph save the active topics or log them?

A:

rostopic list -s

gives a list of subscribed, active topics. To save the list,
rostopic list -s > activeTopics.txt

Will save the list in your current directory. I don't see an easy way to do the same with nodes, though.

That works thanks. I always had assumed that the -s option was for all subscriptions regardless of connection state. I verified using rqt_graph that it's only the connected topics.
