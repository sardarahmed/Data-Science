Q:

[ROS2] Bt_navigator Node not recognized

Hi,
I recently decided to use the bt proposed by Nav2 from Humble, Navigate To Pose With Consistent Replanning And If Path Becomes Invalid.
When I start the bt the following error pops up.
[bt_navigator-1] [ERROR] [bt_navigator]: Exception when loading BT: Error at line 13: -> Node not recognized: PathExpiringTimer 
[bt_navigator-1] [ERROR] [bt_navigator]: Error loading XML file: config_nav2/bt_navigator.xml

This log regards PathExpirinTimer node but I obtain the same error aso for "GlobalUpdatedGoal" and "IsPathValid".
I suspect something related with  nav2_tree_nodes.xml but cannot manage the error.
I currently have installed release 1.1.5 from DEB, which should be the last one.
I am usgin ROS2 humble and ubuntu 22.04

Yes my bad, I am going to correct the question. Anyway I realized the problem. Just forgot to add inside bt_navigator params plugin_lib_names those specific nodes.
Thanks for answearing
