Q:

Electric shadow-hand error with haptic glove

Hi.
i create a pkg for an haptic glove few months ago, on ros fuerte version and was working very nice with shadow robot (shadow_hand).  for some reasons i had to install ROS electric version. i installed also the shadow- robot for electric but it don't works.
i think and suppose is for the dependencies that aren't on ros electric like sr_teleop, now the problem is , how to install sr_teleop on ros electric. cause an overlay was very problematic too.

A:

Can you consider upgrading to Fuerte? Our latest stacks are released in fuerte (sr-teleop etc...). You can install them by simply running:
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-shadow-robot ros-fuerte-sr-visualization ros-fuerte-sr-teleop

If you really want to install them on electric, see my answer to this thread.

i was working on fuerte, and don't have problems with shadow, but i had it with gazebo, cause i need the collision too, and gazebo's fuerte version  don't work.
Comment by Ugo on 2013-02-05:
right, then I'd suggest to go with the source install. Is this working for you?
Comment by monidiaz on 2013-02-05:
the source install for gazebo? i tried many times but that failed, many erros.
Comment by Ugo on 2013-02-05:
No, the source install for our code under electric. Never managed to get gazebo working from sources either... :S
Comment by monidiaz on 2013-02-05:
mm no, i don't know what is the code source for shadow. and why you say dont get gazebo from sources?  well i get some errors, so i install ubuntu one more time, with ros electric now and these is my 4th time intented get working gazebo with collision+shadow-robot(sr_hand) + haptic glove. :'(

I think there's a misunderstanding :S I'm pointing you to another thread where I give a rosinstall file which can be used to install our code from sources under ROS electric. Is the problem that you don't know how to use the rosinstall file?
Comment by monidiaz on 2013-02-05:
ok that sounds better, and you're right really i don't know how to use rosinstall file . thnks
