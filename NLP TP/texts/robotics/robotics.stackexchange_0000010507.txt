Q:

Do DH parameters change for a scaled robot 3d model?

I have the actual DH parameters of a robot:
d1 = 0.4865 m
d2 = 0.600 m
d3 = 0.065 m
a1 = 0.150 m
a2 = 0.475 m

all other di's and ai's are zero.
Can I use these for an inverse kinematics analytic closed form computation or should I measure the virtual distances in the 3d environment?
I am actually asking if the theta angles that will be yeld after the computations are dependent on the scale of those distances.
EDIT: Scale factor is unknown

A:

You will need to provide target coordinates (x,y,z, etc) to your inverse kinematics equations. As long as they have the same scale as your DH parameters, the joint angles calculated will be the same. But since you don't know the scale factor, you don't know how to scale your inputs.
