Q:

Collision detection on table

Hello,
I build on solidwork a simple model of table, then I convert it onto dae to insert into gazebo.
I want to known if I can add this dae file directly on gazebo or should I add my table piece by piece to be able to make my robot going through without strange colision?

A:

You can certainly use a .dae file as a collision model in Gazebo. A very simple model.sdf file for a static table could look like this:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<sdf version="1.4">
  <model name="my_mesh">
    <pose>0 0 0  0 0 0</pose>
    <static>true</static>
    <link name="body">
      <visual name="visual">
        <geometry>
          <mesh><uri>file://my_mesh.dae</uri></mesh>
        </geometry>
      </visual>
      <collision name="collision">
        <geometry>
          <mesh><uri>file://my_mesh.dae</uri></mesh>
        </geometry>
      </collision>
    </link>
  </model>
</sdf>

You can also model your table piece by piece if you really want, but I see no point in doing so. If you want your table to move when your robot bumps into it, you can set the static tag to false and add an inertial block using solidworks values or otherwise generated values.
I will also make you aware of the Solidworks to URDF exporter, which can be handy for more advanced models (though I wouldn't bother for simple rigid models like a table).
