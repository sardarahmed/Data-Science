Q:

Grab Single Frame From Gazebo Camera

I'm using Gazebo 2.2.3 along with ROS Indigo. I also have a robot with a mounted camera in Gazebo. I was wondering if there is a way to just grab a single frame from the robot's camera (not live feed) using ROS. It doesn't even have to display the image like with the image_view command.

A:

I believe there is no pre-made plugin that does exactly what you´re asking for. You basically have two practical options:

Write your own Gazebo plugin,
possibly based on a existing one like
gazebo_ros_camera.
This gives you most control over what
is actually done in Gazebo (short of
diving into Gazebo´s sources
themselves)
Create a ROS node that subscribes to (stream)
data from a existing camera plugin
and just forward data selectively.

The latter option certainly is the easier one to implement and would be preferred if you can live with a few wasted CPU cycles.

I understand. Now, I have an existing node that uses the gazebo/apply_joint_effort rosservice call to move my robot model. I'm assuming that it would be more practical if I just wrote a new node to stream camera data rather than trying to modify my current node to do so as well as moving the model?
