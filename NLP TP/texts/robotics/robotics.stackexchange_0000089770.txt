Did you try putting the value in double quotes?
Like this,
<arg name="foo" value="bar" /> 

as given in the link

I think the OP is asking how to put a dynamic parameter value into an argument not a literal value.
Comment by Tal on 2018-12-06:
I want to put the value of rosparm tal like $(param tal) into argument tal_arg.

A:

The solution you linked to involves making a simple python node which reads the desired parameter value and prints it to stdout. You can then use the value="{eval scriptname.py}" syntax to run that node and put the value it outputs into the argument.
Hope this helps

where i can put this python scrip?
There is other way besides the ways in the link?

Ideally it should be inside a catkin package in the src directory. If you don't already have a workspace with a package setup then I recommend having a look at the tutorials to set one up and create a simple node.

Warning: The mentioned solution DOES NOT work! I tried to implement a python script as recommended, but the "eval" command is not able to interprete it. A more thorough explanation is given here: https://answers.ros.org/question/361411/running-a-python-node-using-eval-in-roslaunch/. As far as I know, there is currently no way to get params into args. An extension to add the "command" attribute to the arg tag is mentioned here: https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/issues/723, but not yet implemented as of today.
