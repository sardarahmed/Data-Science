Q:

Publishing data from Rust to Ros

Hi, how can I publish data from rust to ROS running on two different computers.
I am trying to use the following library but it does not contain any example for my use case where I want to transfer my data to another computer where ROS will be running.

I think you wanted to copy & paste a link to this library/write its name, but it is not here. Please update your question.

A:

I figure out that It is essential to run rosbridge on the computer where you want to send data to. After installing rosbridge using the following command sudo apt-get install ros-<rosdistro>-rosbridge-server and launching using the command roslaunch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket.launch it was working perfectly. I would like to suggest to take care of the port number as rosbridge usually use 9090 and any different port number in the code could lead to error.
I am closing this issue as it has been solved. If the problem persists, please comment and the issue will be reopened if appropriate.
