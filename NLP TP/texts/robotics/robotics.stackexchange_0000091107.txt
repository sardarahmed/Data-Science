Q:

ROS ekf_localization

Hi,
Is there a way to weitgh/gain on input to the ekf_localization_node more than other?
In my case I have wheel odometry and odmetry from an ArUco marker mounted on my robot which is beeing tracked as an odom_msg.
From what I see the ArUco odometry is more accurate than my wheel odometry, how can I make the ekf use the ArUco more than the other?
Thanks in advance

are you talking about the ekf_localization_node of the robot_localization package?

Yes, sorry about that.

A:

Yes! The covariance matrix that your sensor includes to the input to robot_localization is used, unlike in the prior robot pose ekf. If you make the covariance values of the sensor you want to trust higher, then that will be effectively weighed more.

@jksilk to makre an answer as correct use the checkbox at the left of the answer instead of changing the title. I've done it for you in this case.
