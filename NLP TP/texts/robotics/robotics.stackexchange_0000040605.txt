Q:

Including a package and make eclipse-project

Hello everyone,
I'm having some troubles with make eclipse-project, I've developed a ros package and now I want to use it in other package, I add the dependency to the manifest.xml but when I run make eclipse-project it doesn't appear in the list of eclipse includes.
Am I missing some steps? I hope you can help me.
Thank you.

A:

I found the error, I forgot the export tag of the manifest I want to use, now works correctly.
