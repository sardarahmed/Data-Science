Q:

Bare, very slim ROS node running on DD-WRT router?

Hello everyone,
I am looking for information about having a ROS node running on a DD-WRT enabled router.
The node would be used to send status data back to the ROS main system about certain router parameters and thus doesn't need any fancy ROS features.
Basically I am looking for something that is doing the ROS communication management (XML-RPC management and TCP/IP channel allocation) stuff for me.
I know that I could do that on my own, but I am not that deep into c++ programming (I don't want to use python due to the overhead) and any hints would save precious for time :)
Thanks for any help/hints in advance.
J.B.

You may write a simple socket-based application, which will communicate with your host, and thus translate into ROS.

A:

As the author of rosbridge, my bias goes without saying. Still, it is meant for exactly your situation. Here's a quick example of sending a simple UInt8 status message from C: status.c. This simple client ignores any feedback from the server what-so-ever. My recommended approach would be for the WRT to open and close a fresh connection each status update. That way it doesn't have to handle long-standing connections. With this approach, the very first status update might be lost (because establishing a fresh topic can take longer than the publish request), but everything should work smoothly once the /wrtStatus (or whatever you use) is established.
