Q:

Unable to install gazebo 9.13

To be able to use the actors with collision plugin I need install Gazebo 9.13. To do so it seems like I have to use the following command, based on this other issue:
sudo apt-get install gazebo9=9.13.0-1*

This doesn't appear to work for me however, despite working for the other author. I also tried to write the following command, as suggested by another issue, but without any luck:
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gazebo9=9.13.0-1*

Error message:
ros@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install gazebo9=9.13.0-1*
[sudo] password for ros: 
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
E: Version '9.13.0-1*' for 'gazebo9' was not found

What do I need in order to properly install this version of Gazebo?

A:

You need to add the osrf repo to your computer. Then you'll get the latest stable release (which is 9.13.0 atm).

Thank you, this solved my problem. Had to use sudo apt upgrade before being able to run Gazebo again, but otherwise it worked perfectly.
