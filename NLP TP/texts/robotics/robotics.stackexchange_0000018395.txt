Q:

Esc calibration

I want to make a calibration setup for BLDC ESC in the simulink model. I'm using arduino mega (3,9,10,11 pins) and quatro 30Ax4 esc. Normally I can set it to it's max, min, and incrementally increase/decrease duty cycle with transmitter throttle signal by mapping (1000,2000,160,255) and there is no problem. But when I try to map it 0,255 it doesnot work (sounds every 2 seconds like a throttle signal is abnormal).
I need two suggestions;
1. why I cannot map the signal on the full range (0-255).
2. is it possible to make calibration by just sending the max and min values such as shown in the figure instead of using any mapping techniques?

A:

Missing a few information, so I will assume the following:
 - Using the instruction analogWrite() to send pulses to the ESC.
 - Not using the Mega pin 4 or 13.
 - your map() instruction is converting from your receiver pulse length to your analogWrite() function.
ESC require a pulse between 1000uS and 2000uS.
Therefore, analogWrite(160) is about a 1280uS pulse.
(as per analogWrite() reference note, the PWM frequency is 490Hz)
Sending a PWM lower than 125 will send an invalid pulse length.
Some ESC wont arm if the pulse length  is off by even a few uS, so it's good to calibrate them when you do a change in your map() function.
Can't help you for your Simulink model
