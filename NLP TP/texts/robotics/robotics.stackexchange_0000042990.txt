Q:

calculation technical

am looking the kinect calibration and depth calculation.
(http://www.ros.org/wiki/kinect_calibration/technical)
z = b*f / d
There is "4.1 Focal lengths".
IR focal length is 580 pixels.
Could you please tell me why camera focal length is used in terms of pixels
instead of in mm or in meteres ?

Sorry. I know that former question doesn't uploading. It is closed

I'd recommend editing the title to something a bit more relevant (focal length in pixels etc..)

A:

It does not matter whether the focal length is given in pixels or mm, as the relationship is determined by the sensor and image sizes. Go through the following link for more details: http://www.bobatkins.com/photography/technical/measuring_focal_length.html
In general, it is a good idea to have the focal length in pixels as the image size is generally known. Knowing the full intrinsic camera matrix allows for independence from the image size as well.
