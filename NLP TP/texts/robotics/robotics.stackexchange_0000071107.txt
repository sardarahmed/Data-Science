I want to make a mini mobile robot with a mini PC which can run ubuntu.
Is there any opensource hardware product?

A:

I think a convenient solution is using a Raspberry Pi 2 for your robot. ROS can now be installed using Ubuntu 14.04 for ARM (see Ubuntu install instructions and ROS Ubuntu Arm install instructions).
Using this approach, the amount of fiddling with toolchains, compilation etc. is fairly minimal. The system is very lightweight and small and can for instance be powered conveniently via a powerbank during experiments.

Thank you so much. Could you recommend a mini mobile robot platform?
I want to use Arduino Robot, but the product is end-of-life.

I'm not quite sure what you want to achieve, but you can get a "2WD arduino robot" chassis (google it) starting at about ~15 US$. You can also order a Arduino clone (~10 US$) and motor shield clone (~10 US$) from China. This is about the cheapest option that comes to mind :)

Thank you so much. I want SLAM and navigation using RP-Lidar. A good wheel encoder is a must, which will be used for localization(amcl) although mapping algorithms, such as hector_slam, do not need it.
