Q:

Can we disable line-wrapping on the 'badges' on the bottom of our profile?

At the bottom of my user page it shows the badges I have gotten. However, many of them have linebreaks and this makes them look bad. Like "Nice\nQuestion x\n4" (with \n showing where I currently see linebreaks). These should be given a CSS style="white-space: nowrap" or something.
Thanks :)

Actually, the 'tags' category as well, but it's not nearly as bad.

Please report this upstream at askbot.org

Done and done! "Thanks, fixed in 0.6.80 (well at least made look a bit better)."
