[gmapping_demo.launch] is neither a launch file in package [mrp2_navigation] nor is [mrp2_navigation] a launch file name

A:

Hi Marwa,
Did you try sourcing your workspace?
$ source ~/YOUR_WORKSPACE/devel/setup.bash

After that you could be able to roscd to mrp2_navigation package.
$ roscd mrp2_navigation/
