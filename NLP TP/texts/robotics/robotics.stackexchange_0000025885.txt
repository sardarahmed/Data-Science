Q:

MultiCameraSensor question

I am looking for a way to synchronize multiple cameras in gazebo. I came across MultiCameraSensor and believe this may be what I am looking for. Does anyone know if MultiCameraSensor is capable of providing depth data as well (similar to DepthCameraSensor) as I would like to synchronize multiple depth cameras. Thanks.

A:

It currently does not provide depth data. But you can use stereo image processing provided by ROS.
Here is an issue to track this enhancement:

Thanks for the response. Currently I haven't seen a plugin specifically for the MultiCameraSensor. Does one exist?

You can create your own sensor plugin: http://gazebosim.org/wiki/Tutorials/1.5/plugins
