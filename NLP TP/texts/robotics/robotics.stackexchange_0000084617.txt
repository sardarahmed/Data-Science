Q:

how to connect the velodyne HDL-64 to ROS-indigo?

This is ip addresses infromation of HDL-64E_S3.
 ROS version: indigo
 Laser Moudle: velodyne HDL-64E_S3

I follow the tutorial to set the IP address information. 

[link text (http://wiki.ros.org/velodyne/Tutorials/Getting%20Started%20with%20the%20HDL-32E)
$sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-velodyne
$sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.3.43
$sudo route add 192.168.XX.YY eth0
I don't know how to define  the XX and YY. I don't have the CD which have this information.
