Q:

Fix workspace bounds

Hello,
I would like to set the workspace bound for my robot. I know there is a functionality in moveit that helps you to do that. It is called "fix workspace bounds". Anybody has some example code in python I could use to understand how it works ?

A:

The (whole) code for the module fix_workspace_bounds can be found here.
As you can see there, you can set a ROS parameter (move_group/)default_workspace_bounds that specifies the distance of the boundary from origin in all three dimensions.
I didn't look thoroughly, but I guess you have to pass in the workspace explicitly if you want non-cubic workspace bounds.
Be aware though that the workspace concept does not affect revolution joints.
It is meant for floating and planar joints.
If you want your fixed robot arm to stay within a volume, add wall collision objects in the area that should be avoided.
