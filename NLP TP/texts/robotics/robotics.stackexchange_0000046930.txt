Q:

Ogre Gazebo problem ROS Fuerte

Hi guys,
I'm facing without success a problem when I launch a Gazebo world (anyone, also the simple empty world). I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 and ROS fuerte. The error is the following
Gazebo multi-robot simulator, version 1.0.2

I thing it is OGRE. The real point is it says it wants to load a file named plugins.cfg but this file is not in my computer neither in another one where Gazebo runs well.
Any idea?
Thank you in advance,
Neostek

A:

The same problem appears if I run rviz, so it is not a Gazebo problem
