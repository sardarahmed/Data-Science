Q:

Why is ROS ANSWERS forum so easily exploitable?

ROS ANSWERS unlike stackexchange, ubuntu forums is easily exploitable and I want to divert the attention of forum moderators to this issue.
In this forum anybody can make an account and upvote answers or ask any questions. You do not need certain amount of karma to upvote questions so I can make as many accounts as I want. Also one does not need email verification to set up an account for this forum. I can use this forum on someone else's email account and will encounter no problems or restrictions.
I just care about this community so wanted to share my opinion. I hope the moderators understand although I do realize that this does not have many disadvantages but still.

A:

Every barrier to entry makes it harder for both spammers and regular users.  We tune the settings to make it as easy as possible to join the community without being overloaded with spam.  So far we don't have a problem, if you see a problem please use the flag offensive button and contact the administrators using the "give feedback" link at the bottom.

where is the flag offensive button?!?
Comment by tfoote on 2013-08-28:
It is at the bottom of all questions and answers next to the edit links.  They may be restricted to people with a minimum of karma.

thanks, I guess it is since I don't see them :-)

What's the minimum karma for flagging posts? 1000 seems not enough. Maybe worth lowering it and adding this info to http://answers.ros.org/faq/.
Comment by tfoote on 2013-09-08:
The minimum for flagging a post is 5 Karma.

Looks like I need to get my glasses checked ... I only see edit, delete, link, retag and close. Maybe sth needs to be enabled to let non-admins use this function?

if you don't see it please open a ticket at https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/answers.ros.org to track it.
