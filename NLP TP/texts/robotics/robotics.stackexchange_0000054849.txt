Q:

ardrone_automony is not receiving correct navdata from AR.Drone2.0

I have been running ardrone_autonomy with an AR.Drone1.0 and it has been working great. Today I bought an AR.Drone2.0 and assumed that my code would work out of the box. Unfortunately ardrone_autonomy ardrone_driver throws this error over and over again:
One option (0) is not a valid option because its size is zero
[Navdata] Checksum failed : 1006 (distant) / 34055 (local)
Tag 12504 is an unknown navdata option tag

Is there something I need to change in the code / launch file to make it compatible with the AR.Drone2.0?
I should also mention (though I don't think it's relevant) that I modified ardrone_autonomy to make it catkin compatible.

You have to look for the drone firmware.

Worked like charm, firmware was very easy to downgrade. Thanks!
