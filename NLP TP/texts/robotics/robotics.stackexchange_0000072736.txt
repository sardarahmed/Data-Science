Q:

Kobuki Left Bumper stuck

My Kobuki left bumper has somehow gotten stuck, I could probably live with this, but it messes up the auto_docking node, which reports feedback: [dockdrive: bumped]: and my robot just backs up.
I've verified the behavior by running the following commands in order.

roscore
rostopic echo /mobile_base/events/bumper
roslaunch kobuki_node minimal.launch --screen

As soon as the kobuki_node comes up the echo report the following below.  Also, the right and center bumper work as expected.
bumper: 0
state: 1

Pressing the left bumper has no effect on the echo command above.  Ie. the Kobuki think the left bumper is always pressed.  So I have two options:
Option 1:  Find some documentation on how to take the bumper off and see why it's stuck.
Option 2: Get the auto_docking node to work despite the left bumper being stuck.**
Any ideas?
Thanks

A:

If you take a flat head screw drive and slide it into the opening on the side of the bumper, you can then pry up enough to see a white contact switch with a flashlight (be very carefully).  A second screw driver can then be used to unfree the stuck bumper.
With the bumper not stuck the auto dock routine works perfect.
