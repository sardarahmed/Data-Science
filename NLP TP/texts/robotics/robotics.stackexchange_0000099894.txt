catkin build fails on ros:noetic-ros-base.

catkin_make also fails, but a different error, which looks similar to what's reported in https://answers.ros.org/question/384705

A:

Looks like similar / the same background as https://answers.ros.org/question/384705.
In my case, the issue went away after either:

switching the Docker image  to ros:noetic-ros-core.
installing build-essential.
