In future questions, if you have a question about a tutorial please provide a link to the tutorial.

A:

If you were referencing this tutorial, http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage , then you have to make sure you have 'catkin' selected, rather than 'rosbuild' (this option is located right below 'Next Tutorial: Building a ROS package').
