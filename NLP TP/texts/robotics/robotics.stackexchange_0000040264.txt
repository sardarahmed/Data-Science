Q:

Build failed when build the android_core in rosjava

Hi all,
I'm new in this ROS and ROSjava world. I was installing the android_core following the documentation, http://docs.rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/android_core/html/building.html, but when I want to build debug APKs for all android_core packages (./gradlew debug), I'm getting the next error:

What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':android_acm_serial:updateProject'.

A problem occurred starting command 'android'.

I'm in the right folder and I have installed the android_core, android SDK and Apache Ant.
Any ideas? Anyone is getting the same error?
Thanks in advance

Finally I could solve that problem. The steps that I followed are the next, I hope it help:

Clear the maven cache:
$ rm -rf ~/.m2/repository/ros

Delete the rosjava folder (if already installed) and create it again:
$ rm -r Workspace
   $ mkdir -p Workspace

Install rosjava:
$ rosinstall ~/Workspace https://kforge.ros.org/appmanandroid/hg/raw-file/tip/appman.rosinstall

Install android_core:
$ cd ~/Workspace
   $ rosws merge http://android.rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/.rosinstall
$ rosws update

Build rosjava_core:
$ roscd rosjava_core
   $ ./gradlew install
-- optionals
$ ./gradlew docs
  $ ./gradlew test
$ ./gradlew eclipse

Install google:
$ roscd google
   $ ./gradlew install

Install android_core:
$ roscd android_core
   $ ./gradlew debug
