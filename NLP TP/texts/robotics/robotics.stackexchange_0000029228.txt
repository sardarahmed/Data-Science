Q:

The transition/difference between Citadel and Fortess

Hi there!
I wanted to test my current file on Fortress but it seems that there's few ign syntax are not supported on Fortress from Citadel.

Is there any doc about this?

Perfect. I added some instructions to my answer to check SDFormat spec. Not difficult to solve your problem I think.

Nice! Thank you so much for your time!

A:

Main change probably affecting you is the update from sdformat9 to sdformat12 which, indeed, has some improvements that generates some incompatibilities. SDFormat has its own migration guide. I sometimes found useful to run ign sdf --check (ignition-tools package) to get some hints about what's going on.
Another useful resource is the SDFormat spec. In your case http://sdformat.org/spec?ver=1.8&elem=material says that ambient should in range 0,1 and you are using 2.0 in your file. This is not the only problem but the rest can be fixed using error output and spec.
Good luck!

Ah, gotcha! I'm going to try that one out!
Does it need for me to have both versions?
Comment by Jose Luis Rivero on 2021-10-14:
There is a nice option in "ign sdf check --versions" that should tell you which versions are found in the system and "ign sdf --force-version " to make the tool to use different versions and compare results. In your case I would run against both, 9.x and 12.x, but look for the output in 12.x to see if it helps. Good luck.
