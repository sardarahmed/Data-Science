Q:

Changing the size of the turtlesim window

How can I change the canvas width and canvas height of the turtlesim window displayed on running turtlesim_node? Are there some options which can be used with the command "rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node __name:=turtle1" to change the size of the display window.

A:

The turtlesim does not support a dynamic windows size.
This is mainly due to keeping the code as simple as possible since turtlesim is used as an example/tutorial for ROS.
