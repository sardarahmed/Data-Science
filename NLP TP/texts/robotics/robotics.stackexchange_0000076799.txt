Q:

md5sum issue when calling a service from another computer

I am running ROS on two computers. The master and it is the one requesting the service. The other is the one to which my robot is connected, and the one providing the service I wish to use (move the robot to a point).
When I try to request the service, the following error shows:
unable to connect to service: remote error reported: client wants service /enhance/MoveRobotToPoint to have md5sum 78ad5397dff8517113a4ce521add09a7, but it has 3b74f5e1707ea77798238c7e929349b7. Dropping connection.

Then, I noticed that the .srv files in the machines were different. By running the command
rossrv md5 MoveRobotToPoint

I noticed that the md5sum was indeed 78ad5397dff8517113a4ce521add09a7 on the ROS Master and 3b74f5e1707ea77798238c7e929349b7 on the server.
So, I changed the files so they were the same (and then built the workspace again, sourced devel/setup.bash and restarted the computer). The error still occurs! However, with the above command, I get for both machines 78ad5397dff8517113a4ce521add09a7. So, I am pretty sure the md5sum is correct.
Could it be that somehow the service still "thinks" that the .srv file is the old one? How can I force him to update? I even deleted the hidden ~/MoveRobotToPoint.srv backup file.
Thank you in advance.

A:

You should try deleting catkin_ws/build and catkin_ws/devel and rebuilding.

The bag could have been recorded with a different (older?) version of NavStatus, if you can track it down you could compile it in a catkin_ws just for playing back the bag with.  Or look into https://github.com/facontidavide/ros_msg_parser or https://github.com/StefanFabian/ros_babel_fish if you don't know what the different NavStatus is.
