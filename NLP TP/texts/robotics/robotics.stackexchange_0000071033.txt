Q:

gmapping on pioneer p3dx robots not able to publish on /map

I am trying to create map using kinect . The following are the commands that i executed :-
$ roscore
$ roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch
$ rosrun depthimage_to_laserscan depthimage_to_laserscan image:=/camera/depth/image_raw
$ rosrun tf static_transform_publisher -0.27 0.0 0.6 0.0 0.0 0.0 base_link camera_link 100
$ rosrun ROSARIA Rosaria _port:=/dev/ttyS0 RosAria/pose:=odom
//the above command is for p3dx. It  publishes nav_msgs::odom on /RosAria/pose as its /odom
$ rosrun gmapping slam_gmapping scan:=scan
Here gmapping is showing the following warning    [ WARN] [1450879595.939251882]: MessageFilter [target=odom ]: Dropped 100.00% of messages so far. Please turn the [ros.gmapping.message_notifier] rosconsole logger to DEBUG for more information.
but when I  created a fake odom publisher gmapping worked.
So , help me out to find why is the /odom of rosaria is not able to drive gmapping.

A:

There is a synchronisation problem between the robot and the workstation computers. I used chrony for synchronising both and it worked !!
