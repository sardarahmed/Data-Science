Q:

hector_heat_detection missing dependency?

One of the hector_heat_detection dependencies, is "thermaleye_msgs" , but i couldn't find it anywhere!
at first i thought it's a part of thermalvis, but it was not!
any suggestions?

A:

Yes, that package is indeed missing. If you want to proceed, the simplest way to fix things might be to just create a thermaleye_msgs package yourself and putting this one msg definition into it:
Mapping.msg:
float64 minTemp
float64 maxTemp

As fixing this properly requires some internal re-organization of our repos, it might take a little time.
