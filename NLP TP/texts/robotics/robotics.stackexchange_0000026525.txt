Q:

Import custom .dae file in gazebo from the world file, error of path does not exist

I am new to gazebo and following the tutorial from the official website.
But i am stuck at Test The Mesh heading.
I made the grass.world file and pasted the code given in tutorial.
And i also copied the duck.dae file along with the duck.png file in the same directory of the world files.
But when i run

gazebo /usr/share/gazebo-1.8/worlds/grass.world

It opens empty world and not shows any duck

(gazebo:5903): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: "pixmap",

Error [SystemPaths.cc:370] File or path does not exist[""]

Error [Visual.cc:2069] No mesh specified

I dont know where i am going wrong, just following the tutoral.
Thanks in advance :)

A:

It should work if you run gazebo from within the /usr/share/gazebo-1.8/worlds folder.
The issue is that grass.world is referring a the my_mesh.dae resource, but Gazebo can't find that resource. You could also specify a complete file URI for the mesh:
<mesh><uri>file:///usr/share/gazebo-1.8/worlds/my_mesh.dae</uri></mesh>

Thankyou so very much :)
While trying i also used full path but  using 2 forward-slashes only...
Here you had 3 so when i tried this way...
It showed me the duck :)
