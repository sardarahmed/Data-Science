Q:

Ros-kinetic error: pcl_ros cannot find openmpi

I found this problem building the ros packages for my project.
I am running ros-kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04:
-- +++ processing catkin package: 'ros_sourcesink'
-- ==> add_subdirectory(ros_sourcesink)
-- Using these message generators: gencpp;geneus;genlisp;gennodejs;genpy
-- Warning: ros_sourcesink_clothoid_lane_ros_marker_sink -- not building library, missing [icl_traffic_maps_utilities].
-- Warning: ros_sourcesink_chm_values_ros_marker_sink -- not building library, missing [icl_traffic_maps_gtsam_utilities].
-- +++ processing catkin package: 'ros_automated_driving'

-- Using these message generators: gencpp;geneus;genlisp;gennodejs;genpy
CMake Error at /opt/ros/kinetic/share/pcl_ros/cmake/pcl_rosConfig.cmake:106 (message):
  Project 'pcl_ros' specifies '/usr/include/hdf5/openmpi' as an include dir,
  which is not found.  It does neither exist as an absolute directory nor in
  '/opt/ros/kinetic//usr/include/hdf5/openmpi'.  Ask the maintainer 'Paul
  Bovbel <paul@bovbel.com>, Bill Morris <bill@neautomation.com>' to fix it.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:76 (find_package)
  ros_automated_driving/CMakeLists.txt:9 (find_package)

Thanks for your help!

although this question is quite old, the problem just recently popped up again:
https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/issues/1058
any ideas how to properly solve this?

A:

This looks like a PCL include. I've verified on a clean install that if you apt-get install ros-kinetic-pcl-ros from debians, or run rosdep install to pull in dependencies on a source workspace containing pcl_ros, the path will exist on your system.
