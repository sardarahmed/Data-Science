Q:

How can I narrow a virtual kinect laser scan?

I am simulating a turtlebot in Gazebo, and currently I am having issues with the kinect laser scan, which sees about 270 degrees around the robot. I would like to narrow that so that the laser only picks up objects within the 90ish degrees directly in front of the bot. I haven't been able to find a parameter I can simply change to do this.
How might I go about narrowing the field of scan?

A:

I would suggest adjusting the parameters in the pointcloud to laserscan node. You'll find it launched from turtlebot_gazebo/launch/robot.launch (in the simulated case) and turtlebot_bringup/kinect.launch (in the real-world case).
