Q:

Is ROS/Turtlebot 2 compatible with any camera?

I'm fairly new to ROS so I apologize if this is an obvious question.  What restrictions, if any, does ROS and/or the turtlebot 2 have when it comes to camera compatibility?
I want to use a Logitech Quickcam Orbit AF found here but it's a bit pricey so I don't want to buy it until I know for sure that I'll be able to use it.  It has a mic and can pan and tilt about its base automatically.  Will I be able to use these features as well?
Does anyone have experience using this type of camera or other cameras that don't necessarily have a lot of documentation?
What steps would I need to take in order to implement a new camera with ROS?
Thanks!

A:

ROS isn't one big monolithic thing that either does or does not have support for a particular piece of hardware. It's more nuanced than that.
ROS compatibility with cameras depends mostly on whether or not you can find a camera driver that supports the camera you're interested in. There are a few common camera drivers available for ROS that are listed elsewhere: http://answers.ros.org/question/9089/what-driver-should-i-use-for-my-usb-camera/ and http://www.iheartrobotics.com/2010/05/testing-ros-usb-camera-drivers.html
As for that specific camera, I've seen them on ROS robots in the past, so it seems like someone got the driver working at some point.
A quick google search for "ros quickcam orbit" turns up a number of open-source projects with drivers:

https://github.com/Teknoman117/ucm-ros-pkg/blob/master/kybernetes_drivers/uvc_camera/src/node.cpp - not well documented but looks like it integrates the driver and control. uses the older rosbuild system, so might be a little out of date
https://github.com/AndreaCensi/orbit_camera_actuator - simple, just does PTZ. updated for catkin, so has a slightly higher chance of working, but you'll need a separate node to acquire images.
http://answers.ros.org/question/10365/using-the-player-package/ - an older answer on ROS Answers with users discussing this camera, with various drivers and links to source.
