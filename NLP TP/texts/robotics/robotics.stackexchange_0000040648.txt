Q:

How do you install octomap on Fuerte in linux?

Looking at the octomap instructions, it is not clear to me what I have to do to install the "pre-built packages" on linux -- sorry I don't use linux much so this maybe very clear to others.
What are the commands to install the correct packages?

A:

For just installing octomap as a stand-alone library, run
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-octomap

To install octomap, ROS integration, and octomap_server run
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-octomap ros-fuerte-octomap-mapping
