Q:

Insert sdf at coordinates

Hello,
Is it possible to insert an sdf file at specific coordinates in Gazebo? For instance the origin? All I can seem to do is select my model from the insert tab and then manually place it in the viewport.
I'm new to Gazebo so my understanding of how to properly use it is still forming.
Thanks!

A:

You should be able to add a model in your world file, with code similar to this:
<world>
...
    <include>
        <uri>model://my_model</uri>
        <pose>2.5 1.5 0.5 0 0 0</pose>
    </include>
</world>

Where the numbers represents the global pose and orientation.

That was the missing piece of the puzzle. The world tutorials led me astray, thanks for the help. If anyone is curious on where Gazebo looks for model files see here: http://answers.gazebosim.org/question/177/gazebo-default-directory-and-can-not-insert-model/
