salma if you check the errors, you do not have git installed (probably bzr is also not installed)

A:

You need to run
source ~/ros/setup.bash

in the same terminal before running rosmake roboearth.
It is not clear whether you did so. If this still fails, paste the result of
echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH 

into your question, please.

it doesn't work
the result of echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH  is : /opt/ros/fuerte/share:/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-10-12:
This indicates that sourcing setup.bash did not work correctly. Did you get any error messages, either in the rosinstall command or when executing the source command?
Comment by salma on 2012-10-12:
now when i write
$ source ~/ros/setup.bash
bash: /home/salma/ros/setup.bash: No such file or directory
i found :
bash: /home/salma/ros/setup.bash: No such file or directory
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-10-12:
Did the rosinstall command throw an errror?
Comment by salma on 2012-10-12:
no
and stack installed but in Home
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-10-12:
Can you please edit your original question and add the exact output of the command? See http://ros.org/wiki/Support Something seems to be messed up in your system and we need to find out what. Also, what's the output of ls ~/ros?
Comment by salma on 2012-10-12:
ok i did :)
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-10-12:
I cannot see the output of ls ~/ros.
Comment by salma on 2012-10-12:
salma@salma-G31M-S2L:~$ ls ~/ros
pkgs  setup.bash  setup.sh  setup.zsh  stacks
Comment by salma on 2012-10-12:
edited , the last line
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-10-12:
Then the command source ~/ros/setup.bash definitely must work and must not throw an error.
Comment by salma on 2012-10-12:
so ?? :((
it throw an error :
bash: /home/salma/ros/setup.bash: Permission denied
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-10-12:
I think you must have made a mistake somewhere. Did you maybe execute the rosinstall command using sudo at some point? I suggest that you delete the complete directory ~/ros if you don't have anything important in it (sudo rm -rf ~/ros) and try the rosinstall command and the source command again

Ok i will .. Thanks Lorenz
