Q:

rosrun beginner_tutorials listener.py results in no output

HI All
I'm using ubuntu 16/04 along with python for writing nodes.
I just have few hours experience on ROS.
I pushed rosrun beginner_tutorials listener.py after defining the source but this resulted in no output ust the cursor blinking for few times then stagnant.
I rechecked the CMakeLists.txt but couldn't find any any dependencies in it with reference to tutorials (I'm not sure though)
Sincerely

A:

I'm assuming that you're doing the subscriber/publisher tutorial  for rospy. Are you running the talker node? The listener node will only do something if there's a node publishing (i.e.,callback functions are only called when they receive data on a topic). Try running both nodes and see what happens.

To add-on, run another terminal (e.g: control +shift + o) and rosrun beginner_tutorials talker.py
