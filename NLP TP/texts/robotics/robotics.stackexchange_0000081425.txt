Q:

differential drive + ros_control to move a 2 wheeled base of a robot?

First of all, I am very new to ROS.
I would like to perform a simple task of moving the base of my robot. The package that I want to use to move my Robot's base (consists of 2 wheels) is as simple as this - http://wiki.ros.org/diff_drive_controller?distro=lunar. Can someone detail me about how to use this package and the hardware interface to a TI DSP controller which in turn drives the motor of my robot's wheels.

You have multiple problems, my suggestion: First research how to talk to your DSP, this is not a ROS problem and I suggest to ask at a DSP/Embedded board for a solution. If you have that next do all the ros tutorials then come back.

A:

I think I have to expand my comment a little, you are basically asking two questions:

How to control your hardware

As I said in the comment this is not a ROS specific problem. You better write a driver that talks to your hardware first and then later convert it into a ROS node.

How to use diff drive controller.

Diff drive controller and ros control are not packages I would give to a ros beginner to setup. While they are probably the right software to solve your problem they won't help you in understanding basic ros concepts. Thats what the tutorials are there for. Next I suggest to do the navigation tutorials on a simulated robot. Just to understand how the navigation stack works and what these odom/cmd_vel messages are.
Finally for ros control see this roscon 2014 video.
