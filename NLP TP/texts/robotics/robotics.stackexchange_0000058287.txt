Q:

recent problem with android_apps (catkin_make)

I had a working environment, for developing android apps for ROS.
today, I opened Android Studio, and at the start it started "refreshing the project" .. and all of the sudden I started getting errors about gradle wrapper..
I fell back to terminal, and tried to reinvoke "catkin_make" on the dir.
and I got this error:
* Where:
Build file '/home/aminasfour/project/android/src/android_apps/application_management/build.gradle' line: 26

* What went wrong:
A problem occurred evaluating project ':application_management'.
> Could not create plugin of type 'LibraryPlugin'.

I've tried to download everything from scratch .. and re-followed this tutorial:
http://wiki.ros.org/sig/Rosjava/Android%20Development%20Environment/hydro.
unfortunately I'm still getting the same error mentioned above.
Please I need advice on how to fix it, I have a project that I need to deliver within a week.
Thanks!

I suspect this is due to a recent change on your system. You could try reviewing the package install logs in /var/log/dpkg if you're on Ubuntu

It's not, the latest update that appears there, dates back to two weeks ago (and it used to work then)

Try to update the distributionUrl=http://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-1.10-all.zip in the gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties. This solved my problems regarding the same issue.

A:

If I recall correctly, I got the same error with the recent android studio/build tools version/gradle android plugin and gradle updates. Some of these are embedded in rosjava_build_tools (sdk version and android gradle plugin), so if you updated rosjava_build_tools on hydro, then it will automatically be trying to use 19.0.3 build tools version and android gradle plugin 0.9.+.
If you want to keep to old unsupported (by android studio) versions, then simply override these variables/dependencies in your local build.gradle files. Otherwise update your android studio/rosjava_build_tools and it should disappear.
For the record, I'm now using (April '14)

Android 0.5.4
Build Tools 19.0.3
Android Gradle Plugin 0.9+
Gradle 1.11
