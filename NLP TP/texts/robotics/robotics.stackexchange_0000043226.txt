Q:

How to include a .launch file on a remote machine from a .launch file?

Hi,
I'm using openni_launch drivers for the Kinect on my robot. I am running roscore on a separate computer, my laptop. I have added a line reading  to the openni.launch file on the robot computer so I can access the various image topics such as /camera/rgb/image_color from my laptop.
As it is, I can run the launch file on my laptop which creates the connection to the robot, and THEN I have to go over to the robot computer and launch openni.launch to start the Kinect drivers. This works fine, but it is inconvenient. I want to be able to start the Kinect drivers (execute the openni.launch file on the robot computer) from the launch file on my laptop.
I am wondering if there is a way to add an  tag to the launch file on my laptop that will run the openni.launch file on the robot.
Naturally, I looked at the  documentation at http://www.ros.org/wiki/roslaunch/XML/include already, but there doesn't seem to be anything about including a file on another machine. That's why I thought I would check here.
Thanks very much for reading, and hope you can help!
-Chris

A:

It looks like it's undocumented, and it even gives a warning if you try to use it, but! You can, in fuerte, at least, add a "machine" attribute to an "include" tag in a launchfile and get it to launch everything in that included launchfile to come up on another machine.
See here for setting up machine tags: http://www.ros.org/wiki/roslaunch/XML/machine
And then just simply do (with appropriate values) something like:
<launch>
  <machine name="other-pc" address="192.168.13.37" env-loader="/opt/ros/fuerte/env.sh"/>
  <include file="/path/to/file/on/local/machine.launch" machine="other-pc"/>
</launch>

It looks like what this is doing is actually reading a launchfile on the local machine, and then bringing up its nodes on the other machine!

I have tried that with openni.launch, but it still launches nodes on local machine.

Maybe it only works one level deep. This is an undocumented feature, but definitely something that I think should be added to the hydro roslaunch SIG: http://www.ros.org/wiki/hydro/Planning/roslaunch

I tried it in ROS Electric, but had no luck.
WARNING: [path/to/MASTER/pc/name.launch] unknown  attribute 'machine'
I need to launch a node in a ClientPC with files living in the ClientPC too. Currently it attempts to read files in MASTERPC which also has them, but no luck either. Ideas?

On hydro this results in error:
WARNING: [...launch] unknown  attribute 'machine'

This isn't working on ROS Kinetic either, resulting in a warning and the nodes being launched on the local PC.
