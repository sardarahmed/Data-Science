Q:

RVIZ Application Not Launching

Hello Im trying to run an RVIZ application from the Udacity Robotics-Nanodegree but unfortunately when i try to run it it crashes with this message:
You can start planning now!

[ INFO] [1506666259.823327293]: Stereo is NOT SUPPORTED

I can run RVIZ Perfectly without any application, but when I try to run this one it crashes. This is very weird because many other students have opened it without a problem, so its not application related.
I am Currently stuck in the program because of this problem. If anyone can help me it would be greaaatly appreciated!!!
Daniel

A:

Please see #q271750 and [notice] Removal of Arial in rviz caused breaking changes.
