Q:

catkin_make src failing

Hi!
I am currently having a weird problem. My package cannot be found anymore even though it was working before.
I put the package larah in the src folder and the workspace setup is correct. I also sourced the devel/setup.bash.
roscd larah does not find the package either and rospack profile didn't help.
catkin_make seems to be working fine:
 Base path: /home/turtlebot/catkin_ws
Source space: /home/turtlebot/catkin_ws/src
Build space: /home/turtlebot/catkin_ws/build
Devel space: /home/turtlebot/catkin_ws/devel
Install space: /home/turtlebot/catkin_ws/install

Running command: "make cmake_check_build_system" in "/home/turtlebot/catkin_ws/build"
Running command: "make -j4 -l4" in "/home/turtlebot/catkin_ws/build"

[  5%] Built target openni_camera_gencfg
[ 10%] Built target fallen_person_wrapper
[ 73%] Built target openni_driver
[ 78%] Built target fallen_person_detector
[ 84%] Built target image_saver
[ 89%] [ 94%] Built target openni_node
Built target localization_node
[100%] Built target openni_nodelet 
But catkin_make src gives me following output:

Base path: /home/turtlebot/catkin_ws
Source space: /home/turtlebot/catkin_ws/src
Build space: /home/turtlebot/catkin_ws/build
Devel space: /home/turtlebot/catkin_ws/devel
Install space: /home/turtlebot/catkin_ws/install

Running command: "make cmake_check_build_system" in "/home/turtlebot/catkin_ws/build"
Running command: "make src -j4 -l4" in "/home/turtlebot/catkin_ws/build"

make: *** No rule to make target `src'.  Stop.
Invoking "make src -j4 -l4" failed

also: ROS_PACKAGE_PATH gives the correct location of my package...
Any ideas??
Thank you!

A:

Ok, the problem vanished the same way as it came. I did not do anything except putting an alias in the bashrc like this:
alias cat_make='cd ~/catkin_ws/ && catkin_make && source devel/setup.bash'

this is exactly what I did a million times already... opened up a new shell, ran cat_make and suddenly my package could be found again...
Strange.
