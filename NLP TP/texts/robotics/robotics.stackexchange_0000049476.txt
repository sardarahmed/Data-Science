Q:

Tag Recognition with Kinect

Today, it is still very challenging to do object recognition in real time while the robot and the object are both moving. Hence, I am thinking of putting some special red/green tags on the target objects or labels. Do you think it will make things better or worse? Also, which ROS package is the most suitable for recognizing the tags? I would like to implement this in TurtleBot with Kinect. Thank you very much for your suggestions.

A:

Ar markers are the best to detect probably, use the ar_kinect package

So it is okay even if things are moving?

I my research the markers are static and the camera is moving, that works. The system is reasonably robust but you should try it in your own application.
