Q:

Gazebo 1.6.1 Bullet rolling friction, contact parameters implemented?

Hi,
To which degree is Bullet implemented in Gazebo 1.6.1 from the sdf description page? I tried <rolling_friction> and  <contact> parameters and they don't work.
I also checked the features list, but they are not mentioned as TODO or Done.
Cheers,
Andrei

A:

We have put Bullet integration on hold until July, 2013. The basics are in place (simple shapes, and most of the joints), but friction has not been fully tested.
