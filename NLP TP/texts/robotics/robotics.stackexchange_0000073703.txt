Q:

gazebo_ros_control missing in latest ros-jade-gazebo-ros-pkgs

Hello,
When running "catkin_make" , I got "Could not find a package configuration file provided by "gazebo_ros_control" with any of the following names"
From Gazebo website, http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_installing,
they mentioned that "Note: currently in ROS Jade there is no ros-jade-gazebo-ros-control package released."
From http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_installing, "The 2.5.3 Jade version will include the gazebo_ros_control: ros/rosdistro#11044".
However,
is there any way I can either

build gazebo_ros_control from the source code and install in my local jade (/opt/ros/jade/share:/opt/ros/jade/stacks)
ignore gazebo_ros_control

Thank you for taking time on my questions

A:

I got the response from Stack Overflow and verified the response work.
The solution is git clone gazebo_ros_control from its repo (http://wiki.ros.org/gazebo_ros_control) and put it under your catkin_ws/src and catkin_make.
Please leave your comment if any question or suggestion.
