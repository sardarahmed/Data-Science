Q:

Trying to install dynamixel_controllers in Fuerte getting error

I'm attempting to install the dynamixel_controllers package in Fuerte. This is a fresh installation of Fuerte on a 12.04 machine. I'm receiving this error after downloading the package and typing "rosmake dynamixel_controllers" I receive this error:

A:

I see that you are using Ubuntu 12.04, there should be packages available for dynamixel_motor stack on Fuerte. Any reason you are trying to compile from source?

When I did a search using the ROS search bar, that was the package that came up. I did not see the dynamixel_motor stack until after troubleshooting.
I have since found it but haven't confirmed that things are working properly yet. I will post back once I have made sure everything is working properly.
