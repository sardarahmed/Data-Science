Can you be more specific? What do you mean by convert several packages into C++ code? Do you mean transforming a multi-processes application into a single process?

A:

ROS nodes are just executables which can be run from the terminal or CodeBlocks. You will need to figure out how to set environment variables inside Code Blocks, but if you can do that you should not have a problem launching any of the c++ executables from within CodeBlocks.
