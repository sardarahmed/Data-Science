Q:

How to specify the datetime format for ros2 logs?

I read https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Demos/Logging-and-logger-configuration.html#console-output-formatting but it doesn't mention how to specify the datetime format to be something else than seconds, is that possible?

A:

See here for the list of currently supported format tokens  and the respective formatting handler functions.
Wrt. time, the only formats are:

{time}, which installs a formatting handler expand_time_as_seconds and
{time_as_nanoseconds}, which installs the formatting handler expand_time_as_nanoseconds.

Both of these handlers call expand_time().
So if you want a different formatting, you will have to implement a different handler.
