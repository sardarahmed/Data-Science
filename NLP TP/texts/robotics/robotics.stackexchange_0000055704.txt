Q:

How do I create a ROS enabled Android app?

Hello,
I'm a newbie on ROS and ROSJava and I'm trying write an app which communicates with ROS on a PC. The PC has ROS Hydro installed. I've followed the steps so now I have rosjava_core and android_core. And I was trying to import the tutorials from android_core in Android Studio to test the waters and start playing around but I get a message about unsupported version of Gradle (which is weird because it's using the one that came with AS). I have v1.8 of Gradle. When I am not getting that problem I get "Could not find any version that matches org.ros.rosjava_bootstrap:gradle_plugins:[0.1,0.2).Required by:android_core:unspecified"
I've followed the tutorials as closely as possible but I can't seem to find a solution.
Any help would be very appreciated.

After a lot of messing around and your help I managed to solve my problems.
a) I was sourcing the wrong setup.bash file so I got the "Could not find..." problem.
b) The Gradle problem seemingly solved itself.
Thanks a lot.

A:

For the Gradle version, try to change the Gradle version number in the wrapper folder of android_core (android_core/gradle/wrapper/gradle....properties).
For the rojava_bootstrap... error check this post //answers.ros.org/question/100271/importing-android_core-failed/

This answer help me. Thanks Dtc. What exactly I did:

I installed Gradle 1.9 (not 1.10!)
Cloned android_core
cd .../android_core/android_tutorial_camera
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
.../android-studio/bin/studio.sh
Then selected "Import project" and android_code directory
