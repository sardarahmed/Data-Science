Q:

Error when trying to install rvis

Hi all,
I just started using ROS (groovy), and I'm trying to get rvis installed. I'm following the user guide.
When I try to install using
sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-rviz

I am faced with the error
E: Unable to locate package ros-groovy-rvis

Please help! Thanks

A:

One thing I notice here is that the command is correct, but in the error output it says rviS, not rviZ. Sure you didn't accidentally put "sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-rvis" (with s instead of z) in as command and only wrote it right here?

Oh dear, what a silly mistake! Thanks for pointing that out! :)

Glad I could help, in fact I knew this problem since I made the exact same mistake when trying to install rviz for the first time :P
