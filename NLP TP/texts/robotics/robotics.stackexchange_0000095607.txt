Q:

Simple example of colcon test

I am just starting to use ROS2. I have built a talker and a listener.
I also have a much more complex project that I have to understand.
so far I have understood about colcon build, but I would really appreciate if someone can point me to a simple way to use colcon test.
What is the general procedure if say I write a talker and listener in C++ and want to do some testing? Do my test have to be written in C++? or python?
I believe the way to understand complex things is to start simple so I would appreciate some help here. Later perhaps I could ask more specific questions.

A:

colcon test simply invokes the tests of the package. For CMake-based packages that is using CTest, for Python packages it is pytest. For tests involving more than one executable you probably want to look into launch_testing (https://github.com/ros2/launch/tree/master/launch_testing) and launch_testing_ros (https://github.com/ros2/launch_ros/tree/master/launch_testing_ros).
