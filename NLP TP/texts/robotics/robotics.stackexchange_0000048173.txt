Q:

Installing ROS for an NXT

Hi, I am interested in using ROS to program an NXT. I am very new to ROS and Linux, but not to robotics and I am interested in learning ROS. When I add the following line to terminal:
sudo apt-get install ros-electric-nxtall
I get the text below in terminal. Is the electric version the proper version that I need to use? How can I fix this problem? Thank you for your help!

A:

It is better to upgrade your ubuntu installation to the latest LTS version and install ROS fuerte or groovy.
