A:

I received this error when it came to image_transport from image_common. What you can do, if it is image_transport that throws the error, is to edit the CMakeList.txt in ros_catkin_ws/src/image_common/image_transport and remove the line with tinyxml
add_dependencies(${PROJECT_NAME} sensor_msgs_gencpp)
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME}
  ${Boost_LIBRARIES}
  ${catkin_LIBRARIES}
#  tinyxml
)

See these two links from the issue tracker
