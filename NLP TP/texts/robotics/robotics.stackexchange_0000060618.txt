Q:

Hydro and Indigo in parallel?

Hello
is it possible to use for example a listener build of hydro and on a other machine a talker build with indigo? On which machine has the roscore running?
Thanks

A:

This will generally work, unless message definitions between rosdistros have changed (then, you´ll get errors about md5sum missmatches when trying to establish topic connections). As most messages types are stable by now and do not get changed between distros, it is unlikely you´ll run into problems. See also this Q/A.

The Diagnostic message changed between Hydro and Indigo, so exchanging diagnostic information between machines running different distros will not work.

Thanks for the answers. Now the listener and talker are running with differen versions. The probelm was a network configuration problem.
