Q:

Installing ROS onto NAO V4

Hello,
I've trying to install ROS Fuerte on NAO V4 with Naoqi version 1.14.2 using this tutorial . When trying to compile ROS (this is step 1.4) I succeeded in the step: $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$ROS_FUERTE_DIR
But now, once I run $ make -j8; the following error shows up:
Built target stereo_msgs_genpy
[ 90%] Building CXX object ros_comm/tools/rosconsole/CMakeFiles/rosconsole.dir/src/rosconsole/rosconsole.cpp.o
Linking CXX shared library ../../../lib/librosconsole.so
/home/nao/linux64-nao-atom-cross-toolchain-1.14.5/sysroot/usr/lib/liblog4cxx.so: could not read symbols: File in wrong format
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make[2]: *** [lib/librosconsole.so] Error 1
make[1]: *** [ros_comm/tools/rosconsole/CMakeFiles/rosconsole.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2
As you can see, it compiles correctly until ~90%. Doing a little research the error it appears is due to compatibility between 32 and 64 bits with the library log4cxx, but I am not completely sure. I am using a 64bits laptop (especifications are at the end of the post). Have anyone encountered this error? And know how to solve it? Thank you!
Additional info about SW and HW:

ROS Fuerte
Ubuntu 12.04.2 (64 bits)
Nao atom cross-toolchain 1.14.2 64bits
Laptop 64bits

Hello!
We have just released a binary distribution of ROS groovy for Nao (not fuerte, sorry).
Check it here if you wish: http://www.ros.org/wiki/nao/Installation/local

Thank you, I've already installed it and it runs smoothly ... My question is now, do you have a simple example of how to use it? The tutorials in the webpage, are more focus on either how to cross-compile or use NAO and ROS without CC

Sorry for the delay... can you be more specific? what would you like to do? You may also want to open new specific questions...
