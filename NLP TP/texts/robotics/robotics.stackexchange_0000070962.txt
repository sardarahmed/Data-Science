Q:

how to perform localization based on ceiling

I've seen localization based on the ceiling image mentioned a few places[1],[2] but its not clear to me if a ros package like RGBDSLAM or RTABMAP can be used with a kinect pointing at the ceiling ?
If not, is there another package that can be used to perform SLAM and then localization based on the ceiling ?

Hi,
RGBDSLAM and RTABMAP are visual features-based SLAM, so if the ceiling has enough visual features and there are some discrimitive area (for localization/loop closure), they may work. The ceiling must be also in the depth range of the camera.
Note that RTABMAP can also work with only a RGB camera to detect loop closures (localization). This mode could be used to localize the robot based purely on the location appearance (e.g., it will tell that you are "near" a location in the map, without transformation estimation).
cheers,
Mathieu

Mathieu,where can I find instructions to perform map building and localization using a single RGB camera ?

Search MonoSLAM keyword. Some newest open source approaches: ORB_SLAM and LSD-SLAM
