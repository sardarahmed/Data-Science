Q:

openrave_planning and dependencies on Debian Squeeze

Hi all,
Though I have ROS Diamondback installed and configured on Ubuntu 10.04, it's become necessary for me to also have an installation on Debian Squeeze.  I believe I have the installation working except for the openrave_planning stack.  When attempting to use rosmake to build I'm getting:
Failed to find rosdep collada-dom for package openrave_actionlib on OS:debian version:squeeze
Failed to find rosdep assimp2 for package openrave_actionlib on OS:debian version:squeeze
for each of the packages within the openrave_planning stack.  Is there a method of explicitly installing collada-dom and assimp2 such that openrave_planning will be able to use them?  Is there another place I can configure ROS to search for these dependencies such that they can be installed automatically through rosdep?
Thanks in advance for any help with this issue,

Jeff

A:

In diamondback you can update the rosdep.yaml file in the openrave_planning stack to define a rule for debian squeeze.  You can just update your local copy of this file
The rosdep dependencies are declared in the manifest.xml files. You can see the openrave package declares a rosdep on assimp-dev. Any package which depends on the openrave package will require assimp-dev through the dependency.
