Q:

How to visualize octomap from octomap_server with rgbdslam?

Based on a question asked in this link http://answers.ros.org/question/127581/rgbdslam-and-octomap/,
Mr. Felix answered, "Have rgbdslam send out the clouds+tf transformations and let the octomap_server listen." which I already did as depicted in the rxgraph attached below.

Given I had already did this, how do you visualize the Octomap? I read that the visualization tool is Octovis which I already installed but how will you render the registered point clouds to the Octovis?

I am running into the same issue for not being able to map rgbdslam to octomap with /tf issues. SInce you mentioned that Mr. Felix's suggestions were implemented in your solution " "Have rgbdslam send out the clouds+tf transformations and let the octomap_server listen.", would you be able to elaborate on how you did that ( as your rxgraph is a very tiny screen shot )

A:

The octomap server should output a view topics which you can visualize in Rviz. See the occupied_cells_vis_array topic.

So octomap can be visualized in Rviz. How about Octovis? Is not the Octovis the visualization tool of the Octomap?

Octovis is a stand alone tool as far as I know. You have to save the OctoMap as a .bt or .ot file and load this in to Octovis.
