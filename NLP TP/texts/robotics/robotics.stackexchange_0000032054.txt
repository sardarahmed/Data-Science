Q:

openni_camera slow publish rate - how to configure?

Good evening,
I'm aware of a previous claim similar to this one, but with a multi-post:
answers::frame-rate-low-and-depth-wrong.
I'd like to make a single claim since my depth values are alright, but the frame rate is low. I would like to know whether this is expected behavior, or I haven't configured something correctly, e.g. the publish rate.
I followed instructions on the page wiki::openni_camera. Here are the details.

<br/>
$ rostopic hz /camera/rgb/image_mono average rate: 7.881 **←←←← not close to 30hz for VGA mode**
        min: 0.032s max: 0.968s std dev: 0.12043s window: 202 
$ rostopic hz /camera/rgb/points
average rate: 1.663 **←←←← less than 2hz after 1200 samples**
        min: 0.017s max: 4.500s std dev: 0.55721s window: 1200

My configuration is: x86_64 GNU/Linux (ubuntu SMP), and I'm running the core and node on the same machine (single launch file).
I looked into OpenNINodelet, but it was difficult to figure out the rate since (i) imageCallback() is registered though the OpenNI driver, and, (ii) I'm inexperienced beyond this (I have not tried any other OpenNI-based drivers).
Thanks in advance for your help.
Nikhil

A:

The issue was that I plugged the Kinect into a laptop eSATA/USB 2-in-1 port, which dropped the frame rates, for some reason that I'm not willing to investigate further.
On the normal USB port on the same laptop, I get ~30hz for the images and ~22hz for the RGB PCL points.
Sorry for the trouble, I should have checked this before posting.
