Q:

What is the Name of the part I'm describing

I'm looking for a part that will do a particular function.  It has to be able to move along one axis and tell me the force that is being exerted on it.
Kind of how like a piston moves inside an engine (one axis of movement) except that something will be pushing at the top of the piston and I need to know how hard its pushing.  Another difference is that the piston won't be constantly moving back in forth, but needs to be able to receive commands like.  move x centimeters forward and then remain stationary at its new position.
I know to make this it would involved a sensor and something that can exert force but what is the name of the described machine?
Edit #1 - Response to Matthew Gordon
The piston would have to move between 0-6 centimeters.  The form factor would be small, ideally smaller than the palm of your hand.  (Smaller=better) The forces it would have to deal with are comparable to the forces exerted on a bicycle by its chain.  I'm a math/cs person not engineering so I don't know technical terms for these kinds of things off the top of my head.  It would have to be real time sensor reading, but the volume of data could be processed by a phone.  Would have to working in conjunction with wireless communication, probably Bluetooth, but I'd have to look into the latency requirements to be sure.

A:

It sounds like you're describing a linear actuator with a pressure sensor (or strain gauge) attached to the end.  
To bridge that system across bluetooth, you may want to check out one of several microcontrollers -- look for bluetooth modules, a motor (or servo) controller, and analog inputs (to read the strain gauge).
