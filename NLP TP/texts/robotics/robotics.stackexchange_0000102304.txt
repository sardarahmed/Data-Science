Q:

How to overcome Odom drift while using amcl?

Hi ros community
How to fix the Odom drift I have only used laser_scan for localisation.
And also When I was doing amcl while launching it, the pose direction is perpendicular to my robot, I played with the params and still it's perpendicular to it.i am using an four wheel drive configuration.
The TF tree is map--->odom---->origin_link--->base_link--->rplidar_link and rest to wheels
When i launch the gazebo with amcl node with parameters. In the rviz the pose array of arrows shows perpendicular to the bot on stationary and when moving its shows in the perpendicular direction and the odom drifts away from map frame i have set the 2D pose estimate but the entire robot model rotates. After gmapping what should I do for robot localisation.

Thanks in advance for answering my question

@YASVANTH-S  for safety reasons, you better upload the picture directly since ros answers supports this feature.

I can understand it CroCo but I am new to ros answers so I don't have enough karma points to upload a picture. Is there any other way to show the image.

What is origin_link? This is a non-standard name.
Which transforms are static, and which transforms can take new values as the robot moves?
In your image, which direction is the +x axis for the base_link frame?

Mike Scheutzow for the questions you have asked i have included the images kindly look into it and thank you

Your new images do not fully answer my questions. The new info I learned is that origin_link->base_link is a static transform, and odom->origin_link is published by a node named odom_pub.
Comment by YASVANTH-S on 2022-08-27:
Yes from map -> odom_link is published by amcl and the x+-axis direction to the bot is 90 degree to the lidar. In the gazebo image the red wheel which is on the red line.

A:

It was my mistake because the robot is based on Y axis but the robot should be based on X axis. After I changed my robot axis to X axis amcl worked perfectly. If anyone gets this type of problem first check whether your bot is X axis based or not and Thank for the community for answering my questions through the comments
