Q:

OpenCV GUI applications (beyond highgui)

Hi, not sure if this is the right place for this, but here goes.
I was just wondering what's the best way to create more complicated OpenCV GUIs? I've made some simple stuff with highgui in python and now I want to  add more stuff that isnt' possible with just highgui. Can I use wxpython or pyqt or something to build off of a highgui application? I'm pretty new to python gui programming but so far it seems pretty simple. Or would I want to just make the whole application in wx or qt and not use highgui at all? Thanks!

A:

This is more of a general GUI question that can be asked on stackoverflow or any other GUI sites. but if you are specifically looking into UI libraries that can be integrated with ROS then I'd say Qt would be a better option. I was able to use Qt+OpenGL with ROS and render Kinect data in a QGL widget. Thanks

Yeah I kind of figured but I thought maybe the audience here would be more focused. I am using it for a project that involves ROS but I guess this part is orthogonal to the ROS part.

blueskin, can you provide some tutorial links.If ti's possible then in C++ would be nicer.
