Q:

source command not found

Hello,
I'm trying to install ros on my ubuntu 11.10 and get it work. I followed successfully the tutorial here http://www.ros.org/wiki/electric/Installation/Ubuntu and I'm attempting to the following one here : http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment. According to the second instruction I went to setup.sh which is in /opt/ros/electric/ and modified it according to the script written in that page. But when I run source setup.sh, I get the error " /opt/ros/electric/setup.sh: 2: source: not found " .I tried to change  #!/bin/sh by  #!/bin/bash in the beginning of the setup.sh and ran bash /opt/ros/electric/setup.sh but I'm still getting the same error
Thank you in advance for your help

It would probably help if you posted your edited setup.sh file. Perhaps somewhere like http://beta.pastee.com .

Hi,
According to
http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment
you are not supposed to edit the setup.sh file in the "/opt/ros/electric/" path but setup in your ros_workspace folder created by you.
The idea behind setting up the workspace is to have the packages fetched by ros automatically.
Once you download or create a package in this workspace in the future, the ros commands like roscd, rosmake, rosed etc would be able to lookup in this path.
Once you setup the environment/workspace, your
echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH 

would give the following output
/home/user/ros_workspace:/opt/ros/electric/stacks

You have to source this path to your ~/.bashrc file so that it gets picked up every time you run the terminal.
Hope this helps,
Karthik

yes just follow the tutorial. replace ~/ros_workspace this with your own workspace path in all the places.

Thank you for answering that quickly. I set the setup.sh file back as it was (i changed only the first line so it was easy). You said that I have to setup setup.sh in ros_worspace, does that mean I have to create the setup.sh with the script provided in the website in ros_workspace?
