Q:

unable to see left image from bumblebee2

hi all
I am trying to work with a bumblebee camera to use it for VSLAM, but when I launch the bumblebee node, I'm only able to see the image of the right camera properly. The image from the left camera is very distorted.
I initially thought that my camera was faulty, but even after I replaced the bumblebee with a new piece I still have the same issue!
does anyone know how to fix this problem?
cheers,
divya
