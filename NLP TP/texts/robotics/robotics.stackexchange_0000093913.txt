A:

I fixed it. I edited file kobuki.urdf.xacro. In here, I discovered: radius of left wheel and radius of right wheel is different. OMG. Simple error but I searched it all day. Standard code is also sometimes incorrect. :v

This has been fixed in yujinrobot/kobuki#401.
You shouldn't need to edit any local files any more.
