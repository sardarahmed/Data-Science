Q:

Why do packages disappear?

I wanted to run the talker program and the listener program.
After the talker program was executed, I opened new terminal and typed "rosrun beginner_tutorials listener" to implement the listener program which had made in CMakeLists.txt at the beginner_tutorials package .
Then the display said "No such package/stack 'beginner_tutorials' ".
I'm sure I had ordered "source ~catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" before execution of the talker program, but I commanded it one more time, the program normally run.
Why did the beginner_tutorials package disappear? What was happened?

Make sure the path your package resides in is listed in ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environment variable (you can check by like echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH).

A:

Every new terminal that you open starts "clean", with only the minimal environment, plus any setup commands that you have in your ~/.bashrc
Any source commands you run in one terminal do not affect other terminals.
If you want all of your terminals to start with your ROS environment set up, you should edit your ~/.bashrc and add the appropriate setup command at the end.
