Q:

Error on launching hector_gazebo demo

I'm trying to launch hector_quadrotor demo on ros kinetic and I'm using gazebo 7 and Ubuntu 16.04 on a VM.
I followed these instructions to install required packages [Is it possible to run the hector_quadrotor demos in kinetic?] http://answers.ros.org/question/244776/is-it-possible-to-run-the-hector_quadrotor-demos-in-kinetic/.
The installatin process works fine, but I get the following error  when try to use roslaunch hector_quadrotor_demo indoor_slam_gazebo.launch :
[gazebo-2] process has died [pid 31266, exit code 134, cmd /opt/ros/kinetic/lib/gazebo_ros/gzserver /home/bruno/catkin_ws/src/hector_gazebo/hector_gazebo_worlds/worlds/willow_garage.world __name:=gazebo __log:=/home/bruno/.ros/log/f9016b82-34d1-11e7-b1ed-f780fd559947/gazebo-2.log].

A:

Have you looked at the Gazebo Troubleshooting page? This would suggest a problem with your graphics driver.
Also, any chance you are running a VM? This can typically cause graphics related problems.

Yes, IÂ´m running in a VM and I have already set up to a property graphic driver as said the tutorial.

I would suspect that to still be the culprit, even when following the tutorials OpenGL in a VM seems to be unstable. Can you run provide a gdb backtrace to figure out where the crash is originating?
