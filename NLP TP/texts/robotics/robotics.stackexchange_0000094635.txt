Q:

docs.ros.org down/broken?

docs.ros.org seems to be broken.  For example here is the link for the AsyncSpinner for melodic (I get a 404): http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/roscpp/html/classros_1_1AsyncSpinner.html

A:

It looks like there was a regression in rosdoc_lite I've just merged the fix here: https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rosdoc_lite/pull/95
With a rerun of the documentation job for roscpp the file is restored. Any other package that regressed due to this will recover any missing documentation the next time that there's a change.
