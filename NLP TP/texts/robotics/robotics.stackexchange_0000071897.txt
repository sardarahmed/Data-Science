Q:

Is jni supported in roscpp indigo?

I am writing a node in C++ which communicates with Java code. I think the most elegant way to do this is by using JNI.
Is jni supported in roscpp indego? Can anyone point me to a tutorial or example?
Thanks!

Can you be a bit more specific? In what way do you think that roscpp should 'support jni'? I'd expect that if a typical C/C++ program can call into Java through JNI, a ROS node should be able to do the same.

A:

JNI is supported since my code is writen in C++. To get it to work I added to the CMakeLists:
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "-L /usr/java/jdk1.7.0_79/jre/lib/amd64/server/ -I /usr/java/jdk1.7.0_79/include/ -I /usr/java/jdk1.7.0_79/include/linux/ -ljvm -std=c++0x")
SET(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER "/usr/bin/g++")
set(JAVA_COMPILE "/usr/java/jdk1.7.0_79/bin")
find_package(Java REQUIRED)
find_package(JNI REQUIRED)
if (JNI_FOUND)
message (STATUS "JNI_INCLUDE_DIRS=${JNI_INCLUDE_DIRS}")
message (STATUS "JNI_LIBRARIES=${JNI_LIBRARIES}")
endif()
include(UseJava)
