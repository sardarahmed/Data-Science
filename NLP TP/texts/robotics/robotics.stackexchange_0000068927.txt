A:

Do your packages still contain manifest.xml?
If yes you need to port them all to Catkin.

If they are already Catkin packages, you just need to build them with catkin_make, even when in a subfolder of src it should directly build them.

Packages with a manifest.xml can still be compiled with rosbuild, in a separate rosbuild workspace.
Comment by Che. on 2015-07-27:
as far as i can see there are only package.xml files in each package.
did i get it right that i need to catkin_make the single packages?
i just tried it and i'm getting closer. when catkin_making the packages i get the error "no rule to make target >packagename<. stop.

@ahendrix, yes but then depending on them by a catkin package is not possible.
@che you have to execute catkin_make in the "root" of your workspace
if your packages are in catkin_ws/src/... then you have to execute catkin_make in catkin_ws
(BTW: don't forget catkin_init_workspace in src)

@cyborg
when i'm running catkin_init_workspace in catkin_ws/src/ i get the message File "/home/USER/catkin_ws/src/CMakeLists.txt" already existst... it looks like i'm not the owner of CMakeLists.txt ... i've tried to change that with chown but it didn't work.
Comment by Che. on 2015-07-28:
now i did catkin_make in catkin_ws. it seems that the packages have been built now.

is it right, that i always need to repeat that as i'm adding new stacks to my catkin src?

but when i try to execute a node within a package within the new stack ive installed i get the error `package not found
