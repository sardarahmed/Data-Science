Q:

Ros-groovy packages not found for beglebone black ubuntu 12.04

I am trying to build ROS on a Beaglebone black.  Here is the history:
12  sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu precise main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
13  wget http://packages.ros.org/ros.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
14  sudo apt-get update
15  sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-desktop
or
sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-ros-base
fails with:
sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-ros-base
[sudo] password for ubuntu:
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-groovy-ros-base
Here is the ros-latest.list:
deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu precise main
I have been successful on both amd64 and Raspberry Pi ubuntu running 12.04  Not sure what is missing here.
I note
sudo apt-get install python-rosinstall
and
sudo apt-get install build-essential python-yaml cmake subversion wget python-setuptools mercurial git-core man parted diff
worked ok.

@DrBot, you mentioned running Ubuntu on a Raspberry PI ? AKAIK, ubuntu did not support (12.04 at least) ARM6. Have I missed something ?

A:

If running on a BeagleBoard Black, you'll probably want the ARM builds of Ubuntu. Instructions to install can be found on the ROS Ubuntu ARM install page.
The big difference is using:
deb http://packages.ros.org/ahendrix-mirror/ubuntu precise main

instead of:
deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu precise main
