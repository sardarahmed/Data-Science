Thanks for your quick answer!
I found this on the swig-wx site (https://github.com/wg-debs/swig-wx/blob/master/stack.xml):
This is a special version of swig needed by wxPython, which is SWIG version 1.3.29 plus some custom patches (explained at http://wxpython.org/builddoc.php). The patched latest version of wxPython SWIG is available at http://wxpython.wxcommunity.com/tools

... under the Install graphical library dependencies section of the install guide).

Is there a general installation guide which lists the dependencies?
