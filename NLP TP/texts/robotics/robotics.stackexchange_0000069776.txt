Q:

Ros NXT question

Hi, I am very very new in Ros and I want to connect a NXT robot.
My question is do i need to install Ros and Ros-NXT or is ROS-NXT-Electric enough?
I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 on a VM.
Thanks for your time.

A:

There hasn't been NXT support for a long time, but you can certainly use it with Electric. I would recommend, however, that you first try to use some simulated robots in Gazebo. The PR2 robot's tutorials are rather helpful.
