Q:

Problem with ROSARIA

Hi. I have been had this problem for so long and I never could pass this step.
I install ros fuerte and install rosaria, just as is explained in the tutorial.
When I run the final command:
rosrun ROSARIA RosAria
I have:
NonCritical Error: ARIA could not find where it is located.
[ INFO] [1358004426.341266265]: using port: [/dev/ttyUSB0]
ArLog::init:  File(aria.log)     Verbose     Logging Time    Not also printing
setup failed...
Can someone help me? Thanks

Check the aria.log file for more log messages

I had the same problem and I solved it this way:
sudo chmod 775 /dev/ttyUSB0
sudo chown username:username /dev/ttyUSB0

If this really boils down to permission issues with the serial port, the user connecting to the robot should be added to the dialout group: $ sudo usermod -a -G dialout username, after which you should logout and login again.
