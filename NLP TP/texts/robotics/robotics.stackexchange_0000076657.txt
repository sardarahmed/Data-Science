Q:

launch ros node over built-in wifi of arduino yun mini

Hello,
I want to link my Arduino yun mini with a built-in wifi with my PC (on Ubuntu 14.04, ROS Indigo) over wifi and run the ROS-node on the Arduino with the following command :
rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py tcp
or
rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py _port:=tcp _baud:=57600
But when I launch that,
[INFO] [WallTime: 1475872810.849287] ROS Serial Python Node
Fork_server is:  False
[INFO] [WallTime: 1475872810.858924] Waiting for socket connections on port 11411
waiting for socket connection
I don't understand that error because when I link them using USB connection with network port selected as my access, I don't have any problem. I searched on Google but nothing solved this problem.
Thank you !

A:

Thanks to @ahendrix, I managed to adapt its code for ESP8266 to connect as Ros serial client over WiFi. I supose you can adapt it to Arduino Yum, by creating the class WiFiHardware, that will create the method necesary to connect with:
$ rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py tcp
Please find a working demo code for ESP8266 (not Yum)  at https://github.com/agnunez/espros  that you will probably adapt with Yum includes, instead.
Have fun,
Agustin
