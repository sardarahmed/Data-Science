Q:

how to identity the grid center with saved map center?

I created the map using a  gmapping, then save it, but I saw the center of the map doesn't identify with the center of the grid when I run it this command "roslaunch e100_navigation slam_gmapping.launch".
another issue: the coordinates of the map and Odom located outside the map, I found it on the region of the grid. 
you see the  localisation of the robot outside the map
I'd like to see it on the map
what is wrong?
Any help would be appreciated

A:

If you already have created a map then you don't have to use gmapping anymore. gmapping is for SLAM : Simultaneous Localization and Mapping so you just need to localize the robot in your map.
What exactly have you run to get this result ? I assume you've just launched map_serverto get your map and then gmapping ? Instead take a look at the file navigation.launch from your package, they launch the map_server node and then they use the package AMCL for the localization.

first of all, thank you @Delb, everything is fine, I just need to create the map in the region of the grid not next to the grid.
I will use it for going to a specific position and use the map coordinate as reference. it is working with me but I want to get a small error as possible. As shown in figure above the coordinates both the map and Odom outside the map.

Can you clarify this ? Are you saying that your screenshot shows the map created with gmapping or that you want to build another map on top of your previous map ?
You should provide more info about the nodes you've launched to get this result and detail exactly what you want.

Hi,
I face the same issue with the grid not matching the map created.
How exactly did you fix it ?
Please update the specifics before marking it as answer

did you try to reboot the robot and launch it again?
