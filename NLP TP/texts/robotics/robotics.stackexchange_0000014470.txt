Q:

How's robot vacuum cleaner back to charger when battery is low?

What's technology robot vacuum cleaner used to locate it's charger when battery is low ?

A:

I can't say that all robot vacuum cleaners use it, but the models that I have played with (the Neato XV-15 and Xiaomi Mi) use variations of the Simultaneous Location and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm.
Both robots use a LIDAR as the main navigation sensor for SLAM. There is a rather nice paper available on the Characterization of the Neato LIDAR unit if you would like more information.
In simple terms, the SLAM algorithm uses sensor data to create a map while the robot is cleaning. This allows it to plan a path from its current location back to the base station / charger at the end of the cleaning cycle, or when the battery charge drops below a predefined threshold.
If you are unfamiliar with SLAM, a good place to start is the SLAM for Dummies guide produced by SÃ¸ren Riisgaard and Morten Rufus Blas at MIT.
