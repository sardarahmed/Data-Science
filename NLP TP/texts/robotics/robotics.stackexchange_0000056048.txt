Q:

Hardware to Support ROS, OpenCV, and Motor Control

I would like to build a robot arm that has sonar and camera sensors to manipulate physical objects.  I intend to use ROS for the motion planning and sensor processing and OpenCV for the camera processing.  I'm early into this project and I've tentatively picked some hardware that I think will get me in the ballpark but I'm not really sure if it will work.
My choices so far are:  1) Pandaboard ES (dual-core ARM 1.6MHz) to run Lubuntu and ROS (motion planning, sensor processing) and OpenCV for video processing, 2) a Mini Maestro 16-channel PWM motor control driver to drive up to 10 motors (with room to grow), and 3) Talon SR H-bridge controllers for each of the motors.  Note that the motors are 12V and may have max currents up to 60A.  I assume that I'll be able to run the motor encoders back to the GPIO pins of the Pandaboard to form a closed-loop control system.
I'm worried that the Pandaboard won't have enough CPU power to handle all the image processing, motion control, and motor control.  Is there a better way to handle these needs?  Perhaps a different dedicated board to handle complete PID control of the motors? If so, what specifically would you suggest?

A:

Look into the rosserial package. It works great with arduino for motor control using the polulo gear motors and encoders.
The pi_robot is another place to look for answers for using ros with arduino.
