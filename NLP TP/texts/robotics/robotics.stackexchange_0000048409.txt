Q:

Unable to launch turtlebot_dashboard

Hello,
I can not bring up the turtlebot_dashboard. When I try
 rosrun turtlebot_dashboard turtlebot_dashboard

I get
Couldn't find executable named rqt below /opt/ros/groovy/share/rqt_gui

any idea why?
Thanks in advance

A:

That's a bug in the current turtlebot_dashboard version. The new version contains only launchers and the new way to run the dashboard will be:
roslaunch turtlebot_dashboard turtlebot_dashboard.launch

(I just updated the wiki entry accordingly.)
In the meanwhile, this command should get things going for you:
rosrun rqt_gui rqt_gui -s turtlebot_dashboard

Be warned, a bunch of bugs in the dashboard have been fixed in the new version (which should get into public soon), so you may run into other issues when using the current dashboard.
