Q:

Controling my robot by ROS via Arduino

Hi, I wrote a program to control my quadrocopter with external microcontroller but i want to move control program from uC into ROS. Base microcontroller of mine robot is ARM but i want to send data into ROS via Arduino and resend it to my robot after regulations etc. I build a catkin workspace and new package "autopilot" but my idea is to create few service nodes for data regulations (aptitude, position etc.) and one client to execute them, is it good idea? I need to send data measured by my modules on quadrocopter into service and from client into quadrocopter nodes but i don't know ho to do it (how send data from rosserial to my workspace/package/example_regulator_node). Now with arduino i only created a HelloWorld and Blink example. I'm very beginner with ROS and i will be very appreciated for help.

A:

Topics are how data is moved between nodes in ROS. Have a look at the topic tutorials to see how it works.
