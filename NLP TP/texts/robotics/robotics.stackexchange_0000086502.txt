Q:

How can i read messages from a ROSbag file?

I have a bag file in which some are custom messages whereas others are string messages. How can i display the contents of the topics which have message of type strings (without converting it to a .csv file) ?
for example, From the attached image, how can i read the messages of the topic /pnc/relative_carstatus

I do have a question for you, how do you convert a rosbag file into a csv file?
Anyway, why don't you use the rosbag play to play your bag file, and then in another terminal you just see the messages passing into the topic with rostopic echo /pnc/relative_carstatus?

Hi to convert a bag file to .csv format, use rostopic echo /topicname -b bagFileName.bag -p > file.csv
And to the second part, I only have a bag file and when i play it, unfortunately no new nodes are created and no topics as well. That is why i cannot echo any topic.

Personally, whenever I use rosbag I start all nodes manually, and then play the bad file to publish on the wanted topics. I don't think rosbag starts nodes.

@aakash_sehgal please don't use an image to display text. Images are not searchable and people cannot copy and paste the text from the image. See http://wiki.ros.org/Support#Do

@kharkad how do you start all the nodes manually when you receive a bag file from someone else ?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-04-12:
I am confused: @aakash_sehgal: which nodes are you talking about? rosbag publishes msgs as if the original nodes were running. rosbag does not need the original nodes. If you're referring to "the rest" of the application (ie: consumers of msgs), that would be something else.
Comment by aks on 2018-04-12:
@gvdhoorn yes, that is correct. I wanted to reply to @kharkad 's previous comment and then realised that rosbag do not requires original nodes.
Question : that means just by playing a bagfile i cannot access the messages. am i right ?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-04-12:
You can, as long as the system on which you are playing the bag has the necessary msgs. rostopic echo should be able to show msg content though, just as it would with 'normal' publications.

@gvdhoorn Ohh yes... i was making some very basic mistake. thanks for it.
Another related question : when i echo the topic, i get data : !! Binary | and some unreadable characters below. This is the same when i visualize the topics in rqt_bag. can i convert these ?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-04-12:
This would seem to be a new question. It would be better to post a new one, provided no-one has answered this before (use google: rostopic echo data binary site:answers.ros.org).

A:

You can use Rosbag API to access messages using a simple script

Can you please update your question with a minimum working example?
Comment by aks on 2018-04-12:
@zainmehdi is it possible that i can execute this script in the terminal or do i need to specifically put this in the bagfiles directory and then execute it ?
Comment by aks on 2018-04-12:
@jayess ill try and do that and next time will take care about the image with text.
Comment by ZainMehdi on 2018-04-29:
Sorry for the late response. I hope your problem has been resolved. and to answer your question yes you can execute it like a normal script
