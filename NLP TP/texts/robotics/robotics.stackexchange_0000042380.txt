Q:

map building with rgbslam

Hi
I am using ubuntu 11.04, electric and kinect with openni.
I want to build 3D indoor map.
So I read the rgbslam (http://www.ros.org/wiki/rgbdslam).
But I don't know how to use it.
How to create maps using rgbslam?
Or Do you know other way??

What's wrong with the instructions under the usage section? Did you try them out? http://www.ros.org/wiki/rgbdslam#Usage

To start RGBDSLAM launch
" roslaunch rgbdslam kinect+rgbdslam.launch"  I see the rgb and depth image. After, I don't know what to do. how to process the image

A:

As Lorenz said, this page contains the information you need.
This is quoted form the page:

To capture models either press space
to start recording a continuous stream
or press enter to record a single
frame.

I  have tried rgbdslam before so this should work for you.
