Q:

setUpdatePeriod() in gmapping?

Hi all,
I'm tracing the code of gmapping and try to find out the parameter "temporalUpdate" usage in:
https://svn.openslam.org/data/svn/gmapping
In slam_gmapping.cpp(https://github.com/ros-perception/slam_gmapping/blob/hydro-devel/gmapping/src/slam_gmapping.cpp), it looks like the parameter is used in line#508
line#508:  gsp_->setUpdatePeriod(temporalUpdate_);

but I can not find the setUpdatePeriod() method in gridslamprocessor.cpp or gridslamprocessor.h.
https://svn.openslam.org/data/svn/gmapping/trunk/gridfastslam/gridslamprocessor.cpp
Anybody find it??
ps. I'm using ROS distribution "indigo".
