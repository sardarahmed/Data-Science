Q:

Does ROS currently install on Mint 13?

I'm trying to install ROS on a fresh Mint 13 install, and after following the debian install guide, I get stuck at step 1.5.
Rosdep -a gives the following output:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rosdep2/main.py",

line 111, in rosdep_main
exit_code = _rosdep_main(args)

os_name, os_version, os_codename = os_detect.detect_os()
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rospkg/os_detect.py",
line 404, in detect_os
raise OsNotDetected("Could not detect OS, tried %s"%attempted)
OsNotDetected: Could not detect OS, tried ['ubuntu', 'rhel', 'osx',
'opensuse', 'mint', 'gentoo',
'freebsd', 'fedora', 'debian',
'cygwin', 'arch']

I've tried running rosdep install -a --os=mint:maya, but here's a sample of what I get in return:

ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their

rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
rosconsole: Unsupported OS [mint]
image_view: Unsupported OS [mint]
carrot_planner: Missing resource pcl
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/home/nick/ros/navigation
ROS path [2]=/home/nick/ros/diagnostics

Along with a ton more "Unsupported OS [mint]" issues. My question is: does a workaround exist, or can I simply not install ROS on my Mint 13 system?

A:

For the first error, there might be a bug in rospkg. You might want to file a ticket on it here: https://github.com/ros/rospkg/issues
For the second, it looks like there are only a few packages that are missing dependencies. You can try adding the appropriate deps and testing it out  / contributing it via these instructions: http://ros.org/doc/api/rosdep2/html/contributing_rules.html
