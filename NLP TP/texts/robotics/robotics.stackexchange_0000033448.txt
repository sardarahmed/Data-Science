Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: What is tf2?

The wiki page for tf2 doesn't give any obvious indication that tf2 is experimental, though I can imply that by the fact that it's in the geometry_experimental stack. Regardless, I'm curious about how tf2 differs from tf, how far along in the development process it is, if it is targeted to replace tf at some point and if so when, etc.
EDIT: Another relevant page, though it doesn't quite answer the questions I have.

A:

tf2 is a rewrite of tf.  Our goal at the moment is to release it into Fuerte.  It is targeted to replace tf.  It is mostly a redesign for easier use in code.  It's also noteably lower overhead and doesn't require anywhere near as many dependencies.  The design page can be found at tf2/Design.
It is backwards compatible with tf on the ROS interface thus tf and tf2 can work side by side.

Thanks. I take it then that such things as having an undirected (but still acyclic) graph of frames, and not having to continually broadcast static transforms, would be off the table as they would break the ROS interface?
