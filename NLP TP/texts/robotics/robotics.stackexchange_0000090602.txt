Q:

Rosdep Init cannot download default sources

Just upgraded to 18.04 which required uninstalling ROS from 16.04 (or was I the only one with this issue?).  Installing ROS Melodic and I cannot get "sudo rosdep init" to run:
~$ sudo rosdep init
ERROR: cannot download default sources list from:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/rosdep/sources.list.d/20-default.list
Website may be down.

I see that something about the Github URLs was updated in 0.15.1 ROSDEP (https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rosdep/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst) and I'm wondering if there's some issue that is not my own?  I've tried removing rosdep and reinstalling with no success.

With a browser I am able to get to each of the URLS listed in: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/rosdep/sources.list.d/20-default.list

This file (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/releases/fuerte.yaml) states:
gbp-repos:
? You must update to a newer rosdep version by calling..sudo apt-get update && sudo
apt-get install python-rosdep (make sure to uninstall the pip version on Ubuntu)
Is that my issue?

A:

I finally got past this, thank goodness.  After lots of reading and hacking and try-try-trying again, there are a two things I did to correct this that I want to point out for the community:

I manually installed the "DigiCert SHA2 Secure Server" certificate with instructions from this site:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ca-certificates/+bug/1795242

This seems necesarry to talk to raw.github.com.  That did not fix everything by itself, but seemed to be necessary based on connectivity issues I was having.  Not sure why this wasn't already installed, but I don't know anything about certificates.  I don't know if this was the issue.
What then ultimately fixed it for me was this:

Editing c_rehash lines 15 and 16 to point to "/usr/local/ssl" and copying certificates to that location, which has something to do with making "wget work as before upgrade to Ubuntu 18.04".  I found those instructions at this site: https://superuser.com/questions/1387295/ca-certificates-is-broken-or-not-fully-installed

And I don't have the problem that stated in superuser site.
