Q:

Determine which node is raising a ROS error

I'm using Orocos with RTT-ROS integration for real-time control, and in the Orocos deployer I keep getting ROS errors like
[ERROR] [1529525996.660179901]: Unable to remove FD to epoll: Bad file descriptor
[ERROR] [1529525996.660213076]: Error closing socket [20]: [Bad file descriptor]

It comes up intermittently, and I want to know what node is giving that error so I can try to debug what's going on. Is there a way I can identify where the error is originating from?

A:

What I usually do is set console output formatting as described in answer 258929. That will print the node name as part of the error messages.

@aconkey: I would recommend looking into what @Thomas D describes here. It'll be much more straightforward.

That's great, I didn't know about this, thanks! Do you know if there's a way you can also format the time differently to be more compact? It takes up a lot of space and for console purposes I don't usually need that precise time tracking.

I do not see any options in the documentation for truncating the time field.
