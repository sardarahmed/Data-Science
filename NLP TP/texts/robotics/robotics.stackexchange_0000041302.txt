Q:

RGBD-SLAM on Windows 7

Hello all,
I'm looking to complete a similar project to the RGBDSLAM competion entry. The differences being that I will be using the ASUS Xtion pro and I am looking to complete the project on Windows 7 using Visual Studio 2010.
Is it possible/practicle to apply the source code found at https://openslam.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/data/svn/rgbdslam/ on the Windows platform? I am especially concerned with Diamondback.
Any help on this would be greatly appreciated!
