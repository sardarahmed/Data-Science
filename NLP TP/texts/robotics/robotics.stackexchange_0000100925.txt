Q:

visp foxy and galactic release fails on ros 2 buildfarm

I released visp for foxy and galactic using bloom-release.
I received a couple of emails from Jenkins saying that it fails in ros build farm, here for foxy, and here for galactic.
The tests that are failing require an external dataset that is not a rosbag. This dataset is packaged as a system package only for ubuntu and debian. When the system package is installed using apt-get install visp-images-data, the tests are able to find the dataset and run successfully. An other option is to clone the dataset repo and set an environment var named VISP_INPUT_IMAGE_PATH that helps to define the location of the cloned dataset when used by the tests.

I'm surprised to see that the buildfarm is testing the cutting edge version of ViSP available from https://github.com/lagadic/visp.git and not the last release v3.4.0 that I packaged for foxy and galactic. I must have missed something.

What is the best way to introduce the dataset needed by the tests ?

A:

The solution was to ensure that tests are passing when visp dataset is not available (isolated build)
