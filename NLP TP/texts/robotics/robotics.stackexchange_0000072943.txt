Q:

Execute sicklms 5xx

Hi everyone,
first of all I'm new to ROS and tried to read as much as I can the tutorials.
I successfully installed ROS Jade on my Ubuntu 15.04.
Now i want to use our Scanner Sick LMS 511.
So i found this thread (http://answers.ros.org/question/86246/how-to-use-lms5xx-in-ros/)  with the fork drivers on ROS Answers and tried to install and run them.
To install I used following commands:
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/  
git clone -b master https://github.com/rhuitl/laser_drivers.git
cd ..
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro jade
catkin_make
catkin_make install

After doing that i also added the Path to ROS_PACKAGE_PATH editing .bashrc.
After typing echo $ROS_PACKAGE i get :
/home/senintel/catkin_ws/src/laser_drivers/sicktoolbox_wrapper2/ros/sicklms:/home/senintel/catkin_ws/src/laser_drivers/sicktoolbox_wrapper2
So I hope the path should be right.
Now when i try to run the scanner with:
rosrun sicktoolbox_wrapper2 sicklms_5xx

I get following error :
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named sicklms_5xx below /home/senintel/catkin_ws/src/laser_drivers/sicktoolbox_wrapper2

Now I have no Idea why i get this error. Can anyone help me please?

Don't do that. It's very rare that you have to setup / change ROS_PACKAGE_PATH by hand.
Based on the commands you listed, do a
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

Then try rosrun again.
You basically added the directory with just the sources to your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH: there are no executables there, so the error rosrun gave you makes perfect sense.

Edit:

I removed the line from .bashrc and used your command.
I still get the same error like before.

Searching packages with rospack find sicktoolbox2/sicktoolbox_wrapper2 are linked to
/home/senintel/catkin_ws/src/laser_drivers/sicktoolbox2

Looking at the packages in the github repository you linked, it appears they are rosbuild packages, not catkin. So catkin_make [install] won't actually build them. If you want to use them on Jade, you can only do that from a rosbuild overlay workspace.

Edit2: I'm not sure about LMS5xx support, but I would at least go for a catkin-ized version of those packages: rhuitl/laser_drivers seems rather outdated. Even ros-drivers/sicktoolbox_wrapper has been catkinized. Status is a bit unclear, but clearpathrobotics/laser_drivers appears to have nodes for LMS5xx. Perhaps you can salvage something from there.

Hello thank you for your answer first of all.
I removed the line from .bashrc and used your command.
I still get the same error like before.
