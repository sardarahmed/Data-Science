Q:

Any place other then pyyaml.org to get pyyaml?

pyyaml.org seems to be down and thus the easy_install step ("sudo easy_install -U pyyaml") is failing for me.
Any ideas on how else I can move forward with my Diamondback os x install?

A:

Macports has pyyaml (py26-yaml). Don't know if rosdep will have an issue with using the macports version though.

I ended up reinstalling rosinstall with the following command so that rosinstall was no longer located at /usr/local/bin/rosinstall and this in conjunction with py26-yaml from ports fixed it.    sudo /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/bin/easy_install-2.6 -U rosinstall

Got py26-yaml via macports however I still have the problem "ImportError:  No module named yaml".  Appending the following to PYTHONPATH doesn't seem to work.  Any ideas?  /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/site-packages/yaml
