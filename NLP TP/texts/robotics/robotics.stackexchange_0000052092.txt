Q:

Workstation as Master [Turtlebot]

Hi,
I am trying to run the workstation as master with one turtlebot. After booting up the turtlebot as a non master I launch the turtlebot node by running minimal.launch. The node launches fine but I get the attached errors on the turtlebot commandline.
Inspite of these errors, the turtlebot runs fine but when I subscribe to the odometry data on the workstation I noticed that the odometry gets lost for long periods of time. The "rostopic hz /odom" shows "no new messages" on the workstation and there is an error ("device reports readiness to read but returned no data (device disconnected?)") displayed on the turtlebot commandline.
Here is the error I get on the turtlebot commandline:
[ERROR] [WallTime: 1371589364.129064] Failed to contact device with error: [device reports readiness to read but returned no data (device disconnected?)]. Please check that the Create is powered on and that the connector is plugged into the Create.
[ERROR] [WallTime: 1371589370.596000] Failed to contact device with error: [device reports readiness to read but returned no data (device disconnected?)]. Please check that the Create is powered on and that the connector is plugged into the Create.
[ERROR] [WallTime: 1371589377.007524] Failed to contact device with error: [device reports readiness to read but returned no data (device disconnected?)]. Please check that the Create is powered on and that the connector is plugged into the Create.
[ERROR] [WallTime: 1371589383.468197] Failed to contact device with error: [[Errno 11] Resource temporarily unavailable]. Please check that the Create is powered on and that the connector is plugged into the Create.
Thank you,

A:

This usually means your turtlebot battery needs to be charged. Or that the connection from turtlebot to the laptop is loose.

Thank you for your reply. I do not get these errors when turtlebot is the master. So, I don't think that the robot is not charged or the connection is loose.
