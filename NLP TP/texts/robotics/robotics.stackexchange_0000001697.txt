Q:

MPU-6050 + Arduino nano - Logic converter or not?

I bought this MPU-6050: link
According to the manufacture site, the sensor logic level is 3.3V (though the ebay page says Power supply :3-5v)
Should I use a 4 channel Bi-Directional Logic Level Converter (like this one) for the SDA, SCL, INT channels? or can I connect it directly to my arduino nano?
I saw some places that says I should use it with a logic level converter and some who say it's ok without it. (I guess it depends on the sensor board, so please take a look, link above)
Current Setup:
SDA <-> LLC <-> A4
SCL <-> LLC <-> A5
INT <-> LLC <-> D2
VCC <- LLC <- 5V (arduino)
GND <- LLC <- GND (arduino)

I still don't have the parts so I can't test it, and I'm probably going to use Jeff Rowberg library to communicate with the sensor (I2C)

A:

According to the link you provided, you can use 5V or 3.3V directly on the sensor (it already have a voltage regulator). Since the arduino is able to send 3.3V or 5V you can use both of them directly without any level converter.
You can see on the video here that you don't need anything 
I got a GY-80 with the same kind of features and I use it directly on my arduino nano without any level converter.
Their is also a whole arduino playground on how to use this sensor.
