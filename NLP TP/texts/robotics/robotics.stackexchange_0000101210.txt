Q:

nav2_util - no such file or directory tf2_geometry_msgs

Hello,
I have observed during building the Navigation2 from source on new PC (with ROS Galactic, Ubuntu 20.04) that the nav2_util package won't build correctly:
...
Finished <<< nav2_simple_commander [0.69s]
--- stderr: nav2_util
In file included from /home/piotr/nav2_ws/src/navigation2/nav2_util/src/costmap.cpp:19:

Failed <<< nav2_util [8.28s, exited with code 2]Summary: 6 packages finished [31.9s]
1 package failed: nav2_util
1 package had stderr output: nav2_util
27 packages not processed

I followed these steps:
mkdir -p ~/nav2_ws/src
cd ~/nav2_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2.git --branch galactic
cd ~/nav2_ws
rosdep install -y -r -q --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro galactic
colcon build --symlink-install

It seems only after installing additionally (next to rosdep):
sudo apt-get install ros-galactic-nav-2d-msgs ros-galactic-nav-msgs
Nav2 packages can build correctly.
I have searched a bit after this problem but I didn't find this as a solution suggestion. I am not sure it is even the correct approach too...
What could be the source of this problem? Any suggestions/better fixes/explanations are welcome.
Best,
Łukasz Janiec

A:

I'm not exactly sure why you're seeing that. I might recommend try a new terminal, sourcing /opt/ros/galactic/setup.bash and rebuilding after deleting your install / build spaces in case there's some odd caching going on.
I just cloned the galactic branch in my /tmp directory and confirmed that nav2_util is building fine and the binaries are also tuning over in CI.

It must have been this odd thing with cache because I can't reproduce it now with rebuilding everything again (even after removing ros-galactic-nav-2d-msgs, ros-galactic-nav-msgs) and sourcing everything by hand in known sequence. At least Google will lead people with the same (rare?) problem to this question.
