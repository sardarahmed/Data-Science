Q:

Can rosserial set parameters?

The rosserial parameter documentation shows getting parameters from the parameter server, but not setting parameters. Is there a way to set parameters from rosserial?
I'm guessing not, since the NodeHandle class only has parameter getters, not setters, but I'm wondering if anything's in the works or why this hasn't been a priority yet.

Parameters are usually set during startup/launch, and aren't normally used to communicate information from hardware to other nodes, so that's probably why there hasn't been an effort to set parameters from rosserial.

I was looking for a good way to provide several 32-byte constant values from my microcontroller into my ROS environment (unique IDs for all my devices, read on boot). rosserial doesn't seem to have a latching mechanism, so I supposed my best option is to use service calls through rosserial.

A:

There isn't an enumeration in the TopicInfo message for setting parameters: https://github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial/blob/jade-devel/rosserial_msgs/msg/TopicInfo.msg , and this is the message type that defines the wire protocol for seting up topics and services and retrieving parameters, so the definitive answer is no; rosserial cannot set parameters.
