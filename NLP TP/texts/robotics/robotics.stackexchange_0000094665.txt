Q:

Can catkin_make_isolated resume rather than restart

I'm following the kinetic Installation OSX Homebrew Source guide, which has some hick-ups.  I'm fixing each problem as it comes along, but when I run the catkin_make_isolated each time, catkin make starts processing from the start and it takes a long time before it gets to the problem I'm trying to fix.
Is there a way of invoking catkin_make_isolated such that it continues where it's up to?

A:

from looking at the help: catkin_make_isolated -h:
--from-pkg PKGNAME      Restart catkin_make_isolated at the given package
                        continuing from there (do not change CMake arguments,
                        add/move/remove packages or toggle the install flag
                        when using this option since this may result in an
                        inconsistent workspace state).

This looks like the option you are looking for
