Q:

Looking for a wheel

If this is not the right community please point me in the right direction.
I am looking for a speed measuring wheel similar to the one in the picture..
What is it called?
I have googled for a description and used an image search for google but can't find a wheel that's the same.
It is for a Square Meter measuring table in our factory. Everywhere we ask they want to supply us with an encoder that is directly connected to the wheel. This means the encoder is spinning the whole time. We don't want this setup.
What were looking for is a wheel that can be used by the pickup sensor that is connected to the bracket, and the wheel must have its own bearing.
I have added descriptions on the image.

A:

The device you're looking for is called a Hall-effect sensor. There's a decent video on how they work here, and they're commonly used as crankshaft and camshaft position sensors in vehicles.
A typical Hall-effect sensor will only send a pulse when the magnetic/ferrous object passes by the sensor, so you've got no way to determine direction. If you want to determine direction, too, then you should look for a Hall-effect quadrature encoder.
