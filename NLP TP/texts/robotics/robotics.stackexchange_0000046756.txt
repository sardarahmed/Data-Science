Q:

JointTrajectoryAction position vs /joint_state positions

I'm trying to replay a saved trajectory by using the joint_states positions and JointTrajectoryAction. However, for some of the joints (upper arm roll), the /joint_state accumulates all the movement, so its position is some arbitrarily large number (let's say 600).  However, JointTrajectoryAction seems to work on a different frame, because if I issue a goal to position 600, it ends up spinning indefinitely despite the /joint_state claiming it's very close to 600.  How do the joint_positions differ?

A:

Turns out that the JointTrajectoryAction automatically normalizes the given input between -pi and pi. Normalizing 600 to something between -pi and pi fixed this problem.
