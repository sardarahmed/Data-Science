Q:

"rosrun rgbdslam rgbdslam" symbol lookup error, fuerte

Hi,
after compiling rgbdslam successfully, I tried to start rgbdslam. All I got was a "symbol lookup error":
/home/robot/ros/rgbdslam/bin/rgbdslam: symbol lookup error: /home/robot/ros/rgbdslam/lib/libgicp.so: undefined symbol: gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer_vector_bfgs2

After searching the web for a while I found a related topic here.
So I changed the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to /opt/ros/fuerte/lib:/usr/lib and exported it but I didn't fix the error.
GSL Version:libgsl0ldbl 1.15+dfsg-1build1
ROS Fuerte
Ubuntu 12.04
Can somebody help me?
Cheers!
Georg

are these packages installed "gsl-bin libgsl0-dev"?
Comment by marvin on 2012-09-13:
yes, they are installed.
Comment by Felix Endres on 2012-09-24:
weird, that is a runtime error or a linker error?

A:

Could be that you need to deinstall ros-fuerte-libg2o (and rebuild rgbdslam)
