Any ideas what is causing this issue? I'd love to show you the cmake file, but for some reason it thinks I'm trying to post a link if I do and I don't have enough karma...

Hi, this is off topic but I have been searching the forum for solutions for using piksi with ROS. So far I have not been able to find much. It looks as though that is what you are working on here? Did you ever get it to work. Would really appreciate some help with this.

A:

You need to add the message_generation package to your find_package call if you wish to generate messages.

Hello, I have added the message generation to the find_package as : find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMONENTS roscpp rospy std_msgs genmsg), but it keep telling me that add_message_files() directory not found

@WaliD it sounds like you have a different problem. Please ask a new question.

@ahendrix I have the same error, when I enter the command catkin_make in order to compile the talker and the listener it tells me that add_message_files() directory not found.
I have already added the message generation to find_package, but it tells me the same error
Comment by ahendrix on 2018-06-13:
The OP was Unknown CMake command "add_message_files"., your error is different. Please ask a new question.
Comment by WaliD on 2018-06-13:
It is the same error I said, but I have solved the problem: I forget to add the message_generation to the file "package.xml".
Thank you

@WaliD Hi, Could you please tell me, how did you add 'message_generation' to 'package.xml' and where. any sample, please. Thanks.
