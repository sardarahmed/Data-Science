Q:

Error in Indexing ROS Repository

Hi ! The pull request for document indexing is merged. But even then, the package information is not displayed on ROS Wiki page !
Wiki page : http://wiki.ros.org/teleop_keyboard_omni3
Details added in distribution.yaml :
teleop_keyboard_omni3:
doc:
  type: git
  url: https://github.com/YugAjmera/teleop_keyboard_omni3.git
  version: master
source:
  type: git
  url: https://github.com/YugAjmera/teleop_keyboard_omni3.git
  version: master

Can someone tell me what to do to get the Package Summary ?

A:

Your PR (ros/rosdistro#20480) was merged 4 hours ago.
Doc jobs are only run once every three days.
You'll have to have a little more patience.
