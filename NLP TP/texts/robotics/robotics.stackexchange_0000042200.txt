Q:

Adding custom constraints to OMPL planners

Hi everybody,
I'm currently trying to get an understanding of the OMPL planners and the OMPL ROS interface and wondering how hard it would be to make the planners take into account custom constraints.
Custom constraints example A:
Apart from the individual joint position limits for each joint, the position difference between two (e.g. revolute) joints should not exceed a certain value.
Custom constraints example B:
Consider the growing of a tree. Would it be possible to make the added children of one node dependent of their parent? I.e. the joint configurations q_n+1 are dependent of the previous configuration q_n. In this way one could add variable joint limits.
I had a look at the OMPL code and got the feeling that the State Sampler could be the right place to add such functionality. If that is true, does someone have an idea how to easily add this to the ompl_ros_interface?
Thanks for you hints!

A:

Again very late reply -- Your intuition is correct. StateSampler is the way to go. However, that is not exposed in the ompl_ros_interface. However, in MoveIt (the replacement for arm_navigation) there is the option to supply your own state sampler. The API for that is a bit simpler right now, but the intention for it is to be essentially a wrapper for StateSampler, so you can implement functionality such as the one mention.
