Q:

error when echo a rostopic when using gazebo_ros package for ros intergration approach

Hello,
I am using the gazebo_ros packages to build my program with catkin packages and I am publishing two topics one of them I used sensor_msgs::LaserScan , the other topic I built its message that the problem happen with. The  problem is when I use "rostopic echo " on a topic that I built,
I get the following error :
ERROR: Cannot load message class for [angen_gazebo/PirMsg]. Are your messages built?
I dont have a problem using a "rostopic info" in which I get the information of this topic.
Also I can use “rosmsg show” and “rostopic info”  to get the information of the topic.
Meanwhile there is another topic that I publish and am using sensor_msgs::LaserScan type and I can echo its topic without any problem as the previous one.
Note: both  topics showed when using rostopic list
Can anyone help me plz!
thanks in advance.
