Q:

How to control robots models?

Hello.
Sorry if there is an obvious answer to this question, but I did not find it after a very long search.
I would like to know how to control the robots models which are packed with Gazebo. That's easy to add them into the world, and I did not find how to go further.
I have read the tutorial of course. It looks like I have to modify the robot description to add some plugins. That makes sense for defining a new robot, but for using a model, it seems complicated.
If you could give me hint, that would be appreciated.
Thanks a lot.

I noticed that none of the robots in the library have src with them. I was looking for some working example but I am still looking. I am using ROS with the included gazebo 1.5  - I am trying to write a plugin currently and found a depreciated example: https://code.google.com/p/utexas-art-ros-pkg/source/browse/#svn%2Fbranches%2Fprojects%2Fstacks%2Fart_experimental

Hi.
To close the issue, they are several way to do that:

develop a "Gazebo plugin", which is a C++ calling Gazebo API (answer from iche033). The robot models do not need to be modified.
use ROS and gazebo_ros_pkgs, in this case the URDF or SDF model should be adapted, w.  tags and so on, as described in the gazebo-ROS tutorial
player and do not know how the model should be modified

Thx all again.
