Q:

How can I create robot model and simulate with ROS?

I want to create my own robot model and simulate that with C or C++ code through ROS software.
But I can't find any information about that.
Please tell me about this problem detail.

A:

The keyword you should look for is URDF (Unified Robot Description Format). This format along with the associated tools allows you to create a robot model and use it with existing ROS tools (for example gazebo, rviz and tf). Have a look at this page:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/urdf
Be sure to click the "Tutorials" link in the light blue box, this should get you started.

Just as an update... URDF replaced with SDF now.. For people reading through this thread now, make your models in SDF
