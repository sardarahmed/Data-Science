A:

Do you follow the right procedure?
At first, Please check creating a new workspace on this page( http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/rosbuild/CreateWorkspace )
As I use Hydro, I check Getting rosbuild Package Sources on this page ( http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/using_rosbuild_with_catkin ).
So, I worried if the package is compatible for Hydro. Anyway, I compiled the package and succeeded it. Please look at the following.

ken@ken:~/rosbuild_ws$ rosws init . ~/catkin_ws/devel
ken@ken:~/rosbuild_ws$ rosws update procrob_functional
[procrob_functional] Fetching https://github.com/procrob/procrob_functional.git (version None) to /home/ken/rosbuild_ws/procrob_functional
Cloning into '/home/ken/rosbuild_ws/procrob_functional'...
remote: Reusing existing pack: 96, done.
remote: Total 96 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (96/96), done.
[procrob_functional] Done.
ken@ken:~/rosbuild_ws$ ls
procrob_functional  setup.bash  setup.sh  setup.zsh
ken@ken:~/rosbuild_ws$ source setup.bash
ken@ken:~/rosbuild_ws$ rosmake procrob_functional
[ rosmake ] rosmake starting...                                                 
[ rosmake ] Packages requested are: ['procrob_functional']                      
[ rosmake ] Logging to directory /home/ken/.ros/rosmake/rosmake_output-20140421-171730
[ rosmake ] Expanded args ['procrob_functional'] to:
['face_recognition']       

[ rosmake ] Results:                                                                                                                                             
[ rosmake ] Built 41 packages with 0 failures.    
[ rosmake ] Summary output to directory   
[ rosmake ] /home/ken/.ros/rosmake/rosmake_output-20140421-171730
ken@ken:~/rosbuild_ws$ 

All I want to say is to follow the right procedure. I hope you will succeed.
For next question, try to type the following, if you build fuerte_workspace with mkdir -p ~/fuerte_workspace

cd ~/fuerte_workspace
rosws init . /opt/ros/fuerte
