Q:

Moving from no layers to layered costmaps

Hello,
i did all the setting up to get my robot working with navigation 2D in ROS Fuerte. After that, I went to ROS Hydro and got it to work again. My problem is now I want to change to layered costmaps, where the current map is in a layer (let's call it Obstacles) and the person i'm following is in another layer (let's call it PersonLayer). How can I do that? Is there a more easy to understand and/or complete tutorial than the ones in the costmap_2d section of the wiki? I'm having some trouble in understanding those.
Thanks!

A:

Using Hydro automatically converts your old configuration to use layers. After you start navigation, look at the costmap parameter space to see which layers are being used.
Do you have a specific question about the tutorials?
