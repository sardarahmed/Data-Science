Q:

Question on creating a ROS Workspace during installation

Hi, I am installing ROS1 on Ubuntu 16.04. I have followed the steps up to Section 3. Create a ROS Workspace of the installation tutorial.
http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment#Install_ROS
I have executed:
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/
$ catkin_make
If I stay with Python 2.7, do I still need to execute the following two commands after catkin_make?
$ source devel/setup.bash
$ echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

Thank you.

A:

The command:
$ echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

It is not needed, however, always when you're going to use a workspace you must source the setup.bash
"This command tells which packages are inside the workspace."
And it is not directly connected with your Python Version.
