Q:

Depend on ros package in catkin package

Hey,
I am trying to depend on a ros package in my catkin package, but this does not seem to work (or at least not in the same way as with another catkin package).
I tried adding build_depend and run_depend in the catkin package for the ros package, and added it to:
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS <packages>)

but then I get the error :
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "<some ros package>" with any
  of the following names:

So my question now is, can I depend on a ros package in a catkin package, and if so, how?

A:

catkin packages are also ROS packages (usually). What you mean maybe is a rosbuild package (having manifest.xml). And no, catkin packages cannot depend on rosbuild packages, it only works the other way round. So if you want to build a package that depends on a rosbuild package, your package has to be a rosbuild package, too.

I was afraid that would be the answer. Since ROS appears to be moving towards catkin build packages, the best solution would be to convert this rosbuild package to a catkin build package?
Comment by Dirk Thomas on 2013-02-15:
You can only do that if all the packages your package depends on are already using catkin. Else they need to be converted before.
