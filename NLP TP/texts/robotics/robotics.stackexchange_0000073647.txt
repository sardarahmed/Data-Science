Q:

/bin/sh: 1: Syntax error: "(" unexpected

There must be something misconfigured with this system because the same code builds on other systems no problem. Here's the full output. Using Ubuntu 14.04 and the latest ros-indigo packages from the ppa. This is a fresh install on this system. Any ideas what it might be?

Here's the cfg file in question. It starts with a shebang as expected.
#!/usr/bin/env python
PACKAGE = "velodyne_pointcloud"

from math import pi
from dynamic_reconfigure.parameter_generator_catkin import *

gen = ParameterGenerator()

gen.add("min_range", double_t, 0, "min range to publish", 0.9, 0.9, 10.0)
gen.add("max_range", double_t, 0, "max range to publish", 130, 0.9, 200)
gen.add("view_direction", double_t, 0, "angle defining the center of view",
        0.0, -pi, pi)
gen.add("view_width", double_t, 0, "angle defining the view width",
        2*pi, 0.0, 2*pi)

exit(gen.generate(PACKAGE, "velodyne_pointcloud", "VelodyneConfig"))

[..] and the latest ros-indigo packages from the ppa.

Just making sure: there is no PPA for ROS. Do you mean packages.ros.org?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2016-04-29:
Also: how did you download the sources for velodyne? DynReCfg files should be executable, so if you didn't clone the repository correctly, you can run into problems.
Comment by joq on 2016-04-29:
You said you installed from "the ppa", but your output looks like you are building it from source. Are you?
Comment by zacwitte on 2016-05-02:
Yeah, sorry for the confusion. By "from the PPA" I mean I added packages.ros.org as a repository and most of ROS is installed that way. The velodyne package is out of date on packages.ros.org so I cloned the latest from github into a catkin workspace, which I'm trying to build.

Missing shebang causes this same error message.

A:

It looks like the problem here was a space in my "actual" catkin workspace path. The path shown above is /home/marble/mBot/ros/devel/include/velodyne_pointcloud/VelodyneConfigConfig.h but that's actually a symlink to /home/marble/Dropbox (my company)/mBot/ros/devel/include/velodyne_pointcloud/VelodyneConfigConfig.h. Unfortunately dropbox has a space in the folder name and no way to change it. I thought a symlink would work fine and it usually does, but in this case it does not.
I'm not sure if this is a bug in Dynamic Reconfigure, but the workaround for now is to not allow any spaces in paths, even if they're obscured by a symlink.

I highly recommend that you avoid whitespace in your paths. It's just going to make your life easier.
Comment by zacwitte on 2016-05-03:
I definitely agree, however Dropbox doesn't offer a choice.
Comment by joq on 2016-05-05:
It would be nice for gencfg to work even with spaces in the path, but that's hard to do for most Unix tools.
