Q:

failing to build gazebo from source due to not being able to download libraries

Hello,
Im trying to build gazebo from source for the gz-sim github:
https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-sim
from this tutorial linked in the github:
https://gazebosim.org/api/gazebo/6.1/install.html#source-install
but when I get to the part where you install the libraries, this is what I get:
sudo apt -y install   $(sort -u $(find . -iname 'packages-'`lsb_release -cs`'.apt' -o -iname 'packages.apt' | grep -v '/\.git/') | sed '/ignition\|sdf/d' | tr '\n' ' ')
    Reading package lists... Done
    Building dependency tree       
    Reading state information... Done
    E: Unable to locate package libgz-fuel-tools9-dev
    E: Unable to locate package libgz-gui8-dev
    E: Unable to locate package libgz-msgs10-dev
    E: Unable to locate package libgz-rendering8-dev
    E: Unable to locate package libgz-sensors8-dev
    E: Unable to locate package libgz-transport13-dev

what am I missing?

A:

I figured it out now. I had two problems.
Firstly, Its confusing knowing what gazebo version to use with what ros2 version. and which one to use isn't immediately obvious. Following the below guide, I saw that my version of ROS2(foxy), only supported citadel.
https://gazebosim.org/docs/garden/ros_installation
(or if that link is dead, if you're using an LTS ROS2 version(foxy), use gazebo(citadel), or if you're using the latest ROS2, use the latest version of gazebo(garden)
Second, I found the install from source guide for Ubuntu  + gazebo citadel here:
https://gazebosim.org/docs/citadel/install_ubuntu_src
