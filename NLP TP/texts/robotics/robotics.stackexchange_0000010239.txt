Q:

What are some pitfalls of an ultrasonic sensor?

I'm using a HC-SR04 sensor to detect obstacles. What are the pitfalls with an ultrasonic sensor?
Here are a couple I've found during my testing:

The signal can bounce off of one wall to another and then get picked up, distorting latency
Absorbent materials sometimes don't bounce the signal back
Check the datasheet for supported range (min/max)

A:

From my experience, don't use them for obstacle detection on high speed robots. Your'e just as good as without using them.
