Q:

roslaunch of dynamic reconfigure gui

I would like the dyanmic reconfigure gui to launch automatically from the launch file rather than having to open up a new terminal and rosrun it separately. Does anyone know if this is possible?

A:

Adding the following node element should work:
<node name="reconfigure_gui" pkg="dynamic_reconfigure" type="reconfigure_gui" />
