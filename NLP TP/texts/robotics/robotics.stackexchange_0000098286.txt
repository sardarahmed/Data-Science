Q:

no ros-foxy-ros-base for armhf, why?

On focal, why aren't there any ros-foxy-* packages for armhf architecture, like ros-foxy-ros-base?
There are just a few ament_cmake ones.
There must be a reson to this, I don't know yet.
Location of packages to look is here as described in the install manual
Appreciate any kind of tip.

A:

According to REP 2000: Foxy Fitzroy (May 2020 - May 2023), armhf (or arm32 I believe it's called in that REP), is Tier 3 on all supported OS (Ubuntu, Debian and WebOS).
That means there are no binary packages available, and the S in the table means users are required to build them from source.

There are just a few ament_cmake ones

that's probably because those are Python/CMake packages, which don't require any additional builds to be usable on arm32.
You can also see this on repo.ros2.org/status_page/ros_foxy_ubhf.html: note there are almost no green squares in the Fhf column.

To add to this, here is a discourse post regarding the tier downgrade for arm32 support.
