Q:

kobuki teleop problem

I have problem with teleop by keyboard. After bring up kobuki
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch, I cannot teleop by keyboard using
roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch. However roslaunch kobuki_keyop safe_keyop.launch works well. Could you explain for me? it seems ros packet for turtlebot 1 is not running for kuboki ( I also tested with turtlebot_follower and gmapping_demo and it didn't worked on kobuki). Thanks

Thanks for remind me.

Hi !
I tested all the packages from the tutorial on a Turtlebot 2 and they were all working (except the Panorama one because I missed a library and didn't want to install it).
Did you start the teleoperation from turtlebot_teleop through ssh ? This might be the source of your troubles if you haven't.
But you can't use packets from the Turtlebot 1 on kobuki since many topics (and some other things I guess too) have been changed. So you need to install the ones which were released for the Turtlebot 2.
