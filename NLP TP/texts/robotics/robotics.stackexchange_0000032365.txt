Q:

Can a single git repository release multiple ROS stacks?

I am setting up a repository which will contain several ROS stacks. I want rosinstall and ros_release to manage each stack separately.  I know how to do it with svn, but git seems to force the whole repository to be managed as a unit.

Is there a way to use git that meets these requirements?

Do I need a separate git repository for each stack?

A:

You need to map git repositories directly onto stacks as you cannot do partial checkouts of git repositories.  For source-based installs using rosinstall, you can get into bad states if you are using more than one stack from a single git repository.  Another way to think of it is, outside of ROS, if you were releasing a software library, you would have a separate repository for that software library, i.e. we generally map releasable units to separate repositories.
You can, however, use git submodules to create larger, virtual repositories.  git submodules are not seamless, but they are the closest to combining the aggregate 'give me everything' behavior of SVN and managing release-able units separately.
