Q:

Irobot create connection problem

I have a question about controling the icreate robot, after I run this command:
rosrun irobot_create_2_1 driver.py
The robot begins turning in the same place, and it shows the next message:
Bad data
I have restarted the robot several times, it does not work.
How can I fix it?

A:

I had to buy the USB cable, because my bundle came with a serial cable, so I got an adaptor, and it did not work. So I just got the USB, and it worked.
