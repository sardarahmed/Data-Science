Is the visualization_experimental stack still in use?

Is this stack still in use? I want to try the qt rviz stuff on my source based distro and electric, if possible.

A:

rviz_qt is now just rviz!  For Fuerte, it will be the default.  If you build from source, you can easily get it by building fuerte or unstable.
Here's the relevant announcement:

One minor correction: Murph wants to use it with Electric, so the answer there is to keep using the visualization_experimental stack.  However, all development on that tree has ceased, so there are likely many bugs on that branch that will never be fixed.
