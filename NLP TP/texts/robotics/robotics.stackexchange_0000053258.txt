Comment by Zee-Q on 2013-08-01:
Which version of gazebo are you running? and with which ROS distribution?

A:

Install Synaptic Package Manager and install simulator_gazebo from that. and run the following command.
$ roslaunch gazebo_worlds empty_world.launch

I hope it will work fine.
Note: run the ros master before running above command
$ roscore
