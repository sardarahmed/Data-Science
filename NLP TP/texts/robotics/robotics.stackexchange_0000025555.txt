Q:

Why even Gazebo + ROS questions should be asked on gazebosim.org?

@nkoenig announced in this thread.
To me, however, since Gazebo can work standalone without ROS, it makes more sense to delegate ROS related question to answers.ros.org. Indeed there have been recently many questions that are related to gazebo on answers.ros.org that might have not captured enough attention from people in gazebosim community.

A:

Gazebo is a utility that ROS and others use. It's best to keep all questions related to a utility in one place. This reduces confusion, and is cleaner from a project standpoint.
