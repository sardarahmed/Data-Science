Q:

Error with rosinstall: rosws cannot find lib

Hi,
I migrated from ros diamondback to ros fuerte.
I wanted to create a workspace with rosws as stated on the wiki, but I get this error:

ERROR Cannot find rosinstall
libraries, check your installation.
One frequent cause is that rosinstall
0.5 is still installed in /usr/local/lib. No module named
rosws_cli

I just dont know how to solve that.

Hi @KruseT, I dont know why but I cannot comment on your answer.
I followed your instructions but the problem persists. If I understand right, rosws is looking for: /usr/share/pyshared/rosinstall/rosws_cli.py. Both packages rosinstall and vcstools are up to date.
I also removed what you told me.

A:

As the error states, a frequent cause is that you have an old version of rosinstall in /usr/local/lib, as well as a newer version somewhere.
Another source is when you have updated rosinstall, but not vcstools.
So first try to update rosinstall and vcstools:
$ sudo apt-get update python-rosinstall python-vcstools

If that works, all is well. Else on Ubuntu, you can do
$ sudo rm -rf /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rosinstall*
$ sudo rm -rf /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/vcstools*
$ sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/rosws /usr/local/bin/roslocate /usr/local/bin/rosinstall /usr/local/bin/rosco

This might be "python2.6" instead of "python2.7" on some systems.
If you never had them installed via apt-get, do so:
$ sudo apt-get install python-rosinstall python-vcstools

EDIT: Please comment on my question what caused this for you if you find out, it can help us improve the support.
