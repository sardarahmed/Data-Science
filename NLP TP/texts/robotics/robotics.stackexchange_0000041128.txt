A:

Unfortunately, there is not a nxtall package for fuerte yet. Have you considered installing electric on your system? There are not a lot of libraries for the arduino and nxt, and I think the best support for those systems would be in electric (the nxt recommends you install diamondback, but the arduino rosserial system works better [from my experiences] in electric).
Hope this helps!
