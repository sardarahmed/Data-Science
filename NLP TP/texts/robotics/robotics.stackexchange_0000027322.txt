Q:

How to set up another simulation more conveniently?

This is the scenario. I open a gzserver and then a gzclient. Now if I want to open another simulation, that is, another gzserver and I want to clear out the previous simulated robot. How should I do? I will shutdown gzserver and gzclient and open another gzserver and gzclient but it is not very convenient.
Any suggestions?

A:

You can start multiple gzserver instances on the same machine using the GAZEBO_MASTER_URI environment variable. Here is an example

Start gzserver and gzclient. By default they operate on localhost:11345
Terminal 1: gzserver
Terminal 2: gzclient

Start a gzserver and gzclient on a different port
Terminal 3: GAZEBO_MASTER_URI=localhost:11346 gzserver
Terminal 4: GAZEBO_MASTER_URI=localhost:11346 gzclient

Here is a shorter version:
Terminal 1: gazebo
Terminal 2: GAZEBO_MASTER_URI=localhost:11346 gazebo
