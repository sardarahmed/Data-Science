Q:

list action servers

How can I get a list of the names of action servers?
Is there also a way to get a list of the actions that a given action server has?
Using either a cmd line or python would be preferable for me.
Thanks!

A:

Each action server publishes 5 topics (my server is named test below):
/test/cancel
/test/feedback
/test/goal
/test/result
/test/status

So you can e.g. use grep to the output of rostopic list to get the list of available actions, e.g.
rostopic list | grep -o -P '^.*(?=/feedback)'

While this works very well for me, I also opened a ticket for a new feature https://github.com/ros/actionlib/issues/44
