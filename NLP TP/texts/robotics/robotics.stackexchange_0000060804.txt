Q:

libuvc_camera: Library not loaded with indigo on osx

Hello,
when it try to run my webcam with libuvc_camera:
sudo -E rosrun libuvc_camera camera_node vendor:=0x046d
dyld: Library not loaded: librospack.dylib
  Referenced from: /opt/ros/indigo/bin/rospack
  Reason: image not found

But librospack.dylib is compiled fresh and sitting in /opt/ros/indigo/lib/librospack.dylib.
Why is it not being found? Is there something wrong with my paths?

I guess with your answer to your other question you don't need to resolve this any more?

No, unfortunately this still needs to be resolved. I gave up the isight but really need a camera. Thus I've settled for a fairly standard Logitech c270...

A:

I would start by not using sudo, which is not well supported by rosrun. Does the error persist?
If you don't have permission to access the device, change them temporarily using chmod, or permanently with udev.

You are right, i only tried sudo -E  because it was recommended in the wiki. Of course I tried without sudo before but had a different error:

ros::InvalidNameException: Character [0] is not valid as the first character in Graph Resource Name [0x046d]. Turned out the leading 0 in 0x046d was the real problem.

For the record, could you state the command line invocation that worked for you (dealing with the leading 0)?
Comment by J.M.T. on 2014-07-15:
Sure, rosrun libuvc_camera camera_node vendor:=x046d
