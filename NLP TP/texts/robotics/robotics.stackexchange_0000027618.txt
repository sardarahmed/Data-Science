Q:

Box not moving in animated box tutorial

Hi there,
I'm trying to follow the animated box tutorial. When I run gazebo with animated_box.world, I see the box in the middle of the world but it does not move. Then when I try using the gz topic interface to view the pose, it comes up but doesn't have any pose information.
I'm using gazebo 5.1

Can you run gazebo in verbose mode and see if you're getting any errors? gazebo --verbose

I just tried 'gazebo --verbose animated_box.world' and I received the following warnings and errors:
[Wrn] [gazebo.cc:186] Waited 1seconds for namespaces.
[Err] [Plugin.hh:153] Failed to load plugin libanimated_box.so: libanimated_box.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

A:

It seems that the plugin was not added to GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH, so Gazebo can't find it.
Be sure to move into your build folder and add it to the path like this:
 export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=`pwd`:$GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH

As explained in the tutorial.

I had done that, but I just realized that I used ' instead of `
It works now, thank you!

What is the default value of $GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH, i guess I changed mine by mistake?
Comment by chapulina on 2016-02-23:
I believe it is empty by default.
