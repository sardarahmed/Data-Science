Q:

building beginner_tutorials returns "No Makefile in package" errors

I'm new in the world of ROS and have just installed ROS (Fuerte). I'm trying to make my way through the tutorial steps, but I'm encountering some problems. When I execute 'rosmake beginner_tutorials' in step 4 (1.2.1. Using rosmake) I get the following messages:
[rosmake-0] Starting >>> std_msgs [ make ]                                                                                   
[rosmake-0] Finished <<< std_msgs ROS_NOBUILD in package std_msgs
 No Makefile in package std_msgs                           
[rosmake-0] Starting >>> roslang [ make ]                                                                                    
[rosmake-0] Finished <<< roslang ROS_NOBUILD in package roslang

[rosmake-0] Finished <<< rospy ROS_NOBUILD in package rospy
 No Makefile in package rospy                                    
[rosmake-0] Starting >>> roscpp [ make ]                                                                                     
[rosmake-0] Finished <<< roscpp ROS_NOBUILD in package roscpp
 No Makefile in package roscpp                                 
[rosmake-0] Starting >>> beginner_tutorials [ make ] 

The building process completes quickly and reports 0 failures.
The above messages and the short building time are not what I expected based on the tutorial information.
What is going wrong here ?

A:

I don't see anything wrong in the information you provided.
Those are not errors.
When building core packages that were installed from binaries, the ROS_NOBUILD file tells rosmake it is not necessary to compile anything there.
