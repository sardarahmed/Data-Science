Q:

Mixed publishers for robot_state_publisher?

Is it OK to have different publishers publish different parts of the joint_states topic to a robot_state_publisher node?
Consider I have a URDF with a base link B and two joints X and Y attached to that.
Can I have a nodeX that publishes to joint_states and only provides a JointState with name "X" and position for X and a different nodeY that publishes only JointState for "Y"?
