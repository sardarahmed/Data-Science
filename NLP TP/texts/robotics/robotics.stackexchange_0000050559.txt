Q:

Two cameras using gscam

Hello,
How can I start two cameras using gscam? What i have to change in:
export GSCAM_CONFIG="v4l2src device=/dev/video0 ! video/x-raw-rgb ! ffmpegcolorspace"
and here:
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/gscam/image_raw
To see video from two cameras in one window?

A:

You could use one terminal per camera and export in the first /dev/video0 and the second /dev/video1? You should then use a separate launch file to prevent that both publish to the same topic. Not sure if this possible, some camera implementations are a little basic.
With Rviz you can view the two streams. rosrun rviz rviz and add the streams.
