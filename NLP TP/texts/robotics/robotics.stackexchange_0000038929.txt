A:

I had a similar need so I wrote a simple Python node that does this for the quaternion in nav_msgs/Odometry messages. It allows you to select the Euler rotation convention and will also optionally output the Euler angles in degrees. If you want to take a look it's called quat_to_ypr.py in the starmac_tools package (starmac_common stack).
