A:

If you are installing ROS on a laptop or desktop (i.e. anything that isn't an embedded system) you should install the recommended "desktop-full" version rather than the "base" version (more on that here). I'm not sure tf is included in the "bare" version, and if you're just starting off with ROS you probably want the "desktop-full" version anyways.
Once you install the "desktop-full" version and follow the environment setup instructions, you should be good to go.
