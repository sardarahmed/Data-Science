Q:

problems installing libdc1394v2

Hello everyone. I am new to ROS and am currently working on getting the Bumblebee2 node (By Soonhac Hong, source: http://cu-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bumblebee2) to work properly in Ubuntu 10.10 for my Pt grey Bumblebee2 stereo camera . When I use rosmake to build the bumblebee2 package I am consistently getting an error:
"
Failed to invoke /opt/ros/cturtle/ros/bin/rospack deps-manifests bumblebee2
[rospack] couldn't find dependency [libdc1394v2] of [bumblebee2]
[rospack] missing dependency
"
This results in a successful build of 5 packages with one failure...
So I I tried installing libdc1394v2 as per instructions on the distributor's website... I am still having the same problem.
If it isn't already obvious, I am also quite new to Ubuntu and I'm not even certain if I am installing this package properly. I followed the instructions, any idea why I am still having problems launching this node? I apologize if I sound like a complete idiot here, I am very eager to learn more but I am at a loss as to what I need to do to educate myself. I feel like it may be my lack of Ubuntu knowledge and not a lack of ROS knowledge that is holding me back.
I have attempted to run the camera using coriander... I receive an error that states that it does not detect any camera connected to the bus. The camera works properly in a Windows environment.
Any help is appreciated! Thanks
UPDATE:
Following the instructions of user joq, I edited the manifest.xml file in the bumblebee2 package and created a rosdep.yaml files with gedit. I am now getting a new error:
"
ros@ros-SG45:~$ rosdep install bumblebee2
Failed to find stack for package [libdc1394-dev]
Failed to load rosdep.yaml for package [libdc1394-dev]:Cannot locate installation of package libdc1394-dev: [rospack] couldn't find package [libdc1394-dev]. ROS_ROOT[/opt/ros/cturtle/ros] ROS_PACKAGE_PATH[/home/ros/bumblebee2:/opt/ros/cturtle/stacks]
executing this script:
set -o errexit
No Packages to install
"
I was under the impression that the ros-cturtle-camera-drivers were installed when I installed the ROS + base version in the first place. If this is incorrect, then how do I determine if these drivers are already installed / how do I install them? If ros-cturtle-camera-drivers were the name of a package I would know what to do, but it isn't (as far as my search has told me) so I'm not sure what software you are referring to specifically.
I have gone through all of the bus permission troubleshooting per joq's advice as well, to no avail. The camera still is not working with coriander, and I also tried it using Kino. No luck. However, I was presented with another issue when attempting to add a raw1394 specific udev rule, as described at (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Firewire#Method%203.%20%27udev%20rule%27):
"
ros@ros-SG45:~$ modprobe -r raw1394 && modprobe raw1394
FATAL: Error removing raw1394 (/lib/modules/2.6.35-25-generic-pae/kernel/drivers/ieee1394/raw1394.ko): Operation not permitted
"
I'm just running into problem after problem here!
Thanks again!
Rob

A:

Maybe there is a newer version of the bumblebee2 package, I don't know.
That dependency is now out of date. There does still exist a libdc1394v2 package in camera_drivers_experimental, but it is no longer maintained. You may be able to download and compile that package from SVN, but I do not recommend it.
The simplest solution is probably to replace the <depend package="libdc1394v2"/> in the package manifest with a <rosdep name="libdc1394-dev"/>. To resolve that dependency either install ros-cturtle-camera-drivers or else create a rosdep.yaml in that package with these stanzas:
libraw1394-dev:
  ubuntu: libraw1394-dev
  fedora: libraw1394-devel

libdc1394-dev:
  ubuntu: libdc1394-22-dev
  arch: libdc1394
  fedora: libdc1394-devel
  macports: libdc1394

Your problem with coriander is most likely a common Ubuntu device permissions problem. See: bus permissions troubleshooting.
If you need more details, post a follow-on comment.
[Edit: responses to follow-on questions posted as an "answer"]
If you updated the rosdep.yaml, you should no longer need the libdc1394v2 package.
The reference to <camera_info_manager/camera_info.h> is out of date (predating cturtle). The released version should include <camera_info_manager/camera_info_manager.h>, which is part of the camera_drivers stack in cturtle (moved to image_common in diamondback). I think you have that already.
The dependencies on camera_info_manager are package dependencies, they use the <depends> tag in the manifest.xml, not <rosdep>. The (obsolete) camera_info.h does not belong in the include file of the bumblebee2 package.
You are correct that the inability of Ubuntu to find your camera is a separate problem.

Thank you so much for the help! Following your instruction, I edited the manifest and created the rosdep.yaml files in a text editor with your code. I am now getting a new error which I have described in an update to my original questions.
