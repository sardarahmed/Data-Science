Q:

Are there any robot that working with ROS Kinetic? (not turtlebot)

Kinetic Kame version is released on
last year (May 23rd, 2016).

( It is 301 days from the start date to today's date :) )
But still I can't find any robots that fully working with Kinetic version :(
Are there any?

A:

Finally I found simple one :D
ROBOTIS - TurtleBot3
The steps below works fine now, anyway they can be improve or change the repositories. I definitely suggest to follow the link above.
The Tutorials teaches installation but There is a big <TODO> under Gazebo section. Coincidentally I saw the other branch and so, I cloned develop branch :)
First:
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-joy ros-kinetic-teleop-twist-joy ros-kinetic-teleop-twist-keyboard ros-kinetic-laser-proc ros-kinetic-rgbd-launch ros-kinetic-depthimage-to-laserscan ros-kinetic-rosserial-arduino ros-kinetic-rosserial-python ros-kinetic-rosserial-server ros-kinetic-rosserial-client ros-kinetic-rosserial-msgs ros-kinetic-amcl ros-kinetic-map-server ros-kinetic-move-base ros-kinetic-hls-lfcd-lds-driver ros-kinetic-urdf ros-kinetic-xacro ros-kinetic-gmapping ros-kinetic-turtlebot-teleop

Then:
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
git clone -b develop https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3.git
sed -i 's/isnan/std::isnan/g' `grep "isnan" -rl` #May be you can get error when compiling without this
cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make && source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

And Finally:
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger && roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_gazebo.launch

Hi Orhan, do you know a robotics arm to simulate it in gazebo(I'm using kinetic too) ..?
Comment by Orhan on 2017-03-26:
Hi, no, but I suggest, If you have a robotic arm which works with old versions, run it via older way, then look at errors, try to solve them.
