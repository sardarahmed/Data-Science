Q:

TurtleBot Calibration -- Still waiting for scan

I've been following the turtlebot tutorial (http://www.ros.org/wiki/Robots/TurtleBot)
I am stuck on 5.TurtleBot Odometry and Gyro Calibration
When I run 
$ roslaunch turtlebot_calibration calibrate.launch, 
I get the following output, and the final message "Still waiting for scan" repeats forever.
Any suggestions? 
I am using the full kit that comes with everything (irobot, kinect, eeepc, etc).
Thanks!

turtlebot@turtlepc:~$ roslaunch turtlebot_calibration calibrate.launch

A:

It sounds like your TurtleBot software on your TurtleBot might not be up to date:
sudo apt-get update

then:
sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-turtlebot-robot

Thanks! That helped a bit. It now gets past the previous error, and the robot starts rotating. However, before completing a full turn, it stops and the wrench icon on the dashboard becomes red. Its says Power System: Error.
