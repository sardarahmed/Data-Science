A:

In rviz you are subscribing to the normal un-registered pointcloud. You should change that to /camera/depth_registered/points if you have depth registration enabled.
If you still experience problems you should look at the text of the warning message and/or try setting a different fixed frame.
It may also help to check if any pointclouds are published at all using: rostopic hz
