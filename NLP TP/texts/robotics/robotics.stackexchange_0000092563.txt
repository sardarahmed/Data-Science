Q:

LSD-SLAM double free or corruption

Hi,
I'm trying to run the LSD-SLAM by https://github.com/kevin-george/lsd_slam/wiki/LSD-SLAM-with-ROS-and-Ubuntu-16.04 using ROS-Melodic and Ubuntu 18.04.
It compiled fine with no errors but when trying to start the lsd_slam_core using this comand: rosrun lsd_slam_core live_slam /image:=/camera/image_raw _calib:=src/lsd_slam/calibration_params it throws a message and then stops.
This is the message I get: 
double free or corruption (out)
Aborted (core dumped) 
I'm not sure where it dumps the core but I'll attach it if someone could tell me.
I found this Issue on Github which more or less handles the same error, and there they recommend using another version of Eigen. I installed multiple versions but it didn't run, and I always got the same eror.
Hope someone can help me.

Ok fixed it myself :D it worked
I as stated in the comment on the other answer I wasn't able to compile it on another version because g2o didn't like eigen 3.2.5.
But when only using Eigen 3.2.5 on catkin_make for LSD_SLAM without a problem. 
Here's what I did.
I just sed the variable EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR to the path of the downloaded 3.2.5 one line above the include_directories 
 
hope this helps someone.
