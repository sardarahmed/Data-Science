Q:

no matching function for call to 'fromMsg(geometry_msgs::TransformStamped_ >::_transform_type, tf2::Transform&)'

Hello,
I am currently trying to cross compile the robot-localization package for a custom made OS with yocto. I managed to cross compile the other dependencies but I got a problem with this one.
I did 2 modifications in the CMakelists.txt from origin, you can see mine here http://pastebin.com/XYy53Cfs.
During compilation, it stops at 70%. I think there is a problem with the tf2-geometry-msgs library. It is included but the issue is in the fromMsg method.

A:

Are you certain you're using the latest release of the tf2_geometry_msgs package (0.5.11)? The method that it's looking for is here. If you're building from source, look at the file tf2_geometry_msgs/include/tf2_geometry_msgs/tf2_geometry_msgs.h and make sure you see that method.
EDIT: Also, you shouldn't need to modify the CMakeLists.txt file. I've compiled robot_localization on an ARM board (an ODROID U3) and it builds fine.
