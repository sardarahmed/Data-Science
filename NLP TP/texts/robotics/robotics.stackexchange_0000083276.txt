Q:

roscd/roslaunch cannot find the package that be built recently

Hi.everyone.I put some packages in my workspace ~/catkin_ws/src recently and then executed the conmmand catkin_make in ~/catkin_ws as usual.But I cannot use roscd to open the new build packages while old packages works. In my ~/.bashrc. I put source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash  and source /home/shantengfei/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash in the end.Iguess if I donot put the last setup.bash I cannot roscd any packages in ~/catkin_ws. What makes me confused is that some packages can be opened using roscd while the new one cannot. Could any one please give me a solution?

did you try running source "~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" in your current terminal? Otherwise try to close everything and open a new consol.

Thanks for your reply.I put source /home/shantengfei/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash in my ~/.bashrc, so I guess when I open a new terminal it can source automatically,right? I tried your suggestion but it still does'nt work.

whenever you open a new terminal, the code in your ~/.bashrc file is executed. My bashrc file contains source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash and source /home/username/catkin_ws/devel/setup.sh  Did your run catkin_make before opening a new consol. Is ther a CATKIN_IGNORE in your node maybe?

After running source /home/shantengfei/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash, try to run rospack profile, maybe this will solve your problem.
If you just type roscd && pwd, what is the output?
Is your package printed if you run rospack list| grep YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME_HERE?

Hi Ruben.Sorry to reply you solate. After trying the command rospack profile it worked.But if I create new package, should I execute the command rospack profile every time?

Hi @tengfei,
I've added as an answer because the comments are limited in size.
In summary, YES, every time I create a new package, I run rospack profile to make sure it will be find.

A:

Hi @tengfei
Even if you add source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash to your ~/.bashrc file, it only will be automatically executed when you open a shell.
If you create new packages, the setup.bash won't be automatically executed on the shell that is already open, then, what I do is to run the following commands every time I create a new ROS Package:
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
rospack profile

Probably only one of then would work, but I always run both commands to make sure it will find my recent created packages, messages, etc.
