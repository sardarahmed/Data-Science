Q:

why the box turn over when set velocity?

Hi friends, I am following this tutorial Model plugins.
In this tutorial, set a volocity to the box:
this->model->SetLinearVel(ignition::math::Vector3d(.3, 0, 0));

but when simulate, the box turn over, like this:

so why? is it a bug? thanks!

A:

If the box and the ground has the coefficient of friction bigger than 0, this behavior is correct. The box gets caught by the floor and tripps over. Just as in real life.

thanksï¼Œ but how to change the coefficient of friction?  In the gui, I did not find how to change it.

You can set it in GUI:
right click on the model -> Edit Model  -> right click on the link -> Open Link Inspector -> Collision tab ->  drop down the collision -> Srurface/Friction/Mu edit value

Or in SDF code:
<model>
...
   <link>
    ...
      <collision>
      ... 
         <surface>
             <friction>
                 <ode>
                     <mu>1.0</mu>
                 </ode>
             </friction>
        </surface>
...
