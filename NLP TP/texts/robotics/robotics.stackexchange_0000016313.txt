Q:

What does the number of teeth in a gear determine (when meshing identical gears)?

Suppose I want to mesh two identical gears (size and number of teeth). What would be the difference if both had 12 teeth versus both having 48? Assume the motor spins at the same speed in both scenarios.

A:

So, assuming that the more teeth that there are, the smaller the teeth become (and logically for gears with few teeth, the bigger the teeth are):
Big teeth:

Capable of handling higher load
Capable of transmitting a greater force
less likely to strip
less precise
greater tolerance
more sliding friction1
greater backlash
Less smooth movement

Small teeth:

Less load capable (for a given material and gear thickness)
Capable of transmitting a lesser force
More likely to strip under heavy load (for a given material and gear thickness)
More precise
Tighter tolerance (more susceptible to defects, and misalignment, in the drive train)
Less sliding friction1
Less backlash
Smoother movement

Data summarised from Does the size of the teeth on a gear really matter?

1 Although, in the case that you describe, with a 1:1 ration the gears will be more geometrically perfect, and friction should be minimal
