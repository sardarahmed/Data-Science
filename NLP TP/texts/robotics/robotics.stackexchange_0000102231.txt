A:

You could pass the gui launch descriptor. This is how it looks in the command line for ROS2:
ros2 launch gazebo_ros gazebo.launch.py gui:=0

This flag exists for ros1 as well

Usually parameters called similar to headless etc. could work too

@Pepis giving a ros2 answer for a ros1 question is not totally helpful. Also, the name of that argument depends on which launch file(s) the user has, so it may or may not work.
