Q:

ROS urdf_to_graphiz counterpart in Gazebo

Hi all,
is there a tool in gazebo equal to the function of ROS urdf_to_graphiz to get a visual overview of your sdf model?
Thanks for your help,
Christoph

Hey Nate, thank you for your answer. I just stumbled over that, because I thought it could be nice to have an overview of one's model like the urdf graph. Cheers Christoph
