Q:

How to build pcl in_hand_scanner

I'm using ROS Groovy on Ubuntu 12.04. The PCL I use is pcl17 downloaded and compiled from source(refer to this page). The compilation finished without errors.
I'm trying to learn recognition, and I found the 3D pointcloud model that is to be recognized in the scene is usually required. And then I found this, the in-hand-scanner in the tutorial documentation, that seems to help me build my own 3D pointcloud model for recognition.
However, I tried to find it in this folder:
~/pcl_overlay/install_isolated/bin

and there is no executable file which has the name related to in-hand-scanner. The folder is not empty. There are several executable files that looks related to the applications in this folder:
~/pcl_overlay/src/pcl_unstable/pcl/pcl_trunk/src/apps

There is a folder named in_hand_scanner in the apps folder, too.
I found some discussion on the Internet and set -DBUILD_apps=ON in the CMakeLists.txt of the package, and then compile it again. After compilation there are more executable files appear in the bin folder such as pcl_openni_tracking, but still, there is no pcl_in_hand_scanner.
What should I do to generate the in-hand-scanner executable file, or is there a better way to build a 3D pointcloud model? Thanks~

A:

You might have to enable the other flag BUILD_app_in_hand_scanner. When you run CMake, you should see a summary of the apps that it will build (usually saying XXXapp is disabled).
