Q:

Bug: Mesh file path in URDF. Cannot locate resource file://

Hi 
I've saved a SolidWorks file as an ASCII .STL, opened it in MeshLab and re-saved as a Binary .STL
When I try to test it using the file:// descriptor in a URDF file I'm getting some errors:
XML code is:

[ERROR] [1342609158.212504927]: Error retrieving file [file://home/username/path/path/filename.stl]: Couldn't open file /username/path/path/filename.stl
[ERROR] [1342609158.213501127]: Could not load model 'file://home/username/path/path/filename.stl' for link 'Mounting_link': OGRE EXCEPTION(6:FileNotFoundException): Cannot locate resource file://home/username/path/path/filename.stl in resource group Autodetect or any other group. in ResourceGroupManager::openResource at /tmp/buildd/ros-fuerte-visualization-common-1.8.4/debian/ros-fuerte-visualization-common/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/visualization_common/ogre/build/ogre_src_v1-7-3/OgreMain/src/OgreResourceGroupManager.cpp (line 753)

** Notice that in the error it looks like it may be truncating the word 'home' and trying to load "/username/path/path/filename.stl".
When I change the path to:

the mesh loads correctly.
Thanks.

So what exactly is your question? For bug reports, it's best to file a ticket at the corresponding trac: https://kforge.ros.org/robotmodel/Trac

Ok, will do that.  Originally this was a question, then I edited it when I found a solution  :-)

A:

When you're looking for a file using file:// like http:// usually you need 3 slashes to tell it that it's a absolute url.  try "file:///home/username/path/path/filename.stl" if you don't the first argument after the slashes is considered the hostname.

This syntax worked better for me "file:///$(find package_name)/path/to/file". This will likely work for different machines.
