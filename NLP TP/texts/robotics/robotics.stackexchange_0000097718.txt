Q:

How to run the autoware runtime manager through carla_autoware?

How can i run the autoware runtime manager through the carla_autoware. I have followed and run this https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla-autoware and drive the vehicle around and all. But now i would like to run the  runtime manager interface to upload different map, pcd, waypoints etc.. Also is there a way to create/ upload new waypoint files  through rviz or ros?

A:

The carla_autoware project creates a Docker container in which Autoware is run. Inside this Docker container, you can source the Autoware installation as normal (e.g. source /home/autoware/Autoware/install/setup.bash) and run the runtime_manager with ros2 launch runtime_manager runtime_manager.
