Q:

Why tod package's fuerte page instructions using diamondback pakcages?

I followed tod doc.
I change to fuerte tag.
Which tod.install contain many diamondback packages.
  - other: {local-name: /opt/ros/diamondback/ros}
  - other: {local-name: /opt/ros/diamondback/stacks}
  - svn: {local-name: vslam, uri: 'https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/vslam/trunk'}
  - svn: {local-name: vision_bleeding, uri: 'https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/branches/trunk_diamondback/stacks/vision_bleeding'}
  - svn: {local-name: object_recognition, uri: 'https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/branches/trunk_diamondback/stacks/object_recognition'}
  - svn: {local-name: object_recognition_experimental, uri: 'https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/branches/trunk_diamondback/stacks/object_recognition_experimental'}                                                

How to fix it?
Thank you~

A:

I think you face an inconsistency in the wiki, caused by a recent change of the wiki infrastructure and indexer. It probably never has been ported to fuerte. You can try to compile it from source, but I would expect a lot of problems because of changed interfaces, updates to pcl and deprecated packages.
