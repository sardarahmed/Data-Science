Q:

I don't know why Raspberry Pi didn't cognize /dev/ttyACM0

ubuntu 20.04, Noetic, turtlebot3
Right now I'm doing below thing
https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/bringup/#bringup
The Problem is that my raspberry pi didn't cognize /dev/ttyACM0(ACM1)(Opencr). And I don't know why...
I'm doing that All day long...
I unplugged many times. and then I re-install ROS on raspberry. then It worked about 30 minuates.. And then ls: cannot access '/dev/ttyACM0': No such file or directory
Again

A:

Reinstalling ROS isn't going to help you here, because this isn't a ROS problem. This error is very revealing:
ls: cannot access '/dev/ttyACM0': No such file or directory

This error is telling us that the file that should represent your hardware device doesn't exist, meaning that the raspberry pi itself is unable to connect to the hardware. As a result, rather than investigating ROS, we should be investigating how the Pi is trying to connect to the Turtlebot:

When you plug in the USB, does the Pi recognize that a new USB device has been connected? You can use view the kernel messages in wall mode (dmesg -w) to see if the operating system detects something being plugged in.
If a device is recognized, is it connecting to /dev/ttyACM0 or somewhere else? It might be using /dev/ttyUSB0 instead, for example. You can observe how the output of ls /dev/tty* changes before and after plugging in the turtlebot to see what port is being used.
Is the Pi able to interact with other serial devices? Plugging in an Arduino, for example, should result in the creation of /dev/ttyACM0. If it does, there's something wrong with your turtlebot (is it charged, everything powered on, cables fully connected, etc?). If it doesn't, there's an issue with you Pi (bad port, bad configuration?).
