Q:

No module named defusedxml.xmlrpc

I'm using robot_localization offered by ROS downloaded from gihub .It can be compiled and I haven't changed anything of it. When I executed the command: 'roslaunch ekf_template.launch' in a terminal,I got several warnings as follows:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/home/pantiq/robot/devel/bin/roslaunch", line 6, in
exec(fh.read())
File "", line 34, in

from defusedxml.xmlrpc import monkey_patch
ImportError: No module named defusedxml.xmlrpc
Then I downloaded a folder named defusedxml from a website,and put it in the robot_localization/src path,still it doesn't work.
What should I do with it?Shall I custimaze it or do something else?
I do appreciate it if anyone can help me out.

A:

It seems like you're missing the defulsedxml python package; and it looks like your probably can't run any roslaunch or roscore commands as a result.
defulsedxml should have been installed when you installed ROS. If you're running Ubuntu, you can reinstall it by running sudo apt-get install python-defusedxml

Thank you so much that your proposal really works.But here pops up another problem:
After running the command: roslaunch ekf_template.launch , I run rostopic echo /odometry/filtered in another terminal.Then I got nothing.Does it mean that the node isn't operating at all or something else goes wrong?

I'm not very familiar with robot_localization, so I'm not sure what's wrong. That sounds like a topic for a new question.

Thank you Ahendrix.Maybe I should raise a new question about it.
