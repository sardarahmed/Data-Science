Q:

Errors while installing ros-indigo on Ubuntu 14.04

I'm getting this error while trying to install Ros indigo:
Unpacking ros-indigo-desktop-full (1.1.6-0trusty-20181117-082021-0800) ...
Errors were encountered while processing:
/var/cache/apt/archives/python-catkin-pkg-modules_0.4.10-1_all.deb
/var/cache/apt/archives/python-catkin-pkg_0.4.10-100_all.deb
/var/cache/apt/archives/python-rosdistro-modules_0.7.2-1_all.deb
/var/cache/apt/archives/python-rosdistro_0.7.2-100_all.deb
E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)

I'm installing this on a guest ubuntu 14.04 in virtualbox. All these packages seem to be related to python but I don't know how exactly to solve this.

A:

Please see whether #q299091 covers this.

All these packages seem to be related to python [..]

It's not really about Python, that's just a coincidence. It's the format these pkg use.

Yes, running sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install dpkg comands did the trick.
