Q:

Error: ur5_ros-gazebo package not found

Hi!
I cloned a package into my catkin_ws/src folder with 'git clone https://github.com/lihuang3/ur5_ROS-Gazebo.git', then catkin_make & source devel/setup.bash (all works fine)
laurah@laurah-HP-EliteBook-840-G1:~/catkin_ws$ catkin_make
Base path: /home/laurah/catkin_ws
Source space: /home/laurah/catkin_ws/src
Build space: /home/laurah/catkin_ws/build
Devel space: /home/laurah/catkin_ws/devel

laurah@laurah-HP-EliteBook-840-G1:~/catkin_ws$ rosrun ur5_ROS-Gazebo testmotion.py
[rospack] Error: package 'ur5_ROS-Gazebo' not found

What am I doing wrong?
I am using Ubuntu 16.04

Did you remember to build the workspace? You can't just clone a package and try execute scripts/binaries in it.

Oh I thought catkin_make would be enough. I will try catkin build first thing tomorrow. Thank you for the fast reply :)

catkin_make is enough. That is what "building your workspace" means.
Did you also source /path/to/your/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash?
Comment by Tyrel on 2019-05-06:
The only error I see when I look at the package on github is that the python file is named testmotion.py instead of tesmotion.py
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-05-07:
That would become a problem if/when roslaunch is able to find the package. That isn't happening according to what @lr_k123 tells us, so that's something to fix first.

A:

The cause of the error is that the package is actually called ur5_notebook instead of ur5_ROS-Gazebo (see here in the manifest). The latter is only the name of the repository (and the directory in your workspace).
The following should work:
rosrun ur5_notebook testmotion.py

Thank you very much! I did not see that. Do you also advise to rename ~/catkin_ws/src/ur5_ROS-Gazebo to ~/catkin_ws/src/ur5_notebook or will that cause other problems?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-05-07:
re: rename: it's not really necessary, but if you'd like to it won't harm anything. You'll probably have to rebuild your workspace though.
