Q:

Error building Fuerte on OSX

I tried building Fuerte on OSX Lion but got the following boost error:

I was using boost 1.50.0 via homebrew.

ok, for some stupid reason I cannot answer my own question!!!  The solution is to use boost 1.49.0, for some reason (I don't understand the error message) 1.50.0 doesn't work.

Should probably ticket this anyways so the problem can be fixed.

A ticket is already filed for this error ... let's see how long it takes to get fixed because it was filed 9 days ago and there still is an issue.
