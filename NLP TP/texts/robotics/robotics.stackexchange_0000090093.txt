Q:

Qt Creator ROS plugin installation error

Hi All
I'm trying to install Qt Creator Ros plugin, but get the following error.

nvidia@tegra-ubuntu:~/Downloads$ chmod
> +x qtcreator-ros-xenial-latest-online-installer.run
> 
> nvidia@tegra-ubuntu:~/Downloads$ sudo
./qtcreator-ros-xenial-latest-online-installer.run

--version QMake version 3.0
Using Qt version 5.5.1 in
/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu

I'm trying to install it on a Jetson Tx2 running ubuntu 16.04. Current version of qt creator is 5.5.1 and QMake version 3.0. ROS installation is kinetic.
What can I do wrong. I'm following this:
https://ros-qtc-plugin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_source/How-to-Install-Users.html
using the Xenial installer.
Thanks in advance

A:

ELF: not found (cut) Syntax error: ")" unexpected

This may be a typical error when platform a binary is built for is not what you're running on (e.g. ref on unix.stackexchange.com). My guess is you're getting that error because you're on Jetson Tx2, which is ARM-based IIRC and I doubt QtCreator's binary is built for.

Thank you very much for the quick answer - I'm pretty new into this, so a can not see through all the time ;) I believe it because of the Jetson, based on your answer.
