Q:

mapping_msgs/CollisionObject.h: No such file or directory

I'm trying to add an object to my RVIZ scene, from this tutorial.
Would anyone know why using,
#include <mapping_msgs/CollisionObject.h>

would not be available?

A:

if you are using Fuerte, it would be
#include "planning_environment/models/collision_models.h"

That should probably be included via <> and not "", since it isn't really a local header file and should be in a path specified with -I .

yes. it's my fault. it should be <>. you only need to add  in the manifest and ros will do the path finding thing for you.
