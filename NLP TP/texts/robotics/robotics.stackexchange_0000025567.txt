Q:

How to convert world contact positions to robot's local coordinate?

I am implementing contact plugin on PR2. I found the contact sensor returns contact positions based on world coordinate.
Since robot can move around and my controller only accepts contact positions based of torso_lift_link coordinate, I need to convert the position from world to local. Is there any method for it?
Thanks

Take the difference between the robot pose and the contact pose.
