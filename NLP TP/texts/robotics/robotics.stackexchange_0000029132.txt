Q:

How to import an image in gazebo

Hello,
I am using gazebo and I want to create a plane/ground with road lines. One way that I have been using and it is working is via importing the solid bodies found in gazebo, minimizing their dimensions and emulating the lines of a circuit. However this takes too much time. I want to ask if someone has a video or any other reference or he/she can tell me how to import an image as my ground (then all i have to do is draw the circuit in an image editor).
Kind regards,
Christos
