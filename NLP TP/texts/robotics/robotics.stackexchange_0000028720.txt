Q:

What is an equivalent to Gazebo 9 function physics::Joint::Position() in Gazebo 7 for prismatic joint?

I was using the physics::Joint::Position() function in Gazebo 9 to get the deflection of the child link from its initial position. Now I want to implement the same in Gazebo 7, but it doesn't have this function and I can't find anything in the API documentation, that looks like it does the same thing.
What can I use to get the deflection of the prismatic joint in Gazebo 7?

A:

It's called GetAngle(). Note that this function accepts an argument representing the index of the axis. In a prismatic joint, you'll use 0.  See here for the function definition.

I was thinking about that, but the function returns an angle. How do I map this value to the prismatic joint deflection from initial position in meters?

The name of the function is confusing and that's why we deprecated it. It will actually return a position if you're using a prismatic joint.
