Q:

Trouble connecting UR5 robot with moveit! and Rviz

After following the Create_a_MoveIt_Pkg_for_an_Industrial_Robot tutorial the launch demo will not work, it reports:
ResourceNotFound: ur5_moveit_config
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/groovy/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/opt/ros/groovy/share
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/groovy/stacks
When I run:
roslaunch ur5_moveit_config/launch/demo.launch

A:

I'm using ROS Indigo, so I'm not sure if my answer makes sense foor Groovy, but I think it applies for both versions (and otherwise it may lead you in the right direction).
It seems if the ur5_moveit_config package cannot be found by the roslaunch application. So did you perform the following steps:

Download and install the universal_robot module, or create the ur5_moveit_config yourself using the tutorial?
Then build everything, using 'catkin_make'?
Setup the environment for your workspace (i.e. to set the right paths), using 'source devel/setup.bash'?
