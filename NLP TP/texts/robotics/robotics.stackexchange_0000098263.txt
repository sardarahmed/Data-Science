Q:

mkdir -p /catkin_ws/src is not working

Hi everyone, I have just installed ROS noetic on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using multimass (so I am in a virtual enviroment in windows).
I am folowing the ROS tutorial step by step and after the installation there is the creation of a Workspace using catkin, but the first command to do that ("mkdir -p /catkin_ws/src") doesn't work.
The response is:
mkdir: cannot create directory ‘/catkin_ws’: Permission denied

How can I fix that?

A:

mkdir -p /catkin_ws/src

you're missing the ~ (or tilde), which refers to your home directory on Linux.
Right now you're trying to create a directory in the root of your filesystem, which is typically not something you can do as an ordinary user.
You'll want to run something like this:
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src

or (equivalent):
mkdir -p $HOME/catkin_ws/src

Thanks a lot! Actually in the tutorial the ~ was present but I cannot write it in Windows powershell (even copying and pasting it doesn't appear). With $HOME instead it works!!!

The tutorials will assume you're using Bash, so I'm not surprised the commands don't work for you in PowerShell.
I'm also slightly confused how you're using PowerShell on Ubuntu.

I am not on Ubuntu, but on Windows 10. To create the virtual machine needed to generate an Ubuntu enviroment I used Multipass. So Windows Powershell is available.

Multipass creates VMs afaict. So it's still Ubuntu that's eventually running.
You state so yourself as well.

Yes but the terminal where I am writing remains the same, the tops rows are still:
