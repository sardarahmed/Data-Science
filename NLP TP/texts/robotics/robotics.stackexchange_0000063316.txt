Q:

cannot launch node of type [rocon_interactions/interactions_manager.py]

I'm new to the turtlebot and have setup both my workstation and the turtlebot as described in the tutorial. Both machines are running Ubuntu 14.04 and Indigo Igloo. I've been dashing my head against some errors for a while and haven't found any similar posts on the forums. If anyone has suggestions I'd appreciate them.
When I run on the turtlebot:

roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch

and on the workstation:

rqt -s kobuki_dashboard

to bringup the dashboard I can see the colour of the battery, warnings, and other features along the top. However, the content is grey and I get errors and warnings as follows:

I don't know what caused the issue, but I wiped , reinstalled, and re-made everything and it worked.

Could you mark it as resolved if it is no longer problem?
Comment by Kongaloosh on 2014-10-28:
I tried, but it doesn't let me accept my own answer.
Comment by dfk on 2015-03-10:
What exactly did you wipe? ROS? or Turtlebot packages?
Comment by Minglong on 2015-09-22:
I also want to know what you wiped? All the ROS system?
