Q:

Specifying package build order with Ament

Is there a way to make Ament build packages in a specific order? I have a package set up similar to how the Common Interfaces package is set up in Ardent (like a metapackage) and the packages get built in alphabetical order by default. I am trying to resolve dependency issues with the packages.

A:

ament will build things in dependency order. You should make sure to declare the dependencies and then it will build them in the right order. Alphabetical order is just used as a deterministic tie breaker.
