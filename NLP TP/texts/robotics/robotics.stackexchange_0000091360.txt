Q:

python rosmsg/rospack in ROS2

I have some python code using rosmsg and rospkg, i.e.
rospack = rospkg.RosPack()
lines = rosmsg.get_msg_text(msg_name, False, rospack)

how to do the same in ROS2 with rclpy?

A:

Here's what I do:
from rosidl_runtime_py import get_interface_path
from rosidl_adapter.parser import parse_message_file
m = parse_message_file('std_msgs', get_interface_path('std_msgs/msg/Bool'))

it's actually better than what you do with RosPack as parse_message_file parses the lines for you and returns a nice object with all the info in it.
