Q:

Sicklms200 model for Gazebo

Anyone knows where I can find a Sicklms200 model for Gazebo 1.6. I see that in the old versions was a model included but know it is not in the gazebo/models repository. I found the old sicklms200.model and the .mesh file but I do not know where I have to put them in order to work.
I would appreciate any help
The problem is that I got an siclms200.model file that looks like this:
<model:physical name="default_sicklms200_model"
xmlns:model="http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/gazebo/xmlschema/#model"
xmlns:controller="http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/gazebo/xmlschema/#controller"
xmlns:interface="http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/gazebo/xmlschema/#interface"
xmlns:sensor="http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/gazebo/xmlschema/#sensor"
xmlns:body="http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/gazebo/xmlschema/#body"
xmlns:geom="http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/gazebo/xmlschema/#geom"
xmlns:joint="http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/gazebo/xmlschema/#joint"

  <controller:sicklms200_laser name="laser_controller_1">

    <interface:laser name="laser_iface_0"/>

    <interface:fiducial name="fiducial_iface_0"/>

  </controller:sicklms200_laser>

</sensor:ray>

</body:box>
</model:physical>
And is not quite the same as the .sdf file for example from hokuyo laser. I don't know how to make it work, I have tried to change it to a sdf file format but still I can not make it work because I have a sicklms200.mesh file not a sicklms200.dae file and it gives me an error and does not work. I don't know why is this.
I don't know what is the best way of approaching the problem. I don't know how to update the model or how to make it work and I don't know where I can find some information. I am a bit lost.
I would appreciate any help.

Hi,
as standard Gazebo uses the ~/.gazebo folder for the models and meshes. You can put the model there, and just drag and drop it in the world if it is compatible.
You could check the tutorials page, and then update with other questions you may have.
Cheers,
Andrei

Hi thank you for the answer, but is not quite working. The problem is that the file I found is a .model file not a .sdf file I explained above...

You could just build your own sick lms model using simple shapes provided by Gazebo. It's just a few boxes and cylinders. The .model format is outdated, so as Andrei suggested, look through the tutorial page to learn how to build a model in sdf format.
