Q:

Unable to spawn object.urdf in Gazebo

Hello, I just started learning ROS recently and I was going through the tutorial for Gazebo package. When I tried to follow the tutorial to spawn an object, even  though I have already created the object.urdf file, the command in 2.3 returns the following: loading model xml from file  Error: file does not exist
Does anybody know why this is happening?
Thanks!
Tom

A:

hello, change your directory to where your object.urdf file is then type this command below
rosrun gazebo spawn_model -file object.urdf -urdf -z 1 -model my_object
then i guess it is going to work
