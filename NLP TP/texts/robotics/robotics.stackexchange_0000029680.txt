Q:

Problem compiling camera1394

Hi,
I'm trying to install the camera1394 package and I keep getting an error after running 'rosmake camer1394.' I've pasted it here:
  /home/rheld/ros/stacks/camera1394/src/nodes/format7.cpp: In member function ‘void Format7::setOperationalParameters(sensor_msgs::CameraInfo&)’:
  /home/rheld/ros/stacks/camera1394/src/nodes/format7.cpp:440: error: ‘struct sensor_msgs::CameraInfo_<std::allocator<void> >’ has no member named ‘binning_x’

I just ran 'svn up' in the camera1394 directory to make sure I'm using the latest version.  I still get the error above. Any tips?

Are you using Diamondback or Cturtle?

A:

Looks like you are trying to compile the Diamondback (SVN trunk) version of camera1394 against Cturtle. As you see, that does not work.
If you need the new features, run the diamondback version. An Ubuntu binary package is available: ros-diamondback-camera-drivers.

Awesome. It works perfectly now. Thanks!

Yes, install that binary package, camera1394 is there. If you do not already have the basic diamondback distribution, you will first need to install it, see http://www.ros.org/wiki/diamondback/Installation/Ubuntu

Thanks for the help! I'm new to ROS, so I'm a little unclear on the next step. Do I just sudo apt-get install that binary package? And then what? Should I still use camera1394, or does that package contain different drivers I should use? And do I need to install diamondback now?
