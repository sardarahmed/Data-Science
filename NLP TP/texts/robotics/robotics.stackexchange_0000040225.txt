Q:

video stream between multiple maschines

Hi There,
I'm working on a UAV which is equipped with a webcam. The webcam is running with the usb_cam package and it is working fine on the UAV Machine.
Now I'm trying to send the image-data via wireless to the base station but I can't get the messages. I exported the Master to the UAV and can even see which topics are published there, but when I try rostopic hz /logitech_usb_webcam/image_raw I don't recieve any message.
Could that be a result of two different versions of ROS (UAV = diamondback / Base = electric) or is that a failure somewhere else? would be great to get some help.
Cheers

A:

As Dan already said, you should check the ROS NetworkSetup.
In this case i assume that the error is caused by your /etc/hosts file. You should be aware that local entries in the /etc/hosts file overwrite entries of your DHCP server...

Thanks for the quick response. I worked only with the IP's to set an alias in the /etc/hosts file was the solution.
