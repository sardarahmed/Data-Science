Q:

Is there any C++ library I could use to program a robotic manipulator involving forward and inverse kinematics?

I came across robotics library (RL), but quite unclear about its real purpose. Is it a FK/IK solver library or simply an graphical simulator?. RL has poor documentation, so its not clear how to use it. Im looking for some C++ library where there APIs to solve FK/IF analytically. Thank you.

A:

The best way to understand forward and inverse kinematics is to write a library for its own. A good starting point is to implement Cyclic Coordinate Descent. 
So called "ready-to-run" librarys like OpenRave or OMPL have an extensive C++ tutorial section too but are notorius difficult to install. Most of them only run under linux, and are not even part of Ubuntu's package manager.
And a short informal note: C++ is not a high-level-language, especially not in scientific environment.
