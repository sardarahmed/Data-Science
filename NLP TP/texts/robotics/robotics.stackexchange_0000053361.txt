Q:

TurtleBot Pointcloud in Rviz

SSH'ing into my TurtleBot and running it on there is really laggy, and someone told me that this is because of the high bandwidth requirements of a graphics heavy app like Rviz. He said I should run Rviz locally and have it receive its position and point cloud data from the turtlebot. Any idea how i would go about doing this?

@llSourcell  don't use # in your tags.

A:

You should first configure your environment variables on your both computer, Turtlebot and workstation.
Put Turtlebot computer as master on both station with:
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://turtlebot_ip like:
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.1.101:11311

In the workstation do also:
export ROS_HOSTNAME=workstation_ip

In your Turtlebot laptop:
export ROS_HOSTNAME=turtlebot_ip
export ROS_IP=turtleot_ip

even local-host should be defined explicitly.
