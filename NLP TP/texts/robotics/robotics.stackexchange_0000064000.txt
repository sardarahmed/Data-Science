Q:

catkin_make multiple names

Hi,
Lately I have been trying to use the catkin_make command, with no luck. It seems some of the packages in the stacks folder have been given the same name, and so I cannot compile correctly. Now, I can't remove these, as they are shared with some co-workers, and I do not know if they are using them. So, is there some other choice for me to be able to compile on my catkin_workspace?
This is the message from catkin_make:
/opt/ros/groovy/share/catkin/cmake/em/order_packages.cmake.em:23:

Using ROS Groovy and Ubuntu 12.10.
Thanks for your attention.

Please edit your original question if you are going to add any new information.

A:

You have several packages with same name in different places on your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH and/or in your workspace:
RuntimeError: Multiple packages found with the same name
"camera_calibration_parsers":
- share/camera_calibration_parsers
- stacks/bumblebee2/image_common/camera_calibration_parsers
- stacks/image_common/camera_calibration_parsers
Multiple packages found with the same name "camera_info_manager":
- stacks/bumblebee2/image_common/camera_info_manager
- stacks/image_common/camera_info_manager
Multiple packages found with the same name "image_common":
- stacks/bumblebee2/image_common/image_common
- stacks/image_common/image_common Multiple packages found with the same name "image_transport":
- share/image_transport
- stacks/bumblebee2/image_common/image_transport
- stacks/image_common/image_transport Multiple packages found with the same name "polled_camera":
- stacks/bumblebee2/image_common/polled_camera
- stacks/image_common/polled_camera

For example, as you can see above, you have the camera_calibration_parsers package in three locations.
It is not clear to me how you got to this point. We would need to know what is in your environment and exactly how you are building (command by command) your packages to understand how you might be going wrong.
