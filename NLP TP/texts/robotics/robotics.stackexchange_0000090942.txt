Q:

ROS2 Windows OpenCV self package?

Hi,
I have finished migrating a ROS package to ROS2 and I am currently going to test it on Windows.
I had a question regarding the installation of OpenCV.
Is there a particular reason why OpenCV is precompiled instead of using the OpenCV versions available in chocolate repository?

A:

My memory is hazy, and I don't have a Windows machine to verify handy at the moment. But I believe the binary releases from upstream and chocolatey were compiled for Python 2 rather than Python 3, which is needed for ROS 2.
From the OpenCV chocolatey package description:

This package installs precompiled OpenCV binaries. This does not allow you to customize the features compiled into your installation. This download is about 193 MB.
If you wish to customize the features compiled in your installation, then you must compile OpenCV yourself.

I didn't see anything in the description of the chocolatey package which hints at the target python interpreter for current releases. If they've switched to Python 3, we may be able to deprecate our custom binary distribution in favor of the chocolatey package.
