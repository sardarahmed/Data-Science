Q:

Mouse Teleop TurtleSim

To whom it may concern,
I have managed to work turtlesim with the turtlesim_teleop_node using a keyboard but require to turn using mouse control.
i have tried to find the method and cannot find one on the internet. I know that ROS has an inbuilt mouse_teleop and i am trying to integrate it with turtlesim.
Any help?

EDIT
I have tried GitHub Repo and other Ros repositories which i found:

https://github.com/ros-teleop/teleop_tools
https://github.com/clayauld/clearpath-ros-teleop

but was still unable to figure out how to work it with turtlesim.

Have you tried Google? https://www.google.de/search?q=ros%20mouse_teleop
within the first few hits: GitHub Repo, rosindex, ...

please edit your question, don't post additional Information as an answer.

A:

I think you have to work through the Getting Started page and ROS tutorials and try to understand those. And especially this Tutorial about roslaunch.
I don't know on which Topic the turtlebot is listening, but it is most probably not mouse_vel which you would publish on if you use the Launch file in mouse_teleop.
You should probably remap to teleop_velocity_smoother/raw_cmd_velas they are doing in all the Launch files  here.
