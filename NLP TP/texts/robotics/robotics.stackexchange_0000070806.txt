Q:

remove a ros package in workspace

HI, I  want to remove ros package which installed from source. Using wstool retrieves from source and catkin_make to build.
I just deleted the package in /src, and any related files in /build and /devel and catkin_make again.
Could any give me suggestions to remove that package professionally.

I wonder do you get a more professional solution now. I am facing this problem too.

A:

That's the standard way to do it.
If you're not quite sure what to remove in the build and devel spaces you can simply remove the whole directory and rebuild.
If you use the isolated builds it is easier to remove the whole directories.
