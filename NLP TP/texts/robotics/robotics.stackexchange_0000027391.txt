Q:

How to make select parts of composite models static

In a composite model, is it possible to make one part of a model static while make other parts dynamic?
I'd like to position a platform in a static position a few meters in the air, while allowing actuators attached below it to move, simulating the platform being mounted to a ceiling. I tried making the platform model static, while making the actuator models dynamic, but Gazebo seems to interpret the entire model as static if even one part is static.

A:

Currently, it isn't possible to make some links of a model static while the others are dynamic.
A workaround would be to fix the platform to the world with a joint that has very low limits to make it almost fixed (you can try making it completely fixed by setting upper and lower limits == 0, but that might cause instability). I'd also make it very heavy to make sure it doesn't move. See the foosball table as an example, it would look something like this:
<joint name='platform_world' type='prismatic'>
  <parent>world</parent>
  <child>platform</child>
  <axis>
    <xyz>0 0 1</xyz>
    <limit>
      <lower>0</lower>
      <upper>0.1</upper>
    </limit>
  </axis>
</joint>
