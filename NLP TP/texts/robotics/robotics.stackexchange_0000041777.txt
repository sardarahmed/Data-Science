Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Export error

I think I might have screwed up something in the environment variable. Is there anyway to remove this, because I couldn't find any help to get rid of this.
bash: export: `=': not a valid identifier
bash: export: `/home/ubunturtle/ros_workspace': not a valid identifier
bash: export: `=': not a valid identifier
bash: export: `/home/ubunturtle/ros_workspace:/home/ubunturtle/ros_workspace:/opt/ros/fuerte/share:/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks': not a valid identifier
bash: export: `=': not a valid identifier
bash: export: `/home/ubunturtle/ros_workspace': not a valid identifier

Looks like a typo in an export command. We could provide you better help if you mention what command/file is generating that output.

A:

check your .bashrc file. it's in your home folder (hidden file)

Thanks a lot, managed to remove some stuff in the file. Now the export errors are gone.
