Q:

Nothing published to /scan under Hydro

After updating to Hydro, executing:
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup 3dsensor.launch
no longer seems to work correctly.
The expected topics appear, and it is possible to get some data off the Kinect: images and pointcloud data can be visualized in rviz.  However, nothing is being published to the \scan topic.
Everything seems to work fine if I grab a copy of the Groovy version of 3dsensor.launch and launch that.
The issue is the same whether I use a Kinect or Asus Xtion.
Has anyone else had luck with 3dsensor.launch under Hydro?

A:

/scan topic may not work with the default 3dsensor.launch setup.
Try this.

3dsensor.launch depth_registration:=false

Thanks! That solves the problem. Is there any reason this defaults to true?  According to the documentation for openni_launch: "If true, use OpenNI's factory-calibrated depth->RGB registration", but it defaults to false for openni_launch.  What is the practical impact of leaving it off?

It changes the type of output you get. With false, you get just depth clouds which are lower bandwidth and come out on a different topic. Changing it will break anyone using the old settings.

Good to know.  I think this should be considered a bug in 3dsensor.launch.  It will be confusing for users if different topics are "broken" based on a configuration setting.  It's also inconsistent with the behavior in Groovy.

Create a ticket on github and when people have time they can check. I remember originally setting up 3dsensor.launch in groovy so everything was on and 'viewable' from rviz (but you shouldn't use it like this because it's cpu hungry), so it might be a regression.

I tried the solution above. when I use depth_registration=false, I don't get the PointCloud2 output on rviz.
