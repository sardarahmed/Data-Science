Q:

How can I get all currently running nodes from the master in rosjava?

Is there a simple way to retrieve all currently running nodes from the ros master in rosjava?
In order to obtain all topics in the system the following works:
MasterClient masterClient = new MasterClient(this.node.getMasterUri());
Response<SystemState> systemState = masterClient.getSystemState(defaultNodeName);
List<TopicSystemState> topicSystemStateList = systemState.getResult().getTopics();

Is there something similar to obtain all running nodes?
The only way I found is to indirectly retrieve them via TopicSystemState.getPublishers() and TopicSystemState.getSubscribers() - but this would ignore nodes which do not subscribe or publish anything.

A:

While the underlying information is available, much of the master API is not yet exposed as a public API. Feel free to file a feature request.
