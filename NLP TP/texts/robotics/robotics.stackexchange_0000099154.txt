Q:

Unable to locate package realsense2_camera for Foxy

Hi!
I'm wondering, why I'm not able to find/install realsense2_camera package for ROS2 Foxy. The package is not found by the command
sudo apt-get install ros-foxy-realsense2-camera

E: Unable to locate package ros-foxy-realsense2-camera

However, realsense2_camera_msgs and realsense2_descriptions are found, but according to ROS Index, the realsense2_camera should be also found.

Could you check whether you're running into #q379190?
A sudo apt update should error with a key expired problem.

I had this issue also earlier on the day, but it shoudl be solved now, sudo apt(-get) update is working. And I think, that these problems are not related to each other.
When I type sudo apt-get install ros-foxy-realsense and press tab button twice, I get the list of the following available packages:
ros-foxy-realsense2-camera-msgs
ros-foxy-realsense2-camera-msgs-dbgsym
ros-foxy-realsense2-description
ros-foxy-realsense-msgs
ros-foxy-realsense-msgs-dbgsym

Edit: with the sync of 2021-06-03, realsense2_camera should now be available from the main repositories.

According to status_page/ros_foxy_default.html?q=realsense, realsense2_camera is not available in the main repositories yet (notice the red square in the right-most column).
That would explain why you can't install it using apt.
As to why it isn't available, I wouldn't know.
It seems to be available in the testing repository though. How to set that up is sort-of documented on this page: Pre-release Testing: Debian testing repository.
