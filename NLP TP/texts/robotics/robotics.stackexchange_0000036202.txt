Q:

specifying tcp port range for nodes

we're extremely port limited and would like to specify a range of ports for nodes to use when communicating with each other. For example: 9000-9500
any ideas how to assign specific ports for node communication? Looking at roscpp and the docs it looks like the publisher sends a connection header to subscriber with how to connect to itself. Does this means the port is already determined at this point in time? or is connection header sent through XMLRPC with the new port? It looks like the info is sent into the 'callerid' variable. Unfortunately, i haven't been able to track down exactly how this gets assigned....
how does port assignment make sure it doesn't class with other ports?
all this is very mysterious and it would be great if someone could provide even the smallest bit of info.
thank you

A:

Ports are automatically assigned by the system when the publishers socket is created.  The tcp and udp code would need to be modified to constrain the ports within a range.  After the listening port is opened, it is registered on the master so that the other nodes can contact it when they want to connect to it.  (The client side ports are also auto assigned.)

so in other words, the port selection happens in the linux kernel somewhere, interesting. that would explain why there's only calls to get the port. thanks!
