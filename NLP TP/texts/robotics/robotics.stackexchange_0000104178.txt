Q:

process has died [pid 8941, exit code 127, cmd 'gzserver -slibgazebo_ros_init.so

I am launching gazebo with ros2 launch gazebo_ros gazebo.launch.py Gazebo is not launched and is showing the following error:
[INFO] [launch]: All log files can be found below /home/dell/.ros/log/2023-09-17-13-44-45-896306-ubuntu22-8940

[ERROR] [gzclient-2]: process has died [pid 8943, exit code 255, cmd 'gzclient'].

all packages and plugins for gazebo-ros are installed by sudo apt install ros-humble-gazebo-*
