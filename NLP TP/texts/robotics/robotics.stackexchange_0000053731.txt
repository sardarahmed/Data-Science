Q:

Teleop control not working in Turtlebot Simulator package and Gazebo

currently following the tutorial @
http:// www.ros.org/wiki/turtlebot_simulator/Tutorials/hydro/Explore%20the%20Gazebo%20world
Everything else seems to work fine. The model loads into gazebo and the pointclooud image can be seen in Rviz. But I cannot control the turtlebot using the teleop keyboard configuration.
I'm using the newest Gazebo(1.9) and ros Hydro is installed.
If I try to use the $ roslaunch kobuki_keyop keyop.launch command it tells me Keyop can not connect. I'm not sure if they've started on different servers and are unable to communicate.

A:

Assuming you are using Hydro sources, I commited a fix for the turtlebot teleop on monday, so a git pull on turtlebot_simulator should fix it.
Kobuki keyop also should work if you have all the latest code. The "could not connect" warning appears because before the enable/disable commands where not simulated on Gazebo, but they are now.
Please also ensure you use the latest Gazebo and SDF versions.
If you don't wont to mangle with code, all these changes will be released together with the official Hydro release.

No, don't wait!  :-) Get the sources, test it and let us know what's not working.
This will help us polishing the code for the release!

I'll definitely give it a go. How hard can it be, right? :)
