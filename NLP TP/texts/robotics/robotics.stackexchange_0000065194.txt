A:

There are two common causes for problems like this:

You don't have the uvc_camera package installed. Try installing it by using sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-uvc-camera
You've checked out the uvc_camera package from source, but haven't compiled it. Either compile it, or remove it from your workspace and install it through apt (see #1)

Hi sir, how do we edit the uvc_camera launch folder to launch a usb camera asus xtion pro live. Awesome help by the way thanks in advance!

The Asus Xtion Pro Live isn't a normal USB camera; you should use the openni or openni2 drivers for it. If you're having trouble with it, please ask a new question.
