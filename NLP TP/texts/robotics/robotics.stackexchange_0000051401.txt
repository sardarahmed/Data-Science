Q:

OGRE linking to boost fails, OSX 10.7

Trying to install groovy on my mac running lion.  After appropriate tapping and following the instructions, brew install ogre (or brew install ros/groovy/ogre) gets me the following.  I noticed in one of the patches that boost versions are only listed for up to 1.46.1, so I also tried reverting back to that version of boost via homebrew.  I was using the newest in the homebrew repo, 1.53.0.  It seems as though its just not getting the right flags, but I was concerned at it seems no one else has had this problem.  Any help is appreciated.  Thanks.

I am not sure what the problem is, but all I can tell you is that I use boost 1.53 and it works fine for me.

I can reproduce this problem now, looks like Ogre is going to need a patch of some sort.

A:

I just posted a fix to the ogre formulae on the ros-groovy tap:
https://github.com/ros/homebrew-groovy/commit/12e84193bb59f7230d8523b3e44726906fd66aac
Try doing:
$ brew update
$ brew install ogre

Let me know if it doesn't work for you.
