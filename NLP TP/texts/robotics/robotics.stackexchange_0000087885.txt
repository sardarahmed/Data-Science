Q:

Cannot use rosserial_server

Hi,
I want to use rosserial_server for high speed communication.
But, I use rosserial_server serial_node.cpp
$ rosrun rosserial _server serial_node

I get the error message
[INFO] [1531356226.107258127] Opened /dev/ttyACM0

[WARN] [1531356226.117567124] Socket asio error, closing socket: asio.misc:2

[WARN] [1531356228.119077841] Socket asio error, closing socket: asio.misc:2

 ...

So,What do I do to solve this error?
(I use Ubuntu16.04LTS,kinetic,ros_lib_kinetic)

A:

According to  rreignier
"reboot the computer and do not use rosserial_python before to avoid any conflict in the serial port communication"
I can use rosserial_server by this way.
