Q:

Forward / remap multiple topics to a single topic?

Is there already a way to forward / aggregate multiple topics to a single topic?
I tried remapping with rostopic echo, but found that the last remapping argument takes precedence.
Example in bash:
# Spin up unique publishers
rostopic pub -r 5 /test/a std_msgs/Float64 "data: 0.0" &
rostopic pub -r 5 /test/b std_msgs/Float64 "data: 20.0" &

# Echo with remapping
rostopic echo /test/c /test/c:=/test/a /test/c:=/test/b

The output shows '20.0', meaning b's data is the only one getting through.
For the time being, I wrote a script to aggregate the topics: topic_aggregator.py

A:

Will topic_tools/relay do what you want?

Seems like it only handles a single topic. I tried out topic_tools/mux, which handles multiple topics, but running rostopic echo only showed '0.0'. Will look a little more into it.

mux switches between topics, it doesn't merge them.

If I understand your question correctly, two instances of relay should do what you want, one that does /test/a -> /test/c and one that does /test/b -> /test/c

Ah, that works. Thank you!
