Q:

Confused adding header files in ROS2

From the migration tutorial : LINK
It is obvious that I need to specify a subfolder msg and replace .h to .hpp.
However, I can see some different situation with ROS2 tf2 package: LINK
It seems that I need to add the <tf2/LinearMath/Quaternion.h> as in ROS1 like this:
#include "tf2/LinearMath/Quaternion.h"

Can someone suggest me the correct way of including this header file in ROS2?

A:

There's a geometry_msgs/msg/quaternion.hpp that is the replacement of geometry_msgs/Quaternion.h in ros1. tf2/LinearMath/Quaternion.h is not a message, it doesn't have a changed path or capitalization or extension (yet?) from ros1 to ros2 so the same include will work.  This http://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Tutorials/Quaternions#Components_of_a_quaternion still applies:

ROS uses two quaternion datatypes: msg and 'tf.' To convert between them in C++, use the methods of tf/transform_datatypes.
