Q:

Using amcl with 360° laser, periodically update without rotating operations

Hi all,
I have a robot with 3 lasers. It can update costmaps in 360°. Using amcl's global_localization service isn't useful without rotating robot.  How can I calculate robot's pose periodically?

A:

global_localization is a feature to (re-)initialize amcl's particle filter by spreading estimates throughout the entire map. It is meant to be called only occasionally if the robot gets lost, certainly not "continuously". And yes, it typically requires some motion from the robot to make the filter converge. Calculating the robot's pose continuously is the task of amcl in general, not specifically of the global_localization service.
See this thread for using multiple laser scans with amcl.

Thank you, Is there a way to update amcl continuously with single laser?
Comment by al-dev on 2016-03-24:
By continuously do you mean periodically, without moving the robot ?  Not with the default implementation of amcl, the filter is only updated when one of the thresholds controlled by update_min_d (distance) and update_min_a (angle) is exceeded.

Yes, I mean periodically without moving robot. Thank you for an answer.
