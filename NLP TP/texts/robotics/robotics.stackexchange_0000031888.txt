Q:

How to control pr2 head in gazebo

Hi all,
I'm trying to control pr2's head (i.e., moving up and down, left and right) in simulation, but couldn't get it working. To this effort, I start with playing with controlling right gripper as in the tutorial (http://www.ros.org/wiki/pr2_simulator/Tutorials/BasicPR2Controls). However, publishing a command does not seem to work (?!). It did not change anything. Actually I do not know what to expect..
Can anyone give me some directions of controlling pr2's head? Thanks a lot.

A:

if you want to control the head of the PR2 you should send goals to the pr2_head_action (http://www.ros.org/wiki/pr2_head_action). The pr2_controllers and pr2_common_actions packages many of the basic actions available for controlling the PR2
