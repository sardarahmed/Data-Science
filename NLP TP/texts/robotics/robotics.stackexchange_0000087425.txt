Q:

Where do I turn off CATKIN_ENABLE_TESTING?

What's the right way to set this? I imagine I could muck with /opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/cmake/toplevel.cmake, but somehow that doesn't strike me as the Right Thing.

A:

According to the how to of the catkin docs, you can disable CATKIN_ENABLE_TESTING by using
catkin_make -DCATKIN_ENABLE_TESTING=0

Not sure why googling didn't bring that up; thanks.

To be fair, it took me a while to find it combined with searching the catkin repo.

@jayess: you may want to link to the rendered version of the catkin docs instead: here. The github link would allow you to link to a specific line though, which may be nice.
