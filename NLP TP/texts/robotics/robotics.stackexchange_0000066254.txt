Q:

how to double the resolution of the map?

Hello,
i did the SLAM Map Building with TurtleBot,got a map( width :576,height:512) and  a yaml file that goes with my  pgm map. Its resolution is 0.05,but the SBPL Lattice planner has a map resolution 0.025,  i want  to  change  my map's  resolution  is 0.025.There has been a  similar problem  .
Question:   what should  i do  to my pgm map  with the gimp software to change my pgm map's resolution?
Thanks for  your help !!

A:

In Gimp, use the Image -> Scale Image tool, and double the X and Y size of the image.
In your map.yaml, set the resolution to 0.025:
resolution: 0.025

thanks @ahendrix,it's very very clear.By the way ,there is  a link , @dornhege suggests that   we should not change the resolution after building a map,what do you  see this  idea ?

You cannot change the resolution without scaling the image also. Unless this is not possible I would usually just rebuilt the map with the target resolution.

@jxl Have you try to generate your own primitive file(*.mprim) with your resolution in SBPL??? May be it works
