Q:

Constraining Joint angles of a UR5 arm while motion planning in moveit

I'm using ROS noetic on ubuntu 20.04.3. I have to move my robotic arm towards white coloured object (goal) but while planning the moveit plans a path including weird trajectories and I read somewhere that to avoid this we can constraint the end effector joint angles but I'm not sure how to do this as I'm a beginner to this. Any help would be appreciated
