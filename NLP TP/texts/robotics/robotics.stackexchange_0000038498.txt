A:

Short Answer: This is due to the teleop_base being deprecated for a while.
Longer Answer: The Joy message is no longer in the joy package, but has instead been moved to sensor_msgs.  You could probably update teleop_base to reflect theses changes (the manifest.xml and the actual source files will have to be updated at a minimum).
Probably the better answer is to write a simple "glue" node that will change the Joy messages that your device (ps3joy, etc) puts out, and changes them into appropriately scaled Twist messages published on /cmd_vel.
The other option is to use a pre-made generic teleop node, like https://github.com/skynetish/teleop
