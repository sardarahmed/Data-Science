Q:

Moveit! Using solve type speed instead of distance

I switched to using trac_ik for my kinematics plugin and set the solve type to distance. Here's my kinematics.yaml
manipulator:
  kinematics_solver: trac_ik_kinematics_plugin/TRAC_IKKinematicsPlugin
  solve_type: Distance
  kinematics_solver_search_resolution: 0.002
  kinematics_solver_timeout: 0.1
  kinematics_solver_attempts: 300

However, when I launch MoveIt I get the following messages:
[ INFO] [1498738699.604294668]: Looking in private handle: /move_group_commander_wrappers_1498738699102337314 for param name: manipulator/solve_type
[ INFO] [1498738699.605287670]: Using solve type Speed

Am I setting the solve type incorrectly for use in MoveIt?

EDIT: I added
 <group ns="move_group">
    <rosparam command="load" file="$(find PACKAGE_NAME)/config/kinematics.yaml"/>
  </group>

to the start of my move_group.launch file. MoveIt! now displays the correct solve type on launch, but when I run code to move my robot, the terminal running my code still says its using solve type Speed.

A:

This is a bug in where parameters are expected to be by MoveIt and the plugins.
Have a look at this issue for details and a workaround:

A proper fix for upstream MoveIt would be highly appreciated! :)

I edited my question, do I need to change some other files to get this to work with my code?
