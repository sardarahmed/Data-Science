Q:

PointCloud Input to costmap_2d

I am trying to add an additional PointCloud to the costmap_2d list of things to avoid (when doing PR2 navigation). I have added the proper information to the observation_sources parameter.
However, my PointCloud is not being avoided properly, despite the move_base node subscribing to the topic. When comparing my PointCloud messages to the /ground_object_cloud PointCloud data, I noticed that that PointCloud had four Channels of extra data: intensities, index, distances,  and stamps. Are these necessary input for costmap_2d, and if so, what do they mean?

A:

It turned out that the problem was not the parameters Lorenz mentioned (although he helped me narrow down the possibilities, for which I'm grateful). It turns out that just changing the frame helped.
I had originally been trying to add points in the /map frame (related to my previous question) which wasn't being processed by the cost map. I changed the node that was publishing the points to translate them to /base_laser_link and that fixed the problem, at least for now (in that it is taking the points into consideration, even if it sometimes causes problems).
I haven't dug into the code yet to figure out if that is a bug or a feature yet.

Is there any chance you can post your .yaml file for this? I am attempting to get costmap_2d to subscribe to /kinect2/hd/points but it seems my parameters are not correct. Thanks.
