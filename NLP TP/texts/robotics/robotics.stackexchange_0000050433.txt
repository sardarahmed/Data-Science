Q:

urdf_tutorial Groovy vs. Fuerte

Hi,
i just installed ROS Groovy within Ubuntu 12.10 ( native (full) and virtualized (lean install) )
In both Groovy installations the tutorial "Building a Visual Robot Model with URDF from Scratch" fails.
It brings NO USEFUL OUTPUT. RViz keeps an useless small window without any content.
None of the logfiles shows some kind of error.
In an freshly installed ROS Fuerte on Ubuntu 12.04 the same tutorial runs immedeately as suspected.
Does somebody know what to do to bring this tutorial up and running in Groovy?
Should I keep my fingers of Groovy?
Thanks in advance.

A:

I've made a .rviz version here: https://raw.github.com/DLu/robot_model_tutorials/master/urdf_tutorial/urdf.rviz
Save this file in the urdf_tutorial directory and change instances of urdf.vcg ot urdf.rviz
