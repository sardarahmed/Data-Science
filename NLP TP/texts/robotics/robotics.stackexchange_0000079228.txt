Q:

A manipulator with gripper for simulation

I am experimenting with high level manipulation tasks and wish to see the results in simulation. I would like to use Moveit for motion planning and observe the simulated results in Gazebo.
I need some suggestions on manipulators with a simple gripper as its end-effector (2 finger like PR2 will do just fine).
I tried to use a pr2 gripper with ur5 but I think I am not able to get the controllers right. Also the motion planning gets really weird in moveit after adding the gripper.

Bit lighter on computational cost would be better. Just a manipulator would be good instead of entire robot with sensors and all.
