Q:

openai_ros on Ubuntu Focal + ROS Noetic

Just would like to have a quick check, is it possible to use openai_ros with ubuntu focal + ros noetic?
the reason I am asking this is I get the following error while trying the last step of the instruction mentioned at here (https://bitbucket.org/theconstructcore/openai_ros/src/kinetic-devel/).

kinwah@ROS:~/catkin_ws$ rosdep install
openai_ros
ERROR: the following packages/stacks
could not have their rosdep keys
resolved to system dependencies:
openai_ros: No definition of
[python-catkin-pkg] for OS version
[focal]

If it is not possible, anyone knows how to resolve this or how can I approach the maintainers for possible workarounds?

A:

Hi everyone! I have gotten in touch with the maintainer team of openai_ros!
According to the email reply, there will be support for Noetic at the beginning of next year. Also for ROS2.
