Q:

Problem with scaling of objects in Gazebo gui

Hi there,
I am trying to scale the object's visual and collision size (geometry => size tags) in Gazebo gui.
Upon changing the value the following exception gets thrown:
Qt has caught an exception thrown from an event handler. Throwing
exceptions from an event handler is not supported in Qt. You must
reimplement QApplication::notify() and catch all exceptions there.
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'gazebo::common::Exception'
Aborted (core dumped)
Version 2:
I also got the following bt:

This has been noted in https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/simulator_gazebo/trunk in ROS fuerte which pulls in the deprecated_parser_sdf_1.2_support branch of Gazebo. OS: Ubuntu 12.04.

A:

The scaling feature was never implemented, and resulted in a segault. We have resolved this problem in gazebo 1.5 by removing the GUI based scaling feature.
We'll spend more time on this in the near future to implement it properly.
