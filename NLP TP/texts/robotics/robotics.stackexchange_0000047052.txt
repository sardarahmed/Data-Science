Q:

(Groovy @ 12.04) E: Package 'libtbb-dev' has no installation candidate

Am installing ROS Groovy (from source) on a Tablet, whose Kernel is armv7l.
When running the command:
$ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro groovy -y
Items install up until:
executing command [sudo apt-get install -y libtbb-dev]
as it shows the following error:
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
Package libtbb-dev is not available, but is referred to by another package.
This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or is only available from another source
E: Package 'libtbb-dev' has no installation candidate
ERROR: the following rosdeps failed to install
apt: command [sudo apt-get install -y libtbb-dev] failed
Any suggestions? If not needed, what other rosdeps exist after this one that the device did not get a chance to install?
Thanks...

A:

TBB packages are not built for ARM architectures (not sure if that is even possible/supported).
You can however pass the robust option (-r) to rosdep, and it will continue installing the other dependencies if some packages were not found:
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro groovy -yr
So no need to revert back to installing all dependencies by hand.

What will break if libtbb-dev and collada-dom-dev failed to install?
