Q:

Dynamic goal tolerance

I was wondering if there was any way to change the yaw_goal_tolerance and xy_goal_tolerance of e.g. the base_local_planner.
There are several situations where we want to apply a very small tolerance (+decrease accs and vels). But since this should definitely not be the default we want to be capable of 'dynamically reconfigure' those params. Unfortunately, those parameters are missing from the according reconfigure message.
What recently came to my mind was killing and restarting the node and apply a different set of default parameters. In my opinion, that would be a really dirty hack though.

Did you hack into move base to add the dynamic reconfig for these?
If yes, could you please share that part of the code?

A:

No, AFAIK there is no way to dynamically reconfigure these planner parameters. If you are serious about this, hack into move_base and have it read these params from a callback , like  plannerParamsUpdateCallback . Killing and restarting the node would be terrible, to say the least.
