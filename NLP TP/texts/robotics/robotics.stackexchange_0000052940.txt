Hi @FourTrees,
This could be a classic error I have faced before because of the process XnSensorServer.
It would be more useful if you can also share with us the output for

rostopic list

However, I can suggest you a possible solution (way around) which might just work. You need to basically restart the XnSensorServer Process. This can be done using the following two lines of command:

killall XnSensorServer

XnSensorServer

After performing this try to roslaunch the openni.launch file. Let us know if this works. Just to add to your information this happens when you launch openni topics multiple times as sometimes the XnSensorServer process is not properly cleared and shutdown.
Please note that if you have the process XnSensorServer linked to any other program or doing something else killing the process may not be a safe choice. It is advisable to kill/ Terminate any other processes using XnSensorServer before killing this process.
GoodLuck,
Regards,
Sivam

In addition to above workaround, there is a possibility that your kinect is not powered although it might be connected to robot you are working on...but direct power supply should also be there... For this make sure yellow light glows on Kinect..

Also, in case above step has been followed, Please check if your robot is charged. Please do check the output of lsusb once and you can refer this too:

I have a follow-up question.  I can get my Linux 12.04 with ROSHydro system to run two kinects perfectly fine, but when I try to launch the 3rd it comes up with an error that says "Application XnSensorSever has closed unexpectedly".  These Kinects are all on different buses btw.  Any ideas?

Hydro, openni_launch, No kinect connected...waiting for devices to be connected...
Solution:
sudo apt-get remove libopenni-*
sudo apt-get install libopenni-*
download the openni_launch again.
And then it works!
