Q:

ros_java build failing

Hi all,
I have been trying to get rosjava working but I am facing problems :). After I download rosjava and try to install it with
./gradlew build
I get the one failed test
Test org.ros.time.NtpTimeProviderTest FAILED
and eventually the build fails. What am I doing wrong?
Does any one have any idea how I can resolve this issue?

A:

That test is flaky and you can avoid running it using -x test. Really you should be calling the install task though which will copy the artifacts to your m2 cache so they can be used. The install task does not run the tests.
