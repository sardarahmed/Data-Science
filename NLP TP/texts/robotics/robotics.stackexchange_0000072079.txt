The error says that /dev/ttyUSB0 does not exist. Did you check if you find this port with ls /dev/ttyUSB0? Otherwise, you need to replace ttyUSB0 with your correct serial port, as it says in the tutorial.

thank you but how do I find the correct serial port? I want to use Bluetooth for the communication

A:

A simple way to check the correct serial port is using the Arduino IDE , on the tools menu go to "Port" and it shows the current port where Arduino is connect. Once you check the arduino the _port:= param has to be the same
