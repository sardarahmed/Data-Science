Q:

problem building freenect_stack

Hi All,
I've downloaded the freenect_stack, although I've getting the following error using rosmake on the stack:
MSG: gencfg_cpp on:Test.cfg CMake Error at cmake/cfgbuild.cmake:66 (string): string sub-command REPLACE requires at least four arguments. Call Stack (most recent call first): cmake/cfgbuild.cmake:87 (gencfg_cpp) CMakeLists.txt:24 (include) when rosmake

I've looked around to see if there is something I need to update - not found anthing that stands out. Rest of my ros system is working/building with out issue.
Any insight would be most helpful
This is on debian with furte
Thanks
Mark

A:

Something is not correct while generating the dynamic reconfigure config file. Can you post the output of the following command:
roscd freenect_camera
rosrun dynamic_reconfigure gendeps cfg/Freenect.cfg
