Q:

The size of particlecloud in PoseArray Message

Hi,
I wrote a node that subscribes to amcl particlecloud. I would like to write a callback function that process all the Pose array elements.
How can i get the size of the particlecloud or specifically the number of poses in the PoseArray Message?

A:

geometry_msgs::PoseArray has pose vector type each element represent a particle in case of amcl particlecloud.
geometry_msgs::PoseArray poseArray;
int size = poseArray.pose.size();

Hi @bvbdort do you know how to increase the size and spread of amcl particles, I am not being able to trigger the plan module for my Ackermann truck and I believe it is due the fact of particles size. I have already changed the parameters but the size seems to keep the same: AMCL Small particles don't allow Planning
