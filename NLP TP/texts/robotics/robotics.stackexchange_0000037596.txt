Q:

ros-electric-desktop-full not found

I am attempting to install ROS Electric on an iMX53 Quick Start board running Lucid Linux 10.04. It is an ARM Cortex A8. I am following the directions for Lucid at http://www.ros.org/wiki/electric/Installation/Ubuntu. Everything goes well until:
"sudo apt-get install ros-electric-desktop-full"
returns: "E: Couldn't find package ros-electric-desktop-full"
Suggestions? My skill level is high and I have previously successfully installed Electric on Maverick on an x86.

I'm not sure you can get Cortex A8 precompiled .debs. AFAIK, only i386 and amd64 are packaged right now. See also http://www.ros.org/debbuild/electric.html

I meant apt-get update, not upgrade.

I searched for this problem and saw nothing. Now, on the right, I see this issue http://answers.ros.org/question/1776/error-while-successful-sudo-apt-get-install-ros. Is it possible this is a mirror issue too? I'll look around for a way to change the mirror. I'm not a Linux expert yet.

Yes, You say "sudo apt-get upgrade" but I did "sudo apt-get update" per the instructions. Is that the problem? I don't have enough Karma to upload a screen shot, but in the Lucid "Software Sources, Other Software" tab; the item "http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu lucid main" is checked.

Did you update the sources list? Is it correct? Did you apt-get upgrade?

A:

You will have to build from source, see http://www.ros.org/wiki/electric/Installation/Ubuntu/Source

Agreed. There are some debs available for ARM, but not nearly the full set that are available on x86. See http://ros.org/debbuild/electric.html for the current build status.
