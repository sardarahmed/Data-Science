Q:

display multiple windows using image_view

Hi, all,
If there two image topics:
One is /camera/rgb/image_color, the other is /camera/mono/image_mono
I want to view these two topics in two separate window:
Then, I try:
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/rgb/image_color

And then open a new terminal and issue:
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/mono/image_mono

However the latter one window will cover the first one. What other parameters for image_view I should append to the command?
THX~

A:

Have you tried just dragging the windows by their title bars to other positions? Assuming they aren't maximised, you can then tile as many windows as you may need.
