Q:

GUI glitch while running autoware

I am working with Autoware 1.12.0 (source build) on Ubuntu 18.04 (Melodic).
The GUI glitch I am facing is that the window doesn't clean when UI elements redraw, so I end up with text writing over text every time I switch from one tab to the next in the runtime manager.
The terminal output is:
GtK-WARNING **: Negative content height while allocating gadget (node entry, owner GtKentry)
Thank you
