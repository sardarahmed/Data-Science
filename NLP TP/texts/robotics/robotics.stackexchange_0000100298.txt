Q:

how to port rviz_imu_plugin on ros foxy

I would like to visualize my IMU(MPU6050) data on RVIZ2.
A node is publishing  message(sensor_msgs::msg::Imu) and I can see the message via "ros2 topic echo /imu" at this time.
Could you please advise how to see IMU data on RVIZ2?
It seems like that there's rviz_imu_plugin(http://wiki.ros.org/rviz_imu_plugin) but I did not find one for ros2 foxy/Rviz2

Years passed, "binary installer" (i.e. no need to build from source by yourself) is made for some ros2 distros https://index.ros.org/p/rviz_imu_plugin/
