Q:

How do we keep TurtleBot cables tidy?

We've been playing around with some TurtleBots at the office and occasionally run into issues with dangling wires and blocked indicator lights. I've posted what we've done below - does anyone have other suggestions?
Four pieces of tape (all visible below) keep the cables clean, the Kinect and Create lights visible, and allows enough slack for the netbook to sit on top of the robot or on the lower shelf.

We've found these downward right angle adapters useful.
