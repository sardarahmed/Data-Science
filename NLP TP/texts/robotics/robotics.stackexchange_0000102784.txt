Q:

Package 'ros1_bridge` not found

Hello,
This is the guide that I followed: https://github.com/ros2/ros1_bridge/tree/foxy (I am stuck on attempting example 1).
I was successful in building ros1_bridge with colcon (took about 20 mins). I am trying to do the first example. Note that I am bridging neotic (ros1) to foxy (ros2) so I have cloned the ros1_bridge repository from the foxy tree.
In shell A, I sourced ros1 then ran roscore. In shell B, I sourced ros1 then sourced ros2. Then when I try to run:
ros2 run ros1_bridge dynamic_bridge
I get the error
Package 'ros1_bridge' not found.
Am I missing anything here?
Thanks!

ros1 and ros2 works perfectly btw!

A:

Found out after a day of checking around! I'm a beginner and the tutorial doesn't mention it, but ros1_bridge works as a workspace folder so you'd have to source that workspace.
In .bashrc, I alias 3 things:
alias noetic='source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash'
alias foxy='source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash'
alias bridge='source ~/ros1_bridge/install/setup.bash'
That way, when you want to run ros1_bridge, which is a ros2 workspace, you can use 1 terminal for this. Your terminal command lines should be something like:
$ noetic
$ foxy
$ bridge
$ ros2 run ros1_bridge dynamic_bridge
in this order!
I hope this helps new beginners trying to get into ROS2 and ROS1!
