Q:

Fusing multiple sensors of same type using robot_localization

Hi,
I understand fairly clearly how data from Multiple sensors of different type like IMU, GPS , Wheel-Odometry etc can be fused using the Kalman-Filter.
But how does robot_localization fuses data from multiple sensors of same type say velocity input from 2 Wheel Odometers?
Is it simply weight averaged using their individual co-variances and the combined output is sent as a single Odometry measurement to the Kalman filter or is it a lot more complex process?

A:

According to line 175, if you are sure about your covariances report from both wheel odometry, then each velocity measurement will be fed to the KF individually based on its time stamp. Make sure that you follow the documentation before doing so.

I see, so at each iteration of Kalman Filter, Velocity measurement from just one Odometer is given as input based on the timestamp and a different H matrix is created depending on which sensor data is being fused. This Helps.
Thanks!
