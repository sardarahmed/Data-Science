Q:

Easy way to transform a geometry_msgs::Pose by a 4x4 Rotation Matrix

Hello All,
I feel as if there should be a way for me to easily translate and rotate a geometry_msgs::Pose by a 4x4 rotation matrix given to me as the final transformation from a registration in the Point Cloud Library.
I'm not sure of how I should go about performing this operation.
Thanks,

A:

You can use tf's poseMsgToTF method. It will generate a tf::Pose instance which is essentially similar to Bullet's Transform class. You can use the methods getBasis and getOrigin to construct the matrix.
