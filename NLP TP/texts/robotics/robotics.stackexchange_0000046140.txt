Q:

RoboEarth installation using rosinstall

Hi,
I'm trying to install RoboEarth on my Ubuntu 10.10 and I'm following the steps at the wiki page. Somewhere along the line, I have to use the command rosinstall, but it doesn't work. When I try sudo apt-get install python-rosinstall , I get the following error:
E: Unable to locate package python-rosinstall.
If I try the command sudo pip install -U rosinstall, I get the message:
sudo: pip:command not found.
What should I do?
I'm a beginner, so any help is welcome! Thanks!
EDIT: After michikarg's help, I was able to run rosinstall but I'm still having problems with the installation process. Some of the dependencies were not found, even some that are already installed such as libqt4-dev.
Here is the log message (by the way, I'm using ROS Electric):

A:

ROS Electric is not officially supported. If you really can't update to Fuerte, try Revision r2047:
roscd roboearth
svn up -r2047
