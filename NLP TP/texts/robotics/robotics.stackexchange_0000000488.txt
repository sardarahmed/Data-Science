Q:

Is it possible to use Matlab "system" function to call ROS commands?

Is it possible to use the Matlab's system function to call ROS commands?
For example, using system('rostopic pub /cmd_vel geometry.msgs.Twist {....}
or system('rospack find ipc_bridge).
I'm trying to send some commands to ROS without using something like IPC-Bridge.
PS: I know, however, that I need to use IPC-Bridge to subscribe to topics.

A:

This is possible. But it is very sloppy, in my humble opinion. It is useful for one-off commands, but how will you read back output, verify your command was executed, etc. 
If you are dead-set against the IPC bridge, you may want to look at using the MATLAB-java interface. ROS also allows you to program in Java using ros-fuerte-client-rosjava (ubuntu), or just rosjava.
