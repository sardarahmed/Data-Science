Q:

urdf collada difference

Hi,
What is the major difference of urdf,stl,collada?
STL is only composed by mesh, so it only can move the whole object, right?
And urdf can define several joints to move.
But if I use collada file could I move joints like importing urdf?
Or I should import many collada files and control each part separately?

A:

The Collada spec. 1.5 allows you to include also the kinematic chains. On the last Beta Program Conference Call I remembered one group (I think JSK) was expanding the Collada-ROS implementation. I currently have no idea of the current status.
