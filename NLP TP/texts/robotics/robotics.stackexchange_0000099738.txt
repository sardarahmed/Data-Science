Q:

How to use STM32 IDE with microROS + FreeRTOS?

As the title says. How do I incorporate the STM32 IDE into my development workflow? Alternatively, is there a suggested development workflow that is better?

Thanks! Is there an equivalent for ROS2 Foxy?

There is a foxy branch in this repo that should work

That's great! Is only the U(S)ART transport supported by this method? Or is UDP/Ethernet supported too? I didn't see it in the README

Only USART, feel free to contribute if you port the UDP transports.
