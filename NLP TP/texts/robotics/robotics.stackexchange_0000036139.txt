Q:

Problem installing tabletop_object_perception package

I have been trying to use the tabletop_object_perception package
http://www.ros.org/wiki/tabletop_object_perception
The binary for ros-electric-tabletop_object_perception downloads only 3 files and so, i attempted installing from the SVN source of it.
There were lot of dependencies unresolved and i have been installing many of those from the SVN sources. There are compilation errors in many trunks , like motion_planning_common and also tabletop_object_detector .
"/ros_electric/tabletop_object_perception/tabletop_object_detector/include/tabletop_object_detector/marker_generator.h:45:41: error: geometric_shapes_msgs/Shape.h: No such file or directory"

Has anyone managed to get the entire package working ? is there a binary for the package with all the dependencies available ?

I have exactly the same problem. Maybe somebody has found a solution in the meantime and could share it?

No one? There seems to be discrepancy between tabletop_object_detector and electric. geometric_shapes_msgs was part of motion_planning_common, which became arm_navigation.

A:

tabletop_object_perception no longer exists in Electric except as an empty stack. tabletop_object_detector is now in the stack pr2_object_manipulation, which you can get in debs as ros-electric-pr2-object-manipulation , or from Electric-trunk at
https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/stacks/pr2_object_manipulation/branches/0.5-branch
I apologize if you were using the address on the wiki; it's terribly confusing, but the wiki is still giving Diamondback svn addresses, which do not compile against Electric debs.

But, I cannot see any ..tabletop_object... package in the pr2_object_manipulation stack. In contrast, tabletop_object_perception is linked from that stack. In either case, please add a deprecation/moved note where it suits.

Good point.  I added notes to both wiki pages, along with the urls for Electric and Fuerte code.
