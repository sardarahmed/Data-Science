Q:

ROS package template for Python package generation

Are there any project templates for ROS Python packages which can be used with a project generator like cookiecutter?

I don't know of anything distributed "officially" (ie: through some package or other distributable artefact from OSRF or the ROS buildfarm). I know of some work within ROSIN that goes in this direction (slightly further, code generation as well). Not sure when that will be released though.

Would have been nice if one could streamline package skeleton generation a bit. In case you can provide info about...: What will the ROSIN generation deal with exactly (what will it generate)?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-04-08:
Package structure, nodes, topics, launch files, etc. A bit more than just a skeleton package. And based on a declarative data structure (essentially an xml file, nothing too fancy). And some expectation management: it's not a research topic in ROSIN, so this is a convenience tool.

Sound helpful. Will this support ROS node packages (which include node/nodelet specific code) separate from ROS lib packages (which include code without any ROS dependencies despite of building)?

Note that the fact that I don't know about something for tools like cookiecutter doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

Look like this one is what you are looking for?
