Q:

Use generic home directory reference from launch file

I am running a .bag file from a launch file but I want to make the filepath generic so other team members can run this launch file. So I have:
<launch>
    <node pkg="rosbag" type="play" name="player" args="/home/jimbob/bagfiles/test.bag" />
</launch>

But not everyone on my team is named jimbob so I want to replace "/home/jimbob/" with maybe ${HOME} or something generic.

A:

See $(env ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE) on http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML#substitution_args
You can use $(env HOME)
