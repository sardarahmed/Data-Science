Q:

Unable to find 'swig.swg' and Unable to find 'python.swg

Hi All,
I'm building a new Debian (wheezy) install.
Following the usual instructions. I've successfully built the swig app - swig.swg & python.swg exist in /swig/1.3.29.
Seems the build script can't find them - anyone any idea what's wrong? Output is:
'[ 61%] Generating rosout_panel_swig_generated.cpp, rxtoolscpp.py
:1: Error: Unable to find 'swig.swg'
:3: Error: Unable to find 'python.swg

make[1]: *** [rx/rxtools/CMakeFiles/python_rxtools.dir/all] Error 2

Thanks

A:

Okay found the problem. For some reason the swig installation script thought is had installaed the lib at /usr/local/share/swig/... (Which is normal) however the actual files were in /swig i.e. off top level dir.
Solution
cp -r /swig /usr/local/share
and get on with the build.

If you don't want to copy the files to the wider filesystem, you can pass swig the -I option to specify where to look for your .swg files:
swig-2.0.10/swig -go -intgosize 64 -Iswig-2.0.10/Lib -Iswig-2.0.10/Lib/go example.i
