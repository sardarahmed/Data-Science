A:

Please just try again, this is most likely a transient ((inter)network) error.
If you already did that, then please update your question with what actions you've already taken to resolve this.

I have tried again, but failed! It's the same error

I did not say you should reinstall, I said you should try to run sudo rosdep init again ..
Also: please install rosdep using apt-get instead of pip or easy_install (unless you really have to). It will probably result in hard to solve problems later on.

What is the output of wget https://raw.github.com/ros/rosdistro/master/rosdep/sources.list.d/20-default.list?

live in shenzh,china,Is this website not support this area like china?

It should work fine, unless there is someone/something interfering with your network. Do you use a proxy?
