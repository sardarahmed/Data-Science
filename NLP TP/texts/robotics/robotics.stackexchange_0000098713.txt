Q:

Autoware - Sharing files between the host system and ADE

Hi All,
I am new to Autoware, and trying to install the Autoware in my system by following the steps given here.
I have a question in section Sharing files between the host system and ADE.
In the given example, first step is to move the file from host (local) system home folder to adehome folder. (Which effectively deletes the folder in the host home folder. And then the Symlink is created.
My questions are,

Do we need to remove the file from the host system?
How the Symlink is created between the files?

Kindly excuse if my understanding is inaccurate.
Thank you,
KK

A:

No, keep it on the host since it gets mounted within ADE

The adehome folder exists on the host machine, and is mounted inside the Docker container (ADE)
The ADE CLI tool knows to mount this folder within the container because of the .adehome file that the docs also tell us to make

There isn't a symlink, but rather adehome gets mounted within the Docker container (ADE)

Files that you want to have persist across multiple instances (or even persist across restarting ADE) should exist within adehome
So clone your reops, store your sample data, etc. within .adehome

Thanks for the response.
That's what I was thinking too, and noticed as well.
Apparently section "Sharing files between the host system and ADE" is not needed, since it is already done by ADE.

True, for ADE it's not required to map the .basrc and other files mentioned in the original link, just a helpful hint. Glad I could help!
