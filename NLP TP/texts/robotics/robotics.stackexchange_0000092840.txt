Q:

Exchange data(messages) between robots in ROS1

Hello together,
actually I have some rover running on ROS1 and want exchange data over messages between them e.g. to make a merged map.
They will all be connected to an access-point. Each rover should run his own roscore.
What are the possibilities to do that? Anyone did something like this before?
BTW: I'm aware that ROS2 is more suitable for that, but due to the ARM Hardware ROS2 will not work for me at the moment.

A:

It sounds as though you want to use a ROS Multimaster setup between your rovers. There is a tutorial about setting this up here.
Is there a reason why you need each rover to run their own roscore, for example do they have intermittent access to the shared Wi-Fi network?

I think it would be more reliable to run roscore localy on the rovers. They should be as autonomous as possible. For example they should continue to work if they lost connection to the AP or the master.

and that is exactly what multimaster allows you to do.
