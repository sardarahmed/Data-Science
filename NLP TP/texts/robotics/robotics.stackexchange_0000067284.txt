channel_feedback (sensor_msgs/JointState)
Current position of the channels (fingers).

Yes, I know that I can use channel_feedback, but I don't know how I can use it, because I try calling:
rostopic echo svh_controller/channel_feedback and it prints messages to screen, but how I can use the current data to update the channel_targets?
Comment by inflo on 2015-04-27:
you could send it with "rostopic pub ..."  or write a node which publishes to channel_targets

A:

Ok. I solved my problem, I can read the current position calling:
rostopic echo svh_controller/channel_feedback
