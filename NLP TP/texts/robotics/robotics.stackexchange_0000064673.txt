Q:

Alternate source of repositories for ROS on UbuntuARM

While installing ROS on BeagleBone Black running Ubuntu Trusty, the repository sources at "http://packages.namniart.com/repos/ros trusty main" are unavailable since the domain has expired, according to the web browser
Is there any alternate source for those files?
