Q:

pcl_ros manifest.xml changes

In the diamondback , pcl_ros's manifest.xml says
 <cpp cflags="-I${prefix}/include -I${prefix}/msg_gen/cpp/include -I${prefix}/cfg/cpp" lflags="-Wl,-rpath,${prefix}/lib -L${prefix}/lib -lpcl_ros_io -lpcl_ros_features -lpcl_ros_filters -lpcl_ros_segmentation -lpcl_ros_surface -lpcl_ros_tf"/> 

In the electric , pcl_ros's manifest.xml says
 <cpp cflags="-I${prefix}/include -I${prefix}/cfg/cpp" lflags="-Wl,-rpath,${prefix}/lib -L${prefix}/lib -lpcl_ros_tf" /> `

and the former flag options were uncommented.
I wonder why it had changed.

A:

The -I${prefix}/msg_gen/cpp/include is no longer needed (and deprecated).
I don't know about the -l linker parameters.
