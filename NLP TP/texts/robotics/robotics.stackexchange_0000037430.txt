Q:

PCD file in ROS?

We have published Points2 type point cloud in ROS using Minoru camera.
Can we generate a PCD file in ROS of these published point clouds? How can we process this PCD file using ROS? Purpose is to create an input file for object detection and then recognition.

A:

Have a look at this tutorial for conversion from ROS data types to PCL datatypes. You can then use PCL's built-in PCD input/output.
This tutorial might also contain some useful information.
