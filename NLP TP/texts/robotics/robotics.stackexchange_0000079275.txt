Q:

Display RRT generated by MoveIt

Hey guys,
is there a way to display the RRT generated by MoveIt for motion planning in something like a picture/map/graphical output? I want to see the differences between the MoveIt planners and therefore it would be helpful to see the planned path, or generated roadmaps. Maybe some of you know a way or tool to do so.
Thanks for your ideas. Im running ROS indigo on Ubuntu 14.04.

A:

I think this could be something that davetcoleman/ompl_visual_tools can do.
Also check out wiki/moveit_visual_tools and wiki/rviz_visual_tools.

Thanks it looks very promising!

Do you know if there is a python tutorial/documentation on how to use the tools, especially the first one?

I don't think ompl_visual_tools can be used from Python. Dave is rather C++ oriented.
