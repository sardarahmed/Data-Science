Have you tried building it from source on Kinetic?
Comment by joq on 2016-06-16:
I built it yesterday on Xenial and Kinetic with no problems, and it passed all the unit tests. So, you can run it from source until a binary release is available.

Thanks Jack, I'll build it from source.

A:

Please don't.
There are new Indigo and Jade releases in the pipeline. Kinetic will come after that.
Thanks for inquiring. I opened issue #93 to track resolution of your problem.
