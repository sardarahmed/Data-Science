Q:

Unable to implement control on MoveIt: Parameter '~moveit_controller_manager' not specified

I am struggling to implement a joint_trajectory_controller on Moveit.
I have:

Set up my controllers.yaml file

controller_list:
       - name: /nymble_arm_controller
         action_ns: joint_trajectory_action
         type: FollowJointTrajectory
         default: true
         joints:
             - base_swivel
             - arm_joint
             - elbow_joint  
             - wrist_pitch
             - wrist_yaw
             - wrist_roll
           

2.Implemented an action server node for joint_trajectory_action interface.
Action server I have implemented is from here
3.Created a moveit_planning_execution launch file as described here
This launch file contains the required controller_manager.launch file described here
4.Created a launch file to start action server and included above launch file.
I have gone through all the similar questions asked before but none has helped me.
Will be grateful for some help.

A:

The mistake I was making was that the controller.launch file was not named in the following convention:
"robotname"_moveit_controller_manager.launch.xml
