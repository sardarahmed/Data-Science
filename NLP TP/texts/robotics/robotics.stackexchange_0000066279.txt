Q:

Interface code to handle Arduino Motor Controller and Odometry

Hi,
I am building a robot based off of a electric wheelchair with an Arduino as the motor controller and odometry interface. My question is this: Is there a package already existing that reads odometry from the Arduino and publishes it to TF and sends twist commands to the Arduino? I looked at the differential_drive package on github, but it uses another board as an interface to the encoders. I have photo interrupters on my robot that I would like to use instead and I have them working with the Arduino. They change state when the encoder wheel's teeth are blocking the IR beam or not. The reason I want to use the Arduino as the encoder controller is because I need to know which way the robot is moving as I can't discern direction of rotation with only one sensor per wheel. I am using Ubuntu 14.04 with ROS Indigo full installation.Is there a package to fit my needs that I have just not found yet or is there a package I can modify slightly to fit my needs? Thanks,
L

A:

Try looking at:

ros_arduino_bridge
ros_arduino

You would have to keep track if the direction of the wheel since you only have one channel but it is possible.
