Q:

"make uninstall" target for drcsim

When compiling drcsim from source, there is not "uninstall" make target, which makes uninstalling the compiled version more cumbersome than it should be. Of course, one can always create a little helper script, but it seems unnecessary to make each user find their own way of uninstalling.
Or am I missing some obvious option here? If not, I'll open a ticket on the drcsim bitbucket.

A:

You're right; the uninstall target missing from drcsim.  Please file a ticket and we'll add it (we'll add it faster if the ticket includes a patch, perhaps copying the CMake code from gazebo).
