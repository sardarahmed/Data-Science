Q:

Messages being blocked from publishing

I am running 2 nodes. One is polar_scan_matcher and the other one is my own node that publishes scan messages. Something is wrong somewhere because when the 2 nodes run at the same time, the publisher of the scan messages is being block as I received an error saying
"WARNING: no messages received and simulated time is active.
Is /clock being published?" when I run "rostopic echo -c /scan"
As I run "rostopic list", I got these topics:/clock, /goal, /imu, /initialpose, /pose,/pose2D,/rosout, /rosout_agg,/scan,/tf.
What could be the possible culprit? How do I fix it?

A:

It looks like you've somehow set the "use_sim_time" parameter to true, but you don't have a clock source (ie: rosbag play --clock or some other source, like Gazebo).
Since you're using tf, WallTime isn't an option.
You can check the status of the use_sim_time parameter by using rosparam.
rosparam get use_sim_time

And if it is set somehow, you can reverse it by running:
rosparam set use_sim_time false

You're right..I've just changed the value in the launch file and that works..Thanks anyway.

Should I run/include this on in the launch file or running as a command? I've tried as a command, still not working..

Just one small addition because it confused one of my contacts:
If you use Gazebo this does not apply to you. Gazebo publishes the /clock topic for you.

@Chad Rockey I have a question to your recommendation with the flaf of the use_sim_time. In my launch file first I've set this to true, because I get the message about TF_OLD_DATA while playing my recorded bag file. But now I try to use a node and it seems, that the topics is published, but no messages are received (simulated time is active)
