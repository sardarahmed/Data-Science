Q:

Is there any tutorials for visual SLAM (beginners)?

Hello,
I am new to ros as well as to robotics. I wish to learn some basic tutorials in Visual-SLAM. I tried RGBDSLAM from ros and it works. As I am not good in programming, I can't understand the codes.
So, I would like to learn how to do programming for visual SLAM (c++ or Matlab). Is there any available tutorials for visual SLAM (any webpages or books)?

Hello
can you help me to how to make RGBDSLAM work
thanks

A:

Welcome, Chris! If you'd like to work with programming of any sort, I suggest some training in your programming language of choice in the first place. I know it can be a pain for many, but it'll be hard to work past using other people's code on your application if you can't program yourself.
SLAM is not exactly an easy problem to tackle even without considering the programming aspect of it, either. With Visual SLAM, there is an extra amount of work involved in using computer vision for sensor processing (for instance, for matching subsequent image frames). More programming comes in when you have to work with the CV libraries to do that, such as OpenCV.
Here are some references I found useful in the past, although they are not specific to Visual SLAM:
OpenSLAM (I recommend Tim Bailey's MATLAB package for beginners)
SLAM for Dummies (Tutorial)
