Q:

how to run can_open_motor node CanDriveHarmonica?

I tried to run it, but there is no executable file. rosmake does not do anything cause of the file ROS_NOBUILD in different dependencies. And even if I deleate this one, in the CMakeLists.txt file is a line like: rosbuild_add_executable(CanDriveHarmonica common/src/CanDriveHarmonica.cpp)
missing.
I just downloaded the stack cob_driver and with it the can_open_motor, but nothing works. Any ideas how to solve the problems and run it?

A:

The cob_driver stack is specific for Care-O-bot hardware and will probably not work without modifications on different hardware. Which hardware are you working on?

I thought I can run CanDriveHarmonica to see the messages sent by the node to the Elmo Motion Control Harmonica. The aim is to reconstruct a realy old robot for ROS and I wanted the information which CAN messages are needed to be sent to Harmonica in order to initialise and steer it.
