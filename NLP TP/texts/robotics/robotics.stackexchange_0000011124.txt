Q:

Can I use a FTC regulation phone to use the camera on multiple tasks?

PREFACE:

THIS QUESTION REGARDS FTC ROBOTICS
I am aware that a question similar to this exists on SE and I have looked at it, but the solutions provided did not solve my problem, and the nature of my question has additional constraints and criteria involved that make this a distinct problem.

PROBLEM:

I have been put in charge of creating java classes to add to an existing app, used to control a robot (FTC robotics, for those who are wondering). The features I have been given to add to the app include:

Shape detection (provided by FTC, all I need to do is tweak some
files)

Automatically record and save a video in the background of the app using the back camera

QUESTION:

I was wondering, if this is even possible, how I would go about both recording video and using shape detection? How do I even record a video from the background of an app? If i cannot achieve both I was told to prioritize recording, as we have substitutes for shape detection.

SPECS:

Motorola moto g 2nd gen with Android Marshmallow

Or as a fallback:

ZTE speed with Android Marshmallow

A:

OpenCV is a comprehensive vision processing library with an Android port. It should work fine for both of your needs.
