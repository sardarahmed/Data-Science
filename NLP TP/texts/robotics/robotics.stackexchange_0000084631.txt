Q:

What's a good stepper motor to use with ROS?

I'm looking for a stepper motor w/encoder that works with ROS. Does anyone know of a good one that has documentation about how to use it with ROS?
Thanks in advance.

Unless we know what you're trying to do with it it's impossible to answer. Plus the motor itself is largely unconnected to ros. You probably want to ask about a good stepper motor controller that works with ros.

I’m building a robot arm. I want to be able to get positional feedback like I can win the dynamixel servos. What’s  good stepper motor controller to use for that?

A:

If you'd like to build and 5/6 axis serial robot you might want to take a look at the BCN3D Moveo robot, it is open source (mechanics, eletronics etc.) and fully ROS compatible.
