Q:

Cannot launch the latest drcsim

Hi.
I tried to launch drcsim like this:
$ roslaunch atlas_utils qual_task_1.launch

then gazebo process dies generating the following message:
Warning [gazebo_main.cc:62] escalating to SIGKILL on client

Here is the specification of my PC:

Ubuntu 12.04, 64bit
ROS : fuerte
drcsim : 2.6.2-1~precise
gazebo : 1.8.1-1~precise

Moreover, I can successfully launch drcsim like this:
$ optirun roslaunch atlas_utils qual_task_1.launch

What is the cause of this problem?
Is there any way to launch drcsim without optirun?

A:

We had lots of trouble with the Optimus GPU setup.  We did once configure a bunch of Thinkpads with Optimus GPUs in them for use in a workshop.   That process worked well enough, though we still had a "black screen of death problem," wherein Gazebo would sometimes launch with a blank GUI window.
