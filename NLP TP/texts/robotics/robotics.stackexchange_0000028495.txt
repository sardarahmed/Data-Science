Q:

heigthmaps slow down simulation

Im working on a proyect, and Im using heigthmaps models. When I add them to the simulatoin, Gazebo slow down a lot and even freezes. I have also realized that , the higher I set the max heigth in the sdf file , the slower the simulation is. Does anyone know why  this happends?Is there any way to solve it? Im using gazebo 7 in Ubuntu 16.04.

A:

Can you try running gzserver without gzclient, does the problem still happen?  You can monitor the real time factor with the command gz stats

If the problem doesn't happen, you can try setting the level of detail for heightmaps for gzclient by adding this to ~/gui.ini:
 [heightmap]
 lod=3

You could also try reducing the definition of your heightmap

Thanks!This helped me a lot! Running gzserver doesn't slow down the simulation, and most of the time I dont need to use the client, so it is at least a partial solution.
