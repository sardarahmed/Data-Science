Q:

How to activate collision to the shadow_hand

Hello, i'm working with a glove and the shadow hand of the shadow robot, the glove is working really good, but now i need to detect collisions with the shadow hand and other objects inside of gazebo.
Someone knows how to realize that?.
Thank you!

Hey,
We have several gazebo touch sensors on the simulated hand. They are accessible on the topics name /..._bumper:

/ffdistal_bumper
/ffknuckle_bumper
/ffmiddle_bumper
...

However they appear to be broken for the time being in Fuerte (see this thread). They should work in Gazebo 1.6.17 release but I don't know when that will happen...

Sorry I didn't patch my version of Gazebo and I'm waiting for the next release hoping to have this annoying bug fixed so I can't help you with that I'm afraid.
