Q:

differences between PC and ARM port with freenext.launch

I have installed ROS (Indigo) on both a regular PC and an ARM embedded board (i.MX6x SABRE-Lite).
Both run Ubuntu 14.04.
After launching freenect.launch on the PC almost 200 topics are created.
After launching it on the ARM-board only a few dozen topics are created.
I don't need all the extra topics, so its working fine for me, but my question is, where can I find the points where this differentiation is made.
In the ROS sources, or in libfreenect, or in the ROS infrastructure?
I can't find it, hopefully someone here knows it...
UPDATE: if I do freenext_launch freenect.launch then rostopic list|fgrep camera|wc yields 194.
Thanks in advance, Sietse

"200 topics": are you sure? That seems a bit excessive ..

A:

Do you have additional image transport or depth image transport plugins installed on your PC that you don't have installed on ARM?

Thanks Austin, I did have additional image transport plugins installed on the PC.
That answers my question.
