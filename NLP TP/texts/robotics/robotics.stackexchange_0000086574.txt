Q:

WARNING: no messages received and simulated time is active. Laser Scan Matcher

ROS Kinetic - Ubuntu 16.04
Looking this up, all the forum posts I can find are either about gazebo or don't really have an answer.
Laser Scan Matcher node takes an input and produces an output.  The input isn't empty, I checked with $ rostopic echo /theinputtopic.
If I put <param name="/use_sim_time" value="true"/>in the node launch file, and I do  $rostopic echo /outputtopic , I get:

WARNING: no messages received and
simulated time is active. Is /clock
being published?

If I put <param name="/use_sim_time" value="false"/> in the node launch file, and I do $rostopic echo /outputtopic , I get absolutely nothing, just an empty new line.
Putting --clock as argument also doesn't seem to have any effect.
What's causing this error?

Have you solved this problem yet?  If not, could you post the entire launch file, and maybe a screenshot of an rqt_graph of the system running with the bag playback?

A:

The input topic was /tf_static which only gets sent out a single time, the very first millisecond. The trick is to run everything you need to do (example: $ rviz and $ rosrun somepackage somealgorithm and then run $ rosbag play bagfile.bag
This way, $ rostopic echo /tf_static isn't empty, and everything functions properly.
Basically, the topic was a bit annoying and had to be run last, otherwise everything else doesn't work.
