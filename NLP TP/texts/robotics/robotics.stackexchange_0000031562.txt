Q:

Running several nodes under a "top" node

I have organized my code in such a way that when I run a "main" file, it calls methods in other classes, from other packages, to accomplish a task. I soon realized that the classes written, requires a rospy node so that it can communicate with ROS_MASTER.
But I cannot initialize other nodes under the "main" node as i think ROS only allows one node to be initialized and not a node inside another.
Example: The classes in the other packages use SimpleActionClient/action client which uses the actionlib, that requires to initialize a node to publish messages and call services.
I had only initialized a node for the "main" method.
And since I cannot initialize any more nodes, the code does not really do anything 
Any advice on how to resolve this issue? or any alternative ideas?
Thanks!

Can you update your question to clarify what you're trying to do, and what isn't working?  Possibly provide an example.  From your description everything sounds doable.

A:

From what I understand you want several classes of your program to use ros-node functionality. You can just pass them the node handle in their constructor and store it in a member variable. See here for such a constructor definition.
