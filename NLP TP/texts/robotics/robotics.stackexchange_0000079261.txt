Q:

TurtleBot navigation stack algorithms

Is there any design doc or research papers that the current turtlebot navigation stack implements?
I would like to learn the algorithms and the top-level design in more depth.
Thanks!

A:

The turtlebot uses the ROS navigation stack, and that wiki page has a great deal of documentation, tutorials, examples and even a few papers about how it works.
