Q:

How to include the customly made msg header in cpp code?

I followed the following tutorial to create my own custom msg.
/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingMsgAndSrv

I have a package named test1. I created a msg in this package. After I build the package, the msg header file is located at
test1/msg_gen/cpp/include/test1/Num.h

I wish to include this in my source code, which is located at test1/src folder. I couldn't use the include
#include "msg_gen/cpp/include/test1/Num.h"

or
#include <test1/Num.h>

Could anyone give me a valid header that can include this header file?
