Q:

I can't run rviz

Hi, I am trying to use rviz, but recently I receive the following error:

Try adjusting the vblank_mode configuration parameter.

How to modify the parameter vblank_mode? What is the right value?
Many thanks in advance.

Shell show the following warning: Message received without callerid. What is the meaning?
