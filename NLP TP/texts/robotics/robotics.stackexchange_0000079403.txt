Q:

How to convert .csv or .mat file to ros?

I collect the odom and IMU data by dspace microautobox and at the same time I collected lidar data directly on ROS.
The odom data is .mat file now and it can be converted to .csv file. The lidar data has been recorded as a rosbag file.
Now I want to first convert the odom data to something available for ROS and then merge the two data to a single rosbag file. How can I make it?
I searched online for a long time but only can find how to convert rosbag file to other formats...

A:

See #q119211 and #q233042 (via #q249059) for related questions.
To summarise: a simple Python script that reads in your CSV and uses the rosbag API to convert everything to a rosbag is probably easiest.

By the way, do you have any suggestion about how to correlate dspace with ROS? I want to implement real time finally and I'm not sure if converting data this way is a best solution?

This is really a separate question. Please open a new one.
