Q:

About Debugging program using ROS

Hi All,
ROS is based on process communication. Can I do things in a single process?
Sometime I just want some lightweight operations and resorting to process is too costly.
Also, have multiple thread is inconvenient for me to use debug tools and IDE such as qtCreator.
I'm new to ROS, sorry for the possibly silly question.

A:

The ROS communications primitives work for both interprocess as well as intraprocess. See the publish subscribe overview for details on how to optimized using boost::shared_ptr

That's cool. So it's automatically managed by ROS. Thanks!
