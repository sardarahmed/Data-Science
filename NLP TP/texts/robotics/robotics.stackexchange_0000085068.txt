Q:

I cant start the RTABMAP_ROS - freenect problem

Hi! I'm using Kinect Xbox 360 and working on NVIDIA Jetson TX2.
I installed the ROS from here: http://www.jetsonhacks.com/2017/03/27/robot-operating-system-ros-nvidia-jetson-tx2/
I can use RTABMAP normal version but can't launch the rtabmap_ros. I tried to everything for launch but it still does'nt work.
My ros directory:
Here is the error: /opt/ros/kinetic
[freenect.launch] is neither a launch file in package [freenect_launch] nor is [freenect_launch] a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

A:

Hello, thanks for helping everyone. I solved the problem with these steps:
roslaunch freenect_launch freenect.launch depth_registration:=yes
roslaunch rtabmap_ros rtabmap.launch rtabmap_args:="--delete_db_on_start"

I think this problem is because of double freenect version. I got freenect that I installed manualy, another freenect version came from ROS. Therefore, rtabmap cant launch.
