Q:

Problem with robot_upstart

I am trying to install robot_upstart for my package
serge@media:~/NetBeansProjects/ROS_beginner_tutorials/ros_ws$ rosrun robot_upstart install beginner_tutrorials/launch/m1.launch

But I get the error
Unable to locate path launch/m1.launch in package beginner_tutrorials. Installation aborted.

I already entered the command
source ./devel/setup.bash

And am definitely sure that it it works, because
rosrun beginner_tutorials talker

works properly. And if I do not enter source command I can't run the talker, so the source is added
Also when I enter
rospack find beginner_tutorials

the package can be found.
So what can be a cause of the problem?
And maybe I understand something wrong about robot_upstart. Does it creates a new launch file or can only write/overwrite data in existing launchfile or maybe it require a ready launchfile?

A:

serge@media:~/NetBeansProjects/ROS_beginner_tutorials/ros_ws$ rosrun robot_upstart install beginner_tutrorials/launch/m1.launch

If that is an actual copy-paste, then the problem is most likely the typo in the package name: beginner_tutrorials.
The correct package name (and the one you use in the "I'm definitely sure that it works" bit) is beginner_tutorials.
