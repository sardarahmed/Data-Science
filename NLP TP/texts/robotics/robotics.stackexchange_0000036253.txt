Q:

Dropping connection

I am trying to run joy Tutorials/WritingTeleopNode on Ubuntu 11.4 with ROS electric.  I am using a Cordless Rumble Pad 2.  Everytime I get an [ERROR] [1323140529.624261794]: Client [/teleop] wants topic /joy to have datatype/md5sum [joy/Joy/e3ef016fcdf22397038b36036c66f7c8], but our version has [sensor_msgs/Joy/5a9ea5f83505693b71e785041e67a8bb]. Dropping connection. The joystick is working up to that point.
Any help would be appreciated,
Morpheus

A:

That error indicates that some node is publishing a sensor_msgs/Joy message on /joy but your node is expecting a joy/Joy message.
It appears tutorial was not updated for Electric. In Electric, the Joy message was migrated to the sensor_msgs package and saw the addition of a Header field.
The quick fix for your teleop code should be change from joy::Joy to sensor_msgs::Joy, updating the includes and manifest dependencies appropriately.
