A:

You can spawn multiple instances of the same model via launch files. The lots_of_robots.launch example launch file spawns 100 Pioneer 3 AT robots into Gazebo for instance (screenshot) ;) It's a small demo I created at a workshop last year, and should give you an idea how you can do it also for fewer robots. Setting up the correct group namespaces and tf for onboard software can be a bit tricky though.
