Q:

ERROR: cannot launch node of type [ps3joy/ps3_joy_node]

First of all, I'm running Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS (using catkin hydro) on my workstation and at the beginning, I have these packets: beginner_tutorials, ps3joy and CMakelist.txt file  ( ~/catkin_ws_ruben/src )
Im trying to follow Writing a Teleoperation Node for the PS3 Joystick from
http://wiki.ros.org/ps3joy/Tutorials/WritingTeleopNode
I created my new package learning_ps3joy on ~/catkin_ws_ruben/src
chmod +x turtle_teleop_ps3joy.cpp   (to execute turtle_teleop_ps3joy.cpp I've created)
I suppose that this line is wrong on wiki:
rosbuild_add_executable(turtle_teleop_ps3joy src/turtle_teleop_ps3joy.cpp)
so I change for this
rosbuild_add_executable(learning_ps3joy src/turtle_teleop_ps3joy.cpp)
So in CMakeList.txt I have the following ( I suppose is correct):
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.4.6)
include($ENV{ROS_ROOT}/core/rosbuild/rosbuild.cmake)

# Set the build type.  Options are:
#  Coverage       : w/ debug symbols, w/o optimization, w/ code-coverage
#  Debug          : w/ debug symbols, w/o optimization
#  Release        : w/o debug symbols, w/ optimization
#  RelWithDebInfo : w/ debug symbols, w/ optimization
#  MinSizeRel     : w/o debug symbols, w/ optimization, stripped binaries
#set(ROS_BUILD_TYPE RelWithDebInfo)

rosbuild_init()

#set the default path for built executables to the "bin" directory
set(EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/bin)
#set the default path for built libraries to the "lib" directory
set(LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/lib)

#uncomment if you have defined messages
rosbuild_genmsg()
#uncomment if you have defined services
#rosbuild_gensrv()

#common commands for building c++ executables and libraries

rosbuild_add_executable(learning_ps3joy src/turtle_teleop_ps3joy.cpp)

#rosbuild_add_library(${PROJECT_NAME} src/example.cpp)
#target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} another_library)
#rosbuild_add_boost_directories()
#rosbuild_link_boost(${PROJECT_NAME} thread)
#rosbuild_add_executable(example examples/example.cpp)
#target_link_libraries(example ${PROJECT_NAME})

I type rosmake and then following Setting up the PS3 Joystick without problems
Then I create launch folder, create inside turtle_ps3joy.launch
<launch>

 <!-- Turtlesim Node-->
  <node pkg="turtlesim" type="turtlesim_node" name="sim"/>

 <!-- PS3 joy node -->
  <node respawn="true" pkg="ps3joy"
        type="ps3joy_node" name="PS3_turtle_joy" >
    <param name="dev" type="string" value="/dev/input/js0" />
    <param name="deadzone" value="0.12" />
  </node>

 <!-- Axes -->
  <param name="axis_linear" value="1" type="int"/>
  <param name="axis_angular" value="0" type="int"/>
  <param name="scale_linear" value="2" type="double"/>
  <param name="scale_angular" value="2" type="double"/>

  <node pkg="turtle_teleop" type="turtle_teleop_joy" name="teleop"/>

</launch>

and run on termimal     roslaunch learning_ps3joy turtle_ps3joy.launch
Output:

So , How can I solve this?
Thanks for your time

A:

Can you share your launch file and a little more clarity on the packages you are using?
It is most likely a naming error. You need to take care with what you are naming your packages, your nodes and your executables. And the same should reflect in your launch file.
Another common error is - you might not have sourced the setup.bash of your catkin workspace. As a result ROS will not find your packages.

Packages that I am using: turtlesim, ps3joy and turtle_teleop on ~/catkin_ws_ruben/src/
Now, I think launch file is correct with the name of packages and nodes
I sourced the setup.bash at the beginning tutorials

hello, I have the same problem with you. Did you solve this problem? Could you tell me how?
Comment by astur on 2014-12-18:
I use package joy (I discard package ps3joy). Moreover, I use geometry_msgs.msg import Twist and publish with pub = rospy.Publisher('turtle1/cmd_vel', Twist) with this msg. Also, make sure you have the correct lines on package and CMakeList and the packages on /src.Then apply a catkin_make
Comment by astur on 2014-12-18:
robin@rchiesa:~/catkin_ws_ruben/src/$ ls
CMakeLists.txt   include  msg           src  launch   package.xml  scripts       srv
~/catkin_ws_ruben/$   catkin_make
Can you write here what error is showing you?, i can try to help you.
