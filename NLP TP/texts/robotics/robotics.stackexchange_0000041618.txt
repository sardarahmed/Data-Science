A:

Evaluating results of what? Tabletop object detection? 3D SLAM?
For 3D slam with color information, there are some datasets here (the bagfiles contain depth and rgb images from the Kinect, and there is a script to compute point clouds from them if you need that).

Sure, here you go: http://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset/tools#adding_point_clouds_to_ros_bag_files

BTW, you should use that script only to work with the RGBDSLAM-Bagfiles. If you just want to record depth images yourself and add point clouds later, this method is better: http://wiki.ros.org/openni_launch/Tutorials/BagRecordingPlayback
