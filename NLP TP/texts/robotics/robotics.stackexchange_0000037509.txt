Q:

pip/easy_install -U rosinstall problem

Hi,
I am installing Diamondback afresh on Ubuntu10.04 using repository deb packages. The steps are followed as given in wiki.
By default rosinstall is not setup. I am stuck while following the steps as in http://ros.org/wiki/rosinstall .
I am behind a proxy for which http_proxy and https_proxy is defined.
Following is the output on console:
Searching for rosinstall
Reading http://pypi.python.org/simple/rosinstall/
Download error: [Errno -2] Name or service not known -- Some packages may not be found!
This repeats couple of times. Is this issue related to proxy??? I do not face any problem when having a direct internet connnection.
Also installation of package ros-diamondback-ros-release deb ver:0.1.14-s131s503298 do not help.
I had also tried using pip. Following is the output of pip log.
  Downloading/unpacking rosinstall

  Could not fetch URL http://pypi.python.org/simple/rosinstall: <urlopen error [Errno -2] Name or service not known>

A:

It looks like easy_install obey's a environment variable to setup proxys. blog post
You can also use pip the replacement for easy_install which has a --proxy argument man page

I did set http_proxy, https_proxy. It did not worked and I end up copying packages from other machine. Maybe something is broken here or i might had made some silly mistake in exporting http_proxy. I believe we shall close this question.

It still do not works :( I can go to webpage http://pypi.python.org/simple/rosinstall/ and download one of rosinstall pkgs. What next shall i do? Readme file is not helpful enough.

This is a problem for pip/easy_install community.  I suggest that you ask this problem on their forums.
