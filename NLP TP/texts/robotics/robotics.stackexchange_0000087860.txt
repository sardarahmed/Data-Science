Q:

Cannot setup Jackal Clearpath's network

I cannot setup Jackal's network by connecting to my machine via a network cable. When I try to ssh to jackal as mention in this link https://www.clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/jackal/network.html I get an error message saying no route to host.

are you using a ethernet cable to connect?

I guess that your problem is that  when you try to ssh into the Jackal using the default IP (ssh administrator@192.168.1.11) you are getting that error right?

Yes I am using an ethernet cable, and I do get that error when I try to ssh when using the default IP. I'm not sure if it's something wrong with my laptop's ethernet driver or something wrong with the jackal

Also, I am on a class C network with network number 192.168.94 so the static IP that the tutorial tells me to give my computer (192.168.1) cannot be achieved if I'm not mistaken. Sorry, I'm very new to Jackal and also don't know much about networks

A:

Did you try giving the static IP? You can try this:
In the right side of the top bar click the connection menu and select Edit connections.
Choose the wired connection and click Edit, then choose the  IPv4Settings tab and change the Method to Manual. There you can add an IP like 192.168.1.50 by clicking the Add button.
Then you should be able to ssh using the default static IP:
ssh administrator@192.168.1.11

what should I put for the net mask and gateway when I am editing the wired connection?

Leave them empty for now and give it a try
