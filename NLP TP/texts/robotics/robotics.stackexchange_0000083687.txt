Q:

The error: cannot resolve host address for machine

I have installed the ROS in a raspberry 2. I use the code to set  the environment .
source environment.sh

After that I make the roslaunch and there is an error
code:
roslaunch duckietown joystick.launch veh:=wama 

error:
cannot resolve host address for machine [wama]
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

My URI is wama.local:11311
I changed the hostname to biecuole, and try to ping the biecuole and biecuole.local. They both work but the error is still existing
code:
roslaunch duckietown joystick.launch veh:=biecuole... logging to /home/robot2/.ros/log/f4462c94-c3f7-11e7-b0b6-74da38c7fa07/roslaunch-biecuole-8314.log
Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.

Does ping wama in a command terminal work? If not, that is the problem.

A:

Unable to establish ssh connection to [zhang@biecuole.local:22]: Server u'biecuole.local' not found in known_hosts

This error simply tells you that the host you are trying to connect to (using SSH) is not yet known to your own system (ie: the machine from which you are trying to connect to others).
Logging in once with ssh (in a regular terminal session) should solve this (make sure to first check #q41446 though).

I can ssh the biecuole and biecuole.local
Welcome to Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.4.38-v7+ armv7l)

I already used the code in 41446,  it does not help

Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-11-08:
If you ever connected through SSH without adding the option that #q41446 mentions, ssh will not do anything, which could mean that the current entry in known_hosts uses the wrong algorithm.
Just in case, remove any entries for biecuole and biecuole.local and try again.
