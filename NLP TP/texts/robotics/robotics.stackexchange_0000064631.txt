A:

Each line represents a single field (from a topic) which is plotted over time.
The color of the line indicates which value it represents; the legend on the graph tells you which field in the topic is represented by each color.
If you're still having trouble, maybe you can edit you question to include a screenshot, and I can explain by example.
