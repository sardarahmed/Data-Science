Q:

URDF origins tags

I'm building my first urdf, and I noticed that I can define the origin tag on the visual, collision elements but also on the link element. So I am wondering if there's a best practice ?
For instance, if I have two 10cm x 10cm x 10cm boxes one on the other, I could define the origin on the link tag with y = 5cm and the origin of the visual/collision tags at y = 5cm too but this is not really DRY, so I would probably only use the origin of the link tag only with y = 10cm, but which solution is better ?

If I understood correctly what you are saying at 17:30, using only the origin of the joint tag is not a problem for fixed joints right ? Also, in rviz, when you show the axis, which axis does it shows, the joint one ?

Using only the origin tag is probably not a problem. It shows the joint origin, which is the origin of the child link.

Since an URDF with a single link also displays axis, I assume that an implicit joint is created for the first link  in an URDF right ? And if i'm right, this joint between that URDF link and an hardcoded link created/hardcoded somewhere by the ROS system ?
