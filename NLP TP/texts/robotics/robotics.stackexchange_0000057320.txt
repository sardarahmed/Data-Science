Q:

Tracking robot position during teleoperation

Hi,
I want to track robot's current position when it is moved by teleop( which we can view in rviz  window as well)
ROS automatic behavior also need to perform similar kind of stuff during goal position achievement.
So, now which packages or exactly which part of ROS does similar kind of stuff?  (THIS HAS BEEN SORTED OUT WHICH IS amcl)
Where the processing related to comparison of current goal (x,y,z) and sub goal  is done?
Where the goal and subgoal location is stored in move_base package?
Question:3 SO WHENEVER I CLICK SET GOAL in RVIZ, where does the GOAL LOCATION is SAVED EXACTLY?
Thank you for any kind of help.

A:

ROS navigation usually uses AMCL to track and publish the location of the robot, in combination with the robot's odometry.
AMCL usually publishes the position of the robot as a TF transform from the /map frame to the /base_link frame.
To understand how rviz interacts with the navigation stack, take a look at http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/Using%20rviz%20with%20the%20Navigation%20Stack
You can also use the rostopic, rosnode and rqt_graph tools to introspect a running system, to see which topics exist and how they're connected.

@thanks for the answer. I have gone through http://wiki.ros.org/amcl. I think by listening into the amcl_pose topic, we can get the robot's position wrt the map. Global plan is completed before the robot movement in rviz; so whenever I click set goal in rviz, I need that goal location to be saved in some text file. In amcl_node.cpp, I only found some gui_publish_period, can't able to locate exactly how various navigation packages interacts dynamically with rviz. I only know that last plan is computed by navfn package. Is there any material or paper related to this issue?

Does anyone have the answer for 3rd Question?

You should be able to find the goal topic by reading the rviz tutorial that I linked to. Read section 4 carefully.
