Q:

dependency to pointcloud-to-laserscan

When I try to install dependencies on ros-noetic using rosdep:
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y

I get an error:
Cannot locate rosdep definition for [pointcloud-to-laserscan]

I already have that dependency listed on my package.xml file:
<exec_depend>pointcloud-to-laserscan</exec_depend>

link to pointcloud_to_laserscan
Can you tell me how can I solve that please? thanks.

A:

You are using the wrong name. The correct string is "pointcloud_to_laserscan".
You can list all the known rosdep names with the command rosdep db.
