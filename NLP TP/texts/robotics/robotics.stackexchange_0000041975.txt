Q:

c1 vs c2 PR2 Filesystem Organization

This question is the root cause behind this question. Short version: Roslaunch is not finding the right packages on c2.
The problem is that my package path included /home/dlu/ros which works on c1, but not on c2. The correction is that /u/dlu/ros works on both.
Are there any other differences between c1 and c2 in how their file systems are organized?

A:

The pr2 filesystem overview can be found in the PR2 Manual including discussion of home directories and unionFS setup.
