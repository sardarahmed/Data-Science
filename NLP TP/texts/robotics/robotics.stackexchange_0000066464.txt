A:

Put your contact into a geometry_msgs/PointStamped and set the frame_id to world, then use tf transformPoint to transform the point into the link frame.

Thank you!
One comment is that the /tf should be publishing data at sufficient rate.
Use rostopic hz /tf to see the rate. Gazebo publishes link states at 1kHz by default.
But using tf methods simplifies transformations.
