A:

If you Google there are number of projects to run ROS on Edison found:

http://wiki.ros.org/Edison and http://wiki.ros.org/wiki/edison.
Also this one is elaborated but in Japanese

(TODO: those two pages on ros.org above are currently disjoint. They should be combined or at least moved to somewhere common).

@130s, Thank you - these links will be helpful.
When I googled, I only came across instructions on how to install ROS on Yocto.
