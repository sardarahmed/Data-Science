Q:

mjpeg_sever cmake error:Unknown CMake command "catkin_project"

I follow the http://www.ros.org/wiki/mjpeg_server
and svn co http://svn.code.sf.net/p/bosch-ros-pkg/code/trunk/stacks/remote_lab/mjpeg_server
But when I cmake it. there's error:

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:12 (catkin_project):
Unknown CMake command "catkin_project".

How to deal with it ?

Which version of ROS are you on? Fuerte?

A:

Hi Koprenee,
since the day you asked the question we switched back to rosmake from catkin. I don't know if you already tried, but if you check out the latest code and do
rosmake mjpeg_server
it should compile just fine.
