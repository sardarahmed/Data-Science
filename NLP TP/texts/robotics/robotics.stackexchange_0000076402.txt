Q:

clock skew was detected warning

I am logging into a laptop via teamviewer and then ssh- ing into another system. When I run catkin_make   in that system, it gives me the warning:
clock skew was detected. Your build may be incomplete.

What is the reason for this warning; Is it due to teamviewer? How can this be avoided.

A:

This isn't related to ROS; it's actually a message from make, when it's running the build files generated by cmake.
Stack overflow has a decent explanation.
It seems like you're connecting through quite a few machines. If you're transferring files between machines or using a network filesystem, it's possible that not all of the computers involved agree on what time it is. (possibly disagreeing on which time zone you're in or whether use local time or UTC for timestamps)
