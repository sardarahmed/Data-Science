Q:

position control of uav

Hi guys , i would like to create a node for position control.
It should get current position values and the target position values .
For control i want to use a common PID Control for each coordinate.The node should output cmd_velocity message (geometry_msgs/Twist topic)
Is there maybe ready code for my goal?
Can i write a simple publisherfor that goal? So it is possible that a common publisher communicate with a gazebo plugin?
How the code might look like?
thanks
adrian
