Q:

colcon package ignore regex

Hi I would like ignore connext and cyclonedds related packages e.g: rmw_connextdds, rmw_connextdds_common, rti_connext_dds_cmake_module && cyclonedds, rmw_cyclonedds_cpp
colcon build  --symlink-install --packages-ignore-regex connext cyclonedds

But I have a warning says
[0.349s] WARNING:colcon.colcon_core.package_discovery:the --packages-ignore-regex 'connext' doesn't match any of the package names.
How to have a proper regex to ignore the packages ?

A:

The regex selection and skip arguments are implemented using python's re.match meaning that the regular expression must patch the start of the string (in this case the package name) so changing the command to:
colcon build  --symlink-install --packages-ignore-regex '.*connext' '.*cyclonedds'

should have the intended effect.
