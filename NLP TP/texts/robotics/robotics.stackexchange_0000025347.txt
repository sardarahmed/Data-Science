Q:

Gravity Disabled on Robot Pinned to World

I have a simple robot with four links and four revolute joints.  The first joint is pinned to the world.  When I run the simulation, the robot is not affected by gravity.  I know gravity is enabled because when I drag another object like a box and drop it into the world, it falls down.  I suspect that gravity is not affecting my four-link robot because it is pinned to the world.  Could this be the case?  How can I enable gravity for my robot?
Update:  The problem was fixed by specifying collision elements for each link in the robot. This is strange since collisions and dynamics should be decoupled.  Should this be considered a bug?

can you post your robot model?  (with and without collision bodies?)

can you change your question's title to reflect the issue?  i.e. dynamics disabled if missing collision element?  thanks.

A:

It appears if a model does not have any collision elements, it behaves statically, ticketed here.
