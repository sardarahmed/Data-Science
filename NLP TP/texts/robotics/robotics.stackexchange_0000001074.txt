Q:

How to assemble brushless motors and propellers?

I'm building a quadcopter and I've received my motors and propellers.
What's the right way to assemble those together?
I'm not confident with what I've done, as I'm not sure the propeller would stay in place on a clockwise rotating motor.
I mean, if the motor rotates clockwise, will the screw stay tightly in place, even with the prop's inertia pushing counter-clockwise?
Here's what I've done (of course i'll tighten the screw...) :

This is correct. Just make sure to insert a lever into the hole at the top to really tighten the nut!
