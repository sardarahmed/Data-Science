Q:

Colcon build gives Qt5quick error

I am trying to build this package on ROS2. I was getting some errors with tf2_geometry_msgs but I resolved that by editing the CMake file and package.xml. Apart from this, I am getting the following error that I cannot get rid of:
--- stderr: ui_for_debug_and_demo
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:28 (find_package):
By not providing "FindQt5Quick.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Qt5Quick",
but CMake did not find one.
Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Qt5Quick" with any
of the following names:
Qt5QuickConfig.cmake
qt5quick-config.cmake

Add the installation prefix of "Qt5Quick" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
"Qt5Quick_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
"Qt5Quick" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
been installed.
I installed Qt5 from multiple sources and even tried giving the cmake path by this command:
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/Qt5.10.1/5.10.1/gcc_64/lib/cmake
However this error keeps persisting and I am unable to build the packages.
Please help with this

A:

Do you have Qt5 installed?
sudo apt-get install qtbase5-dev
sudo apt-get install qtdeclarative5-dev

Based on this post from StackOverflow.
