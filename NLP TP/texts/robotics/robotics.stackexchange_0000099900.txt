Q:

Autoware 1.14.0 build error: ‘Index’ in namespace ‘Eigen’ does not name a type

I follow autoware wiki  to build autoware 1.14.0 step by step, when I begin to build (without CUDA), error occurs:
error: ‘Index’ in namespace ‘Eigen’ does not name a type   return state_(static_cast<Eigen::Index>(IDX::X));

my environment: ubuntu 18.04 ros Melodic ,Eigen 3.2.10
and here is my error log from terminal
So how can I solve this error?
Thanks in advance!

A:

Ok,  It is because the version of Eigen is old, I downgrade autoware to 1.12.0 and update Eigen to 3.3.7, and then build successfully.
