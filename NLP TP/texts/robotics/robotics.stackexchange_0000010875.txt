Q:

Relay Fix at Normally Open

I am using my RF module to send a High signal to relay but just once by a push button.As soon as I release it the Relay goes to NC . How can I Fix it to stay at NO . I thought of using a Flip-Flop.

A:

Yes, that is a very good way to go...
you can use a t flip flop so you the q output can hold the relay in the state you need and can toogle every time you press the button..
here the T flip flip, your signal every time you press the button must be connected to the clock

and the output signal diagram looks like

Edit
you can replace the flip flop with its equivalent nand gates

or even more, considering that every nand gate can be schematizied with diodes
like
but as you can see you will need more more elements and more place on the main board if you really want to replace the flipflop
