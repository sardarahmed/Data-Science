Q:

simple_navigation_goals no such file or directory

Hello,
I am new to ROS. I am using ubuntu 16.04 and am trying to follow this tutorial
I followed all the steps, however when I run ./bin/simple_navigation_goals in the end, I get
bash: ./bin/simple_navigation_goals: No such file or directory
Can someone let me know why this is?
I have already tried to do source devel/setup.bash after I did catkin_make
Thanks,
Aaron

I see that's how the tutorial that you linked to tells you to run the node way which I find strange. Usually, you'd run the node with
rosrun <package-name> <node-name>

Can you try running the node that way and see what happens?

A:

figured it out, you have to cd in to /catkin_ws/devel/lib/simple_navigation_goals and then run ./simple_navigation_goals to work...

How did you compile the node and how are you trying to run it? You should be able to use rosrun from anywhere in your terminal (i.e., not having to be in /catkin_ws/devel/lib/simple_navigation_goals )
