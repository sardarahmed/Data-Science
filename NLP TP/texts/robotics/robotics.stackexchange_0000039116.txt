Q:

Does android_tutorial_pubsub connect to other ROS Masters?

I've built and installed android_tutorial_pubsub from source, but it doesn't seem to connect to a specified ros master on a host computer. I'm running it on an Asus Transformer Prime with Ice Cream Sandwich (4.0.3). Should I expect this to work in this way?
rosjava_core:

 merge
branch: default

android_core:

 Initial import of android_core documentation.
branch: default

I've also tried it on a Honeycomb tablet (Iconia Tab) and a Gingerbread Nexus One (2.3.6) all with the same behavior, so I'm assuming I'm missing something.

Additionally, android_tutorial_camera exits when I try to open it with the error "Unfortunately , CameraTutorial has stopped."

See the answer here: http://answers.ros.org/question/12771/running-android_tutorial_pubsub
The tutorial starts its own roscore. You'll have to modify it to connect to a different one.
