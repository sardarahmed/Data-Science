Q:

ROS node implementation

Hi, I want to implement C# in ROS, and I want to first initialize a C# node.
I found the code in roslib, /opt/ros/electric/ros/core/roslib/src/roslib/xmlrpc.py, seems to have implemented node(by class XmlRpcNode(object)).But I am not sure if this file is the right one I am looking for.
Thanks~

A:

Implementing a ROS client library in C# is not trivial. Some information on the client protocol can be found here. What you essentially need to do is:

Implement the slave API which is based on XMLRPC.

Implement a message generator that parses msg files and generates C# code for serialization an deserialization

Implement the TCPROS transport.

Also have a look at this wiki page and this question.
