Q:

Error:Invalid  tag: turtlebot_description

Hi! I am beginner in ROS and Turtlebot3 and I'm trying to run this command line roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_remote.launch to launch robot state publisher and I have this error:
while processing /home/fish/catkin_ws/src/turtlebot3/turtlebot3_bringup/launch/includes/description.launch.xml:
Invalid <arg> tag: turtlebot3_description
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/kinetic/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/home/fish/catkin_ws/src
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/kinetic/share. 

Arg xml is <arg default="$(find xacro)/xacro --inorder '$(find turtlebot3_description)/urdf/turtlebot3_$(arg model).urdf.xacro'" name="urdf_file"/>
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

It looks like I do not have urdf file

A:

I managed to solve it. I have reinstalled turtlebot3 packages on my PC, and then delete the folder.
Link to turtlebot3 repository: https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3.git
How to install using git clone:
cd ~/catkin_ws/src

git clone <link>

cd ~/catkin_ws
