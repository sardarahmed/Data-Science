Q:

heightmap insertion unsuccessful with gazebo 7

I want to use heightmap created by myself in gazebo, and I`ve followed tutorials like  this one and  this. I use Ubuntu 16.04 and gazebo 7 as the second tutorial requires.
At first , I created a heightmap as the first tutorial instructed, and  I tested with my gazebo. It worked out, though occasionally the heightmap  wasn't loaded fully .  Only half of the terrain was loaded,  and the other half was flat.
But after a few hours I tried again. But no matter how I try , my gazebo always  crashes after I insert heightmap.
And the error msg is always the same:
gzclient: /usr/include/boost/smart_ptr/shared_ptr.hpp:648: typename boost::detail::sp_member_access<T>::type boost::shared_ptr<T>::operator->() const [with T = gazebo::msgs::Response; typename boost::detail::sp_member_access<T>::type = gazebo::msgs::Response*]: Assertion `px != 0' failed.

I've checked a question asked by others before.But is there any better solution to this problem?
Updating gazebo to 8 may work, but it's not convenient and the tutorials insert heightmap with gazebo 7 successfully.
Thanks in advance.

Can you try using gazebo 7.7? There are instructions in the question you linked to. I assume you are using a large image for the heightmap. Can you try using a smaller image?

My image is 129x129. Gazebo 7.9 works.  Thanks.

A:

Update gazebo to the 7.9.
http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=install_ubuntu&cat=install
get OSRF keys, and then sudo apt upgrade.
