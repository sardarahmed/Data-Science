Q:

Kind of values(convention) of input parameters in setRPY from tf::Quaternion class

I would like to know about setRPY method in defined in tf::Quaternion class. I couldn't find the API documentation describing it. What range of values in the input parameters(values of roll, pitch and yaw) does it expect? Is it:

-180 to 180 or
0 to 360

Thanks in advance.

A:

ROS standard units of measure
Angles are represented in radians. It does not make a difference whether you represent them in the 0 to 2pi range, or the -pi to pi range
