Q:

How to estimate velocity from robot_pose_ekf

I have a differential drive mobile robot. and I am using  robot_pose_ekf to estimate the state of the robot [x,y,θ]
How to estimate  [v,ω ] the translational and rotational velocities. from robot_pose_ekf output  or adding   [v,ω ]  as an output from robot_pose_ekf [x,y,θ,v,ω] .

A:

The output topic is http://docs.ros.org/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/PoseWithCovarianceStamped.html which is not providing velocity, I don't think robot pose EKF allows you to do this. Robot Localization however will allow you to do this.

Are there any individual  package that  can estimate [v,ω ] directly from the output of robot_pose_ekf [x,y,θ], robot_pose_ekf/odom_combined (geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped)?

Look at replacing robot pose ekf with robot localization.

It sort of makes sense that something called robot_pose_ekf doesn't output velocity, doesn't it?
