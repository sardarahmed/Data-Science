A:

How are you subscribing to the images? If you're subscribing the raw image, the amount of data that has to be transferred could be quite large. Using one of the compressed transports (compressed or theora) may speed things up quite a bit. I'd suggest taking a look at the image_transport wiki page to learn more.
