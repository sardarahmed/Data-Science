Q:

Can use freenect library for ASUS Xtion

Hi all
I am working with ROS turtlebot in ARM-based UDOO board, as I research, ROS Hydro support freekinect library for ARM, so I want to ask , can I use it for ASUS Xtion, because I think ASUS Xtion is more convenient than Kinect. So what should I do now?

A:

I found one link in google group, there is one guy build successfully xtion and kobuki with raspberry Pi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAisDh1kngQ
I think it is as same as UDOO

I will try do it in this week.
In additionally, I think ros-hydro now have not enough supported features for ubuntuARM, so if any ones are excited about turtlebot and ARM, let try with ros-groovy and wait the new hydro update
