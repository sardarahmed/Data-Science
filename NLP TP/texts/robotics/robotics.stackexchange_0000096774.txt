Q:

I am getting while launching my turtlebot pn RVIZ

I am using turtlebot for my obstacle avoid robot using ultrasonic sensors.I am using 8 ultrasonic sensors.I dont know where the error is but ths it is successfully seen in gazebo but while I am launching it in rviz.
`[ERROR] [1596993808.761522983]: Failed to build tree: parent link [base_footprint] of joint [sonar_front_joint] not found.  This is not valid according to the URDF spec. Every link you refer to from a joint needs to be explicitly defined in the robot description. To fix this problem you can either remove this joint [sonar_front_joint] from your urdf file, or add "" to your urdf file.
[robot_state_publisher-3] process has died [pid 4060, exit code 255, cmd /opt/ros/kinetic/lib/robot_state_publisher/state_publisher __name:=robot_state_publisher __log:=/home/lekhasree/.ros/log/09d44e52-da65-11ea-afc1-e8d0fc91b2fd/robot_state_publisher-3.log].
log file: /home/lekhasree/.ros/log/09d44e52-da65-11ea-afc1-e8d0fc91b2fd/robot_state_publisher-3*.log
PLese help me out with this error
The urdf file is https://github.com/Lekha03/urdf-of-ultrasonic-sensors-with-turtlebot.git[link text](https://github.com/Lekha03/urdf-of-ultrasonic-sensors-with-turtlebot.git)
In this I have inserted the required files. Turtlebot isnt visible in RVIZ, what should I do.

A:

You did not specify the link base_footprint in your urdf file. I assume this link is specified in the turtlebot description, which you should include in your urdf.

Thank you ...It is not showing errors .But my turtlebot is not visible in RVIZ.,only a rectangular is being visible.

You need to add RobotModel in the Rviz Panel in order to see the turtlebot

Yeah I am Inserting But no turtlebot is visible.Only rectangular box is visible.

Can please check the files.Should I insert anything more for turtelbot to be visible.

If you don't have a real robot than you might have to include joint state publisher to fake the joints. You might be seeing now only the fixed joints so for non-fixed you need joint state publisher.

Yeah, I did It but a BOX is being Visible. Cant I visualize my gazebo world on RVIZ

I am not sure if the urdf included in your link is the actual one you are using, but from the commented parts I see that you are specifying boxes as visuals, hence the box in Rviz.
<visual>
      <origin xyz="0 0 0" rpy="0 0 0"/>
      <geometry>
        <box size="0.02 0.01 0.01"/>
      </geometry>
</visual>   

You need to specify meshes if you want them to be visible in Rviz
