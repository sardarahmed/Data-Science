Q:

Problem Installing Groovy on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Hi,
I am trying to begin working with ROS and I am completely new to ROS and I already have Ubuntu 12.04 LTS installed on my desktop. I configured the repositories, set up the sources.list, set up the keys ran sudo apt-get update and then called sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-desktop-full but I am getting the following error
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree

Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created

Do you have enabled the community packages? The easiest way is to run sudo synaptic, go to Settings|Repositories and activate all Ubuntu sources except Source Code, i.e. main, restricted, universe and multiverse.
Comment by roehling on 2013-02-28:
Are all your system packages up-to-date? Run sudo apt-get dist-upgrade and make sure that no packages have to be upgraded. Do you have any other third party repositories or PPAs which might clash with the ROS ones? Lastly, try to install the bare-bones system ros-groovy-ros and see if that works

has someone found a solution to this issue? I am not able to find a solution :-/ This thread doesn't seem to fix it either http://bit.ly/12W9dLy

A:

Check if you have been selected right distro on source.list.
This happened to me, that I put the ubuntu 12.10 instead of 12.04, and this occurred to me :)
