Q:

Scripts in ROS root space?

When I am trying to understand the layout of ROS root space , I found that all the files ( or most of them ) of pre-built packages are scripted in python. Although in user built packages, c++ implementation is available I would like to know if it is possible to have a c++ version of the core scripts ? Or are there some of them that can only be scripted in python . Thanks in advance

A:

If you mean "are they already provided (by OSRF) and can I somehow install them", then: no.
If by "is it possible" you mean: can they be reimplemented, then: yes, probably, but I doubt anyone is going to do that.

Or are there some of them that can only be scripted in python?

Well .. this is software, so anything is possible, but for some things Python is / was just more efficient / natural / easy / more portable, for others C++.
The choice for a particular language also doesn't necessarily only depend on 'objective' metrics, but often times also on the experience and preferences of the involved developers, which in this case I believe preferred Python for some things. Hence large parts are implemented in that language.
