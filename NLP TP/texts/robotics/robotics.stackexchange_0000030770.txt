Q:

KeyError: '10' when running rosdep install on Linux Mint 10 machine

Hello!
I started ROS on Linux Mint in a Virtual Box. Since the virtual Linux was very slow, I installed the full Linux Mint and restarted the Tutorial in the new Linux. Unfortunately when I arrived at the 3rd chapter and tried to install the turtlesim the following error happend:
/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/ros_tutorials/turtlesim $ rosdep install turtlesim
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/diamondback/ros/bin/rosdep", line 35, in <module>
    sys.exit(rosdep.main())
  File "/opt/ros/diamondback/ros/tools/rosdep/src/rosdep/main.py", line 124, in main
    r = core.Rosdep(verified_packages, robust=options.robust)
  File "/opt/ros/diamondback/ros/tools/rosdep/src/rosdep/core.py", line 296, in __init__
    self.osi = roslib.os_detect.OSDetect(os_list)
  File "/opt/ros/diamondback/ros/core/roslib/src/roslib/os_detect.py", line 479, in __init__
    self.detect_os()
  File "/opt/ros/diamondback/ros/core/roslib/src/roslib/os_detect.py", line 498, in detect_os
    self._os_version = os_class.get_version()
  File "/opt/ros/diamondback/ros/tools/rosdep/src/rosdep/debian.py", line 124, in get_version
    return self.version_map[self.mint_detector.get_version()]
KeyError: '10'

If somebody has an Idea on how to solve it, I would be very happy for any input! I already reinstalled ROS and uninstalled the Virtual box, but it is still not working...
Thanks a lot

A:

Rosdep doesn't support Mint 10 at the moment.  There is a patch to be applied in ticket 3404 thanks to flofra.
