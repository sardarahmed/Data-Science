Q:

problem to run kinova Mico2 robotic arm

Hi,
I follow this tutorial "https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/kinova-ros" to control kinova mico 2 robotic arm (4DOF, with 2 fingers gripper). When I run this roslaunch kinova_bringup kinova_robot.launch kinova_robotType:=m2n4a200 use_urdf:=true, I got this error:
... logging to /home/abbas/.ros/log/29b74d74-af7a-11e6-bcec-000c291b5b22/roslaunch-ubuntu-6431.log

xacro: Traditional processing is deprecated. Switch to --inorder processing!

To check for compatibility of your document, use option --check-order.
For more infos, see http://wiki.ros.org/xacro#Processing_Order

Param xml is <param command="$(find xacro)/xacro.py '$(find kinova_description)/urdf/$(arg kinova_robotType)_standalone.xacro'" name="robot_description"/>
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

I could not find any xacro script for mico2 robotic arm in urdf folder (in kinova_description).
How can I solve this issue?
Thanks,
Abbas

A:

You have 2 steps to figure out this problem :
First is to go to your Xacro files which are in your robot_description package and for each one of them type this command at the Terminal :
" rosrun xacro xacro [filename.xacro/filename.urdf.xacro] "
Then you can find out where is the problem comes from.
And the second step is to go to this site
" http://wiki.ros.org/xacro "
And read about the new changes to convert your file and resolve the problem.
Good luck

Hi DT,
Thank you for your answer. I communicated with the kinova company, First, they said I can use the urdf of mico1. Second they sent me edited kinova_comm.cpp in kinov_adriver/src and it works now.
