Q:

Are there standard angular velocities when it comes to robotic arms?

for manipulators that lift heavy loads, e.g. a car or a cow, what would be the ideal angular velocity?
Are there any standards for arm safe moving speed? (of course I know it depends on the project and use, the question is a yes or no)
Is there any difference when the manipulator works around people ? (since in some cases people can be moving around it, so should it move slower ?)

A:

First of all there is nothing like an ideal angular velocity. There might be an optimal one based on some cost function you defined, there might be a nominal one related to you operational ranges, there might be a typical one related to the task in general.
Usually the manipulators moving heavy loads are moving rather slowly because of the dynamics effects induced by the load and the manipulator itself. If the load was to me moved faster, it will require more energy and generate way more strains on the manipulator structure. 
Also typically if you design a manipulator you thing at the level of forces and moments, which implies considering joint torque more than joint velocity.
Lastly concerning the human-robot interactions there are some norms to be followed by industry, ISO 10218 and more recently ISO/TS 15066. Both are rather restrictive in terms of end-effector velocity. Additionally you can look at the work of Pr. Haddadin on human-robot interactions and how to consider different metrics than just end-effector velocity and take into account the shape (and associated trauma) of the end-effector.
