Q:

Point cloud in gazebo environment

I am working on a project whose main objective is to check the sensors that can perceive the environment and implement those in gazebo environment. so i am trying to implement lidar sensor and generate point cloud of the outdoor environment. Can anyone guide me how to generate a point cloud of an outdoor environment in Ignition Gazebo Fortress?

A:

So you want to take a ros2 PointCloud2 message and write it to a .pcd file.
There is a existing ros1/ros2 package called pcl_ros. The src code for both is in this github repo, but I don't know the current status of the port to ros2. This package has a ros node named pointcloud_to_pcd that writes PointCloud2 messages into .pcd files.
