Q:

Why do I kept getting KeyError:'TURTLEBOT_MODEL' every time I run the teleop command?

I am trying to do a simple simulation of the Turtlebot3 and I'm currently using ROS2 Foxy. I tried to run this command in the other terminal
ros2 run turtlebot3_teleop teleop_keyboard

but it returns this error
File "/usr/lib/python3.8/os.py", line 675, in __getitem__
raise KeyError(key) from None

KeyError: 'TURTLEBOT3_MODEL'

Have you done a web search on "TURTLEBOT3_MODEL" ?

A:

Have you added TURTLEBOT_MODEL to your .bashrc?
You can do this by writing in the terminal echo "export TURTLEBOT_MODEL=burger" >> ~/.bashrc if your model is burger.

agree that's the issue, unless you source it, you need to export TURTLEBOT_MODEL=burger in every terminal.
