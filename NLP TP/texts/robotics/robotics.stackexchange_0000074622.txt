Could you explain all the steps you took?
If you downloaded the source and built the package, have you sourced setup.bash?

I actually figured out the problem a while back.I didnt add the setup file to bashrc and so whenever i opened a new terminal , i got this error.Still thanks vmatos.

A:

I don't see any release for Kinetic of rosserial on wiki/rosserial or status_page/ros_kinetic_default.html?q=serial, so I would think not being able to install it is expected.
