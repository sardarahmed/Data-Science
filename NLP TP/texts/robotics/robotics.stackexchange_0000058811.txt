Q:

NAO laser head urg_node connection problem

Hi. I'm trying to use NAO laser head with urg_node, but there is connection problem. I'm trying to connect with Ehternet and always have same problem
 [FATAL] [1397748302.090283298]: Could not open network Hokuyo:
192.168.0.10:10940
could not open ethernet port.

Also i used different ip-diapason address: default, 192.168.0.0/24, 192.168.1.0/24 there is no connection to laser. (to connect laser use NAO ip, default ip (192.168.0.10) as said here) What i'm doing wrong?

A:

Do you have details about the Nao laser head you are using? I'm pretty sure that the Hokuyo laser is not connected via ethernet but a serial device over USB (the only one I know with the URG04LX is definitely not network-enabled). So you can't connect to it over network. Instead you need to cross-compile hokuyo_node or urg_node for the Nao and run the driver locally on the robot.
