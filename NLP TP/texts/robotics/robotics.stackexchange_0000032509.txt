Q:

Swissranger camera - fail to open device through ethernet

Hi all,
I am running on the diamondback on a linux and am having problems when connecting the Swissranger (4k) using swissranger_camera found at http://www.ros.org/wiki/swissranger_camera. I have followed the respective tutorial and have noticed that the udev settings had to be changed for the "usb" method of transmission; is there an equivalent when using the ethernet?
Currently I get an error msg as such

[ERROR] [1308857795.791120355]: Exception thrown while connecting to the camera: [SR::open]: Failed to open device!
What steps should I take to config this to use ethernet?
Thanks in advance!

You probably won't need udev rules for ethernet.

A:

Hi,
I run the camera as roslaunch sr_eth.launch. Before launching the swissranger_camera node, you should set the ethernet address of the camera by editing this launch file (ether_addr parameter) and any other parameter which best fits your application.
Cheers

thanks.For those who might be struggling, I had to do something like this: telnet default ethernet address 192.168.1.42, set the static address by fw_setenv staticip 192.168.1.33 and change my ipv4 settings to have the same three fields as the new static addr, mask 255,255,255,0; power off/on s4k
