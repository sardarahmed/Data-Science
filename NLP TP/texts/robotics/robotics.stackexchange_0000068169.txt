Q:

How to put a launch file?

Hi all.
I'm trying to create a launch file as part of Hokuyo TF.
<launch>
  <node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="odom_to_base_link" args="0 0 0 0 0 0 odom base_link 100" />
  <node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="US6" args="0 7 2 1.5708 0 0 base_link laser 100" />
</launch>

Credits to Malefitz for the codes.
However, I'm wondering where should I copy the .launch file to.
Thanks for any help!

A:

Put launch files into the package you pass as the 1st argument.
$ roslaunch [package] [filename.launch]

As noted in the tutorial, roslaunch command automatically looks into the passed package and detect available launch files.
