Can you clarify what is slower? Setting up connection, sending data (and then: bw or latency), tearing them down, something else?

I mean while sending and receiving data its slower than a TCP socket connection without ROS framework.

How are you measuring this? If you are comparing sending a raw array of bytes versus publishing and receiving messages, then that is not a correct comparison.

A:

ROSTCP is an adapter that lets ROS send messages over TCP for topics; not for general use.
If you want a TCP socket, use the standard OS interface for creating a TCP socket.
