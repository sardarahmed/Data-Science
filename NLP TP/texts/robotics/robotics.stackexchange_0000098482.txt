Q:

Publish RTABMAP cloud_map as ordered point cloud

I am using a D435 and T256 to record 3d data with realsense_ros. D435 data is published as a ordered point cloud. Environment point cloud is assembled with RTABMAP and published as cloud_map.
Is it possible to get cloud_map published as ordered point cloud(height > 1)?

A:

I don't see how it could be possible as cloud_map is the point cloud of the whole map, it is not structured like an image WxH.
