Q:

Show which nodes run on which host

Hi guys,
I am currently experimenting with distributing my ROS application to multiple machines.
I would like to get an overview on what nodes are running on which hosts within the network.
Is there anything like rqt_graph which provides additional host information?
Thank you!

A:

From the command line you can use rosnode machine <machine-name>. Details at rosnode wiki page. In a very quick glance I did not see a programmatic way to call this utility.
