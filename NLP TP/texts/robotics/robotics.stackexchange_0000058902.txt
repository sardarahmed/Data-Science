Q:

could not find executable file

Hi
I am trying to use Voxelized Shape and Color Histograms (VOSCH) in order to recognize an object,  I follow this link http://wiki.ros.org/vosch ,but when I run :

rosrun vosch example_vosch rospack find vosch/data/sample_cone_green.pcd

I got the Error that

Couldn't find executable named example_vosch below   /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/mapping/vosch

can anyone help me to fix it?

A:

I think that you did not compile it after downloading the package.
Please check that all dependencies are installed and it compiles without errors. Then it should find the executable.
You can also try
rosmake --pre-clean <package_name>
to remove the previous builds and compile it right now in your system.
Good luck!
