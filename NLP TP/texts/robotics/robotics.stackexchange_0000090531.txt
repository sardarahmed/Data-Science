Q:

No interactive markers displayed whilst following moveit! tutorial ROS Kinetic

I am new to using rviz and moveit and currently working through the following tutorials on ROS Kinetic:

http://docs.ros.org/kinetic/api/moveit_tutorials/html/doc/getting_started/getting_started.html
http://docs.ros.org/kinetic/api/moveit_tutorials/html/doc/quickstart_in_rviz/quickstart_in_rviz_tutorial.html

I completed the first link, moving onto the second link (quickstart in rviz) and completing steps 1 and 2 I find that the interactive markers are not displaying. I am unsure where the errors lie here considering I have followed the instructions perfectly.
When examining the terminal which launches moveit tutorial I see that I have a warning. I'm not sure how relevant it will be but I have included it anyway:
[ WARN] [1550244405.694068338]: Unable to update multi-DOF joint 'virtual_joint': TF has no common time between '/world' and 'panda_link0': 

Further searching around I have found that this issue may have popped up before: https://answers.ros.org/question/278820/moveit-interactive-marker-missing-on-new-kinetic-version/
However the link to the discussion is something beyond me and it doesn't seem to appear to be instructions to fix it. Unsure where to go from here and would appreciate any suggestions to fixes. Please let me know if more information is required from logs etc.

I have the same problem, please let me know if someone finds a solution!
I get an also an info, that "Stereo is NOT SUPPORTED" because "OpenGl version: 3 (GLSL 1.3)". This might be because I have got a machine with an Intel on board graphics...
Do you also get this? Might this be a problem?

A:

Although I did not seem to find a permanent solution to the downloaded demo not displaying interactive markers, I did however find an alternative way to work around it. Simply following the instructions of the next step in the tutorials, the setup assistant tutorial (http://docs.ros.org/kinetic/api/moveit_tutorials/html/doc/setup_assistant/setup_assistant_tutorial.html), will ask you to delete the panda demo folder and you will replace it yourself with a new panda which you create yourself. After this I found that interactive markers were now displaying on the new panda so I could go back and explore the previous tutorial.
I don't have an ideal fix to this, nor do I have a concrete answer as to why the demo panda does not display it (I suspect it to be linked with the end effector of the panda not being properly configured) but hopefully this will allow anyone working with moveit for the first time to continue with the tutorials.
