Q:

Error: command stage_ros not implemente

I recently installed stage_ros in my computer but when I try to run using "rosrun stage_ros stageros $(rospack stage_ros)/world/willow-erratic.world" I get the following:
[rospack] Error: command stage_ros not implemented
[FATAL] [1437511362.267388529]: The world file /world/willow-erratic.world does not exist.
[Loading /world/willow-erratic.world]err: unable to open world file /world/willow-erratic.world : No such file or directory (/tmp/buildd/ros-indigo-stage-4.1.1-4trusty-20150424-0404/libstage/worldfile.cc Load)
I'm not sure if it has something to do with how my environmental variables are set up or if I'm missing something.
EDIT 1
I got stage_ros to work now, I'm able to run thtat command line with no errors, I forgot to add the 'find' key word. This is the output in the command line:
$ rosrun stage_ros stageros $(rospack find stage_ros)/world/willow-erratic.world
[Loading /opt/ros/indigo/share/stage_ros/world/willow-erratic.world]

[ INFO] [1437593174.136336700]: Found 1 laser devices and 0 cameras in robot 0
Now I'm having some issues installing the controllers, http://wiki.ros.org/stage/Tutorials/IntroductiontoStageControllers. I downloaded, extracted and moved the folder to my catkin_ws. I catkin_make it and used the rosmake command but when I run the rosrun command in the tutorial I get the following error:
$ rosrun stage stageros 'rospack find stage_controllers'/world/roomba-wander.world
[rospack] Error: package 'stage' not found
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named stageros below

It should be rosrun stage_ros stageros 'rospack find stage_controllers'/world/roomba-wander.world. The "stage" package became a system dependency and the "stageros" node went into the "stage_ros" wrapper package.

A:

Have you installed stage_ros? And I think you messed up your command a little... This worked on mine: rosrun stage_ros stageros $(rospack find stage_ros)/world/willow-erratic.world
