Q:

No ROS_WORKSPACE set

I have upgraded from Electric to Fuerte on Ubuntu 11.10.  Every time I type roscd, I get  No ROS_WORKSPACE set.
This is part of my bashrc:
#source /opt/ros/electric/setup.bash 
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/ros:${ROS_PACKAGE_PATH}
#source /opt/ros/electric/setup.bash
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/ros_workspace:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
#source /opt/ros/electric/setup.bash
source  ~/setup.sh
source /opt/ros/fuerte/setup.bash

source /opt/ros/fuerte/setup.bash

I  appreciate any help.

what do you get when you type "echo $ROS_WORKSPACE"

As mentioned below, try adding the ros workspace in bashrc or setup.sh. Try creating a new workspace or overlay following the tutorials

A:

In my opinion you would benefit from cleaning up your .bashrc, ideally there should only be one line in it regarding ROS workspaces, which could be:
$ source ~/ros_workspace/setup.sh

This setup.sh in ~/ros_workspace could best be created using rosws or rosinstall, and it would set the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH for you.

Except some people are still getting used to the idea of workspaces, remember how long it took me to drink the kool-aid...
