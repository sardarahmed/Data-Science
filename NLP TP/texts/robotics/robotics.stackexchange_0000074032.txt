A:

If the error is bash: source/opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash: No such file or directory you simply missed a space when editing your .bashrc
The line should be
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash

and not
source/opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash

EDIT
gedit ~/.bashrc

Find all lines containing source/opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash and delete.
Add then following line:
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash

you are good to go.

open your .bashrc with an editor, you still have the line before in it.
Remove all lines sourcing something from ROS and only add the last one.
