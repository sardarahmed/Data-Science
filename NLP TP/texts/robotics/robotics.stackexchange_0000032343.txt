Q:

rospy logging configuration file

The logging overview page for rospy (http://www.ros.org/wiki/rospy/Overview/Logging) mentions that as of Diamondback, logging is configured using a file in the fileConfig format.
Is there an example of how to set this up?
Also, do there exist handlers that publish to rosout, and can those be configured from the file as well?

A:

You cannot configure rosout via the rospy logging format.
In the future, I hope to use a non-logging-module-based solution for rospy, as it is difficult to manipulate.
