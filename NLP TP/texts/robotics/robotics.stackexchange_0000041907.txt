Q:

Move base global planners switching

Hi,
After reading http://answers.ros.org/question/9888/switching-global-planner/
I've got some questions regarding the issue of switching global planner.
As I can understand the global planner is a parameter of move_base, and it's displayed in the dynamic reconfigure but I cannot change it online?
I need to use different planners and different configurations controlled by a supervisor node.
For now the options are:
Kill the move_base node and relaunch it ( roslaunch api ???)
Keep two move_base nodes online and simply reroute the goals.
Somehow change all parameters on the fly using dynamic_reconfigure.
Anyone has experience and doing something similiar, I think this would be a great addition to ros Navigation.
Thanks

A:

The consensus answer to the question you linked was to write a supervisory planner that switches between other planners when needed. That would be done using a single move_base instance.

Thank you I did a simplified version of that( 2 planners only hard coded) works great

hi, @joq, I also want to implement same function. However, I can't understand what supervisory planner is and don't know how to implement it. I also asked question, please see this link
