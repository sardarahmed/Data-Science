Q:

Python package anomoly

from std_msgs.msg import String

when ROS encounters a statement like the one above, where does it search, to obtain String class? I check $PYTHONPATH and it doesn't seem like the class exists in a file located in that path. I searched the ROS package std_msgs..but it only shows a folder msg that has the String.msg file in it. I don't see any module called 'msg' in which I expect to find the 'String' class..
Could someone please tell me whats going on? Am I missing something fundamental or are things really twisted a little bit.. ?
Thanks

A:

Look in the std_msgs package in the src directory. When messages are generated, the resulting python module is placed in the src folder in a subdirectory with the same name as the package. So the full file path on my machine is:
/opt/ros/electric/stacks/ros_comm/messages/std_msgs/src/std_msgs
