Q:

Using the OpenNI Kinect and the Nyko Zoom attatchment

I'm working on person tracking with the Microsoft Kinect and the Nyko Zoom attachment.  I need accurate distance estimates to/between each person and, of course, the Zoom warps the Kinect image.  Thus, I need to determine an intrinsic and extrinsic calibration of the Kinect with the Zoom attachment.  Based on my limited experience with this, I'm assuming that image rectification needs to occur before images are processed by OpenNI.  Has anyone else done this?  Does anyone have any advice on how to proceed?  Thanks, in advance, for your time!  :-)
