Q:

Faster ar_track_alvar

I'm playing around with ar_track_alvar package. I use it both to initialize amcl and to localize the docking station.
It works fine, but is a terrible CPU-hunger. I have changed the code to limit its frequency, but even at 8 Hz it's always taking around 60% of CPU, and my navi stack is suffering CPU starvation (and the laptop eventually switch off!).
Any suggestion for reducing the CPU usage? Maybe I should try the non-kinect version, but really I need a good depth estimation.
Another idea i'm thinking about is to make it a nodelet and load on the kinect nodelet manager... not sure if this helps reducing CPU usage, but I'm afraid it can slow down the fake laserscan.
Thank you a lot.

Well, this is not a solution, but I added dynamic reconfiguration with an enable/disable switch that subscribes/unsubscribes to pointcloud topic, what at the same time stops the (also very CPU-hungry) depth image to pointcloud nodelet. My fork https://github.com/corot/ar_track_alvar.git
