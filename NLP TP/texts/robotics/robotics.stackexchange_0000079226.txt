A:

There's a paper on tf here: http://wiki.ros.org/Papers/TePRA2013_Foote
tf2 has several optimizations but has most of the same structure. The majority of the changes were dependency cleanup etc. You can see the tf2 design here: http://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Design
Performance related changes from tf include:

Adding support for static transforms. This avoids maintaining a time history, and providoes O(1) lookups.
There is support for remote caches, reducing the need for multiple caches.
