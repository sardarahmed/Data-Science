Q:

How do I control the robot without using ROS?

I have added the model Pioneer 2DX to an empty world. This model comes with the plugin DiffDrive.
<plugin filename="libDiffDrivePlugin.so" name="diff_drive">
  <left_joint>left_wheel_hinge</left_joint>
  <right_joint>right_wheel_hinge</right_joint>
  <torque>5</torque>
</plugin>

Running gz topic -l I get the topic:
/gazebo/default/pioneer2dxCamera/vel_cmd

How do I control the robot without using ROS?
I'm getting crazy figuring out how to publish to topic vel_cmd to control this robot.

A:

You can use Gazebo Pluginsï¼Œ which can interact with Gazebo through  Gazebo API. But the data communication way is very like ROS type.

Thanks. If I want to control the robot with arrow keys? How can I do it? Thanks.

If you use ROS, that will be quite easy. But if you don't want to use ROS, then you can check Gazebo API to see if there has keyboard related functions.

You write a plugin like KeyboardGUIPlugin which publishes velocity commands. Here's a demo world: https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/src/f4e51e8f64001beda70615ab8982a7d5a4e65b18/worlds/simple_arm_teleop.world?at=default&fileviewer=file-view-default

This world is appropriate. In fact, there are many places where gazebo is very similar to ROS.
