Q:

Create_autonomy stops reacting

I am currently using create_autonomy with my Virtual machine .
I have ROS hydro installed with create autonomy.
But after running it for severel minutes on my roomba 780 I won't be able to send any more cmd_vel messages.
Basically the roomba will just continue to move in the last given direction.
Is there a simple solution to this problem or could it be caused by the virtual machine for instance?

A:

AFAIK, the robot base will latch the latest command received, regardless of the status of the serial connection. For example, if the cable is disconnected mid-operation or the driver is not shutdown properly the robot will continue to execute the latest velocity command. I would double check that the cable you are using is not loose.  It could very well be a virtual machine related issue, but I cannot say for sure.

So good news it works perfectly fine when using raspberry so again it has something to do with virtual machine being unable to use USB ports properly.
