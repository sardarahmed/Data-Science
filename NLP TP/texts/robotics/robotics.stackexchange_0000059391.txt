Hello,
I'm searching for an option to transfer a zip-file via ROS. Is there any possibility to do this?
Thanks in advance

A:

This really sounds like you're looking for a linux file-transfer tool such as scp or rsync.
I suppose you could define a new message type, probably with a string field for the file name and byte[] field for the raw data, and publish that on a topic.
