Q:

Error with message_to_tf, in ros fuerte

I have a problem with message_to_tf.the problem is when you compile message_to_tf.
when rosmake is used gives the following error:
error: /home/dava/local/src/ros-fuerte/hector_common/message_to_tf/src/message_to_tf.cpp:40:26: error: no matching function for call to ‘btMatrix3x3::btMatrix3x3(tf::Quaternion&)’

A:

You should use the fuerte branch of the hector_common stack or message_to_tf where btMatrix3x3 and other bullet types have been replaced by the respective tf types. The URL of the repository is https://tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/branches/fuerte/hector_common.
See http://ros.org/wiki/hector_common for further details.

In the meantime, the fuerte branch has been merged with the trunk branch and /trunk/hector_common can be used for ROS electric and upwards.
