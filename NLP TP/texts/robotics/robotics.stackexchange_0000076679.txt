Q:

Troubles installing ROS Kinetic on Linux Mint Sarah 18

I am currently trying to install ROS Kinetic on my Linux Mint 18 running laptop. As far as I am aware of, Sarah 18 is based on Linux kernel 4.4 and an Ubuntu 16.04 package base. Following the wiki installation manual, I am running into the following errors (when calling apt-get update):
Err:11 http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu kinetic/main amd64 Packages
  404  Not Found [IP: 64.50.236.52 80]

W: The repository 'http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu kinetic Release' does not have a Release file.
N: Data from such a repository can't be authenticated and is therefore potentially dangerous to use.
N: See apt-secure(8) manpage for repository creation and user configuration details.
E: Failed to fetch http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu/dists/kinetic/main/binary-amd64/Packages  404  Not Found [IP: 64.50.236.52 80]
E: Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.

Is this problem related to the fact that I am not using Ubuntu? Are there any methods of installing ROS on Linux Mint Sarah 18?

See this link - http://insane-on-linux.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/installing-ros-indigo-on-mint-17.html
It's a problem with the auto-genned source

This comment helped me resolve the same error I experienced when calling 'apt-get update' on the Raspberry Pi 3. Thank You
