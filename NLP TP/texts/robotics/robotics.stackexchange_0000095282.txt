Q:

Running the same node on multiple image messages parallel

Hello ros comunity.
I have six cameras, where i would like to do object classification, with YOLOv3 using darknet_ros, on each of the camera inputs, at the same time. I am using a Jetson AGX Xavier, with ros-melodic, cuda and opencv installed, and i can acces the cameras through ethernet.
My question is:
What would be the smartest and ideal way to handle multiple image messages (or messages in general) in parallel, using the same node?
It would be nice if someone could point me in the direction of the theory that i need to solve my problem most efficiently.
Have a nice day.

As a quick comment: if "the node" hasn't been written with this in mind, then the answer would be: you can't.
Of course, I'm assuming here that "the same node" means: "with a single running process". If instead you meant: with multiple running instances of the same node type, then you should be able to start as many as you need in separate namespaces and have each of them subscribe to the appropriate topics.
Depending on how many resources the node uses / requires (especially: GPU resources here as you mention CUDA), you should be able to start multiple. But that really depends on how "the node" has been written.

Thank you for the response.
I meant running multiple instances of the same node type but on different inputs, and as you said, using different namespaces, was the way to go.
