If you are sure this is not browser related (ie: try another one to make sure / clear cache), then you might want to report this at ros-infrastructure/answers.ros.org/issues.

I've just reported this: ros-infrastructure/answers.ros.org#137.

A:

Fixed, there was an error in determining which edit links to hide.

Please let us know at ros-infrastructure/answers.ros.org#137 if editing works for you again.
