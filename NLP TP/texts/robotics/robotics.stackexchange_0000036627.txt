Q:

How do you obtain covariance from manufacturer datasheet?

I am looking through the imu driver code (microstrain_3dmgx2_imu) to understand how I can write a driver for my own IMU.
I notice the parameters for orientation/angular velocity/linear acceleration stdev were derived from the manufacturer datasheet ("The default value, derived from the manufacturer datasheet, is very conservative.")
What I would like to know is, how is this derivation done? For example, if the "Accelerometer nonlinearity" is 0.2%, and "Accelerometer bias stability" 0.010 g, how do I get the variance?

A:

Turns out that the "Accelerometer bias stability" is the standard deviation. So variance is just the square of it -- in this case (0.010 g)^2
note: g is the gravitational accel 9.81ms^-2
