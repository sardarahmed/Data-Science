Q:

Rosinstall missing in python 2.7

Trying to install rosjava but that ends up failing because i'm missing rosinstall in python 2.7 -> dist-packages. Also missing vcstool. Was wondering if there was a way to get these back or fix up python.

A:

Well, you'd want to install the rosinstall and vcstools Python packages. I'd tell you exactly how to do that, but you've left out your OS name and version from your question. :p

In spite of the lack of information in the question (try and be more specific next time), here are a few common ways:

On Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install python-rosinstall python-vcstools
On OS X: sudo pip install rosinstall vcstools

Sorry about that. I'm using ubuntu and I tried that command and nothing shows in the python packages.

You can try listing the files installed by those debian packages with something like dpkg -L python-rosinstall. Then you can double check that those files are there. If not you can uninstall and reinstall it.
