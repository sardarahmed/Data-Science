A:

You'll want to use the image_transport library to subscribe to image messages from a camera, and cv_bridge to convert from ROS image messages into an openCV image type.
Take a look at the cv_bridge C++ tutorial. The Diamondback tutorial should apply to Electric as well.
You may also want to take a look at the generic publisher and subscriber tutorials to get a feel for ROS in general.
