Q:

rosdep update: "No address associated with hostname"

I have a Intel RealSense robotic development kit.  I installed Ubuntu 16.04.
$ which rosdep
/usr/bin/rosdep
$ rosdep --version
0.11.5
$ apt-cache policy python-rosdep
python-rosdep:
  Installed: 0.11.5-1
  Candidate: 0.11.5-1
  Version table:
 *** 0.11.5-1 500
        500 http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu xenial/main amd64 Packages
        500 http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu xenial/main i386 Packages
        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status
     0.11.4-2 500
        500 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial/universe amd64 Packages
        500 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial/universe i386 Packages

so version is not the problem.  I'm able to ping raw.githubusercontent.com and get results
$ ping raw.githubusercontent.comPING raw.githubusercontent.com (151.101.48.133) 56(84) bytes of data.

However, when I get to installing rosdep, I get this:
$ sudo apt -y install ros-kinetic-desktop-full python-rosinstall ros-kinetic-realsense-camera

I have no proxy on my Internet connection, either.

What is the output of getent hosts raw.githubusercontent.com?

151.101.48.133  raw.githubusercontent.com

And
python -c "import urllib2; resp=urllib2.urlopen('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/rosdep/ruby.yaml', timeout=15.0); print resp.info()"

also returns successfully?
Note that Github is known to be unstable and experiences lots of transient network errors.

No, it also fails.

A:

Ok. That would perhaps point to a problem with how Python resolves addresses.
Two things I would try / test:

try some other hostnames / URLs
create a Wireshark capture of the traffic when you run the above one-liner
