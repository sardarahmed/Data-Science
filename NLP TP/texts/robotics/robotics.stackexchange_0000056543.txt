Q:

Required Internet Connection = DRM

Why is there no easy way to install offline? Others have asked and gotten a round-about way to accomplish it from other users. However, the people responsible for ROS should be the ones addressing this gap in openness. Some projects are standalone and specifically isolated so that a controlled software environment can be created. An internet connection compromises that goal.

A:

There is no easy offline install because up to this point, nobody has needed it enough to do it themselves. Thus is the nature of open source projects. That said, there actually is an offline install method designed for the turtlebots using a ISO that enables installing an entire ROS system from a flash drive. A google search for turtlebot iso will turn this up. You can also download debs for later installation with aptitude download.
