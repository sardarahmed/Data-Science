Q:

Plotting Lidar Scan data in rviz

Hi People,
I've been recently working on ROS with my new Husky A200 Robot from Clearpath. Platform Details:
OS - Ubuntu 11.10
ROS - ros-electric-desktop-full
Sensor - Hokuyo Lidar
Issue - rviz output for laser scan
I opened rviz in its default state using

rosrun rviz rviz -l

Later I tried to add an interface for LaserScan and in the topics field I chose
/lidar/scan
However, I dont see any output and instead I get the error message as shown below:

topic: no message received

Transform:sender=/lidar/hokuyo : For frame [laser]: Frame [laser] does not exist

A simple command like rxplot /lidar/scan gives me the data from my Lidar scanner which implies I am able to communicate with the sensor otherwise.
looking forward for a reply that could help me proceed with my Lidar.
Thanks.

A:

In rviz you should change the .Global Options > Fixed Frame to the laser frame id, "/laser" by default.
I hope it works!
