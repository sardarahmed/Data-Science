Q:

sensor_msgs::PointCloud2 not displaying in rviz

hi,
I am new to ROS. I have read binary files of laser dataset and prepared sensor_msgs::PointCloud2 messages. But when i tried to view them in rviz, it not showing anything. Here is one of the  pointcloud message from rostopic echo. I would like to know what is the problem.
--thanks

A:

In the pointcloud display in rviz under "Status", do you see that the one message arrived in rviz?
What is your 'Fixed Frame' (Global Options in rviz)? Set it to 'laser_link', or make sure there is a tf transform from the fixed frame to laser_link.
I'm not sure how exactly rviz handles timestamps, maybe the 0 timestamp of the message is an issue (but I guess it should still display).

@demmeln /map is my fixed frame and i am publishing /map to /odom tf and have static tf  for /base to /odom and /base to /laser. its not showing number of messages recieved.
Comment by VC on 2013-12-22:
@bvbdort the point cloud's frame is /laser_link according to the message, but your tf tree does not seem to have it ... name mismatch? Also, if your fixed frame is /map, the point cloud message time stamp will need to match with that of the tf broadcasters. Is the point cloud visible when you set the fixed frame to laser_link?
Comment by bvbdort on 2013-12-22:
@VC yes i mean /laser is  /laser_link

@demmeln its not showing number of messages recieved
Comment by demmeln on 2014-01-07:
Hmmm... Can you check for errors with roswtf and then check if the publishing node and rviz are connected in rqt_graph?
Comment by bvbdort on 2014-01-07:
@demmeln In rqt_graph its not showing anything related to rviz. No errors in roswtf.
Comment by demmeln on 2014-01-20:
Sorry for the late reply. Have you set your fixed frame to laser_link? Are you publishing the message repeatedly, or just once? The number of messages received should show up if you open the "Status" entry in rviz. In rqt_graph untick "Hide Debug" to see rviz.

the problem is with data of pointcloud. When reading pointcloud data properly its working fine.
