Q:

How to shutdown all nodes

What's the easiest way to signal all nodes to shutdown?
I created a daemon that runs several launch files in the background, but now that even if I kill the roscore, the other nodes don't end, they just keep running, forcing me to hunt them down and manually kill each process.

Late answer but worth doing so.
rosnode kill -a will terminate correctly all nodes.
For example before I was terminating all processes by using killall -u user_name, and this managed  the rtabmap node to corrupt the database. With the command I first mentioned, no more corruption happens.

rosnode kill -a is a nice way to shutdown nodes, as it gives them time to properly close files, stop timers, etc, but do know that it'll only work as long as your roscore is running. If that is gone, it won't be able to find the running nodes anymore.

It seems that this doesn't work for respawn nodes, though (unless you have at least one required node).
