Q:

Exclude topic from namespace

Hello,
I have a Turtlebot running the navigation stack and a workstation that runs the corresponding map-server.
The amcl node is launched in a namespace so that all published and subscribed topics get prefixed with that namespace. So amcl is subscribing to /namespace/map instead of just /map.
Now I want to exclude the map topic from the namespace so that amcl subscribes to /map again but all other topics should still be prefixed.
I tried to remap it from "map" to "/map" but that didnt't change anything.
Thanks for your help.

A:

By default amcl will get the map not via the topic, but via a service call (http://wiki.ros.org/amcl), so you need to remap that instead.
