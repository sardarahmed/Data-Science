Q:

How to control Gazebo from a C++ code

In this question there is a cpp code that creates a joint in Gazebo.
How does this cpp code even know how to connect to Gazebo server? and what should be included?
What does a code look like that can connect to the Gazebo server and do some modifications?
I couldn't find any tutorial about the Gazebo Cpp API.
