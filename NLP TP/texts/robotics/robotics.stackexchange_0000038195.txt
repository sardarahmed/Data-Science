Thanks for you answer Dimitri, but my problem with filters package is when i use the arm_navigation stack.
The velocity and acceleration are not consistent with the desired time. For example: If I required the trajectory with a final time of 30 minutes or 10 second, the result trajectory take less 3 seconds for completion.
Any ideas?
