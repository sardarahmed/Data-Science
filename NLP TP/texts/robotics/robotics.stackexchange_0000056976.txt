Q:

bloom-release: How to over-write latest release

I have updated my release repo running bloom-release but now I want to update that release over-writing previous commits and tags. One way is to do it manually, using git, resetting each branch/tag to previous state and then running bloom-release again, but I am searching for a more elegant way.
EDIT: I have cancelled the pull request to rosdistro at the end of bloom-release script, so the release is only in my release repo.

A:

You should never "overwrite" a release. Once a version, say 0.1.0-0 is released, people are referencing it and it should not be changed.
If you need to release version 0.1.0 again, just run bloom-release again and it will automatically increment the release version, so it would become 0.1.0-1.

I have canceled the pull request to rosdistro, so the release is only in my -release repo. I want to do the same release due to a typo, so i don't want to increase the build number without a reason.

Version numbers are free. Use another.

@czalidis in that case there is no one referencing it, but there is no easy way to do this, bloom is setup to explicitly not overwrite releases because often they are already referenced. Manually resetting the branches and tags is about the only thing you could do.

Thanks for your time anyway! I have done in once in the past manually and it is a lot of work to reset each branch/tag properly. I was asking only because I saw: "git push --all && git push --tags  # You might have to add --force to the second command if you are over-writing existing tags" in bloom-release script.
