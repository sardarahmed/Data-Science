Q:

'geometry_msgs' depends on non-existent package 'message_runtime'

hi everybody,
I' m trying to install a packege but rosmake ends by this  error:

[rospack] Error: package/stack 'geometry_msgs' depends on non-existent >package 'message_runtime' and rosdep claims that it is not a system >dependency. Check the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH or try calling 'rosdep update'

ROS_PACKAGE_PATH is setted on the packege path i'm installing and rosupdate fails by a 404 file not found error.
I did't find any documentation about  message_runtime package.
could someone help me?
thanks

A:

Hi,
Are you installing ros-groovy? Try installing message-runtime.
sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-message-runtime should install the package.

thanks for you answer. I' m already on groovy and when I try                                                                        sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-message-runtime      the shell tell me:        ros-groovy-message-runtime is already the newest version.

Try running rosdep update and restart the shell. I hope it solves the problem

rosdep update stops after the massage:      Hit https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/raw/master/releases/fuerte.yaml
ERROR: error loading sources list:
