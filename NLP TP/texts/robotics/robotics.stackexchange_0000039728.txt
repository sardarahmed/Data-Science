Q:

Can roslaunch setup rxconsole filters?

I have setup a launch file that starts rxconsole, rxplot, ros_vrpn_client, rviz, and my own custom node. As it sits rxconsole starts up showing info items only. I would like it to start up showing debug message and preferably only a subset of them. Does it support setting filters from the command line or via the param tag in a roslaunch file?
