Q:

image_rect cropped?

I am having an issue where my image_rect output from stereo)image_proc is being cropped way down to a small section of the center/far right of the image_raw topic. As far as I can tell, I am not feeding these values to rectify anywhere throughout my launch file.
Im using 2 Flea3 Monochrome USB3 cameras in Ubunut 14.04.1 using indigo. To get the cameras up and running, Im using the following package from Kumar Robotics:

In the screen shot you can see that image_raw topic is the entire room, in the image_rect the topic is cropped down to nothing.

A:

The parameters that are passed to image rectification process come from the camera calibration, and are published on the camera_info topic.
Have you calibrated your cameras yet? What are the resulting calibration parameters?

I used camera_calibration, and it seemed to go well. Got a total of 173 samples (went over kill by accident).
This is the yaml for the right camera:

I recalibrated for good measure and it opened up he crop drastically. I am now centered and seeing roughly 80% of image_raw in image_rect. Much appreciated for steering me in that direction!

yeah. very occasionally the calibration comes up with a bad fit, and it needs to be recalibrated.
