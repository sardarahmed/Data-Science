Q:

package index lost converting to unary stack

I am converting camera1394 to a unary stack for Fuerte. The indexer has seen this change, and camera1394 is no longer included as a camera_drivers package. (It is now a dependency, instead.)
I changed the package header for camera1394 to <<StackHeader(camera1394)>>, but that header information is not displayed in the wiki. Instead it says: "Cannot load information on camera1394, which means that it is not yet in our index. Please see this page for information on how to submit your repository to our index."
The source trunk moved from:

https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/camera_drivers/trunk/camera1394

to:

https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/camera1394/trunk

Since both are contained in ros-pkg/stacks, I expected the new camera1394 stack to be indexed automatically. How can I make that happen?

A:

We don't index all of ros-pkg/stacks for that contains all the branches as well as trunks.  We only index specific subdirectories.  We'll need update the indexer to add camera1394 explicitly.

I should have realized that. Thanks!
