Q:

Move backwards, rotate and re plan a global path

Dear all.
I am using:
<param name="base_global_planner" value = "SBPLLatticePlanner"/>
 <param name="base_local_planner" value="base_local_planner/TrajectoryPlannerROS" />

I have experienced that when the robot is going to passed through a narrow doorway, it gets stuck.
I am trying to figure out how to set the following strategy when the robot gets stuck.
1.-A parameter that allows the robot to move certain meters backwards.
2.-Set the angle for the robot to rotate and make the robot rotate that angle
3.-Re plan the global path
If it can go trough the doorway, it is fine if not go to step 1
Well, probably I may need to write my own plug in, right?
Can you give me an advice on how to start it :)
I hope you can help me and in advance thank you :)

Hello, currently im looking into the "moving backward" feature to unstuck the robot. have you found a solution or anything useful to share with regards to this topic? Thanks!

A:

Use dwa_local_planner/DWAPlannerROS plugin for local planner, and set its min_vel_x parameter to negative value. This answer is based on my question.
