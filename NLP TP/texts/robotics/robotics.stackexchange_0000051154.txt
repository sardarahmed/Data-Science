Q:

Installing the joy node on Mac OSX

I installed ROS groovy on my Mac OS 10.8.3 following the MacPorts tutorial.
I copied the joy package from the source.
$ rospack find joy
$ /opt/ros/groovy/share/ros/joy    

Eventually, I get:
$ rosdep install joy
$ ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
joy: No definition of [joystick] for OS [osx]

Does it mean that currently it is not possible to install the joy package on Mac?
If it is possible, I would be glad to learn which installation steps I missed.
Best regards,
Luc.

A:

I am using osx_joystick for this at the moment. It is not entirely the same, but it shares many similarities. It at least gets the job done ;)
