Q:

Error in URDF file

Hello all!
I try to build urdf model robot. End I have error message:
Invalid parameter "name" while expanding macro "bioloid_F10"

I use 2 files, head.xacro and head_hardware.xacro.
In head.xacro:
<include filename="$(find robot_description)/urdf/head_hardware.xacro" />

    <bioloid_F10 parent="bioloid_F4_head_10" name="head_tilt_bracket">
       <origin xyz="0 0 0" rpy="0 0 0"/>
    </bioloid_F10_fixed>

In head_hardware.xacro
<macro name="bioloid_F10" params="parent number x_loc y_loc z_loc">

What is wrong?

A:

Name is not a parameter in your macro. The parameters in the macro must match the ones you pass into the usage of the macro.
