Q:

ROS & PCL on ARM A9

Hi,
I am trying to build a system with ROS and PCL on XILINX ZYNQ ZC702 SoC.
I would like to know if any one has build it for an ARM Cortex A9 system.
I am finding it difficult to cross compile with the cross compiler provided from Code Sourcery. Any tips or guidance will be helpful.
Thanks,
Anup.

I'm still unsuccessful in my attempts, (and am getting less and less time to experiment) but perhaps an answer to my question on stack_overflow might help you out a little.

Since you have no tags, it is likely that no one who knows about this will see your question.

Hi,
I have not tried cross compiling on ARM myself, but is there anyway you could directly compile ROS on your target? I have had success on this for A8 and A9 chips

I took the freedom and added few tags.

I was using this a guide before giving up :(
