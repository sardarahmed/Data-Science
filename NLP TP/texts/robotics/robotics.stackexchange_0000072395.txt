Q:

Can I define a minimum turn radius with the dwa_planner?

I'm working with a robot that can turn in a way similar to a car and thus cannot turn in place and has a minimum turn radius. Is the dwa_planner capable of being configured for that kind of robot? I've read the documentation, and it seems that even when setting holonomic = false it still assumes that linear velocity and rotational velocity are independent variables.

A:

No. Search for a different local planner.
