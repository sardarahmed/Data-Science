A:

You can set the user camera pose in the SDF as follows:
<world name="default">
  <gui>
    <camera name="user_camera">
      <pose>0 0 0 0 0 0</pose>
    </camera>
  </gui>
...
</world>

From Gazebo 6, you can find out the current camera pose on the World tab, under GUI. Then you can use that value in your SDF.
On older versions of Gazebo, you can save your world with the desired camera pose and find the pose in the saved SDF.
