Q:

pcl_ros nodelets do not exist

I'm working with some of the built-in pcl_ros nodelets. I have a VoxelGrid filter and passthrough filter working fine, but when I try to run the SACSegmentation nodelet as decribed in this tutorial, I get the following error:
[ERROR] [1427820107.811356547]: Failed to load nodelet [/normal_estimation] of type [pcl/NormalEstimation]: According to the loaded plugin descriptions the class pcl/NormalEstimation with base class type nodelet::Nodelet does not exist.

So some of the nodelets apparently aren't being recognized as nodelets by ROS on my system. They aren't listed in the pcl_nodelets.xml file, which is where I'd expect to see them. But I haven't had all that much experience with nodelets to know whether that's true or if I'm just doing something wrong. So is there anything I need to do to make these nodelets recognized?
Or perhaps they've been removed for some reason with the tutorials still existing? That particular filter isn't documented on the main page, anyway.

A:

Looks like there was a divergence between the nodelets defined on hydro-devel and indigo-devel due to a pull request I didn't cherry pick to indigo. Keep an eye on this ticket for fixes https://github.com/ros-perception/perception_pcl/issues/86.

I know this was posted a long time ago, but I faced the same issue and just included the relevant hpp file from the impl folder and it solved the issue. Just wanna help someone who faced the issue
