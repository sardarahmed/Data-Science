Q:

.rviz/config and display_config do not exist

I'm running ubuntu 10.4, electric.  I'm trying to start rviz (which used to work).  Apart from segmentation fault that seems to be common, I notice that I do not have a config or display_config file in my .rviz directory.  When and how are these generated?

A:

My config files are modified every time that I close Rviz so that it can preserve the settings that I used last. This is the default behavior on my machine. Rviz also has a "save configuration" option in the menu.
