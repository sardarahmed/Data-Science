Q:

How to create srv/msgs fiels for Aruduino?

Hello,
I've just started using ROS on the Arduino Uno and I have already run into the problem hat I don't know how to create my own srv/msgs files for the Arduino node.
In the normal ROS workspace you just have to create the srv/msgs files in the folders, add them to your CMakeList and then catkin_make. After that you can just include them into your node.
But how does it work for the Arduino node?
Best
