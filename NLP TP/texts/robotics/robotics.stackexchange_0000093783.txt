Q:

Question about custom-made message

Hello!
I'm using ROS kinetic on ubuntu 16.04.
And I'm going to make my own message consisting of many sub-custom messages.
The sub-messages are in the right directory where any other messages are defined.
Below is a sample of the messages.
my_msgs/StateError          stateError              # error for state
my_msgs/EvalCovariance      evalCovariance          # validate covariance

and my_msgs is the name of the directory.
(In other words, StateError messages and EvalCovariance messages are all in the my_msgs directory.)
In this case, is it mandatory to drop my_msgstags  because they're all in the same directory??
(like this)
EvalCovariance      evalCovariance          # validate covariance
StateError          stateError              # error for state

Thanks in advance :)

A:

to define a message based on different messages (sub-messages) that are defined in same package you have two options:

you drop the package name before these messages because the sub-messages are defined in same package

StateError         stateError
EvalCovariance     evalCovariance

you indicate the package_name before these sub-messages  (not the directory_name) :

package_name/StateError         stateError
package_name/EvalCovariance     evalCovariance

so, if my_msgs is your package_name, both samples you wrote in the question are valid. But, if my_msgs is just a directory_name then you need to use the second sample without attaching my_msgs/
