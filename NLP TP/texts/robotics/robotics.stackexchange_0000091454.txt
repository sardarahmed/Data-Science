Q:

Universal Robots - joint speed control

Greetings.
I am quite new with ROS and I am still pending to identify something.
Is there already implemented in ROS the control of joint speeds for Universal Robots manipulators?
I have identified the speedJ() function from URScript language (native for UR controllers), which allow joint speed control, but not for ROS.
Any information will be welcome.
Thanks.

A:

At least the ur_modern_driver supports joint velocity control with the ros_control setup in kinetic-devel (the old driver (master branch, deprecated) supported a /joint_speed topic, but that has not been ported to the new version).
Velocity setpoints are directly mapped onto speedj(..) statements on the controller.
See ros-industrial/ur_modern_driver#218 for some discussion on using ros_control's JointGroupVelocityController.
