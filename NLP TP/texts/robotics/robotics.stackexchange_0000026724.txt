Q:

Modelling environments (simple test environment) for gazebo

Hi all,
for some tests and validation between our real robot and my simulated robot
I want to build a simple environment in Gazebo (recreation of a simple floor or room in our
university).
Which program or tool would you propose to for this task (without the need of studying a whole book before)?
Thanks for your help,
Christoph

A:

You can directly insert simple shapes into Gazebo. Anything more complex will require the use of a 3D modeling application like Blender, 3DS Max, Maya, etc.
Here is how to import meshes into Gazebo:
