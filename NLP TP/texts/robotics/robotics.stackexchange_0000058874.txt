Q:

tf:TransformTFToEigen() causes 'TransformTFToEigen' is not a member of 'tf'

While trying to build dvo_ros package for dense visual SLAM, i was given
'TransformTFToEigen' is not a member of 'tf'
error for the line
tf::TransformTFToEigen(tmp, result);
I have been trying to search around the documentations for tf package but could not find anything on the above function. Have the  function been removed? If so was there a replace for the above function?
Thanks

A:

This function is part of the "tf_conversions" package, specifically I think it is found in "tf_conversions/tf_eigen.h".

This error occurs when you do not have the above header included in your code.

I have met the same problem. The header file is included in the code. How can I solve this problem?

I solved this problem by replacing "TransformTFToEigen" and "TransformEigenToTF" with "transformTFToEigen" and "transformEigenToTF" respectively. Please see https://github.com/tum-vision/dvo/issues/2.
