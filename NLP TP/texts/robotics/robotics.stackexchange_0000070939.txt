Q:

GMAPPING: How to mark 'out of range' laserscan as free-space

I'm using a SICK TIM 300 Laserscanner with the gmapping node to create a Map.
But whenever the Laserscanner can not see an obstacle at a certain angle (because the obstacles are out of range), gmapping marks these areas as 'unknown'.
But the Laserscanner not seeing anything at a certain angle, means there is no obstacle within the measuring-range (in my case: 4m). As a result gmapping should mark these areas as free.
How can I solve this problem?
I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 with ROS hydro.
The Laserscanner marks these 'out-of-range'-areas as 'distance = 0m', the header from the /scan - message tells that the minimum distance is 0.05m.
Thanks for your help.

A:

If you take a look at the gmapping page there're two parameters called maxUrange and maxRange. I quote: "If regions with no obstacles within the range of the sensor should appear as free space in the map, set maxUrange < maximum range of the real sensor <= maxRange".
So, if you want that region appears as free space, you have to set your maxUrange under the maximum range of the real sensor (which is the maxRangeparameter).

Thank you very much :D
It's that easy. Now the map looks way better.

what is the unit of maxUrange and max range?
