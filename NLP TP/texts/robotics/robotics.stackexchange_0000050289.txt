Q:

How to turn off Pioneer 3dx rear sonars using ROSARIA?

I have a Pioneer 3dx mobile robot, which has eight front sonars installed. It is also possible to have eight additional sonars at the rear of the robot, but I don't have these. However, when subscribing to the ROSARIA sonar topic, a distance is published for sixteen sonars, eight of them continuously reporting a distance of 0.
Of course, this is unwanted behavior. I could not find an appropriate parameter on the ROSARIA tutorial page, http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROSARIA/Tutorials/How%20to%20use%20ROSARIA.
What is the correct way to receive only distances on the sonar topic for sonars actually installed?

A:

I have found that ROSARIA uses the parameters from the file p3dx-sh.p at /usr/local/Aria/params. I changed the SonarNum on line 49 to 8 and the issue was resolved.
Looking back, it seems like a trivial question. However, I didn't find anything quickly, so I'll leave the solution here in case anyone would ever need it.
