Q:

pandaboard, robotino dependencies problem

Hey,
i'm trying to install the robotino stack on a pandaboardES.
At first i installed ROS groovy (bare bones) following the guide for groovy on pandaboard
--> roscore starts succesfully
now i am trying to build the robotino stack, but i have problems with missing dependencies.
a few packages are build with calling
$roscd robotino_node
$rosmake --pre-clean

but at first the "geometry_msgs" packages was missing.
after downloading and building robotino_node for the second time, another package was missing. like this i downloaded and built the following stacks:

geometry_msgs
geometry
image_transport
pluginlib
class_loader

Now, "console_bridge" is missing, but i can't find it on ros.org.
Is there a possibility to install all missing dependencies automatically?
Where can i find "console_bridge?
Am i doing anything in principle wrong!?

A:

As far as I know there is no possibility to install all missing dependencies on an ARM platform, so you will either have to add all missing packages by hand or install the desktop package and not the bare bone.
Here is what I found to be the easiest approach:
Set up a catkin workspace with the desktop package. Remove the big packages if you know you will not need them. This would be packages like collada, opencv and PCL.
Now catkin_make everything, fixing occurring errors. This will take a considerable amount of time.
Set up a rosbuild workspace and with a link to the catkin install folder.
rosws init . /ros/install/folder

Install your stack here.
Edit: If you are missing console_bridge, I would assume you did not link your rosbuild workspace to the install folder.
