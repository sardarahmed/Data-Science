Q:

How do you cancel an actionlib action?

How does an actionlib client cancel an ongoing action?
The docs clearly explain how to code an actionlib server to react to
a cancellation request and exit, but I can't find any example of how this is initiated by the client.

A:

Each of the client APIs for the action clients has a cancel method. The full API documentation can be accessed through the Code API link on the main wiki page.
In the python action client, send_goal returns ClientGoalHandle which can be used to cancel the goal: http://docs.ros.org/jade/api/actionlib/html/classactionlib_1_1action__client_1_1ActionClient.html#abcec1f2a881b3c41ea977da9812c313e
In the C++ action client, sendGoal returns a GoalHandle with a cancel method: http://docs.ros.org/jade/api/actionlib/html/classactionlib_1_1ActionClient.html
On the python simple action client, there is a cancel_goal method: http://docs.ros.org/jade/api/actionlib/html/classactionlib_1_1simple__action__client_1_1SimpleActionClient.html
On the C++ SimpleActionClient, there is a cancelGoal method: http://docs.ros.org/jade/api/actionlib/html/classactionlib_1_1SimpleActionClient.html
