Q:

custom motion model for smac & mppi

I'm employing the Smac Hybrid-A* Planner along with the Model Predictive Path Integral Controller for point-to-point navigation of a forklift, both indoors and outdoors. Notably, this forklift features a differential drive mechanism with two front wheels and an independently rotating rear wheel, mirroring a tricycle's kinematics. Additionally, I've opted for the "reeds shepp" method, addressing scenarios where in-place rotations aren't feasible.
Can I develop a custom motion model compatible with both the smac-planner and mppi-controller?
Any advice or guidelines on navigating these challenges would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you.

A:

This is simply a differential drive robot; you may simply use the differential drive motion model. The asymmetry is of no real concern to MPPI/Smac, just make sure you provide the appropriate footprint.
I don't know if there's some additional subtlety or problems you're hinting at needing that this doesn't provide, but that seems like the obvious solution :-)
