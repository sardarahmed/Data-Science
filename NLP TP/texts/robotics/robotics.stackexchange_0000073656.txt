Q:

rostopic navigation_velocity_smoother/raw_cmd_vel

I am implementing navigation stack on my robot and using move_base to move the robot. The move base node is publishing Twist messages on rostopic navigation_velocity_smoother/raw_cmd_vel. Can anyone describe what this topic is for ?

A:

I'm not sure which velocity_smoother you're referring to, but this package has documentation for the topics: http://wiki.ros.org/yocs_velocity_smoother
The velocity smoother is designed to smooth out potentially jerky commands to keep a robot from rocking around if the user is too aggressive with the joystick.
