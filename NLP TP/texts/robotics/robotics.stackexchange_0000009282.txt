Q:

Mobile phone power packs

For my robotics project I would like to utilise readily available mobile phone 'power banks' to simplify the power system for my robot. However, such power banks output 5V, great for the logic systems but not for the motors. 
I was wondering if I could wire the outputs of two power banks in series and get 10V or is this a very bad idea? Should I wire them in parallel and use a boost converter? Is a custom solution using 'ordinary' Li-Po batteries and associated charging circuit the best answer?
Additional Information:

This will be a two wheeled robot.
5V Logic
7+V Motor driver
Power Banks: 5V 2.1Amp 2100mAh

A:

Go ahead and use the phone battery for your logic supply.  Then, series wire individual, high current L-ion cells to make your motor battery.  It's good practice to keep the noisy, high-current stuff on a different buss, away from your processor.
Invest in a smart (processor driven) charger that can monitor the voltage of each cell and charge them evenly.  It can also detect a cell that is weak.  Weak cells charge and discharge very quickly, and they must be removed from the battery.
DC/DC converters are not very efficient.  They generate their own noise on the source and sink sides.  And, they get expensive for the current levels required by a pair of motors.
