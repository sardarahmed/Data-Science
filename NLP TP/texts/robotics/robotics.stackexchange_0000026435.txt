Q:

Install DRC Sim on Ubuntu 12.04 + Groovy

Hi!
I have installed ROS Groovy on Ubuntu 12.04 and I want to install DRCSim without installing fuerte. Is there a way of do this? If so, Where can I find some instructions for doing it?
Thanks,
Gustavo.
EDIT
Error message after installation, changing 'fuerte' for 'groovy' and cloning repos:

Glxgears runs fine and gazebo works on its own. What can be causing gazebo to stop?

What kind of GPU do you have?  There have been reports that the GPU-based laser sensor on the Atlas robot causes this kind of crash on Intel GPUs.  There's a fix on the drcsim_2.6 branch that provides launch files that use the old CPU-based laser sensor.

A:

We haven't been testing drcsim + ROS Groovy on Ubuntu 12.04, and we don't make binary installation packages for that configuration, but building from source should work.
Start by following the instructions for compiling from source on Ubuntu, replacing each occurrence of fuerte with groovy as you go.
If you encounter problems, please report them.  And if/when you are successful, please update the instructions for future users who want to do the same thing; e.g., with a note to say that replacing fuerte with groovy is sufficient, or if necessary, with a separate section that details the groovy-specific process.
Update, responding to error output: Most of that console output is normal, but gazebo is definitely dying:
Warning [gazebo_main.cc:62] escalating to SIGKILL on client
[gazebo-2] process has finished cleanly

My first guess is that there's a problem with your GPU drivers.  What kind of GPU do you have?  Do tools like glxgears work properly?
Try launching gazebo on its own, without the drcsim launch file (assuming here that you installed to /usr):
. /usr/share/gazebo/setup.sh
gazebo

Can you insert models into the world, manipulate the user camera, etc.?

Hi, on installation all goes fine changing 'fuerte' for  'groovy'. But trying to start DRCsim, gazebo crashes. On answer I paste the error message.

glxgears and gazebo works on its own... Let me try to insert models...

I've seen problems with graphic cards supporting DRI (hence glxgears is running, even gazebo starts) but are not powerful enough to run big models or some kind of sensors. Are you using an intel card? Nvidia? ATI?

Now it works!.. Something I forgot was to checkout each repo to newest version branch. After doing this and rebuild, finally I can roslaunch atlas.launch.
