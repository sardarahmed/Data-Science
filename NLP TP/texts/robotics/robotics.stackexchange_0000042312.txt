Q:

hector indoor_slam_demo.launch failure

Greetings,
I am in process of establishing hector_quadrotor simulation environment.
Environment: Ubuntu Lucid, ROS Fuerte, hector_Slam stack from http://tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/branches/fuerte . ROS Fuerte is installed using deb packages for Ubuntu. ros-fuerte-simulator-gazebo version 1.6.10-s134161751 is being used.
After successfully compiling the various required packages, on launching, gazebo always dies! Following is the terminal output:

The library libgazebo_ros_paths_plugin.so is resulting in a segmentation fault. Any idea? Do I need to update to newer version, although current version is also very new!

A:

I cannot reproduce the error. The launch file works on my machine, starting up both gazebo and rviz on fuerte. The only "slightly" annoying thing is the laser scan being mirrored from left to right, totally killing SLAM as soon as the UAV is rotated. As everything works in electric I suspect a bug in gazebo, will have to create a ticket for that.
What kind of graphics card are you using and can you start other scenarios in gazebo without crashing it?

Hi Stefan, I notice that the roll movement of the simulated quadrotor shown in rviz is the mirror of the same move in gazebo, is it the same issue you mean? And sometimes my laptop just suddenly shuts down when running the packages. (Ubuntu Precise + Fuerte + ATI HD 3650)
