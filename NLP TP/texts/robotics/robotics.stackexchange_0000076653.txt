Q:

using stdout of a node in a launch file

I would like to use the output of a command in a launch file.
Think of the back quote notatie is the shell:   hostname
So for example something like
<arg name="robotname" default="`hostname`" />

With the idea that the value of robotname is the hostname of the machine.
How could this functionality be achieved?
Thanks in advance,
Sietse

A:

You would need to write this yourself.
Currently, you can only get environment variables, which would work for the hostname
<arg name="robotname" default="$(env HOSTNAME)/>

The wiki page states that (for kinetic) eval

allows to evaluate arbitrary complex python expressions

but I don't know what this actually means. Maybe this would allow you to work a way around this.
