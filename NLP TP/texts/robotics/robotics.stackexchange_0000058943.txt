Q:

subscriber callback

Hi guys,
I am using a subscriber with a callback. It works fine for a while but then the program suddenly stops. My process does not die but stops/freezes.
This is what I do ...

sub = nh.subscribe("topic_name",
10000, &Callback, this);

ros::spinOnce();
I operate two robots with the same code and most of the time one stops receiving data from the callback. The other one proceeds as suggested. I realized that the subscribing works but the process freezes during the spinOnce().
Does anyone have an idea?

A:

You are only using spinOnce. This will only handle messages once. If you want to continuously receive messages call this in a loop or use ros::spin.

I just need to receive messages once at this position. The strange part is that the program stops/freezes after executing the nh.subscribe.

Can you try setting the queue size to 1.
