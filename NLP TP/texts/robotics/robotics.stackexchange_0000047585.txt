Q:

Get all topics in c++

Hi everyone,
is there any way to do something like  "rostopic list" or "rostopic find <msg_type>" NOT in a command line but in a C++ code and get the corresponding topics?
Thank you in advance

A:

Yes, look at the Master API.
getPublishedTopics or getSystemState should do what you want.
