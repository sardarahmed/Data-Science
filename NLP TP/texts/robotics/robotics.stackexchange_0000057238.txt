Q:

How to I rosbag/record a loosless compressed images

Hi
I like to record raw images using rosbag.
rosbag record /front_camera/image_raw

Works perfect  and I can view the images with
rosbag play my_bag.bag &
rosrun image_view image_view /front_camera/image_raw

But the bag files becomes get big very fast
My question is now is there a way to record images loosless compressed?
Currently I see the following topics
/front_camera/image_raw
/front_camera/image_raw/compressed
/front_camera/image_raw/compressed/parameter_descriptions
/front_camera/image_raw/compressed/parameter_updates
/front_camera/image_raw/compressedDepth
/front_camera/image_raw/compressedDepth/parameter_descriptions
/front_camera/image_raw/compressedDepth/parameter_updates
/front_camera/image_raw/theora
/front_camera/image_raw/theora/parameter_descriptions
/front_camera/image_raw/theora/parameter_updates

I tried recording the  /front_camera/image_raw/compressed or  /front_camera/image_raw/theora butI was not able to view the recorded images using image_view.
Thanks
Markus

A:

Record compressed stream via:
$ rosbag record /front_camera/image_raw/compressed

Play back recording with:
$ rosbag play <bagfile>
$ rosrun image_view image_view image:=/front_camera/image_raw compressed

note the space between the raw topic and the transport type in image_view.

Keep in mind that by default, compressed_image_transport uses JPEG, which is lossy. You can use dynamic_reconfigure to switch it to PNG.

I have a node that processes data from a sensor_msgs/Image topic, and I don't want to modify the code. Can I apply what you just said: record a bag file with compressed images, and then and somehow convert from compressed image to "raw" image when I read directly from the bag?
