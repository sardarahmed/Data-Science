Q:

Couldn't find executable named RosAria

I'm trying to run the RosAria node in ros hydro and i enter the following command rosrun rosaria RosAria _port:=/dev/ttyUSB0
but it gives an error that it can't find the executable named RosAria in catkin_ws/src/rosaria. Even tried rosrun RosAria _port:=/dev/ttyUSB0 which gives an error saying stack/package RosAria not found.

A:

Where is RosAria installed? Is it installed into the /opt/ros/distro directory or in your source workspace?
To use code compiled from source:
source devel/setup.bash inside of your catkin_ws
To use code installed via apt-get
source /opt/ros/${distro}/setup.bash
