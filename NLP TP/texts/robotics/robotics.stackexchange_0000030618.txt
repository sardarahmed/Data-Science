Q:

More problems with rosinstall on Mac OS 10.6

Just got an error on running rosinstall this morning on my MacBook. Previously this ran fine. What's perhaps changed is that I updated my macports last night and among the updates was one to boost, which is relevant because this was the error output from rosinstall:
  Linking CXX executable ../bin/rosplay
  Undefined symbols:
    "boost::filesystem3::path::extension() const", referenced from:
        ros::record::Player::open(std::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > const&, ros::Time, bool)in rosplay.o
    "boost::filesystem3::path::wchar_t_codecvt_facet()", referenced from:
        ros::record::Player::open(std::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > const&, ros::Time, bool)in rosplay.o
  ld: symbol(s) not found
  collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
  make[3]: *** [../bin/rosplay] Error 1

Then a bit later:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/bin/rosinstall", line 5, in <module>
    pkg_resources.run_script('rosinstall==0.5.16', 'rosinstall')

    raise CalledProcessError(retcode, cmd)
subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command 'source /Users/john_muccigrosso/ros/setup.sh && rosmake ros ros_comm --rosdep-install' returned non-zero exit status 1

Suggestions? (I realize that this is similar to several other recent questions, but it seems different in that there's no complaint about yaml. I have also reselected python 2.6, redid an easy_install of pyyaml and rosinstall, all with the same results.
(BTW, I would have commented on one of those other questions, but the q & a format of this forum really doesn't encourage that.)

A:

This is definitely a problem with the latest version of boost (1.46.1). I went to macports and did
port activate boost @1.45.0_2

to return to the earlier version of boost, and then rosinstall worked fine. I don't know whether the problem lies in boost or ros, but there it is.
