A:

No, that is not supported at this time.
New nodes with a name that is already used will cause the "old node" to be killed, as all names must be unique.
Can you clarify why you'd want to have two nodes running with the same name?

I was working on a cloud application and here the latency is an issue.Since the old node is killed, to restart the node again on the machine takes some time and this was not okay for my application and hence I was looking for a solution to deregister it and then later register during connection loss

In case of ROS1 and cloud, perhaps a multimaster setup would be more appropriate?

to deregister it and then later register during connection loss

"and later REregister" you mean?

off course I could use anonymous name, but this complicates the application because of other dependencies and I wanted to explore this option of unregistering and registering ,which seemed like a quick solution .But this is possible only if I could prevent it from killing it when cloud node active

yes I mean later reregister

just to be more specific ,my application is more like an edge computing architecture, where the server keeps changing and hence I though it was better to have a single master and everytime I have a new edge server I deploy the computing ros node to it and then change to another edge server with time
