Q:

Why does catkin_make fail when package depends on 'move_base'?

I have been using ROS for a few days and I am following the tutorial for setting up the Navigation Stack.  It tells me to create a package as follows:
catkin_create_pkg my_robot_name_2dnav move_base my_tf_configuration_dep my_odom_configuration_dep my_sensor_configuration_dep

Since tf and odom are handled in the zen package, and my sensor is a Kinect, my actual command is:
catkin_create_pkg zen_2dnav2 move_base freenect_launch zen

When I execute catkin_make I get an error due to move_base:
CMake Warning at /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:76 (find_package):
Could not find a package configuration file provided by "move_base" with
any of the following names:

  move_baseConfig.cmake
  move_base-config.cmake

I googled and subsequently removed the error by:

Removing the build-Dependency on move_base from package.xml
Removing move_base from
find_package(catkin REQUIRED
COMPONENTS ...) in CMakeLists.txt

So my questions in order of importance are:

Why did I get the error ?
What are the implications of removing
the dependency ?  i.e. Will the
Navigation Stack fail because of this
During my googling I read that
move_base is not catkinized and a
catkin package cannot depend on it.
Does that mean the tutorial is doomed
to failure.  I am hoping the
information is out of date and
move_base IS catkinized.  How can I
check this ?  Is there an up to date
list of packages that work in Kinetic
?

A:

You are probably getting the error because the move_base package is not installed in your machine. Try to execute the command:
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-navigation

It will install all the packages you need to run the navigation stack.

What are the implications of removing the dependency ? i.e. Will the Navigation Stack fail because of this

By removing the dependency your package will fail to compile if it uses any library or header file defined in mobile_base package.

During my googling I read that move_base is not catkinized and a catkin package cannot depend on it. Does that mean the tutorial is doomed to failure.

That information is out of date. The package move_base is indeed catkinized. You can check it by taking a look at move_base's CMakeLists.txt file.
roscd move_base
cat CMakeLists.txt

You will see that it uses the proper catkin macros.
If you want to see a list of available packages in Kinetic, execute:
sudo apt-get update
apt-cache search ros-kinetic

I hope this helps

Exactly what I needed on all my questions.  Thank you very much.
I see now that I was trying to setup the navigation stack without actually having installed it. I am amazed I got as far as I did !

I tried to do something to accept your answer for ages, but couldn't find what to click.  Thanks for the clue.  I was looking where I see 'edit', 'retag' 'close' etc. and had missed that rather understated tick icon.  Now done, and thanks again.
