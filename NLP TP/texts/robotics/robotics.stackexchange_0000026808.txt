Q:

"Warning [ODEJoint.cc:1105] GetForceTorque: forgot to set ?" with some models

After recent drcsim changes, some of our custom models started spamming
Warning [ODEJoint.cc:1105] GetForceTorque: forgot to set <provide_feedback>?

to the terminal at really high frequency. Can anyone give me a hint why that happens? So far I´ve been unsuccessful in tracking this issue down, but it appears it can´t be that hard to solve. I´m uploading models for use with gazebo through the parameter server. The drcsim_gazebo launch files work fine, so I guess we do something differently (or wrong).

A:

Ok found it. Accidentally loaded gazebo transmission and other settings for some joint names that are not part of the model and missed setting them for some other joints.
