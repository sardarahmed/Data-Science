Q:

Issues with ar_pose documentation

Hi everyone,
It seems like the repository link for ar_pose is wrong. I guess it might have something to do with jenkins... Right now it is associated with the kinton_robot stack, which seems completely wrong. The SVN repository link is also wrong. Does anyone know what's going on here?

A:

After posting this on the ros-users mailing list, I was advised by @tfoote to file an issue at the ros-infrastructure/jenkins_scripts github as the metadata for the ar_pose package was getting extra information added.
