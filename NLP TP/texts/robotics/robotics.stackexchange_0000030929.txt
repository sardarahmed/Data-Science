Q:

What is ROSPACK_MAKEDIST

I see
set(ROSPACK_MAKEDIST true)

in some CMakeLists.txt files at the stack level, but I can't find information about it.

A:

That variable is no longer needed, and can safely be deleted from any CMakeLists.txt file where you find it.
There was a time when ROSPACK_MAKEDIST was needed to elicit stack-specific behavior from rosbuild, but it was removed long ago.
