Q:

dependency libviso2 cannot be found

I'm working with ROS-Fuerte and eclipse. I want to make a package with the next dependencies
anjinsan@Erasmus:~/fuerte_workspace$ roscreate-pkg odometria roscpp std_msgs sensor_msgs opencv2 cv_bridge image_transport tf geometry_msgs image_geometry libviso2 message_filters nav_msgs pcl_ros std_srvs ros
and I get the next message
ERROR: dependency [libviso2] cannot be found
So i've tried to install it...
anjinsan@Erasmus:~/fuerte_workspace$ rosdep install libviso2
ERROR: Rosdep cannot find all required resources to answer your query
Missing resource libviso2
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/home/ellian/fuerte_workspace
ROS path [2]=/home/ellian/fuerte_workspace/sandbox
ROS path [3]=/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks
ROS path [4]=/opt/ros/fuerte/share
ROS path [5]=/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros
What am I doing wrong?

A:

libviso2 is not a binary or library that can be solved with a rosdep dependency. You can download and compile from [Github] a wrapper for ROS (https://github.com/srv/viso2) and work as if libviso2 was a ROS package.
In your ROS workspace type (you should have followed the tutorials about the rosws tool):
rosws set viso2 --git 'https://github.com/srv/viso2.git'
rosws update viso2
cd viso2
git checkout fuerte
rosmake

and then you are ready!

I'm new working with ROS.
I've downloaded the folder, I'm not sure of what I have to do.
Should I paste the folder "viso2_fuerte" in /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks and then run "make" in a terminal?
