Q:

wstool, rosinstall, rosws difference

What are the main differences among these packages ?
It seems rosws replaces rosinstall but what about wstool ?
Is one of them recommended for catkin ?

A:

Actually, wstool replaces rosws. See the link for details about that. And both rosws and wstool use rosinstall files for configuring workspaces. In general I have only seen wstool used with catkin workspaces and would recommend you use wstool instead of rosws.

Thanks for the links. It appears wstool is the final tool to manage src pkgs. FYI rosinstall is also a terminal cmd. The funny fact is that all these 3 cmds have the same functions.
