Q:

tf2 How to generate rotation matrix from axis-angle rotation?

Is there a build-in tf2 functionality where we can generate a rotation matrix given an axis (tf2::Vector3) and an angle (double). E.g.
Suppose you have:
tf2::Vector3 vec(2,3,4); // by axis I mean - any - axis, not just x,y,z
double angle_rads=1.57;
tf2::Matrix3x3 rotation_matrix(vec,rads); // <-- is there an easy way like this?

Thanks!

A:

OK found it my self :) For people that are wondering (it goes through Quaternions):
tf2::Quaternion q;
q.setRotation(rot_vec,angle);
tf2::Matrix3x3 R(q);
