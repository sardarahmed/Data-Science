Q:

rospack find beginner_tutorials failing

After doing a successful full desktop install of ROS Fuerte on Ubuntu Precise 64-bit, ( overlay too)
I did:
$ roscd
$ roscreate-pkg beginner_tutorials std_msgs rospy roscpp    (this part worked)

then:
sam@Mecha:~/fuerte_workspace$ rospack profile
Full tree crawl took 0.022642 seconds.

To get just of list of directories without manifests,
re-run the profile with --zombie-only

then:
THIS IS THE PROBLEM:
sam@Mecha:~/fuerte_workspace$ rospack find beginner_tutorials 
[rospack] Error: stack/package beginner_tutorials not found

My .bashrc file in my home directory has the following source lines where I replaced one source line with another as prescribed in the installation instructions.... and executed . ~/.bashrc
# source /opt/ros/fuerte/setup.bash  <---this is commented out
source /home/sam/fuerte_workspace/setup.bash

The tutorial instructions say:

If this fails, it means ROS can't find your new package, which may be an issue with your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. Please consult the installation instructions for setup from SVN or from binaries, depending how you installed ROS. If you've created or added a package that's outside of the existing package paths, you will need to amend your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environment variable to include that new location. Try re-sourcing your setup.sh in your fuerte_workspace.

I didn't make any effort to " create or add a package that's outside of the existing package paths".
I don't quite understand how

"Please consult the installation instructions for setup from SVN or from binaries, depending how you installed ROS." helps me since I don't understand what's really happening here.

It seems that maybe the profile command should have listed my /home/sam/fuerte_workspace/ path?!....but I'm not sure.
Please advise.

A:

I found out what the real cause of my problems was!
The ROS Fuerte release makes it possible for users not to mess with ROS_PACKAGE_PATH by supplying a "sandbox" directory in the  fuerte workspace...i.e. -  ~/fuerte_workspace/sandbox
At the URL http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage, section 1.2. Creating a New ROS Package, there is an instruction saying:
Now go into the ~/fuerte_workspace/sandbox directory:
$ cd ~/fuerte_workspace/sandbox
It then says (and here is where the problem occurs):
***** Alternatively, if you use Fuerte or later release, you can simply do: $ roscd *****
The "alternatively" part led me to believe I could also arrive at the ~/fuerte_workspace/sandbox by simply doing $ roscd, but this is not true. One must still explicitly perform $ cd ~/fuerte_workspace/sandbox to complete the tutorial. Otherwise doing $ roscreate-pkg beginner_tutorials std_msgs rospy roscpp will create the beginner_tutorials directory outside thee sandbox directory. If that is what one really wants to do sometime in the future, then the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environment variable must be modified as stated above, but to complete the tutorials, modifying ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environment variable is unnecessary.
Thank you for all your help! Greatly appreciated!
