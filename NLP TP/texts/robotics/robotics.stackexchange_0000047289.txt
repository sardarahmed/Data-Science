Q:

Memory requirement

How much harddrive memory does it take to install ROS?
I'm planning to install it on a Rapsberry Pi and need to know
how big SD-card I need to buy.
Cheers

A:

It depends on how many packages you install.
My install uses desktop-full + some extra packages. fuerte, 64-bit and I have 2.9G.
