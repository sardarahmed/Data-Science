Q:

pcl-ros datatype conversion

I'm trying to convert the Voxel grid filter to the ROS ecosystem. Instead of using 'pcl::PCLPointCloud2' data structure as given in the example code, I'm trying to use 'pcl::PointCloud' data structure (as in Euclidean Cluster Extraction). However, I'm not able to find the API that converts pcl::PointCloud to ROS message type.

A:

You will find that the VoxelGrid filter is already available as a nodelt (http://wiki.ros.org/pcl_ros/Filters#VoxelGrid, http://wiki.ros.org/pcl_ros/Tutorials/VoxelGrid%20filtering).
Read the ROS/PCL overview for a description on how to subscribe, publish, and convert between the different datatypes.
