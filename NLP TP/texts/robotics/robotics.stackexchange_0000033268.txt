Q:

How does cloud_to_laserscan.cpp work

I have some more qns regarding cloud_to_scan.cpp. the post was previously posted[http://answers.ros.org/question/1561/doubts-about-pointcloud-to-laser-scan] but it was not answered. I am in need of urgent help.
Qn 1)if (output->ranges[index] * output->ranges[index] > range_sq) output->ranges[index] = sqrt(range_sq);, what is this statement trying to do.. not that sure...
qn 2) is the x, y and z in metres?or what are the units for the x,y and z?
qn 3) why is  the angle = -atan2(x,z) and not angle = -atan2(z,x)

A:

All your questions can be answer by reviewing REP 103 Standard Units of Measure and Coordinate Conventions

At least 3 is also answered. Look at the coordinate axis definitions in the REP and the definition of the tangent function as found in your favorite math book. 1 apparently just limits range readings to some maximum.
