A:

Looking at this question and the SCIP 2.0 protocol (page 11), it looks like this is the Scan Interval has non-numeric value.
Can you verify your Hokuyo still works with the Hokuyo tools?  Can you hear it spinning?  Is it making bad noises?

i tried reconnecting and found something odd, it kept spinning up and spinning down and again spinning up and continues this for about 6 times and then stops. i tried with hokuyo tools , but it dosent even recognise the laser. Im having a feeling that this is a hardware problem.
