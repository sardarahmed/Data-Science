Q:

Integrating Hark with ROS-matlab

Hello guys!
I am trying to localize a sound source and use that information in matlab. I have integrated ROS with matlab (R2012b) and ROS with Hark. I am also able to visualize the localisation information in HARK. But I need the localisation data in Matlab (to control a robot in Gazebo). The problem I am facing is that the source localization data in hark is outputted as a data type ObjectRef. Can anyone help me how to convert this data structure to simple data types like vector, Int or float that can be published as std_msgs or any other technique by which I can subscribe localization data in Matlab. Information about the data type of source can be found at pg. no. 32 of hark-documentation (version2) . Any solution is welcome by which I can get the localization information in Matlab.
System Specs:
Ros Hydro, Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit, Matlab R2012b, Hark version 2

A:

I found a way around but it is not an elegant solution.
1> Create a rosbuild package (at this time hark_mgs do not support catkin package) that would subscribe to hark_msgs and publish any other standard message.
2> Subscribe the newly created topic consisting of std_msgs.
