Hey, Were you able to figure out how to approach this? I appreciate your thoughts.

A:

I am assuming that you are trying to use dwa_local_planner provided by navigation stack and
given a global plan to follow and a costmap, the local planner produces velocity commands to send to a mobile base. But you can code your own obstacle avoidance
check out costmap and global planner's wiki
