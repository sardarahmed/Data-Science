Q:

Passing Messages between multiple roscores linked on a network

Hello Community,
I am working on a multi-agent project using ROS as the framework on each robot. Since the robots will need to talk to eachother (pass and poll data) I was wondering how ROS could help with that. The idea is to have a similar Publisher/ Subscriber relation, over a network connection for different robots. One way to proceed would be to create UDP messages and broadcast them over the network. I wanted to get some insights about the tools/ packages/ libraries in ROS that can help with this.
Your help is greatly appreciated!
Thanks,
Ammar Husain
