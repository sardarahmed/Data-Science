Q:

Is it possible to kill other nodes in launch file when a particular one ends/dies?

I have a situation where I'd like to kill all other nodes launched from the same launch file once another is finished doing its work.

A:

I believe you want the required="true" parameter for your node element. http://www.ros.org/wiki/roslaunch/XML/node says: "If node dies, kill entire roslaunch."

Perfect. That's exactly what I was looking for.
