Q:

Battery damaged?

Could you please see the attached battery images and tell me if it is safe to continue using this battery or should I discard it?

A:

If the battery cost less than the thing you're powering, then you should probably discard the battery. 
If you're stubborn (or very strapped for cash) and the battery didn't catch fire when the original damage happened, then it might perform okay, but I'd say there's a moderate chance of fire, especially at high currents. 
Check battery voltage with a multimeter, then come back and check it again after a few hours. You're looking for a high self-discharge rate, which would indicate the battery is internally shorted out. 
If the battery voltage drops noticeably after a few hours (or even a day), then you should trash the battery. 
The terminal voltage on a lithium battery only drops about a quarter of a volt from 80% to 20% state of charge, so anything more than a hundredth of a volt or two and I'd call that significant. Every hundredth is about 2.4 percent of total battery capacity in that range, so 0.02V is roughly 5% of battery capacity.
