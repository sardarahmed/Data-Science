Q:

What are the joints _key attributes names for SetAttribute() function?

Hi,
So the SetAttribute() function changed in Gazebo 1.3, it is declared like this:
  /// \brief Set a non-generic parameter for the joint.
  /// replaces SetAttribute(Attribute, int, double)
  /// \param[in] _key String key.
  /// \param[in] _index Index of the axis.
  /// \param[in] _value Value of the attribute.
  public: virtual void SetAttribute(const std::string &_key, int _index,
                                    const boost::any &_value) = 0;

What are the _key string values in order to set the following attributes:
FUDGE_FACTOR, SUSPENSION_ERP, SUSPENSION_CFM, STOP_ERP, STOP_CFM, ERP,
CFM, FMAX, VEL, HI_STOP, LO_STOP

For some of them there are functions like SetDamping(), SetHighStop(), SetLowStop() etc. in order to set them, but for the others  like stop_cfm, stop_erp etc. ?
Thanks, Andrei

A:

Ok, figured it out, I was looking in Joint.cc not in ODEJoint.cc.
The names are:
"fudge_factor"
"suspension_erp"
"suspension_cfm"
"stop_erp"
"stop_cfm"
"erp"
"cfm"
"fmax"
"vel"
"hi_stop"
"lo_stop"
"thread_pitch"
