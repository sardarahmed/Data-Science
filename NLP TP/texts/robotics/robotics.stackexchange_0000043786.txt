Q:

dispaying the data of /odom (nav_msgs/Odometry) UTM-encoded position in RVIZ

Fuerte on Ubuntu 12.04
The goal is to display the odometry of the robot in RVIZ.
I am using the Xsens-mtig gps imu module. I used the package cyphy_xsens_mtig package which publishes /fix and then gps_common package which subscribes to /fix and publishes /odom (nav_msgs/Odometry) which is a UTM-encoded position.
I launched RVIZ and and selected the /base_imu frame id . The odometry display type in rviz shows that the messages are being received but i am not able to see the GPS location in rviz. I have tried all the views possible but it just shows a line which is a reference to TF.
I guess that some link is missing between the TF of GPS and UTM..If any one has any idea, please let me know

A:

Got the answer. The gps_common package does not publish any TF data. So I have added a TF broadcaster and am able to view the TF data in RVIZ.
