Q:

Running hokuyo node on Gumstix with Ubuntu

Hi.
I'm now following below two tutorials to install ROS on Gumstix.
#1 http://www.ros.org/wiki/Ubuntu%20Natty,%20ROS%20Diamondback,%20and%20Gumstix%20Overo
#2 http://www.ros.org/wiki/gumros/ubuntu
However, in tutorial #2, author said, "Create setup.sh as usual and source".
But, there is no clue about that. What should I do for this?
When I follow tutorial #1, install like below, it has "setup.sh" by default.
rosinstall ~/ros "http://packages.ros.org/cgi-bin/gen_rosinstall.py?rosdistro=diamondback&variant=ros-base&overlay=no"
Do you think anything difference between tutorial #1 and #2?
And Second, I would like to use Hokuyo LRF node on Gumstix.
There are 6 dependencies to use hokuyo node.
diagnostic_updater
driver_base
dynamic_reconfigure
roscpp
self_test
sensor_msgs
However, I have no idea to install this.
And also, byte alignment error occurred.
Can you help me to this end?

A:

If you can live with an older distribution, there are .deb packages available for ROS Electric on Ubuntu Maverick and for ROS Diamondback on Ubuntu Lucid. These packages include pre-built laser drivers.
If you still want to install from source, try the following:
The first tutorial looks like the better one to follow; setup.sh and setup.bash are created by rosinstall.
Regarding dependencies: some of those may already be installed by default. If rospack find <package> returns true, then that package is already installed.
If a package isn't installed, you can use the dependency links to find stack containing that package, and get the source code with rosco --distro=diamondback <stack>
You can then start tracking that package with rosinstall by doing rosinstall ~/ros <stack>
Don't forget to install the dependencies for your dependencies. This may be a bit of chase.
If you have to install pcl_ros, I suggest you edit the CMakelists.txt and Makefile and remove any parallel-build options ( -j or -j<N> )
Once you have all of your dependencies downloaded, you should build your laser drivers using rosmake.
