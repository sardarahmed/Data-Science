Q:

not found: local_setup.bash

I created a test workspace. Now i deleted that, because i dont need it anymore.
I had the workspace automatically sourced in my  ~/.bashrc: /home/luca/workspace/test_ws/install/setup.bash. Now i deleted that again from my ~/.bashrc.
Still when i open a terminal i get this message
not found: "/home/luca/workspace/test_ws/install/local_setup.bash"
not found: "/home/luca/workspace/test_ws/install/local_setup.bash"

How can i solve this?

Maybe you also wrote it in your /etc/bash.bashrc file.

i checked etc/bash.bashrc file and der is no source in there.
Comment by nils_iseke on 2022-10-25:
Hm, ok you could execute cd ~ && cat .bashrc | grep source  and  cd  /etc && cat bash.bashrc | grep source to see which ROS related files are sourced. I am assuming that you are using the bash shell echo $SHELL?

cd ~ && cat .bashrc | grep source
# sources /etc/bash.bashrc).
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source /usr/share/colcon_argcomplete/hook/colcon-argcomplete.bash
source ~/workspace/ros_ur_driver/install/setup.bash
source ~/ws_moveit2/install/setup.bash
source ~/workspace/ros_tutorial/install/setup.bash
source ~/workspace/ur_control/install/setup.bash

cd /etc && cat bash.bashrc | grep source
# this file has to be sourced in /etc/profile.

echo $SHELL
/bin/bash

I would just comment out all the sourcing lines, to see if they are part of the problem.
Comment by LucB on 2022-10-29:
Right now there is three times the  not found.
I commented out the last three sources
#source ~/ws_moveit2/install/setup.bash
#source ~/workspace/ros_tutorial/install/setup.bash
#source ~/workspace/ur_control/install/setup.bash

then the not found disappears. For each source one disappears.
Is there a way the source them without executing the "/home/luca/workspace/test_ws/install/local_setup.bash"?

A:

I deleted the folders log, install and build in the Workspaces which caused the not found.
Then i build the packages again and the not found was gone.
