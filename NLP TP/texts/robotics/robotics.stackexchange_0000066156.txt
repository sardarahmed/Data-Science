Q:

Cartesian Planner Plugin not selectable on RViz

Following its wiki I opened a plugin list in a trial to add Cartesian Path Planner MoveIt Plugin after running:
roslaunch motoman_sia20d_moveit_config moveit_planning_execution.launch

I don't see the plugin in the list.
rospack find moveit_cartesian_plan_plugin seems to be returning the right path to the package.
Anything missing am I?

A:

Just figured out. Wiki wasn't correct.
roslaunch fermi_sia20d_moveit_config moveit_planning_execution.launch
