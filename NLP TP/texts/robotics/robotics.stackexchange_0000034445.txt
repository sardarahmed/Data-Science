Q:

Openni kinect error make

Hi!! I'm trying to install the drivers's openni kinect in Ubuntu with ROS electric.
I installed ROS following "the ROS installation instrucion" and I did the first 9 tutorials, but when i tried to install the openni kinect following http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_kinect , the comand "make" fail.
That's the error message in the terminal:
miles@nono:~/drivers$ make
cd openni && make
make[1]: se ingresa al directorio «/home/miles/drivers/openni»
git clone https://github.com/OpenNI/OpenNI.git build/openni
make[1]: git: No se encontró el programa
make[1]: *** [build/openni] Error 127
make[1]: se sale del directorio «/home/miles/drivers/openni»
make: *** [openni_lib] Error 2

Please....help me :(

I have installed  ros-electric-desktop-full. And for openin kinect,  I only installed ros-electric-openni-kinect and rosinstall.

Please provide more information on what you have installed and how you did so, otherwise it's very hard to help you.

A:

I'm pretty sure that the error you're experiencing is because you do not have "git" installed.
If you're on ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install git
