Q:

gazebo_ros missing(indigo 14.04)

Hi everyone,I'm using indigo on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
i have installed indigo full desktop version,deleted Gazebo Ver 2 and installed Gazebo Ver 6.1.0 from the gazebosim website.
i am now trying to launch a xacro model in gazebo, and the following error occurs:
edmond@edmond:~$ roslaunch myrobot_gazebo gazebo.launch
... logging to /home/edmond/.ros/log/a1af2d0c-aa3e-11e5-9405-c81f662b396f/roslaunch-edmond-4794.log

**ResourceNotFound: gazebo_ros**

ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/indigo/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/home/edmond/rosws/src
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/indigo/share
ROS path [3]=/opt/ros/indigo/stacks

so i tried installing ros-indigo-gazebo-ros, but then
edmond@edmond:~$ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-gazebo-ros

   **The following packages have unmet dependencies!:**

    ros-indigo-gazebo-ros : Depends: gazebo2 but it is not going to be installed
    Depends: libsdformat1 but it is not going to be installed
    E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

does anyone has the idea how to fix this problem?
Thanks a lot!
btw, how to edit the format when posting? i can only see the hints for italic,bold, link and image on the right hand side..thanks again!

A:

This page: http://gazebosim.org/tutorials/?tut=ros_wrapper_versions describes how to use a non-default version of gazebo with ROS.
In particular, once you've added the osrfoundation repo to your apt sources, you can install the gazebo ros packages using their version number:
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-gazebo6-ros-pkgs
