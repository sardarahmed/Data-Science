When I was installing turtlebot software I installed ros-fuerte-desktop-full first, then ros-fuerte-turtlebot , ros-fuerte-turtlebot-apps and then in the end ros-fuerte-turtlebot-simulator.

I have working turtlebot simulator on fuerte. Try to install al these stacks: ros-fuerte-turtlebot, ros-fuerte-turtlebot-apps and then in the end ros-fuerte-turtlebot-simulator

A:

Your apt configuration seems to be messed up. Have a look at /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list and make sure the entry references precise, not oneiric. Then do
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-turtlebot-simulator

Also, please make sure you read the support guidelines before posting. Always tag your questions appropriately.

@Lorenz thanks it works now ,, but can't install turtlebot SDK ,, Question Edited
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-12-08:
Not sure what you mean with 'turtlebot SDK' but if you just install ros-fuerte-turtlebot-simulator, ros-fuerte-turtlebot-apps and ros-fuerte-turtlebot-viz to install all turtlebot related packages. And I think your original question was answered. For subsequent questions, open a new question.

that is Turtlebot SDK but not for Fuerte
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-12-09:
You will get everything that was formerly installed with ros-...-turtlebot-desktop with installing the packages I mentioned, i.e. apps, simulator and viz. Additionally, you might need ros-fuerte-visualization.
