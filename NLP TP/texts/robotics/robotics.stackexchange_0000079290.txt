What is your operative system? I encountered lots of problems for raspbian and switched to ubuntu mate 14.04 and everything worked like a charm

I have Raspbian Jessie. But having many issues getting packages install. I'll use Ubuntu Mate. Thanks

A:

Download common messages from here: https://github.com/ros/common_msgs and place it in src folder. Then run catkin_make in your workspace. It will install all common message type including geometry_msgs. If you only want geometry messages then download the geometry_msgs folder.
