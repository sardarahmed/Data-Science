Q:

Joy.msgs line44 problem

Hi, when i want to open the Joy.msg file in the sensor_msgs directory for arduino, i get the following error:
Parsing Joy.msg as OLE file failed at /usr/bin/msgconvert line 44.
For spesification I first installed the msgconverter and tried the following code in terminal:
msgconvert Joy.msg
I cannot see the inside of the message file, how can i solve this problem or see the message file's inside?
Thanks for help

A:

Joy.msg is a text file. It would seem your platform/OS is telling the Arduino IDE it's an "OLE file".
There is no need to convert the .msg file, you should just open it as a regular text file.

Actually: it's a .yaml file, but with a different extension. So if you'd like to benefit from syntax highlighting, tell your IDE it's a .yaml file.
