Q:

Cloudsim/Softlayer: password? emacs?

How do I scp stuff to the field computer: What is the password for the user ubuntu?

Could emacs be part of the standard installation?

Thanks,
Chris

A:

There's no password for the ubuntu user; we're using SSH keys (once you're on the machine, the ubuntu user has password-less sudo access).  Each machine's .zip file contains a .pem file that is the private SSH key for that machine.  There's an example command-line in the VRC User Guide for scping files to the Simulation machine.  The same process can be used for the other machines, swapping key file name and IP address as needed.

Sure, we can add emacs to the provisioning.  This won't be the only such request, so I've opened a ticket to track them.  Feel free to add more requested packages there.  To avoid disruption during Practice, we won't be doing any installations for you, so you'll need to add extra stuff yourself.  The extra packages will come installed by default when the machines get reloaded for Competition.
