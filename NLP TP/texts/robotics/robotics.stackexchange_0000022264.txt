Q:

May I get this robot arm to be controlled via drawing, not programming?

I got an Omron Viper 850 robot arm with a spindle mounted with a cutter. It is controlled via EV+ programming (EV+ is a programming language used in the ACE Adept Omron software to move the robot).
The idea, initially, was to use it to cut some plastic car plates that goes inside of the car. But I have a bunch of different models of car plastic plates and now I am having a bad time doing a program for every plastic plate model that I have to cut. Each program takes 1~2 days to be ready and the curves are not perfect.
The question is if theres some drawing software that enables me to take a photo from the plastic plate, delimit the borders and gets the robot to cut it. Or at least, a software for this robot that permits make some drawings and get the robot to follow the path, alike a CNC machine being controlled by MACH3 software.
Thanks in advanced.

I doubt you will find an out of the box solution, but you can piece together a solution if you have some programming knowledge.
There are many image to G-Code converters out there. You can use one of these to convert your image to G-Code. The most interesting part of this are the coordinates. Your robot is also controlled by coordinates, but instead of a G01 command (in G-Code) it has a Move command. All you need to do is write a small script that replaces the G-code syntax in the G-Code with your eV+ syntax. It does not need to be a full blown interpreter and pretty printer. These programming languages have a very simple syntax, you can just do string manipulation (replace  substrings, add or remove , or ;) and it should work.
