Hello, everyone
I have a question for you.
my environment is Raspberry pi 3, Ubuntu mate 16.04 LTS, rplidar A2.
I just follow rplidar tutorial(http://wiki.ros.org/rplidar)
everything is ok, but when i killed rplidar(press Ctrl+C),
terminal show me : shutting down processing monitor complete
BUT, lidar continues to work(spining), How can i stop rplidar ?
Do i have to do extra work? or something i forgot?
Please answer me how to solve the problem.

Not very familiar with rplidar, but shouldn't it always spin while powered? By killing a node you are basically killing the driver only.

the RPLidar A2 driver (should) starts and stops the motor on launch and exit respectively.
Comment by Procópio on 2017-08-09:
can you share the source of that information?
Comment by naveedhd on 2017-08-09:
In official node here and nodelet's implementation here

@naveedhd I appreciate it. Thanks.

A:

I did 2 solutions about my problem.

Power problem

it looks power problem about my rplidar.
i used 5V/1A power connect. but when i see CPU monitor, i think it was lack about using RPlidar
so i connect power-supplied USB 3.0 hub with RPlidar.

add 2 lines of command

when i use rplidar i always insert 2 lines of command
$ source /home/{user}/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
 $ source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash

with 2 solutions, i can start , stop my rplidar.
