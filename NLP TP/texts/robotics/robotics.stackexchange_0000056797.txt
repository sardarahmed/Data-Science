Q:

Can't run or compile anything !!!! -> symbol lookup error: /opt/ros/hydro/lib/libroscpp.so: undefined symbol: _ZN3ros6HeaderC1Ev

it appears that there is an unknown symbol in the libroscpp.so file, and now catkin can find anything in /opt/ros/hydro/lib/ even though everything is there. No changes were made to the system that I can find, how did this happen and how do I fix it?

A:

I was having the exact same problem then I found this thread.
My issue seems to have been caused by OS updates running across errors while updating the ROS packages.
