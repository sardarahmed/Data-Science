Q:

roslaunch doesn't work

In the roslaunch tutorial, running turtlemimic.launch doesn't work, i get:
[turtlemimic.launch] is neither a launch file in package [beginner_tutorial] nor is [beginner_tutorial] a launch file name
Can anyone help me?
Thanks

can you post the command you are using; did you save the turtlemimic.launch file in launch folder ?

Have roscore running, made the source of setup.bash, beginner_tutorials is recognized as a package and roslaunch gives that error, any help?
