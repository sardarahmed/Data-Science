Q:

Will ROS be able to run on the Raspberry Pi?

Will ROS be able to run on the Raspberry Pi?
It uses an ARM1176JZF-S core.
The provisional hardware specification is here.
Debian, Fedora and Archlinux will be supported at launch.
Cost is expected to be very low.

A:

Given the specs and that it can run some forms of Linux, I would expect that some level of ROS software can run on the Raspberry Pi. I expect you would be able to run most of the core ROS packages (such as the communications or even some more math heavy packages such as tf at slower rates) pretty well.
If you try to run complex software such as navigation, the single core will probably start to have trouble keeping up with everything (not to mention any slowdowns due to things like Eigen probably not being very well optimized for ARM11 compared to x86 or x86-64). It may be possible to run something like navigation with appropriate configuration tweaking for the slower CPU.
All that said, for the cost of an Arduino, you are definitely getting a lot more computing power so it definitely has possibilities.
