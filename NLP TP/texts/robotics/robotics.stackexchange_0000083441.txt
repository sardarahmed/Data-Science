Q:

Is there something like a observer-node?

Hello community,
I am having the problem that once in a while some of my nodes randomly die due to hardware issues (overheating, miserable cable connection, problems in usb_read/write errors, etc.) that can't be faced by me.
I would like to know if I can create some sort of observer-node, that listens to dying nodes and can thus initiate some recovery behavior.
This is pretty important in my case, as sometimes my camera-node dies which leads to the situation, that the robot doesn't have any clue where it's located at.
If I had this observing node I could most likely manage the situation properly, without having to reboot everything.
I am really looking forward to your replies.
Best regards, Till

Do you just want to restart the node? In this case, check launch-files and especially the respawn-parameter.

The respawn flag won't work, as some specific actions have to be triggered before the node can restart.

A:

You could implement a central node that uses bonds to get a notification if one of the other nodes dies.
