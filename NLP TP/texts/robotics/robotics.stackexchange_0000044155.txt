Q:

How to install ros-electric-object-recognition?

I use ROS electric.
I followed Object Recognition Kitchen.
This doc says 'Install the ros-electric-object-recognition package from the official ROS repositories.'
I try to install:
  sam@/home/sam$ sudo apt-get install ros-electric-object-recognition
  Reading package lists... Done
  Building dependency tree       
  Reading state information... Done
  E: Unable to locate package ros-electric-object-recognition
  
  sam@/home/sam$

How to fix it?
Thank you~
=============================================
ROS apt:
  sam@/etc/apt/sources.list.d$ cat ros-latest.list
  # deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu natty main # 停用升級至 natty
  
  sam@/etc/apt/sources.list.d$ cat ros-latest.list.distUpgrade 
  deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu maverick main
  
  sam@/etc/apt/sources.list.d$ cat ros-latest.list.save 
  deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu maverick main
  
  sam@/etc/apt/sources.list.d$

A:

For me, the package exists in electric. I can also see it at packages.ros.org.
Maybe you need to run sudo apt-get update first?
Otherwise, what is your apt entry for ROS?

I try to use apt-get update but doesn't work. I have updated my original post. What to do next? Thank you~

The ros repository in ros-latest.list is commented out. This obviously won't work, just remove the #, run apt-get update again and it should work.

Note: This automatically happened during the maverick -> natty update. You should have gotten a warning about that from ubuntu and it will probably happen on every ubuntu update again.
