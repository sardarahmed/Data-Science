Q:

May I purchase a TurtleBot with an arm similar to Bilibot?

I'd be willing to pay more for a purchase option that would let me buy the TurtleBot FULL package that additionally includes "AN ARM SIMILAR TO THE BILIBOT" with the specs below:
*Custom Designed Acrylic, with aluminum support, providing the perfect balance between strength and low weight.
*Geared Motors
*Lifts objects from the ground up to 17 Inches in the Air
*Lifts objects weighing up to 3 Lbs
Am I able to buy such a TurtleBot package? (I sure sure hope so!!)
Please let me know how much this would cost.
Thanks.

I'm working on getting an arm on the TurtleBot ...be patient...and many other people are working on cool add-ons too. So if you want a TurtleBot get one and join the community!

Because I prefer the expandable physical shelf design of the Turtlebot. The great Turtlebot community support seems far more active at the moment too.

If you want an arm like the one the Bilibot has, why not just buy a Bilibot?

A:

We are currently creating a metric version of the turtlebot (on turtlebot.eu) with options to buy the plates in MDF or in Acrylic. Our site is not complete yet, but on of the first extensions we'll post is a gripper + arm design for the turtlebot.
Other extensions include: dynamixel mount for tilting laser scanner and tilting kinect and an mini-ITX alternative to the current laptop.
I'm finishing the designs and we still need to calculate the costs.
