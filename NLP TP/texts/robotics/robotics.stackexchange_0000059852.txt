Q:

Install ROS Groovy alongside Boost 1.55

Hi,
I'm trying to install ROS Groovy (but the error also exists with Hydro), but it won't install unless I uninstall my new version of Boost. However, I also want to use the newer Boost library, since only the latest version supports the algorithm I use. I tried apt-get install, which complained that I held broken packages, and aptitude install, which simply stated that I should remove the new Boost version and let it uninstall the old one.
Any way I can still install ROS with a newer version of Boost?

A:

The key issue here is that different versions of boost can't be installed side-by-side, and the ROS binaries depend on the older version of Boost. See this question for a more detailed explanation.
You can use ROS, but you'll have to compile it from source.
