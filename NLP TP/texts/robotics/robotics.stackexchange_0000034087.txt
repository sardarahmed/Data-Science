Q:

teleop_controllers package in electric

Was the teleop_controllers package (http://www.ros.org/wiki/teleop_controllers) moved in electric or is there a plan to release it?

A:

I've think I've figured this out.  The JTTeleop controller is now located in robot_mechanism_controllers and it shows up in the controller manager as robot_mechanism_controllers/JTCartesianController.
