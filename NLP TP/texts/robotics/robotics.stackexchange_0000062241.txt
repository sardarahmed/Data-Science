Which version of Ubuntu are you using?
Comment by Morpheus on 2014-09-01:
I am running Ubuntu 13.10.  I see that ROS doesn't support anything newer than 13.04.  I assume that is the problem.
Comment by Dirk Thomas on 2014-09-01:
If you are using 13.10 or 14.04 the recommended ROS distro is Indigo.

A:

To instanll rviz
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-rviz

May be you need to check this Configure your Ubuntu repositories
