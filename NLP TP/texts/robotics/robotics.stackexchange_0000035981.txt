Q:

Is there a simple way to test services (like actionlib's axclient)?

I want to test a service connection as simply as possible (i.e. without setting up a dummy program).
Actionlib has to very nice axserver.py tool for this, which just displays the entries of an action and allows a user to respond to this.
I would like to have the same for services, some script that displays an arbitrary service in a simple gui and allows the user to reply to service calls.
Does something like this exist?

If anyone needs something like this. It is available here:
