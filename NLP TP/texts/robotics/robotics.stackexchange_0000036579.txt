Q:

How can a C++ state machine communicate with a python script?

Hi,
I am wondering how I could tell a python script to execute from a c++ code.
My specific problem is, to activate a pocketsphinx script to recognize spoken commands.
But pocketsphinx is written in python...
Is the solution to make an action client / server for the communication?
I am new to ROS and a bit confused on how this transition between C++ and python works.
Regards,
Max

A:

You can define a simple service in Python with a C++ client.
If you need a more elaborate structure for controlling the service, actionlib may provide a better solution.

I see, thank you for the explanation!

You can return a result message from a simple service. Actionlib provides more sophisticated features, such as cancelling or preempting an earlier request.

So, actionlib when I want to have feedback?
