A:

Project -> Preferences -> C/C++ Include Paths and Symbols
Delete /usr/src/gtest/include (near the bottom of the list).
You might need to build gtest as well:
# See below for source url
sudo apt-get install libgtest-dev
# sudo apt-get install cmake #  <==  Not required since ROS already provides this
cd /usr/src/gtest
sudo cmake CMakeLists.txt
sudo make
# copy or symlink libgtest.a and libgtest_main.a to your /usr/lib folder
sudo cp *.a /usr/lib  # <= Probably not required either due to existing include paths
