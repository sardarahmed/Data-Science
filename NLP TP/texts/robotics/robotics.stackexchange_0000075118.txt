Q:

Possibility of flipping the role of Master & Slave for a group

Scenario
I have multiple bots running rtabmap. They are their own ROS master and their is no slave (party of 1). Each bot is publishing topics but there are no connected ROS machines subscribing to this data.
Question
If connected to the same wifi network how can I have a third party ROS box listen to the topics from each individual ROS bot's topics?
Note
I realize I'm somewhat flipping the idea of Master / Slave communication, the reason being that I'm limited to the software only allowing one node of rtabmap to be present per ROS master.
For those interested there is a small discussion leading up to this question which can be followed on the official rtabmap forum.

A:

You can have one rtabmap per slave (i.e., each robot is a ROS slave), and a ROS master running on a remote computer. You would have to put rtabmap nodes in different namespaces (e.g., /robotA/rtabmap, /robotB/rtabmap, etc) to make sure that topics from multiple robots are not published on the same topic name (e.g., /robotA/mapData, /robotB/mapData, etc...). You would also need to set tf_prefix for the robot state publisher (or TF static transforms) and also for rtabmap nodes to have a different TF tree for each robot.
If you prefer having multiple ROS masters, you may want to take a look at the multimaster_fkie package.
