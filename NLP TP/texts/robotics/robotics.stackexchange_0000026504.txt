Q:

slip1, slip2 in URDF

Hi all,
I'm working on URDF model of skid steering robot (Pioneer 3AT). There is new plugin for controlling this type of robot (see gazebo_plugins package) so, I can command robot from ROS and it moves. But I have problems with rotational movements - robot can't rotate. If I define wheels (collision geometry) as very thin cylinders and apply high torque it "somehow" rotates... If collision geometry is defined using mesh it's better but, robot jumps a bit.
The question is - how can I set slip1/slip2 (as setting this is recommended here) using URDF? As far as I know, URDF is translated into SDF so, I guess, it should be somehow possible. Thanks for hints in advance.
I'm using Gazebo 1.8 and gazebo_ros_pkgs for ROS integration.

A:

URDF has no concept of friction, so you'll have to insert SDF (which is currently specified using the  extension).
Something like
  <gazebo reference="r_foot">
    <!-- kp and kd for rubber -->
    <kp>1000000.0</kp>
    <kd>100.0</kd>
    <mu1>1.5</mu1>
    <mu2>1.5</mu2>
    <fdir1>1 0 0</fdir1>
    <maxVel>1.0</maxVel>
    <minDepth>0.00</minDepth>
  </gazebo>
