Q:

No gazebo-ros package after update?

After the recent 2.0.0 Gazebo update, I can no longer run gazebo_ros. It has been deinstalled during the update. When trying to install gazebo-ros-pkgs, I get the following output:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 ros-hydro-gazebo-ros-control : Depends: ros-hydro-gazebo-ros but it is not going to be installed
 ros-hydro-gazebo-ros-pkgs : Depends: ros-hydro-gazebo-plugins but it is not going to be installed
                             Depends: ros-hydro-gazebo-ros but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

When trying to install the mentioned ros-hydro-gazebo-ros, this is the output:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 ros-hydro-gazebo-ros : Depends: gazebo but it is not going to be installed
                        Depends: ros-hydro-gazebo-plugins but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

Yet, gazebo is installed and can be run.
Is there something broken in the repository?
EDIT:
This issue: https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/126 does indeed state a problem in the repository, but it is not released yet. I'm looking for people who have the same problem or have found a workaround.
