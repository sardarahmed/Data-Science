Q:

How do I run .launch files?

Some of the files that I have from downloading ROS have .launch file extensions. I was wondering what this means, but I cannot find anything through Google or Wikipedia. Also, is roslaunch the only way to run .launch files?

A:

.launch is simply a roslaunch file. It is an XML file which specifies nodes to launch and parameters to assign to them. It's an easy way to avoid typing "rosrun ... " over and over again when you need to launch many nodes in a particular system.

I don't actually need another way to run them; it would have simply made things a bit easier.

I don't believe so. Why do you need another way?

Is there another way to run them, or is roslaunch the only way?
