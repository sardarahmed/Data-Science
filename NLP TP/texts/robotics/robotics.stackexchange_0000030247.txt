Q:

osx error finding boost

I'm trying to install diamondback on a brand new, fresh out of the box macbook pro, and I'm encountering an error that I've never seen before. I'm getting errors from
diamondback/ros/tools/rosboost_cfg/src/rosboost_cfg/rosboost_cfg.py
about not being able to find boost.  The specific error is
rosboost_cfg.rosboost_cfg.BoostError: "Cannot find boost in any of [('/usr', True), ('/usr/local', True)]"
Looking in the python script, it looks like this list should at the very least also include /opt/local/include, which is set in $CPATH.
Here's the relevant python bit:
 _search_paths = [(sysroot+'/usr', True),
                 (sysroot+'/usr/local', True),
                 (None if 'INCLUDE_DIRS' not in os.environ else os.environ['INCLUDE_DIRS'], True),
                 (None if 'CPATH' not in os.environ else os.environ['CPATH'], True),
                 (None if 'C_INCLUDE_PATH' not in os.environ else os.environ['C_INCLUDE_PATH'], True),
                 (None if 'CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH' not in os.environ else os.environ['CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH'], True),
                 (None if 'ROS_BOOST_ROOT' not in os.environ else os.environ['ROS_BOOST_ROOT'], False)]

When I do
echo $CPATH
I get
/opt/local/include
(set from .profile).

A:

I figured out the problem.
It happens when doing sudo rosinstall instead of just rosinstall.
For future reference, rosinstall and sudo don't play well together on OSX currently.
