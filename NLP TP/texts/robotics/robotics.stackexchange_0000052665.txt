Q:

Process has died

I am just trying to launch a file using roslaunch rtklib.launch but it constantly says that process has died. I have spent a lot of time fixing this problem but I cannot. Also everything was working fine yesterday but when I try to launch it now, it does not work. The error is as follows
started roslaunch server http://malik:34688/

I have already tried netstat -ltpn inorder to check there is no other ros program running. Any help would be appreciated.

Can you please be more detailed about it. Forexample what is your output to ROS_PACKAGE_PATH and all the other necessary details

A:

I am gonna answer it, just in case somebody encounters a similar error.
I got this error fixed. I checked my log files and I was able to detect the error. I was accessing data in my code which I had not initialized which lead to my program crashing.

hey ichecked my log file and its empty . what would be the error then?
Comment by Maximilian on 2016-02-19:
Awesome! This error was driving me nuts! However it seems to only occur when launching the process with a launch file. Launching it "manually" prevented the error from happening...

Awesome! I had same Problem
Comment by chrism on 2021-06-23:
Can anyone elaborate on what in the log files would indicate a data related error or even more generally what the log files should contain? I like to have the output parameter of the node in the launch file set to screen, when this is the case the log file is empty. When I set the output to "log" the log file contains no additional information that I can't already see on the screen
