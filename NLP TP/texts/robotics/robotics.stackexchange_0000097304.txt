Q:

lidar_euclidean_cluster_detect frame is wrong

Hello everyone. I am using the lidar_euclidean_cluster_detect and I have noticed that the frame is wrong in the /detection/objects topic.
In the header I have what I put as output_frame as I expected but the position values are not TFed ! It's still in the same frame as the input (lidar).
Example here : https://imgur.com/a/DxeKvPG
The points are still in Lidar frame and not map frame, even if the header says so ! It really looks like a bug.
I just realized that the convex_hull is also wrong in the topic cloud_clusters.
