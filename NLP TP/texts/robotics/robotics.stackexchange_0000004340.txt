Q:

Matlab for moving a robot towards the detected block

the matlab code is used to detect red colored object, but i want to control a bot to move towards the detected object. just need a simple algorithm or idea, controlling the servo i will be able to do it.    

%get snapshot
data = imread('image.jpg');
% Now to track red objects in real time
% we have to subtract the red component 
% from the grayscale image to extract the red components in the image.
diff_im = imsubtract(data(:,:,1), rgb2gray(data));
%Use a median filter to filter out noise
diff_im = medfilt2(diff_im, [3 3]);
% Convert the resulting grayscale image into a binary image.
diff_im = im2bw(diff_im,0.18);

% Remove all those pixels less than 300px
diff_im = bwareaopen(diff_im,300);

% Label all the connected components in the image.
bw = bwlabel(diff_im, 8);

% Here we do the image blob analysis.
% We get a set of properties for each labeled region.
stats = regionprops(bw, 'BoundingBox', 'Centroid');

% Display the image
imshow(data)

hold on

%This is a loop to bound the red objects in a rectangular box.
for object = 1:length(stats)
    bb = stats(object).BoundingBox;
    bc = stats(object).Centroid;
    rectangle('Position',bb,'EdgeColor','r','LineWidth',2)
    plot(bc(1),bc(2), '-m+')
    a=text(bc(1)+15,bc(2), strcat('X: ', num2str(round(bc(1))), '    Y: ', num2str(round(bc(2)))));
    set(a, 'FontName', 'Arial', 'FontWeight', 'bold', 'FontSize', 12, 'Color', 'yellow');
end

hold off

A:

Image X and Y will reflect x and Y coordinates on the floor. Lens has distortion. Use calibration (if opencv), if high accuracy needed (may not need in this case).
Original answer was mis-understood:
Height and Width is distance (far, smaller image) then PID to control speed, slow down when near
Left, Central, Right of the block is angle of block as reference to vehicle coordinate frame and calculate the motion angle
