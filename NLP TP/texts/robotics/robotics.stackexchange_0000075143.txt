Q:

Access to the joints cartesian position from KDL chain

Hello,
for my project I have to know the cartesian joint position, and possibly also the orietation. I have my chain created using KDL and DH parameter. There is a possibility to access to that information from the chain? I mean, some function like: chain.getJointPose()...
Thanks in advance
