A:

Hello,
I had a few shots with VFH features recognitiom which work only on 3d information.
Check these pcl tutorials:
How 3D Features work in PCL
Estimating VFH signatures for a set of points
Cluster Recognition and 6DOF Pose Estimation using VFH descriptors
It kind of gives good results, provided that you took enough snapshots from enough viewpoints of your objects during the learning phase.
I noticed that someone pushed it a level farther, by learning objects directly from 3d models and clustering the observed point clouds.
This work is advertised in this video and hosted in the ROS packagevfh_recognition.
As other said, object recognition stays a hard problem.
I hope it helps
