Q:

Where can I buy the PrimeSense Carmine 1.09

Hello All,
I'm looking into purchasing the new close-range Primesense RGB-D camera but I can't seem to find it available on Amazon.com and on Ebay the prices seem outrageous to me. How much does this camera typically cost? Will they come onto the public market soon?
Cheers,
Martin

A:

The Carmine 1.09 is not that new as you think :D It is already gone from the market since PrimeSense was sold to Apple.
Cubify Sense seems to use the same sensor. But i didn't get it to run with OpenNI till now.
Otherwise for close range I recommend Intel RealSense, which has even better specs. ROS support works in Beta to access RGB and Depth and Interpolated PointCloud till now.
