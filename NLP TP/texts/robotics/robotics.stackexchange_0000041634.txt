Q:

Potential Python problem in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64Bit and fuerte?

Hi all,
currently I have installed a fresh Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 6 4Bit and ROS fuerte. Unfortunately I noticed several problems by using it. The most weirdest issue is given by executing the roscore which is prompting python failure messages "AttributeError("'_DummyThread' object has no attribute '_Thread__block'",)".
So if I just start the core by :
roscore

the system prompts following results:
... logging to /home/tlinder/.ros/log/c84ccda0-bc8c-11e1-986c-0024d76d2f84/roslaunch-fhg-thorsten-2827.log
Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.
Press Ctrl-C to interrupt
Done checking log file disk usage. Usage is <1GB.

started roslaunch server http://localhost:52473/
ros_comm version <unversioned>

SUMMARY
========

PARAMETERS
 * /rosdistro
 * /rosversion

NODES

auto-starting new master
Exception AttributeError: AttributeError("'_DummyThread' object has no attribute '_Thread__block'",) in <module 'threading' from '/usr/lib/python2.7/threading.pyc'> ignored
process[master]: started with pid [2852]
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311/

setting /run_id to c84ccda0-bc8c-11e1-986c-0024d76d2f84
Exception AttributeError: AttributeError("'_DummyThread' object has no attribute '_Thread__block'",) in <module 'threading' from '/usr/lib/python2.7/threading.pyc'> ignored
process[rosout-1]: started with pid [2865]
started core service [/rosout]

So as you can see, some python components are crashing and producing this errors:
Exception AttributeError: AttributeError("'_DummyThread' object has no attribute '_Thread__block'",) in <module 'threading' from '/usr/lib/python2.7/threading.pyc'> ignored

Edit1:
It seems to be a known bug of python 2.7 which is still open.

A:

A couple people have been noticing/asking about this issue (http://answers.ros.org/question/34304/exception-attributeerror-when-starting-roscore/?answer=34307#post-id-34307).
Apparently it is a Python-internal bug, which we just need to wait for the fix to be released (both tickets closed):

ROS ticket: https://code.ros.org/trac/ros/ticket/3950
Python ticket: http://bugs.python.org/issue14308

(Though, I have to wonder if it is related to any of the hiccups I've been encountering in some of the basic python tutorial/example code, e.g. tf, turtle_tf)
