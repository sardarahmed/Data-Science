Q:

Trouble importing SVG from tutorial

Hi,
I am having trouble importing the SVG file from the tutorial into gazebo recently installed on mac OSX.
When I select the SVG file from the gazebo GUI, the extracted path shows up correctly as in the tutorial, but once I click OK, it does not appear in the environment.
I have tried this with both my own SVG, and the file available on the tutorial page.
Thanks in advance if anyone can give me some pointers.

Could you run Gazebo in verbose mode and add see if it shows any error messages? If so, please add them to your question. Also mention the Gazebo version you're using.

I am running version 7.2.0 After running verbose mode, I get the error message:
[Err] [MeshManager.cc:504] GTS library not found. Can not extrude polyline

A:

Unfortunately, it looks like SVG extrusion is not working properly on OSX, see this issue.

I tried using
brew install gts
and building gazebo from source, but I still get the same error

Ah sorry, I overlooked the fact you're using OSX. I updated the answer.
