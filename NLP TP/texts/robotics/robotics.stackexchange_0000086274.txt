Q:

roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo mistake

I wrote this command in terminal:
roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch

But, this error has occurred in terminal:
[turtlebot3_world.launch] is neither a launch file in package [turtlebot3_gazebo] nor is [turtlebot3_gazebo] a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

@kuzey Welcome! I removed the part of your question mentioning that you need urgent help. Although understandable, it's considered bad form to mention deadlines as everyone here has them as well.

A:

This is a question that comes up quite often. Please do a thorough search before asking next time, or at least let us know that you've tried solutions in answers that you found and the results. You should try searching the error on Google using the following format:
<error> site:answers.ros.org

or for this problem specifically
[turtlebot3_world.launch] is neither a launch file in package [turtlebot3_gazebo] nor is [turtlebot3_gazebo] a launch file name site:answers.ros.org
