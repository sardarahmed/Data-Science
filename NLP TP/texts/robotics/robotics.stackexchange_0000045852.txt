Q:

Cannot launch node of type with joystick tutorial

I am trying to run the tutorial "joy/Tutorials/Writing/TeleopNode. I am running Ubuntu 11.10 with fuerte.  I am trying to use a Logtech Rumble Pad joystick.  Here is a copy of my launch file:
<launch>

 <!-- Turtlesim Node-->
  <node pkg="turtlesim" type="turtlesim_node" name="sim"/>

 <!-- joy node -->
  <node respawn="true" pkg="joy"
        type="joy" name="turtle_joy" >
   <param name="dev" type="string" value="/dev/input/js1" />
   <param name="deadzone" value="0.12" />
 </node>

<!-- Axes -->
 <param name="axis_linear" value="1" type="int"/>
 <param name="axis_angular" value="0" type="int"/>
 <param name="scale_linear" value="2" type="double"/>
 <param name="scale_angular" value="2" type="double"/>

 <node pkg="turtle_teleop" type="turtle_teleop_joy" name="teleop"/>

I am getting an error:
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [turtle_teleop/turtle_teleop_joy]: turtle_teleop
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/home/brent/ros_workspace
ROS path [2]=/home/brent/ros
ROS path [3]=/opt/ros/fuerte/share
ROS path [4]=/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks

Turtlesim does come up, but I am not getting any movement with my joystick.  I do get a reading from echo joy.
Any help would be appreciated,
Morpheus

A:

Looking more carefully at the tutorial I noticed last line after the launch file, "Since we built everything in package learning_joy, you may need to change the package in the last line from turtle_teleop to learning_joy." I made the change to my launch file, and everything works fine.
Thanks for your help,
