Q:

ImportError: No module named rosserial_python

While trying to run the Hello World tutorial in arduino using rosserial,i always get this error.
    File "/home/renjith/catkin_ws/src/rosserial/rosserial_python/nodes/serial_node.py", line 39, in <module>
    from rosserial_python import SerialClient, RosSerialServer
ImportError: No module named rosserial_python

I am running on ros kinetic and ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

Take a look at this asked question to see if your case is similar. Or did you correctly configure the CMakeLists.txt and package.xml to make the node track the rosserial package?

A:

I am explaing what i did and this worked for me.
Follow the procedures given in the tutorial Arduino IDE setup http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Arduino%20IDE%20Setup upto the point where you gitclone it from gitclone repository.Then instead of catkin_make type in the following command catkin_make -DCATKIN_WHITELIST_PACKAGES=rosserial followed by catkin_make install-DCATKIN_WHITELIST_PACKAGES=rosserial.Now go to  your workspace/src/rosserial where you will find 11 packages including rosserial.Now repeat the last two commands that you typed in for all of these packages like catkin_make -DCATKIN_WHITELIST_PACKAGES=rosserial_arduino and catkin_make install-DCATKIN_WHITELIST_PACKAGES=rosserial_arduino so on till catkin_make install-DCATKIN_WHITELIST_PACKAGES=rosserial_xbee.Now follow the tutorial from the point where you go to arduino sketchbook cd <sketchbook>/librariestill the end.
