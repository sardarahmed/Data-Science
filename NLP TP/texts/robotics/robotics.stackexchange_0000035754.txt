Q:

Starting the Manipulation Pipeline: self_filter.yaml

ROS Electric
Ubuntu Natty Narwhal

Hello everybody,
I'm following the tutorial Starting the Manipulation Pipeline".
When I run roslaunch pr2_tabletop_manipulation_launch pr2_tabletop_manipulation.launch I have the following error message:
error loading <rosparam> tag:<br> file does not exist [/opt/ros/electric/stacks/pr2_arm_navigation/pr2_arm_navigation_perception/config/self_filter.yaml]<br> XML is <rosparam command="load" file="$(find pr2_arm_navigation_perception)/config/self_filter.yaml"/>
Indeed self_filter.yaml does not exist in the directory.
Could someone please point me in the right direction here?
Thanks

A:

Change the file name to one of these (as per your requirement): old_self_filter.yaml ; self_filter_left.yaml ; self_filter_right.yaml. Because of frequent updates file name have been changed and tutorials that you are following may be old. If you don't have any of these files then get a fresh copy of pr2_arm_navigation.

Thanks VN, renaming one of these files worked for me.
