Q:

catkin package build error

Hi,
I am trying to build slam_gmapping in catkin workspace. I had cloned and build openslam_gmapping package but i am getting below error.
I was able to find openslam_gmapping from rospack find openslam_gmapping. I am using ros groovy
    -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-- ~~  traversing 2 packages in topological order:
-- ~~  - gmapping
-- ~~  - slam_gmapping (metapackage)
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-- +++ processing catkin package: 'gmapping'
-- ==> add_subdirectory(slam_gmapping/gmapping)
CMake Error at /opt/ros/groovy/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:72 (find_package):
  Could not find a configuration file for package openslam_gmapping.

  Set openslam_gmapping_DIR to the directory containing a CMake configuration
  file for openslam_gmapping.  The file will have one of the following names:

    openslam_gmappingConfig.cmake
    openslam_gmapping-config.cmake

Call Stack (most recent call first):
  slam_gmapping/gmapping/CMakeLists.txt:4 (find_package)

-- +++ processing catkin metapackage: 'slam_gmapping'
-- ==> add_subdirectory(slam_gmapping/slam_gmapping)
-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
Invoking "cmake" failed

Edit
Operating System - Ubuntu 12.04
openslam_gmapping cloned from https://github.com/ros-perception/openslam_gmapping
I tried apt-get install ros-groovy-openslam-gmapping but not working.
thanks.

Could You please, be more specific on details like: 1. Operating System. 2. Where did You installed it (openslam_gmapping) from sources? (it smells like an issue with not following the Catkin Workspace directory structure). 3. Did you source the setup.bash file which was created in the place you installed it to before trying to compile with it? 4. If it's Ubuntu, have You considered simply apt-get install ros-groovy-openslam-gmapping?

Do you have your catkin workspace initialized properly (see 'http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace'). Plz source setup.bash in your catkin_ws/devel folder. If you create a simple package and than a second package that depends on your first package, do they find each other?

@Wolf After doing source devel/setup.bash build is proper.

A:

Do you have your catkin workspace initialized properly (see 'http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace'). Plz source setup.bash in your catkin_ws/devel folder.
You can check your workspace being properly initialized by creating two simple packages in your workspace where one package depends on the other. If they find each other the workspace is Ok.
