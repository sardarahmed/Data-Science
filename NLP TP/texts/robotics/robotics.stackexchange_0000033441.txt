Q:

rosjava compilation error when use rosmake

Hi developers,
I have a problem when I try to execute the compilation of the sourcode from rosjava package.
It has not correct reference for libraries from org.ros.message.std_msg & org.ros.message.rosgraph_msgs

  [javac] /rosjava/src/main/java/org/ros/internal/message/new_style/MessageImpl.java:409:
  [javac] cannot find symbol  : class Char
  [javac] location: class org.ros.internal.message.new_style.MessageImpl
  [javac]   public List<Char> getCharList(String name) {
  [javac]               ^
  [javac] 

/media/DATA/ros/rosjava/rosjava/src/main/java/org/ros/internal/message/new_style/PrimitiveFieldType.java:24:

  [javac] package org.ros.message.std_msgs does not exist
  [javac] import org.ros.message.std_msgs.Char;
  [javac]                                ^
  [javac]  ....

Somebody knows what's the problem (and how to fix it)?

A:

resolved, the problem was to update from older rosjava checkout to the new rosjava_core. The script build-msg.xml check if the folder of the messages are avaliable on the ros_home path (which is different that the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH ) and if exists, not generate the new .jar files again.
The older jars have others format names, ex: roscpp.jar -> org.ros.rosjava.roscpp-0.0.0.jar
well finally I can do that my java projects can be connected with ROS ¡¡ fantastic ¡¡¡
