Q:

problem with MIT kinect demos

Hello
I have problem when trying to download the kinect demos.Actually when trying to download:
stacks/motion_planning_common/tags/unstable or /stacks/motion_planning_common/trunk/
the links that are used are unable. So i cannot rosmake or do anything else.
I want to use demos hand_interaction. Any ideas or any other similar demos???
Thanks in advance.

A:

Check this (https://)code.ros.org/trac/wg-ros-pkg/browser/stacks/motion_planning_common/trunk?rev=33669
ros.org use svn.
so use
svn checkout -r 33669 (https://)code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/stacks/
it will download many stacks including motion_planning_common
Please remove any brackets from the hyperlink
