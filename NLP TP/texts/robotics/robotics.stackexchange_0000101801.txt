Q:

effort_controller for JointGroupVelocityController

I'm not able to find this type of controller effort_controllers/JointGroupVelocityController. Does ROS have this type of controller? As far as I know there is a group of position controller for effort interface. Could anyone please confirm this?

A:

If I check GitHub, they don't seem to have JointGroupVelocityController. They do have JointGroupEffortController and JointGroupPositionController.
velocity_controllers does seem to have it. So you might want to try velocity_controllers/JointGroupVelocityController.
Also, make sure you've got ros_controllers also installed, not just ros_control.
