Q:

[autoware.auto] vehicle command topic changed for LGSVL?

I am no longer able to use joystick control in the simulator. It looks like the simulator is listening for vehicle commands on this topic:
/vehicle_cmd

But the joystick interface is now publishing them to this topic:
/lgsvl/vehicle_control_cmd

I can remap the topic, but is there a "right" way to change which control topic the sim listens to?

A:

I ended up just deleting my entire adehome directory and reinstalling everything. That fixed it.
