this problem solved for me, as i understand this topic is not exist by default, so we should write a publisher for it like this and change (~/pos_example ) to ( ~/pioneer3at/vel_cmd )and now this topic is exist in my topic list.

How do you control the robot without using ROS? I'm getting crazy figuring out how to publish to topic vel_cmd of this plugin (DiffDrivePlugin).

A:

Try using the DiffDrivePlugin, of SkidSteerPlugin.
Like so:
<plugin filename="libDiffDrivePlugin.so" name="diff_drive">
  <left_joint>left_wheel_hinge</left_joint>
  <right_joint>right_wheel_hinge</right_joint>
  <torque>5</torque>
</plugin>

Added and issue to add the plugin to the pioneer3at model(https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo_models/issue/9/add-skid-steer-plugin-to-pioneer3at-model)

Dear nkoeing, I’ve added the libDiffDrivePlugin.so to my SDF file but i got error because as i understand this plugin is not for pioneer3at robot, so I’ve added the SkidSteerDrivePlugin and i got this error, so i commented the MaxForce in SDF file and the error is solved, but I don't have vel_cmd topic until likewise.
Comment by Vahid on 2013-05-24:
the error that i mentioned in above comment is for my wrong in SDF file, the MaxForce tag is a child of plugin, i explain correct use in this link.
