Q:

Openrave compatibility with ROS

Hi everybody,
I would like to install openrave and make it work together with ROS, but I am unsure of which versions of ROS are compatible. I would like to try Hydro, as it is the latest ROS version. Is it a good idea? Has somebody done it already? Should I install Fuerte instead for which I have seen that there is compatibility and even a package that integrates Openrave in ROS? My Ubuntu version is 12.04 (precise).
Thanks in advance.
Fran.

There are some examples of ROS integration with OpenRave from Fuerte: http://wiki.ros.org/openrave
