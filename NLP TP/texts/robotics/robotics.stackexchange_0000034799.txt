Q:

Restarting Publisher

Hi!
I just want to share with you some issue I have detected and might be a bug, but probably it's just that I'm missing something. BTW, I'm using diamondback.
I have a couple of nodes: (A) publisher and (B) subscriber. Actually, I'm using image_transport publishers/subscribers. This is how to reproduce the issue given to nodes like above (of course, B subscribes to a topic that A publishes):
run A + run B + stop (Ctrl+C) A + run A
After that, B doesn't receive any msgs from A.
However, if you do:
run B + run A + stop (Ctrl+C) A + run A
it works ---and, of course, you can repeat the last two steps any number of times.
I just wonder why the first "sequence" doesn't work. Is it because it must be done the second way? ---i.e. run subscribers before publishers.
Thanks,
Enrique

I think you've just find the problem, because I'm roslaunching each node (instead of rosrunning). Now I see why I should always do roscore separately; I used to rely on the roscore automatically launched with the first launch file. Thank you!

Is roscore running continuously throughout these tests?

A:

This is a side-effect of the fact that roslaunch only starts roscore if it was not already running.
In either case, starting roscore first should eliminate the problem:

roscore + run A + run B + stop (Ctrl+C) A + run A

roscore + run B + run A + stop (Ctrl+C) A + run A
