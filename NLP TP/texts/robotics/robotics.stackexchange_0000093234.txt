Q:

trying to simulate lane change but receive change.m_TrajectoryCosts.size() Not Equal m_GeneratedRollOuts.size() error

Was trying to follow these steps on autoware 1.12 installed from source on kinetic.
The shown version did not have the equivalent options in the Compute tab but I tried to do roughly the same.

The error I receive is "m_TrajectoryCosts.size() Not Equal m_GeneratedRollOuts.size()" from /autoware.ai/src/autoware/core_planning/op_local_planner/nodes/op_trajectory_evaluator/op_trajectory_evaluator_core.cpp:TrajectoryEval::MainLoop:303
Because "m_TrajectoryCostsCalculator.m_TrajectoryCosts.size() == m_GeneratedRollOuts.size()" on row 284 is not true.

have you solve it?

No, I stopped using autoware before I resolved it. See Hatems answer, I didn't attempt it though.

A:

This is not a complete feature (just proof of concept)
the working example is on old version.
to get the same results as the video using ver 1.12.
you need to use op_global_planner + op_local_planner instead of way_planner and dp_planner.
check the tutorial https://youtu.be/BS5nLtBsXPE
also don't forget to change one flag in op_planner -> MappingHelpers.h and MappingHelpers.cpp to enable the map loader to discover the adjacent lanes.
Regards,

did you mean the 'bFindLaneChangeLanes' flag in MappingHelpers.h?
Comment by Hatem on 2020-08-06:
Yes, this will enable calling a method that search the map for adjacent lanes.
if you have lane change information in the map, you don't need this option.
