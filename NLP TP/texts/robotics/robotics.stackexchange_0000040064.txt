Q:

rosserial_python on Pandaboard - Fuerte

Hey,
I was trying to get rosserial_python to work on my Pandaboard (Ubuntu Oneiric server edition), which has ros Fuerte installed on it, but it seems to miss some kind of module. Here is the error I am getting:
  File "/home/panda/ros/rosserial/rosserial_python/nodes/serial_node.py", line 40, in <module>
    from rosserial_python import SerialClient
  File "/home/panda/ros/rosserial/rosserial_python/src/rosserial_python/__init__.py", line 1, in <module>
    from SerialClient import *
  File "/home/panda/ros/rosserial/rosserial_python/src/rosserial_python/SerialClient.py", line 42, in <module>
    from serial import *
ImportError: No module named serial

I'm sure it is an easy error, but I couldn't find the solution.
Any idea what I'm missing? Thanks in advance.

A:

You need the pySerial package. You can install it by running the following command:
sudo apt-get install python-serial

A good way to install system dependencies for ROS packages is the rosdep command. To see how to install rosdep take a look at http://answers.ros.org/question/32875/rosdep-command-not-found. You can then run something like:
rosdep install rosserial

Unfortunately, rosserial_python does not list python-serial as a dependency, so the second option won't work right now. I'll report this bug to the developers shortly.

Ah I guess I was missing that one, thanks again :) I did indeed try rosdep install but it claimed all dependencies were met.

Yeah, it was unlucky the dependency was not listed. This bug has been reported: https://kforge.ros.org/rosserial/trac/ticket/59

I have a similar issue on my raspberry pi with debian squeeze / ros fuerte.
$ rosdep install -a --os=debian:squeeze
#All required rosdeps installed successfully
$ rosdep install rosserial --os=debian:squeeze
