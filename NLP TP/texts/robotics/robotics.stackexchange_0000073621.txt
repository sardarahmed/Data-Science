Q:

change reconfiguration gui content during runtime

Hello,
is there a way to generate the content of the reconfiguration GUI during runtime? For instance a drop down list where it's content is decided after program start.
I know the variables are declared in the .cfg and I need to compile the package in order to get the according header files. But is it possible to assign a created parameter on the parameter server to, for instance a drop down list?
Thanks in advance,
Chris

A:

Take a look at http://answers.ros.org/question/211686/how-to-set-the-dynamic-reconfigure-min-max-values-programmatically/ , it does appear possible to at least spawn a configure at runtime in python, I haven't tried out adding or removing or altering elements live- the gui might need to be refreshed after each change.
