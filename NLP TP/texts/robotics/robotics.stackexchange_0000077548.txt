Q:

source .zshrc to set ROS environment don't take effect

hello all,
part of the .zshrc file as following:
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.zsh
source /home/adminyin/catkin_ws/devel/setup.zsh
source /home/adminyin/rosws/devel/setup.zsh

when source .zshrc at terminal, it does nothing
only source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.zsh or other .zsh file manually can take effect
could someone tell me what's wrong about this?
It was occured when I use qtcreator open my ROS package, but failed at the CMake execution step

➜  ~ source ./.zshrc

ROS_DISTRO=indigo
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/adminyin/rosws/src:/opt/ros/indigo/share:/opt/ros/indigo/stacks
it was over write?

A:

it was over write?

Yes. By default, setup.* files will overwrite the environment set by the previous one you sourced.
