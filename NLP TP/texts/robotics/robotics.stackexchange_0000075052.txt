Q:

Which RGB-D sensor is better with ROS packages?

While looking for specifications of Kinect and Xtion sensors, I found various versions such as Kinect Version 2, Kinect for Xbox one, Kinect for Xbox 360, Xtion Pro Live and WAVI Xtion. I wanted to know which one of these sensors is better to use especially when using them with ROS.

A:

I've only used the Xtion Pro Live and it works pretty well. I've seen a lot of people using Kinect v2 cameras, so there will be a lot of support for these. They are also higher resolution than the Xtion Pro live and the v1 so will be a bit better. I personally wouldn't buy one of the original Kinects, but it's up to you as they are pretty cheap.
If I was to buy one today I would buy a Kinect v2, because they have good resolution and a good community of support.

Also note that the original kinects needed a separate power supply; the Xtions draw enough power from USB.
