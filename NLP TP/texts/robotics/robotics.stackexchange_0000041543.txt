Q:

unable to parse urdf file

Hello everyone,
The question is extremely simple:
when I type the line (quoted):
<origin xyz="${reflect*camera_offset_x} 0 0" rpy="0 ${camera_offset_p} 0" />

the urdf is parsed, everything is great, I can visualize in rviz and when I type:
<origin xyz="${reflect*camera_offset_x} 0 0" rpy="0 ${reflect*camera_offset_p} 0" />

it doesn't work anymore..
Here, reflect can be 1 or -1 and it seems to by no problem for entering negative values for the angle offsets...
So where the hell could the problem come from?
Thanks for your time.
Yours,
Lucian

A:

I think I figured this one out:
camera_offset_p was declared as:
and if I declare it as:
which is equivalent, it works again.
Maybe someone could explain me why then?

There is no pre-defined constant M_PI in xacro as far as I know.

I already predefined M_PI as 3.1415
