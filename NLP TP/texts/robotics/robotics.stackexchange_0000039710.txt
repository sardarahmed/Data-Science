Q:

Installing Ros on unsupported platforms

Hi,
we'd like to use ROS on a particular linux distribution (Wind River Linux), which is not in the supported OS list. Is it possible to compile from scratch all that is needed and use ROS on WRL?
Thanks in advace

A:

Having never used Wind River Linux, I would say to check here for the "closest" OS and try starting there.

To add support for a new platform a patch to rosdep is the most important thing to do: http://ros.org/doc/api/rosdep2/html/developers_guide.html
