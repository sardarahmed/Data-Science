Q:

Controlling a servocity planetary motor?

I know this might sound like a stupid question, but I actually need help with this. So, I'm looking at this motor: https://www.servocity.com/2737-rpm-premium-planetary-gear-motor. 
I have a raspberry pi, and was wondering how exactly I was supposed to control this. I know that I need a motor controller to drive this thing at a reasonable speed, but I need someone to point me in the right direction as to what type of motor controller I need. Thanks!

A:

This is just a standard brushed DC motor.
What you use to control it (how you control it) depends most on your application.
The Motor Specs are: 

Voltage = 3V-12V 
Speed = 2737 rpm (12V, No Load)
Current = 0.18A  (12V, No Load) 
Current = 4.9A (12V, Stall)
Torque = 9.72 oz-in (12V, Stall)

Some things to consider from this:

If you want to run at 2737 rpm, you better make sure you have a 12V supply and a driver than can drive 12V.  If slower is fine, lower voltage would be OK,  The rpm will scale pretty linearly with the voltage
If you need to be able to support a stall condition, you should make sure the driver can support 5A (or at least as much as you supply can).
Since this is a brushed DC motor, the speed is unregulated.  The speed will result from a balance between input power (V X A) and output power (rpm X torque).  You can add a separate control loop (like using an encoder) if you want to regulate speed.  Some controllers support encoders.
I assume you want to regulate the motor's power.  If so, something has to do the PWM.  This can be done by the Pi or a separate controller.
