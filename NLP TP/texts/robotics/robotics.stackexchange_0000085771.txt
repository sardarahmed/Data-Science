Q:

catkin:command not found

Ros-kinetic Ubuntu-16.04
I used ros yesterday,but today when I input $roscore to lauch my ros environment,the system points that :
The programroscorehas not been installed.
You can use the following command to install:
sudo apt install python-roslaunch
I followed with these prompts, finally I find my catkincommond is not found,and I should install it.
But I input "catkin" in the termial ,then use "tab",there echo some commands ,but no catkin .
Is that means I already installed it?
because I use sudo apt install ros-kinetic-catkin,it tells me is the latest version.
$ catkin_

catkin_create_pkg          catkin_package_version
catkin_find                catkin_prepare_release
catkin_find_pkg            catkin_tag_changelog
catkin_generate_changelog  catkin_test_changelog
catkin_init_workspace      catkin_test_results
catkin_make                catkin_topological_order
catkin_make_isolated 

I tried to install catkin by this command sudo apt install catkin,it points I should install python-catkin-pkg first,so I did.
However,even I installed that, when I want to install catkin package, it still said I need install python-catkin-pkg.
And I do add this Environment variables
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash  to ~/.bashrc ,and I have sourced it.
The really confused thing is ! I already used it to create some workspace,and it works well!
I really do not know why I can use roscore  yesterday ,but today I can't.
Maybe I did some changes in the system,but I really don't know!
I really need help,Thanks!

A:

I rewrote my ~/.bashrc file,
added source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash to  ~/.bashrc,and sourced it .
It works.
