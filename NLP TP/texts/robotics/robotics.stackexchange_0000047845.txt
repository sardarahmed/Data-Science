A:

Basically you just need a ROS driver for you laptop camera. Fortunately there are some generic drivers like gscam or uvc_camera that you could try.

The driver rosnode publishes images (sensor_msgs/Image messages) on a particular topic, and then the code that you write subscribes to this topic to "capture" the image and perform whatever processing is needed to recognize the object.

can you suggest how to write a subscriber and a publisher for capturing image from laptop camera?

Hi there, the two listed packages include the publishers (you'd just need to point to the right device..). As far as the subscriber/client goes, take a look at http://wiki.ros.org/cv_bridge
