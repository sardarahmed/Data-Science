Q:

dynamic_reconfigure and catkin - is tutorial correct?

I tried to follow:
this tuturial
the catkin version but following these instructions give:
tompe@heyer:~/lrs_ws/src/lrs_firefly_usb$ cfg/ffcam.cfg
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "cfg/ffcam.cfg", line 10, in <module>
    gen = ParameterGenerator()
  File "/opt/ros/groovy/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/dynamic_reconfigure/parameter_generator_catkin.py", line 234, in __init__
    self.dynconfpath = sys.argv[1]  # FIXME this is awful
IndexError: list index out of range

if I just try to run the script and it does not work at all in catkin (no files generated). Replacing
from dynamic_reconfigure.parameter_generator_catkin import *

with
from dynamic_reconfigure.parameter_generator import *

works better since it at least generates the files. So is this a bug or not?

I am having problems catkinizing a dynamic_reconfigure server, too. But, in my case I only get the files generated with parameter_generator_catkin().

There is something strange going on here, and we need to get to the bottom of it.

I'm having the same problem. Removing _catkin does work via python script but does not solve the catkin_make-error.

Are there any updates for this problem?

A:

Generator scripts can't be called directly, you'll need make sure your CMakeLists.txt file contains the following line:
generate_dynamic_reconfigure_options(cfg/ffcam.cfg)

However, ParameterGenerator should output a more helpful message, I filed a ticket at https://github.com/ros/dynamic_reconfigure/issues/32
