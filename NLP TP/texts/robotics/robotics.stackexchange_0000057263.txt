Q:

Ubuntu Saucy 13.10 package repository doesn't seem to have ros-indigo-* packages, although I do see other packages like python-rosinstall

I followed the Ubuntu 13.10 Indigo installation instructions
BUT
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-desktop-full
Fails, and I can verify this by looking at this URL:
(NOTE: Not enough karma to paste this link in)
<PACKAGES.ROS.ORG>  /ros/ubuntu/dists/trusty/main/binary-amd64/Packages
and seeing that it doesn't contain any packages that match ros-indigo-*
So am I missing something?
Thanks,
Dan

A:

Indigo is in a very pre-alpha state right now, and debs have not been released yet. Beyond being unreleased, it look like desktop-full is not yet built.
You can track the built state of indigo here.
If you're really, really interested, the indigo debs that are built are available in the shadow repository.
