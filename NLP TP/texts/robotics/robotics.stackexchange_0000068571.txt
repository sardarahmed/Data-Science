Q:

Generation online 3D map from a RGB Camera

Hi!
I need to create a 3D map with an ArDrone 2.0 in real time (while the drone's still acquiring data), but its camera doesn't have a depth sensor, otherwise the RGBDSLAM would be a good choice, i guess. I've read some questions about that but didn't find a way to do it online.
I found this video about monocular SLAM but it creates a depth map only.
Is there a package that i could use to help me with that?
Any thoughts?
Thanks in advance!!

Why is the map built from LSD-SLAM not enough? The output map is point cloud.

Thanks for your response! Is this choice the better one since i need a 3D map to navigate through? I'm looking for more options to consider. (PS.: This package works for ROS indigo and fuerte, i'm using the hydro version, is that a problem?)

A:

Yeah, since you want to navigate, the map is quite important.
tum_ardrone is a good starting point, but instead of PTAM, you can try ORB SLAM. ORB SLAM works for ROS Hydro, so it might be a good choice.

Unfortunately the probabilistic semi-dense mapping module isn't available for ORB SLAM yet, so i don't know a way to create the 3D map with this package, i'm testing LSD SLAM instead.

Yeah, but the navigation part might not be easy. Have fun!
