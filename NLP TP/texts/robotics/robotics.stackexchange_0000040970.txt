Q:

Unscented Kalman Filter - Bayes++

Hey,
Does anybody have any experience how to include UKF from Bayes++ into ROS.
I can't get it to build.
I'm constantly getting errors like:
...Bayes++/BayesFilter/bayesFlt.hpp:588: undefined reference to `VTT for Bayesian_filter::Unscented_scheme'

Any tips are welcome.

A:

I made a port of Bayes++ to ROS, it's not finished but you could give it a try.
https://github.com/miquelmassot/bayes_filter_ros
what I did in order to build it was to create a ROS package and, in the CMakelists add

//Set the dependencies of Bayes++

rosbuild_add_boost_directories()

SET(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "-msse3")

//Source the files from Bayes++ and compile the library

rosbuild_add_library(BayesFilter external_libs/include/BayesFilter/bayesFlt.cpp
external_libs/include/BayesFilter/bayesFltAlg.cpp
external_libs/include/BayesFilter/CIFlt.cpp
external_libs/include/BayesFilter/covFlt.cpp
external_libs/include/BayesFilter/infFlt.cpp
external_libs/include/BayesFilter/infRtFlt.cpp
external_libs/include/BayesFilter/itrFlt.cpp
external_libs/include/BayesFilter/matSup.cpp
external_libs/include/BayesFilter/SIRFlt.cpp
external_libs/include/BayesFilter/UDFlt.cpp
external_libs/include/BayesFilter/UdU.cpp
external_libs/include/BayesFilter/unsFlt.cpp
external_libs/include/BayesFilter/bayesFlt.cpp)

it builds a "libBayesFilter.so" that you can later use.
