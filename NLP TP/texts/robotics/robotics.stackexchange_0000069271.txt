Q:

Rostopic node in launch files

I'm trying to add a rostopic -pub node into a launch file, but I don't know what I have to put in the launch file command line.
I guess this has to be the structure:
<node pkg="rostopic" type="pub" name="arbitrary_name" args=" /pkg_topic pkg_executable_file/message" output="screen"/>
Thank you for your comments.

A:

Actually the binary, i.e., type is also rostopic. The pub is just an argument passed to that. So, if you just move the pub to args, it should work:
<node pkg="rostopic" type="rostopic" name="arbitrary_name" args="pub /pkg_topic pkg_executable_file/message" output="screen"/>

one example could also be args="pub /my_controller/command std_msgs/Float64 50". In this case I am publishing an std_msgs/Float64 with data = 50 to topic /my_controller/command even though I didn't type data
