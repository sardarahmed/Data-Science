Q:

What is up with the PointCloud msg type?

There was ROS, with PointCloud, then they added PointCloud2 which I don't understand why add a version number into a single message, it's not been done for other ones. Now we have ROS2, and I would assume we have PointCloud? But it seems it is still PointCloud2? Wasn't the switch to ROS2 a chance to leave the version number out of the messages? So is the normal pointcloud type in ROS2 PointCloud2? As it was in ROS?

A:

PointCloud2 is the recommended format for a long time. (Over a decade)
The new name was chosen and the old message kept around to not break existing users.
Switching the name between ROS 1 and ROS 2 would be possible, but that would cause extra pain when migrating code. PointCloud2 has long been the name and the consistency and stability are much more valuable than the "cleanliness" of renaming it. Especially if we were to rename it to an already existing definition.
We've officially decided to remove it in future releases in the Foxy API review:
