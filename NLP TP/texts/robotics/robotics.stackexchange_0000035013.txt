Q:

Running ROSJAVA as a thread in a larger app

How might the ROSJAVA talker example be spawned as a separate thread since it must be passed the NodeConfiguration at startup? I get an error stating that I cannot cast my main file to org.ros.node.NodeMain.

A:

I figured it out. I have to implement NodeMain in the main java file, save the passed NodeConfiguration to a global volatile, and read it from the runnable() which contains the RosNode. I am sure there is a better way of doing it (such as simply passing the NodeConfiguration to the run() method) but this works for now. If I run into problems with it, I will post an update.
