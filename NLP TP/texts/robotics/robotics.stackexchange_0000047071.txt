Q:

How can I use catkin package resources with the devel space?

I'm having trouble using package resources from the devel space of a catkin workspace.  After I successfully run catkin_make, I have new build and devel folders.  If I source ws/devel/setup.bash, I can then run binaries and use libraries, scripts, etc as I'd expect.  But what about package-relative resources?
First question: How to I specify these resources in the package's CMakeLists.txt?  I wasn't able to find any examples in the docs.  Here's what I've been doing:

$ cat ws/source/path/to/my_package/CMakeLists.txt
...
install(
  DIRECTORY my_resources DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_SHARE_DESTINATION}
)
...

(but of course this isn't used for the devel space, right?)
Second question: How do I find these resources if I'm using the devel space?
My first try was rospack.  Here's the result:

$ rospack find my_package
ws/build/path/to/my_package/catkin_generated/stamps/my_package

This location doesn't hold any resources (copies or links to the source space).  (Or should it?)
I also stumbled upon catkin_find.  Here's the result:

$ catkin_find my_package
ws/devel/share/my_package
ws/source/path/to/my_package

I suppose the second one is what I want?  Is this always the right thing to do?
Sidenote: It appears through some magic that roslaunch knows where to look for launch files (or does it search everything in the catkin_find list?).

A:

You are right that things listed in CMakeLists.txt with an install(...) macro does not automatically get moved into the devel space.
catkin_find can help you, it takes more arguments, like:
$ catkin_find roscpp package.xml
$ catkin_find roscpp srv/Empty.srv

It will search folders in a specific order to find what you look for. catkin_find is based on the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH and the contents of a file called .catkin in your devel space.
Not sure whether there is a cleaner way to refer to other packages (cmake, python).

Fantastic! This was just what I needed.  This was difficult to find because the catkin_find usage message uses the word "project", whereas it would make more sense to me (as a ROS user, not a cakin dev) if it were the word "package" instead.
