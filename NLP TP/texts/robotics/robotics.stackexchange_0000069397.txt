A:

it looks like the code takes this into account
Source file is here https://github.com/ros-drivers/um7/blob/indigo-devel/src/main.cpp
// IMU outputs [w,x,y,z], convert to [x,y,z,w] & transform to ROS axes
    imu_msg.orientation.x =  r.quat.get_scaled(1);
    imu_msg.orientation.y = -r.quat.get_scaled(2);
    imu_msg.orientation.z = -r.quat.get_scaled(3);
    imu_msg.orientation.w = r.quat.get_scaled(0);

so looks like you put it with the x pointing forwards from the robot, fixing the device so the it looks the right way up from its packaging - the code flips the values round to match right hand rule.

I would expect that to be correct - the test now is to run the node and check the values you get make sense and change in the way you would expect to if you change the robots orientation.
