Q:

Installing ROS on windows 7

Hello everyone,
Can anyone help me with a ROS Electric installation on a windows machine. Ideally I'd love to do it on ubuntu but the PC doesn't belong to me so I can't change the platform.
I've read the tutorial on the website here but it takes to many huge leaps in the build chain and I'm afraid my programming skills aren't up to it yet.
I'm using Visual studio 2010 and I have the final aim of doing a RGBD-SLAM with the ASUS Pro Live.
Cheers!

Thanks I'll try Fuete. Is there any chance someone could provide a short guide on how to get going, the instructions on ROS are really vague.

If you make it work, please post a tutorial. I guess there would be many people interested in that.

If you could elucidate what is confusing or difficult in the instructions for fuerte, please do so. I'll endeavour to update the information.

Did you have any luck on this project? I was looking at doing the same thing with the Asus Xtion on Win7.

A:

If you can use Fuerte, there is experimental Windows support already. Have a look here.
