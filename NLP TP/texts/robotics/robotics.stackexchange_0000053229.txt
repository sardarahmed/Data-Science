Q:

Gmapping with Windows OS

Hi,
Has anyone tried the slam_gmapping package with Windows OS (particularly Windows 7 64-bit). I am interested to run the Gmapping algorithm in Windows instead of Linux. In my project, I use LabVIEW (in Windows) as the programming language and it turns out that I need to apply the Gmapping algorithm.
Has anyone has any experience in using the slam_gmapping package with other programming language? Any comments and suggestions are much appreciated.

A:

There is a toolkit for labview:

But you are making it yourself very difficult as a beginner to use ROS on Windows. If you just want to recreate the gmapping algorithm you should read the paper about it and implement it yourself.

Please see my answer above. I think recreating the Gmapping algorithm would take plenty of time considering I need to fully understand the algorithm and carefully rewriting the code. I prefer to use the same code but this may mean that I need to write a wrapper for Gmapping or ROS's slam_gmapping.
