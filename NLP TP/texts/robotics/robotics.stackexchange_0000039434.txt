Q:

what should be done to keep PR2 stationary on a ramp?

Hello all,
In Gazebo simulation, the PR2 goes down a ramp due to gravity ; I assume the wheel base controller still applies 0 velocity for the wheels.
How should I keep PR2 stationary? What changes should be made in the base controller, URDF, transmission?
Thanks in advance.
CS

if the command velocity is applied continuously, PR2 will move on the ramp but why can't I stop it on the ramp? any suggestions please.

actually my original question is to move a custom robot on a terrain. But, first I tried moving it on a ramp. and it just goes down due to gravity and it is same with the PR2 on a ramp. I hope someone who has worked on robots on a terrain could help me. Thanks.

The PR2 does this in real life too. On the real PR2, turning the casters sideways usually stops it, but it's unstable.
