Q:

pcl (pointcloud) to mesh

Hi, I want to convert pointcloud data set to mesh. What I know is that first I need to convert pointcloud recorded in a rosbag to pcd, then pcd to ply, and finally ply to mesh using MeshLab.
I can create number of pcd files from pointcloud using
rosrun pcl_ros bag_to_pcd <input_file.bag> <topic> <output_directory>

but I have no idea how to convert pcd files to a ply file. Can anyone suggest me how to do pcd to ply or if there is a better way to convert pcl to mesh?
Thank you.

A:

I suggest using the pcl_converter tool that I have committed recently, it allows to convert between multiple formats easily:
Available formats types for SOURCE and DEST:
           OBJ (Wavefront)
           PCD (Point Cloud Library)
           PLY (Polygon File Format)
           STL (STereoLithography)
           VTK (The Visualization Toolkit)

As for the creation of a mesh starting from a point cloud, this is not a conversion but rather a creation.
The process of connecting points of a point cloud by faces is called triangulation, mesh reconstruction, meshing.
You will find more information in the PCL tutorials, greedy triangulation is a good start.
