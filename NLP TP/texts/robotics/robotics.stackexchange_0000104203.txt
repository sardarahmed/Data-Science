Q:

Can TEB or Other Local Planners Work Without move_base?

I am working on path planning and path tracking for a while and I wonder, can TEB local planner (or any other local planner on ROS, DWA lets say) function without move_base?
I mean do I have to use move_base/nav_stack if I want to develop a good and complex local planner like TEB? If not, why everyone integrates their planners as plug-ins to move_base?

A:

People integrate into move_base for software engineering reasons: move_base provides a convenient common interface and integration with local/global planning, goal management, failure recovery, and command velocity calculations. You certainly could write your own code to wrap your planner in the same way as move_base, but why would you when there is already a widely used and supported system for it?
I think you may be partly assuming that a planner is capable of moving the robot. It isn't: a planner (such as TEB) simply plans. You then need to interpret that path as a series of commands to be sent to the robot. move_base handles this (in addition to the other nice-to-have features like failure recovery).
