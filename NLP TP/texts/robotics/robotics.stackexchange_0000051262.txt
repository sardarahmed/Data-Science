Q:

SLAM with pcl data?

As of now I am using pcl (3 coordinates to specify a point in space) for obstacle avoidance and it seems to work fine. I wish to know that without converting pcl to laser (pointcloud_to_laserscan package) can I develop SLAM ? I am not entirely sure about developing a 2D map with 3D data, any help or suggestions ?

A:

Hi,
The package ethzasl_icp_mapping might be the one you need. Then you could use this package octopmap_server to get a projected 2D occupancy grid by passing it the registered point cloud from ethzasl_icp_mapping
