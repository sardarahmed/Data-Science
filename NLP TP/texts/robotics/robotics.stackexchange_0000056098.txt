Hey,
We were in need of this model as well and started converting it to gazebo ourselves.
You can do it yourself, following this tutorial:

Basically, you need to add  tags to all links. You need a little knowledge on urdf and xacro:

You'll also want to represent the finger's underactuation somehow. A Gazebo plugin would be an option. You would have to determine the efforts for each finger phalanx based on their current state, the actuator effort, and the contact forces.

Have you managed to convert it to gazebo?
