Q:

meta forum for ROS answers?

Recent discussions on ros-users showed that ROS Answers is ... Hmm, let's say ... That there is room for improvement. :-)
For this reason there are "meta forums" for stack exchange Q&A's, where people are discussing the usage of the Q&A forum itself.
Example:
http://robotics.stackexchange.com/
http://meta.robotics.stackexchange.com/
In order to not spam the normal ROS-related Q&As with forum-related/AskBot-related questions, I'd like to suggest to implement a meta forum for ROS Answers.
What do you think?
PS: There is a related question on AskBot, but unfortunately no answer to it: http://askbot.org/en/question/6797/hosted-meta-site-linked-to-main-site/

Hi, Marcus. Isn't ros-users mailing list is a some sort of "meta-site" already?
Comment by bit-pirate on 2013-02-27:
Just found out, that we are making use of GitHub issues for answers.ros.org (see here). Altthough I like this approach, we should clearly state somewhere, which questions/problems should be asked where (answers.ros.org, ros-users, GitHub)!

A:

Recent dicussions on ros-users sho that ros-users is a satisfactory place to discuss such things. Adding more places just makes it harder to track dicussions. We can handle some small surplus of meta questions and discussions both here and on ros-users currently.

Personally, I agree with your (and @Boris) point of view. However, there have also been comments about ros-users being "high bandwidth" and other comments indicating it being too lively for some. Hence, I decided to ask this questions here.

If more users agree with this point of view (i.e. upvotes/comments), we should clearly state somewhere, where users should ask questions and place request about ros answers, e.g. Get Involved page).

the answers.ros.org tag could serve as a meta tag
