Q:

Object recognition kitchen - linemod

Hi,
i have installed the linemod package. Now i want to recognize an object (i already have a 3d mesh of it). How do i do that?
On http://wg-perception.github.io/linemod/index.html#line-mod it is said that i need an automatic view generator in order to convert my mesh into a *.bag file which i then can upload into the database via object_recognition_capture upload command.
Where do i get this automatic view generator from?
