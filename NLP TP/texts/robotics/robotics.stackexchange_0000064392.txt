Q:

(About roseus) How can I know about member functions and keyword arguments?

Hello,
I have a question about roseus.
In a sample program, there are arguments like
(ros::roseus ... )
(ros::advertise-service ... )
But how can  I get the information about the member functions (and keyword arguments) ?
Or where are these defined ?
This is the example of the sample program.
#!/usr/bin/env roseus

(ros::load-ros-manifest "roseus")
(ros::roseus "talker")
(ros::advertise "chatter" std_msgs::string 1)
(ros::rate 100)
(while (ros::ok)
  (setq msg (instance std_msgs::string :init))
  (send msg :data (format nil "hello world ~a" (send (ros::time-now) :sec-nsec)))
  (ros::ros-info "msg [~A]" (send msg :data))
  (ros::publish "chatter" msg)
  (ros::sleep)
)
(ros::roseus "shutdown")
(exit)
