Q:

I find kinect depth fomula, Is it right? modified Question

Hi. I find kinect depth fomulas.
But, I'm wondering how to know relationship of depth value using OpenNi?
In libfreenect, this formulas

float dist =100/(-0.0030711016*rawdisparity + 3.3309495161);
//ros distance (cm)

float dist2 = 12.36 * tanf(rawdisparity/ 2842.5 + 1.1863);
//St√©phane Magnenat distance (cm)

Can I use the fomulas in OpenNi?
At (http://www.ros.org/wiki/kinect_calibration/technical)
There is the depth fomula
z = b*f / (1/8 * (doff - kd))
Is the same true for the OpenNi driver?
Can you talk to me how to get the depth relation?
I'm using ubuntu and OpenNi driver.
I saw the disparity has 11-bit value.
So disparity range is 0-2047.
If it is true, any disparity makes the formula's denominator zero(0).
Then, the formula is infinity.
How did this happen?
Disparity 11bit, is it right??

Hi,
If you are using OpenNI, then your Kinect should also be publishing on a topic called /camera/depth/image_raw. The images published on this topic are already calculated to real world depth with taking the Kinect as the origin. You shouldn't be needing a formula to calculate this on your own.
Hope this helps.
