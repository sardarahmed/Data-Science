Q:

Realsense SR300 depth streaming

Hi all,
anyone can get the depth stream from this 3D camera over ROS?
For me it works perfect using the original Intel library tools/example, but in ROS i just can get the RGB stream using this package https://github.com/BlazingForests/realsense_camera 
Im using ROS indigo on Ubuntu 14.04.4 4.2 kernel  Thank you.
