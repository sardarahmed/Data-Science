Q:

Standalone Gazebo crashes on startup

Following NKoenig's advice from here, I tried to install standalone Gazebo (using these instructions).
The version of gazebo that comes with ROS works fine, but the standalone crashes:
When I run "gazebo" from the command line, I get
Gazebo multi-robot simulator, version 1.3.1

Msg Waiting for master.Msg Waiting for master

It starts to load. Instead of the usual "world", I see a black square. After waiting a couple more minutes, I see a white sky appear.  Waiting a little while longer, I see the usual cloud background. Then the program crashes with no error messages.
Sometimes it crashes earlier and I get this message:
Qt has caught an exception thrown from an event handler. Throwing
exceptions from an event handler is not supported in Qt. You must
reimplement QApplication::notify() and catch all exceptions there.

terminate called after throwing an instance of 'Ogre::InvalidParametersException'
  what():  OGRE EXCEPTION(2:InvalidParametersException): All framebuffer formats with this texture internal format unsupported in GLFrameBufferObject::initialise at /tmp/buildd/ros-fuerte-visualization-common-1.8.4/debian/ros-fuerte-visualization-common/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/visualization_common/ogre/build/ogre_src_v1-7-3/RenderSystems/GL/src/OgreGLFrameBufferObject.cpp (line 276)

Also noteworthy: starting Gazebo with "sudo gazebo" gives:
gazebo: error while loading shared libraries: liburdfdom_model.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Things I've tried:

Uninstalling and reinstalling.
Running as root
Uninstalling ROS using apt-get --purge remove ros-*  and reinstalling Gazebo.

I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 with the proprietary NVIDIA drivers for my NVIDIA Corporation NV45GL [Quadro FX 3400/4400] graphics card.

A:

Solution: Install 64 bit Ubuntu rather than 32 bit Ubuntu.  Though, it runs much much slower than the ROS versions of Gazebo do.
