Q:

Using rosbag with rosjava

Hello everyone,
I'm using the latest software for java and rosjava and after searching for a few hours, I couldn't find any api information on how to use rosbag from rosjava. Specifically, writing and reading to and from a bag file. Is this possible?
Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks,
Blair

A:

rosjava doesn't provide that functionality. However, the rosbag file format is documented here so it shouldn't be too hard to implement a rosbag java library.
