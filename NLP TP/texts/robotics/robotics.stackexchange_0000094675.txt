Q:

Trying to do sudo rosdep init and getting the below error

Following the tutorial http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu to install ROS Melodic
I'm using Ubuntu 18.04 on x86_64.
I had Ubuntu 16.04 with ROS Kinetic previously. I removed ROS Kinetic from Ubuntu 16.04. Upgraded from Ubuntu 16.04 to Ubuntu 18.04 and then trying to install ROS melodic.
Error:
sudo: unable to execute /usr/local/bin/rosdep: No such file or directory

A:

The fix was very simple, I went to the /usr/local/bin and removed everything related to ROS and Catkin. That resolved my issue. The next time when I installed ros-melodic and did rosdep init, I saw the rosdep files in usr/bin/ and everything worked smooth from there.
