Q:

How to connect VLP-16 velodyne to indigo?

Under Ubuntu 14.04, indigo,
My situation now is:
      sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.77

(in new ternimal)
      roscore    

(in new terminal)
      cd ./catkin_ws  
  source devel/setup.bash
  roslaunch velodyne_pontcloud VLP16_points.launch

in new terminal:
 rostopic echo /velodyne_points     However, there is no data printed.
 rostopic echo /velodyne_packets   It is said:"Cannot load message class for [velodyne_msgs/VelodyneScan]. Are your mess ages bulit?"

Whether I powered and connected the lidar to my computer or not, there seems to be no difference in the results above.
I think this means the velodyne lidar wasn't connected to linux OS. Is it true?
Therefore, how to connect VLP-16 velodyne to indigo?  How to connect the lidar with my computer through the ethernet?
I only need to power the lidar and connect the lidar to my computer by the Ethernet line, and I don't need to do anything else? For example, I need to turn off wifi or change some network settings in my linux system?

A:

Your error message has nothing to do with connectivity to the velodyne. It means that rostopic echo does not know about the velodyne_msgs/VelodyneScan datatype. And this is likely because it's in your workspace. However in your 2nd terminal you have not source the setup file. Try running
cd ./catkin_ws  
source devel/setup.bash

before you try to echo.
I'd recommend reviewing the catkin tutorials especially: http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/using_a_workspace

It doesn't make any difference. Still no data is published
