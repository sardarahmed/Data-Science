Q:

"The specified base path "/home/rui/catkin_ws" contains a package but "catkin_make" must be invoked in the root of workspace" how can I fix it?

A:

It seems like you have a problem with your workspace structure.
As the message tells, you should run catkin_make in workspace root folder. Your workspace should have a tree like this:
/home
  /rui
    /catkin_ws
      /build
      /devel
      /src
         /your_ros_package
         /your_other_rospackage

And in this tree you should run catkin_make in catkin_ws folder.
If problem persists you can try recreating your workspace following the guide: http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace
