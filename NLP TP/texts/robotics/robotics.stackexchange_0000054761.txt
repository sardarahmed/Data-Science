Is it possible to send a message in one computer using ROS FUERTE and listen to in a another computer using ROS HYDRO?

A:

Yes, it is even possible to have some nodes running in a fuerte environment and some in a hydro environment on the same computer, provided you properly setup environments in different terminals or screens. Note that message formats have to be the same across ROS versions for this to work, though.

@Stefan Kohlbrecher thanks im new in ROS so i have some questions, if i just installed ROS fuerte on my computer and want to install now hydro what should i do to make this cross messaging work?  What important environment setups do i have to change or be careful to make this work? Thanks for the responce

Typically, you add some a setup script to your .bashrc file as described here: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment You switch between ros versions by simply changing what is stated in your .bashrc file. Note that it is always read when you open a new terminal.

@Stefan Kohlbrecher so if I start the first terminal with fuerte then change the bashrc  open another terminal this new one will be using hydro?  Does it matter with which one i run roscore?

Yes, that's the  quickest way of doing it. You could also create some scripts for quickly switching on the command line. I always use the roscore of the newer ros version, but both variants should work I think.

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
ros-hydro-desktop-full : Depends: ros-hydro-desktop but it is not going to be installed
Depends: ros-hydro-mobile but it is not going to be installed
Depends: ros-hydro-perception but it is not going to be installed
Depends: ros-hydro-simulators but it is not going to be installed

Add the sources correctly.
Also, @Stefan Kohlbrecher, is there any recommended practice for splitting nodes between hydro and fuerte?
Thank you.

YouÂ´ll want to have two different workspaces for the packages belonging to the different ROS distros and then you only have to take care to only source the corresponding setup files correctly (especially to not mix hydro and fuerte ROS_PACKAGE_PATH etc.).
