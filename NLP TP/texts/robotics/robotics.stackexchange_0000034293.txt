Q:

rosserial debs for rosserial_arduino

I am installing rosserial to use with an arduino and in the setup page, it has the cryptic lines:
"If you installed rosserial from debs, all you have to do is copy the rosserial_arduino/libraries directory into your Arduino sketchbook. After restarting your IDE, you should see ros_lib listed under examples."
How do you get the rosserial debs?
It goes on to say how to install from source, but I'd prefer to use debs if I can find them.

A:

If you have already setup your ROS system following these instructions, you just have to:
sudo apt-get install ros-electric-rosserial

Thanks!  Is that documented somewhere?  I added it to the wiki page.
