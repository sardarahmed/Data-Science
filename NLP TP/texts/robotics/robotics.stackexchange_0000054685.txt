Q:

Sync problem related to viso2

Hi All.
I'm trying to setup and run Viso2 node in ros fuerte. I have a problem related to a sync warning in gscam, so I asked this question:http://answers.ros.org/question/84611/synchronized-problem-related-to-calibration/
When I updated the code version of GSCAM, I could see the rectify image when I used the image_view node.
But my problem now is when I tried  to Subscribed that topic (Image_rect) to Viso2 node, It show again the sync msg (warning message), this following  message:
[WARN] [1381282007.181977693]: [
image_transport] Topics '/Dava/image_rect_color' and '/Dava/camera_info' do not appear to be synchronized. In the last 10s:
Image messages received:      100

CameraInfo messages received: 0

Synchronized pairs:           0

And when I used the command "rostop echo /mono_odometer/info" I don't see anything.
So I don't know if the problem is with my viso2 configuration or is a problem with GSCAM.
I attached the output, my camera calibration info (From rostopic echo) and rxgraph output.
And you can download my lauch file in this link (): https://mega.co.nz/#!W9pkkD5Q!NcRUbm0drgoKXXoli6rHDGUKEHBebpktfsO4Wd2tDas
I will appreciate any respond . Thank

A:

Please make sure your remappings are setup right. From your rxgraph output it looks like the mono_odometer is only subscribed to the image_rect topic and not to the camera_info topic.
Using rosnode info mono_odometer you can have a quick look at the topic connections.
image_proc is designed to run in the camera's namespace:
<node pkg="image_proc" type="image_proc" name="image_proc" ns="/Dava/camera" />

This way you have all camera-related topics together:
  /Dava/camera/image_raw
  /Dava/camera/camera_info
  /Dava/camera/image_rect
  /Dava/camera/image_mono
  ...

Hope that helps!
