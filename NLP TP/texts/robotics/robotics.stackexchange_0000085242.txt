Q:

How to setup Intelisense on VS Code for ROS C++

#include "ros/ros.h" is even underlined in green. I have this added to the c_cpp_properties.json file. I also installed the ROS extension (which I'm not sure does anything).
{
    "configurations": [
        {
            "browse": {
                "databaseFilename": "",
                "limitSymbolsToIncludedHeaders": true,
                "path": [
                    "/home/ben/workspaces/ROS/cir-kit/devel/include",
                    "/opt/ros/kinetic/include",
                    "/home/ben/workspaces/ROS/ackermann/src/twist_to_ackermann-1/include",
                    "/usr/include"
                ]
            },
            "includePath": [
                "/home/ben/workspaces/ROS/cir-kit/devel/include",
                "/opt/ros/kinetic/include",
                "/home/ben/workspaces/ROS/ackermann/src/twist_to_ackermann-1/include",
                "/usr/include",
                "/usr/include/c++/5",
                "/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/c++/5",
                "/usr/include/linux",
                "/opt/ros/kinetic/include/ros",
                "/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu"
            ],
            "name": "Linux",
            "intelliSenseMode": "clang-x64"
        }
    ],
    "version": 3
}

When I hover over top of the include, it gives me an error:
#include errors detected. Please update your includePath. IntelliSense features for this translation unit (/home/ben/workspaces/ROS/ackermann/src/twist_to_ackermann-1/src/twist_to_ackermann.cpp) will be provided by the Tag Parser.
cannot open source file "x86intrin.h" (dependency of "ros/ros.h")

Everything else ROS works... This in Ubuntu 16.04 and ROS Kinetic.

I meet the same problem. I find "x86intrin.h" in /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/5/include. Add this path to c_cpp_properties.json and #include "ros/ros.h" is OK.

Have you solved this problem ?

There are suggested answers to this problem under another question.

A:

It's probably doable to set this up manually, but I would recommend to take a look at wiki/IDEs - Visual Studio Code (VSCode). It has a link to an extension that should take care of all of this for you.

"The extension does not require additional configuration" is the biggest lie ever!

Thanks for the feedback.
It would be more valuable if you could give your feedback to Microsoft, on their issue tracker.
Your comment here will most likely not be read by many people.

As Samarth mentioned in his answer, this blog post really helps getting it setup correctly.
