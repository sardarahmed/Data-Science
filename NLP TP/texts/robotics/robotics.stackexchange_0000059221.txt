Q:

logging to file and screen

Is there a way to enable logging of a node to both file and screen? And why does setting output="screen" disable logging to file?
I would like to see log messages at runtime on the screen, but still be able to recheck log messages at a later stage without having to copy/paste my terminal screens to a file.
I suppose I could use rqt_console to see the log messages at runtime, but as I understand that would put more strain on my network and I already have timing issues as it is without overloading my network with debug messages.
Thanks in advance

A:

This sounds like a bug (or a feature) in how roslaunch is implementing output to screen. I would file it against the ros_comm issue tracker: https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/issues

I'm not sure if we have to distinguish between roslaunch log and a node's log. Roslaunch seems to log always to a file, but only startup/shutdown messages. The node itself however doesn't log to a file when output="screen". But I will follow your advice and create an issue and see about the response

https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/issues/409 is tracking this issue, it is still open in need of a PR.
