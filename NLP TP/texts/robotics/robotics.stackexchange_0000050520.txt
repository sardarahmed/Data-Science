Q:

Running two different cameras from uvc_camera driver?

Hi,
I have a whole robotic system in which I have a camera mounted on a robotic arm.
One more camera is mounted on the top of a frame from which I can see my whole robotic system.
How can I start two cameras from just one camera driver?
I have been able to start the two cameras with two different drivers.One was uvc_camera and the other one was gscam.
Please let me know
thanks a lot

A:

You can do that by starting two different instances of uvc_camera under different node name or probably under different namespace and in parameters just change the device name.
