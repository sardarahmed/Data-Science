Q:

mouse movement causes Gazebo death

I repost this from the DRC web site. I have had the same problem, and avoid moving my mouse over the Gazebo window as much as possible.
I realize this sounds like a totally bogus bug report and I am engaging in voodoo computer science, but there is no core dump or other evidence I can provide. Perhaps an instrumented version of Gazebo could be created that reports more information about why it quits or crashes.

I have tried installed the DRC Simulator using these installation instructions: http://gazebosim.org/wiki/InstallDRC
However, the simulator keeps crashing. It seems to happen mostly when hovering over the control menu (with the rotation controls, for instance) although not exclusively.
The terminal shows: "Warning [gazebo_main.cc:57] escalating to SIGKILL on server"
Originally I thought it might be a problem with nVidia drivers although it seems to happen on non-nVidia cards as well.

I have observed this issue as well, but only when running the basic Gazebo v1.2.x.  If you run the full DRCSim package including the ROS libraries, I believe this may not be as significant of a problem.  But the OSRF team can answer better than I.

A:

That sounds like bug #119.  We believe that it was fixed in pull request #59.  That fix will be included in a near-term patch release.
