Q:

Use Sony PSP to control and visualize a robot running ROS?

With the launch of Steam Deck ($399), I saw some roboticists thinking about using them to control, visualize sensor data, maps, and other cool stuff. I was wondering if maybe a Sony PSP could do the same job, but with a lower price point, around $150.
Has anyone tried that yet or something similar?

This is interesting and great low cost solution. Do you have a link for examples of using Steam Deck for robotics application, couldn't find it. Sorry it's not answer to your question, but definitely cool idea.

I don't have any examples from steam deck (I think the delivery got delayed). My inspiration came from Boston Dynamics Spot Mini controller and Clear Path Teleoperation Package device. It would be nice to control the robot using the joystick while watching the map being created on the screen...

I've seen someone use a Nintendo Switch.
