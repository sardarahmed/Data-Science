Q:

laser_scan_matcher always diverges

I installed laser_scan_matcher and run the demo bag along with the demo.launch. The laser pose directly starts jumping around and goes totally instable. Same happens with the demo_gmapping.launch.
Am I missing something?

A:

I was playing the bag and then launching demo.launch. Did not notice that demo.launch also plays the bag file, which has led to inconsistency.
