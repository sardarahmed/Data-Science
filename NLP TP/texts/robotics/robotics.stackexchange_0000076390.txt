Q:

but_velodyne with VLP16

The but_velodyne wiki states that the package has been tested only with Velodyne HDL-32E. I am wondering if anyone has tried using the package with VLP16 or is aware of a reason why it would not work with VLP16?
I am looking for ways to colorize point cloud generated by VLP16 and am starting to investigate if but_calibration_camera_velodyne can do that. Has anyone used this node to colorize point clouds? What were the results?

A:

I have not used but_velodyne, and don't know whether VLP-16 support has been added. That device returns data in a slightly different format, so it won't work automatically.
The velodyne driver in ros-drivers does support the VLP-16, if you build it from source.
