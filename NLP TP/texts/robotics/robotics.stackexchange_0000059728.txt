Q:

Simulate urban city roads

Hello I wanted to simulate a busy urban road,similar to Darpa Urban Challenge for an autonomous self-driving-car. I'm in search of simulators for that.
I've seen gazebo since its integration with ROS is easier but editing world files or indeed creating them itself is difficult. In torcs simulator I have seen many world files but not many sensors. I don't want much physics in my simulation. I want a light weight simulator(for checking out path planning on an urban road) and in which creating roads are easier.
I've even searched for gazebo sdf files similar to urban city but in vain.

A:

I´m not sure about other simulators, but here are some Gazebo-related links that might be useful:

As described in the
animate_pose
tutorial, you can animate objects
without using the physics engine. If
you have a model of one or multiple
cars, it should be possible to let
them move using this mechanism.
There has been some work on importing
Open Street Map data into Gazebo,
code
here.
I´m not sure how mature and finished
this is, though.
The driving scenario from the VRC
competition as visible in this
video
is available as part of
drcsim
(vrc_task_1.world) and might be
useful to look at.

That was great .. Thank you but Is there an easier way to create a world like that in gazebo?

Great, importing OSM into Gazebo sounds interesting. Thanks for tip ;)
