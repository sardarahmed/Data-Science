Q:

rosserial and hidraw devices?

Hello,
I used rosserial_python to send data from my robot to my Raspberry Pi with a Bluetooth dongle but now, I want to use a 2.4 GHz WiFi dongle. The device, when I type ls /dev, appears as hidraw2.
When I try rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/hidraw2,
I have this error : [ERROR] [....]: Error opening serial: COuld not configure port: (22, 'Invalid argument')
Can't I use this WiFi Dongle ?

A:

Well .. a hidraw device is not a serial port. rosserial works with serial ports by default. As you can see from the error, it's trying to initialise your hidraw device as-if it were a serial port, but fails (expectedly I'd say).
You'll either have to somehow make the hidraw device pretend it's a serial port, or extend rosserial to be able to work with your specific device.
