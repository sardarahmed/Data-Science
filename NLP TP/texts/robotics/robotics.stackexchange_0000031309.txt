Q:

How to plot in 3D using rxplot

I try to plot in 3D using "rxplot -M 3d". Here are the steps I do:

roscore
rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node
rosrun turtlesim turtle_teleop_key
rxplot -M 3d /turtle1/pose/x /turtle1/pose/y

rxplot gives the following error:

rxplot: error: You may only specific 2
or 3 topics with '3d' or 'scatter'.
When 2 topics are provided, time is used as the third axis.

These commands lead to the same error:

rxplot -M 3d /turtle1/pose/x:y
rxplot -M 3d /turtle1/pose/x,/turtle1/pose/y

Using three topics doesn't work either.
Using rxplot with option "-M 2d" works fine.
Can anyone give me a working example of how to plot in 3D?

There's an open bug on this that I need to resolve first:

For the record: This bug has been fixed long time ago and my turtlesim example from the question works now.
