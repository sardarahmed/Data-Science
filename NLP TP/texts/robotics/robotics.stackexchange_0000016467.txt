Q:

What servos are suitable for a robot like Boston Dynamics’ Atlas?

I have seen Boston Dynamics’ robot Atlas do some pretty impressive things, like a backflip, which must put quite large torques on the servomotors.
What servos are there that can generate torques like that, but are still small enough to fit in a humanoid robot? Which servos would be suitable? And what servos is it likely that Boston Dynamics use themselves in the Atlas robot?

A:

The Boston Dynamics’ Atlas robot doesn't actually use servo motors. It uses electrically-powered hydraulic actuation.
I saw a presentation by Boston Dynamics' Marc Raibert where (if I remember correctly) he said they used to use Moog actuators designed for the aerospace industry, but that they were now using a motor that they build in-house that is integrated into the body of the robots. (He said something similar in this interview with IEEE Spectrum).
