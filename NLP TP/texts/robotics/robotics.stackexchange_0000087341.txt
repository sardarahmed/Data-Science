Q:

Do we require a ROS2 installation to use rclpy?

rclpy is an API from ROS2. It is based on the C based rcl. Do we need to have a ROS2 installation on the machine where I want to use rclpy ?

Ok...but i thought it gives you an access to all the ROS functionalities and could be downloaded (rclpy) on a non ROS macine and then used to connect to a ROS2 machine ? @William
