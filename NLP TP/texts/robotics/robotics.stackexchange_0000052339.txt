Q:

Stage velocity limit

I am having a serious issue with my Stage simulation.
No matter the velocity I send to my simulated robots, through /cmd_vel, Stage is always limiting the fields of twist to 1 (x, y, etc)!
I cannot find any references to this limitation or how/where to change it.
Does anyone know how to change this?
thanks

Good question. I didn't remember seeing any options in the world files I've played with, just checked, and there weren't.
After a bit of digging in the ROS and Stage code, I found a reference to 'velocity_bounds', and 'acceleration_bounds' which can apparently be set by the world file:
http://rtv.github.io/Stage/group__model__position.html
My guess is that the default is 1m/s unless set otherwise.
Cheers,
Gavin
