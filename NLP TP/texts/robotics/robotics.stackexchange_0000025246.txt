Q:

powerplant model

// This will make the model the correct size, but cause the mdoel to
// rotate. The powerplant model is a good example.

Where do we get the powerplant model? :) It doesn't seem to be in the repository.

This comment was in error, and has been removed from the repository. Sorry for the confusion.
The powerplant model will appear next week in the new model database.
