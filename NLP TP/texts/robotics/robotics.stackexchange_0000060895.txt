Q:

Declare array of custom type

Hi, I'm triying to declare an array of custom type that I created. This type is formed by 2 int32 variables. I'm triying do that with this command:

main::myType[] myarray;

where main is my package name. When I compiled the program I received an error
Which is the correct way to do this? Thanks in advance

A:

The correct format for message-type in a .msg file is
package_name/data_type_name[] variable name

Where data_type_name is a message in the package package_name
eg.
std_msgs/Float64[] values

Note that this is not a regular array in c++.
After generating the msg file, if you look at the .h file for that message, you will find that values is a vector of doubles.
std::vector <double> values;
