Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: rosmake error

hi
i am getting error below when i am trying to rosmake rviz
[rosbuild] Building package rviz
[rosbuild] Cached build flags older than manifests; calling rospack to get flags
Failed to invoke /opt/ros/fuerte/bin/rospack cflags-only-I;--deps-only rviz
Package sensor_msgs was not found in the pkg-config search path.
Perhaps you should add the directory containing `sensor_msgs.pc' to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
No package 'sensor_msgs' found

CMake Error at /opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros/core/rosbuild/public.cmake:129 (message):

It is complaining that sensor_msgs.pc is not in PKG_CONFIG_PATH
However, the sensor_msgs.pc is in the config path when i check it.
:~/fuerte_workspace$ echo $PKG_CONFIG_PATH
/opt/ros/fuerte/lib/pkgconfig:/opt/ros/fuerte/lib/pkgconfig:/opt/ros/fuerte/lib/pkgconfig

:~/fuerte_workspace$ find /opt/ros/fuerte/lib/pkgconfig | grep 
sensor/opt/ros/fuerte/lib/pkgconfig/sensor_msgs.pc

Does anyone encounter this issue before?
Thanks

Looks like you are sourcing /opt/ros/fuerte/setup.sh three times. That might cause problems. But, @Lorenz is right: just install ros-fuerte-visualization.

A:

Why are you building rviz from source? Just install the debian package:
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-visualization
