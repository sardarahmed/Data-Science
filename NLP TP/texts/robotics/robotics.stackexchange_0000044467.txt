A:

Sure. You can have all ros distros installed in parallel. You can switch between them by sourcing the different setup.bash files. Just make sure you create separate overlays for different ros distros.

Also in this case, you should not source setup.sh in your .bashrc, but decide every time you open a new shell which distro you want to use, and source the corresponding setup.sh. Swithcing between distros in the same shell can cause errors.
