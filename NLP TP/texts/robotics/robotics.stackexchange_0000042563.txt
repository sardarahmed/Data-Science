Q:

knowrob_omics & comp_ros not found

Hello,
I am working with knowrob and so far everything works fine. The problem I have is related to knowrob_omics & comp_ros packages which are not included in knowrob.
I tried locating them using roslocate without any success. I am following the tutorials at the moment and they are packages that are referenced inside the tutorials.
I even tried by downloading roboearth but still no luck.
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks in advance for your reply.

Hi,
those packages are not yet contained in the public distribution. Please send me an email (http://ias.cs.tum.edu/people/tenorth) and I can give you access to them.
best,
Moritz
P.S. Please tag future questions with "knowrob", then I'll get an email notifier whenever a new question is posted and my response times are faster.
