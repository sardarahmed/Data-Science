Q:

Attempting to publish and subscribe to individual portions of an advertised topic

Hey guys. I've just started using ROS a couple of days back. I'm trying to write a publisher(talker) that will take certain parts of a topic and publish them, and a subscriber that can take whatever this talker is publishing. I know this question sounds a bit vague, but can you help me? I've read the tutorials but I still can't use that to my purpose.
Let's say we have some topic '/XXXX/DATA'. I want to extract, say, '/XXX/DATA.acc_x' using the publisher and send it to the subscriber. Is this even possible?

A:

Yes it is possible, The data that is available on the topic is specified by messages. In you case I assume you define some message that contains some element like
float64 acc_x
for instance. Then you subscribe to this topic and just access the data element via the callback say
void dataCallback(const SomePkg::SomeMsgTypeConstPtr msg) { float accx = msg->acc_x; }
And you are set. You can go ahead and do anything with it afterwards.

You can also publish in the callback too.
