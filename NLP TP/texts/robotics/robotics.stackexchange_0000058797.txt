Q:

ROS-Gazebo Failed to load joint_state_controller

Hello guys,
I'am following this tutorial about ROS Integration on Gazebo 1.9 (http://gazebosim.org/wiki/Tutorials/1.9/ROS_Control_with_Gazebo).
My issue is:
As example I consider RRBot, when I type these commands:
roslaunch rrbot_gazebo rrbot_world.launch

to start simulation, and
roslaunch rrbot_control rrbot_control.launch 

to load controllers, it gives me these errors:
[INFO] [WallTime: 1397731938.843439] [11.566000] Loading controller: joint_state_controller
[ERROR] [WallTime: 1397731939.851478] [12.570000] Failed to load joint_state_controller

[INFO] [WallTime: 1397731941.876315] [14.588000] Started controllers:

Then, if I type:
rosservice call controller_manager/list_controller_types
it gives me this error:
ERROR: Service [/controller_manager/list_controller_types] is not available.

How can I resolve?
Thanks

A:

I've got the same problem and I've figured it out how to solve it.
You are having this problem cause you don't have installed the controllers.
Just run these commands in your terminal:
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-ros-control ros-indigo-ros-controllers`

After that when you try to run the same commands you'll be able to control the arm of rrbot.
