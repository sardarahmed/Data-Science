Q:

For a quadcopter: Premade flight controller or custom made?

I'm interested in building a quadcopter. The result I'd like to obtain is an autonomous drone. I'd be interested in a GPS to allow it to remain stationary in the air, and also to fly through checkpoints.
Can this be done with a flight controller, or does it need to be programmed? I'm not too sure about what flight controllers really are.
Could someone offer any materials to help me get towards this goal.
Thanks, Jacob

A:

It all depends on your experience and comfort in coding and understanding the navigation algorithms needed to allow the drone to fly autonomously. Most flight controllers on the market come with inbuilt sensors (gyros,accelerometers,magnetometers,etc) and usually fly on manual control via an RC transmitter/receiver combo. 
I'm in the same situation as you, and I'm attempting to make my own flight controller using the Arduino Mega board, for which I've bought external sensors to aid in flight.
If this is your first quadcopter project and you wish to program your own flight controller, write code to control the quadcopter manually, since that will give you experience and a wider understanding of how the flight controller works in tandem with the esc's,sensors and transmitter. Keep in mind that this is a lengthy process, and a lot of patience is needed to gain a good understanding of the project.
Good Luck!
PS: If you need any help with programming, PM me, i can provide you some links that might help you :)
