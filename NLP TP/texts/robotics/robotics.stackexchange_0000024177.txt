Q:

How can I make an invisible wall in Webots?

I need to create an invisible wall in Webots but I don't know how to do it. Could someone please help me?

A:

In order to create an invisible wall, you can simply create a Solid node with no children field, so that it is invisible, no physics field, so that it is attached to the static world and a Box node as a boundingObject, so that collision detection will be based on this box:
Solid {
  translation 0 0 1
  rotation 0 0 1 0
  name "my invisible wall"
  boundingObject Box {
    size 0.2 4 2
  }
}

The above Solid node will act as an invisible wall located at the center of the world, with a height of 2 meters, a length of 4 meters and a thickness of 20 cm. You will be able to change its translation and rotation fields to move it around and rotate it.
