Q:

geometry installation error

hii, I am getting an error when I try to install geometry. Can somebody help me out. I tried installing geometry_msgs but its still showing me the same error. Can somebody help me with this.
Package geometry_msgs was not found in the pkg-config search path.
Perhaps you should add the directory containing geometry_msgs.pc' to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable No package 'geometry_msgs' found [rospack] warning: got non-zero exit status from executing backquote expression "ret="PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/home/ascc/ros_workspace/geometry_msgs/../../lib/pkgconfig pkg-config --cflags geometry_msgs`" && echo $ret" in [/home/ascc/ros_workspace/geometry_msgs/manifest.xml]
[rospack] error in backquote expansion for tf
Thank you,
Regards,

I am using this as the source to download the package : http://ros.org/wiki/geometry Downloading it into my ros_workspace path.

Installing dependencies : rosdep install geometry. 2) Making the file : rosmake geometry.

Please explain how you're trying to install these packages.

A:

rosdep install only installs the system dependencies.  You will also need to make sure that all ROS dependencies of geometry are in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.  For example geometry_msgs are in common_msgs which appears to be what you compile is complaining about.

When I do rosmake geometry_msgs, though its able to build, its showing as no make files found. and yet its building. I am kind of skeptic on this part.
Comment by evolutionsdisaster on 2012-02-03:
Yes, you are right, but I have done rosmake geometry_msgs and also rosmake common_msgs. I did rosmake geometry_msgs separetely as well when I was getting that error. But still unable to figure out the problem.

If there's no makefiles found then I expect you're trying to compile an installed version not a source checkout.  If you'd like more information please tell how your environment was created.
