Q:

rviz with an existing point cloud

How can I visualize an existing point cloud in rviz? I went through tutorials but it appears they use sensor data. I have a point cloud in bpf format and have tools to convert it to las format as well.
I am using ROS Melodic on Ubuntu 18.04.

A:

You can convert it from a las to pcd using the las2pcd tool provided here: https://github.com/murtiad/las2pcd and then use the pcd_to_pointcloud node in pcl_ros to publish the pointcloud as (similar to https://answers.ros.org/question/62123/how-do-i-publish-pcd-files-in-my-folder-on-a-topic/)
rosrun pcl_ros pcd_to_pointcloud <file.pcd> [ <interval> ]
