Q:

smach-viewer install

Hello,
Could somebody tell me how could I install the smash-viewer package in ROS-Hydro, please.
I though that the package should be already in the las distribution but I have just installed Hydro full desktop and it isn't there.
I also tried apt-get install ros-hydro-smach-viewer and nothing
Thanks in advance,
Roberto

A:

I reinstalled everything from the scratch and it works just doing:
sudo apt-get install smach-viewer
I guess I had made something wrong with the repositories.
Thank you in any case for the answer.
