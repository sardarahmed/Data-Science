Q:

When I use Matlab Ros toolbox, turtlebot3 tutorial simulation will not work

It is so strange that I use  link text, the fake node works. However, when I use Matlab Ros toolbox, and input some command like "rosinit", the tutorial doesn't work. It shows that 
roslaunch turtlebot3_fake turtlebot3_fake.launch
... logging to /home/ise-admin/.ros/log/292cbdaa-2ea7-11e8-9362-509a4c311940/roslaunch-ise-linux-1-5245.log
Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.

Invalid <param> tag: Cannot load command parameter [robot_description]: command [/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/xacro/xacro '/home/ise-admin/catkin_ws/src/turtlebot3/turtlebot3_description/urdf/turtlebot3_.urdf.xacro'] returned with code [2]. 

Param xml is <param command="$(arg urdf_file)" name="robot_description"/>
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

I have tried to check the turtlebot3_fake.launch, but it is same to github. I also tried rename a .xarco file as turtlebot3_.urdf.xacro, I copied the code from \ turtlebot3_burger.urdf.xacro to turtlebot3_.urdf.xacro. However, error occurs.
I want to know why the tutorial does work.Is there any relationship between the "strike" and "Matlab Ros toolbox"?
Thank you!

Please don't use an image to display text. Images are not searchable and people cannot copy and paste the text from the image. Please update your question with a copy and paste of the text using the preformatted text (101010) button instead of using an image.

Ok, I have added text for first picture, as for the second one, I just want to show that my method was not available.

A:

Hello :)
You have to set which TurtleBot3 you want.
$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL = burger

or
$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL = waffle_pi

and
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_fake turtlebot3_fake.launch

Yes, this is parts of the problem. I solved it today. In recent days turtlebot3 has updated their code on github. So I update the code by git pull and export the variable(maybe change them in bashrc is good too)  export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
export TB3_MODEL=burger
Thank you for help.
