Q:

rosrun or roslaunch

Hellow,
Easy question does roslaunch just execute a set of rosrun or is it slightly different ? I couldn't find it in the doc...
I'm asking that because I'm under the impression that my node run slower when launch with a roslaunch then with a rosrun.
Thanks.

I had the same impression, I made a .launch file to calibrate camera, but It were very slower. When I run the same nodes using rosrun for each node it is really faster. But I don't know how to solve it.

A:

Startup might be slower, I think it should not be slower after roslaunch and all created processes have are detached and up. I am not into the roslaunch implementation but I have not had this impression so far. You can use rosnode ping /your_node or if your node publishes anything you can use rostopic hz /your_topic (preferred) in order to "verify" your impression...
