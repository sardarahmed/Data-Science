I won't answer cause they're all the same. Pretty much, just pick what you enjoy. It is entirely personal preference. I use Visual studio code cause I can use it on all platforms and it has a terminal built in. There is also an extension for ROS to help with sourcing the environment.

A:

I started with Eclipe but got into a lot of issues in importing a ROS package and then compiling it.
I switched to CLion afterwards and everything worked like a charm. Its really easy to just install ROS plugin in it and import a project using CMakeList.txt. Only problem is its free for 30 days evaluation. Afyerwards you have to buy the license.
I have heard a lot about QTCreator but did not use it. Hopefully one day.

I have extensively used PyCharm for python codes. Its a great tool. Still using it. But have not used for ROS (C++) packages. For that i am using CLion.
