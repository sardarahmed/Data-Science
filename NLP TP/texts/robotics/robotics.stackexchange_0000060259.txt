Q:

IR camera stream

Hi there,
I wanna get the IR camera stream from the kinect but I get black screen when I launch this command:
rosrun image_view image_view image:=camera/ir/image_raw

PS: All the other topics work fine.
I don't really know what's going wrong ?

I'm working with ROS-Hydro in ubuntu 12.04 64bit.
Thank y'all

OK it works now even it works like "flashing" but I'll try to look for a solution
my question is:
"_image_transport:=theora"
what that is mean ?
Comment by Sanjayan_Ravi on 2014-06-27:
theora is compression algorithm, _image_transport:=theora means that i am requesting the output to be in compressed format.
Comment by ROSkinect on 2014-06-27:
OK yes.
Now I'm trying to do that using a node so as to do some image processing after ?
did you do that before ?
