Q:

could not open world file

world file
<?xml version="1.0"?>
    <sdf version="1.6">
      <world name="default">
        <include>
          <uri>model://ground_plane</uri>
        </include>
        <include>
          <uri>model://sun</uri>
        </include>
        <model name="my_mesh">
          <pose>-80 -80 0  0 0 0</pose>
          <static>true</static>
          <link name="body">
            <visual name="visual">
              <geometry>
                <mesh><uri>file://model.dae</uri></mesh>
              </geometry>
            </visual>
          </link>
        </model>
      </world>
    </sdf>

this is file
<launch>
  <include file="$(find gazebo_ros)/launch/empty_world.launch">
    <arg name="world_name" value="city.world"/>
    <arg name="verbose" value="true"/>
  </include>
</launch>

this is my launch file
when I launch this it shows me an error as
[Err] [Server.cc:379] Could not open file[city.world]

but when spawn using
gazebo city.world

there is no error and it's spawning correctly.
what could be the problem?

A:

you need to give the path of "city.world":
arg name="world_name" value="/path/city.world"

Thanks, that was the problem
but now when I'm trying to launch it gives this error
[Wrn] [FuelModelDatabase.cc:248] URI not supported by Fuel [model.dae]
[Wrn] [SystemPaths.cc:464] File or path does not exist [""] [model.dae]
[Wrn] [FuelModelDatabase.cc:248] URI not supported by Fuel [file://model.dae]
[Wrn] [SystemPaths.cc:464] File or path does not exist [""] [file://model.dae]
[Err] [Visual.cc:3034] No mesh specified

maybe you also need to set the path of model.dae...
like this:
          <geometry>
        <mesh>
          <uri>model://iscas_museum/meshes/ISCAS_museum.dae</uri>
        </mesh>
      </geometry>enter code here
