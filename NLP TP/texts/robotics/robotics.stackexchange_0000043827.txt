Q:

Roslaunch Sequentially

I need run a lunch's includes(xml) sequentially. That is, one after the other. Until no finish one, don't start the next include.
Is there any way to control this?
Thanks

roslaunch intentionally does not support that approach, preferring explicit robot state sequencing via messages or service calls

A:

No.
Nodes should not need to be run dependently, but wait for services, etc.
If you have another use case that you think can't be solved this way, please provide that.

I am running a slam_gmapping node and a bagfile. After successful completion of the bagfile, i need to run mapserver map saver node to save the map.
