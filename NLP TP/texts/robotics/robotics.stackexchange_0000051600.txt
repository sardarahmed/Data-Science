Q:

Problem with YAML when compiling Camera_Calibration_Parsers

I am currently having a problem with compiling Camera_Calibration_Parsers (error) for Groovy.  I am working with an ARM processor and building from source.  There isn't a libyaml-cpp-dev or yaml-cpp-dev binary available from apt-get so I am attempting an install from source.  I have tried many ways on my own as well as trying to follow this.
I have also confirmed having the share libraries option selected for CMake.

A:

The solution I found was a combination of installing yaml-cpp-0.3.0 from source (which I already did) and removing the pre-built components of camera_calibration_parser (which I did not).
First, when installing yaml-cpp-0.3.0, make sure you open the configuration of the CMake file (i.e. run "ccmake .." in the build directory).  Turn the option "BUILD_SHARED_LIBS" ON.
Second, navigate to the "build_isolated" folder under ros/groovy.  Remove the camera_calibration_parser folder.  Then you are safe to rebuild it.
As a note, the error was not only related to the "GetType" function.  There were other times that different functions in yaml-cpp caused the error.
Hope this helps anyone who comes across this problem.

Thanks so much, I was struggling with this issue and didn't think to remove the pre-built components!
