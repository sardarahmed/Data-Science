While at first site ROS might seem incomprehensible, only continued exposure can help you.
See this question: http://answers.ros.org/question/185205/what-are-publishers-and-subscribers/ does it help a little?

A:

Well, it depends on what you are trying to do.
Do you have any ROS robots available to you? If so, I would suggest you try to map a room. If not, you can certainly do it with a pr2 in gazebo.
If you are trying to code get example code, I would search through the repositories.
If you are like me, the only way to learn ROS is to do. The community is always available to answer questions, so don't hesitate to ask them!
Hope this was slightly useful to you.
