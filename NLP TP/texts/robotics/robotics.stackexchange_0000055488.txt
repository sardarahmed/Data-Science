Q:

catkin_make missing after groovy upgrade from fuego

I upgraded my Ubuntu precise fuego installation to groovy and it seems that some of the catkin tools are missing.
I did this because I was trying to follow a tutorial and got lost trying to figure out the fuego equivalents.
The command that I used was
sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-desktop-full
It seems that I only have catkin_create_pkg, catkin_find_pkg, catkin_generate_changelog, catkin_tag_changelog and catkin_test_changelog commands.
I am really not much of a Linux admin so I don't even know how to remove ROS and start over so any help would be appreciated.

A:

You need run this command on each new terminal (or add it to your ~/.bashrc file):
$ source /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash

This adds the ROS groovy installation to your local terminal environment and should allow you to use catkin_make as long as you have ros-groovy-catkin installed (it should be installed from ros-groovy-desktop-full).
The reason you can see the other catkin_* functions you listed is because they are provided in a distro agnostic Python package, python-catkin-pkg, which is in your environment regardless of your ROS distro you are using.
P.S. The version of ROS before Groovy was Fuerte. :)

That worked perfectly.  I found the original fuerte setup command in my .bashrc and replaced it with groovy.

I now have /opt/ros/fuerte and /opt/ros/groovy
Can I remove the fuerte tree?

sudo apt-get remove ros-fuerte-* should work I think.

Perfect! Thanks!
I wish I could add more votes for you.
