Q:

CMake Errors whilst building Catkin (Raspbian)

Hey everyone
Really sorry if this is something silly or small I've gotten wrong, or if it's something that has been answered somewhere else on here. I am having issues getting through compiling on my raspberry pi. Below I have the last few lines that seem relevant before it stopped running. I also need to point out that I'm new to this. Am studying robotics at university and have followed the ROS Platform forever but only recently started trying to learn how to use it.
-- Using CATKIN_TEST_RESULTS_DIR: /home/pi/build_isolated/orocos_kdl/test_results

Again, really sorry if this is something silly or small I've gotten wrong. Thank you in advance for any help you can give!

A:

The CMake error says that eigen3 is not being found in your system. The most likely explanation for this is that eigen simply isn't installed.
Fortunately raspbian does have a native eigen3 package which you can easily install with the command below (answer yes to any questions apt-get asks).
sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev

However, the official ROS instructions for the raspberry pi do not list eigen as a dependency. It could be that there's an error in the documentation, but it could also be that you're not following them correctly :)

I was following it all word for word, it does warn against a full desktop install and that's what I was going for, so that could be it. But the warning seemed to be more a case of I can do it but it will be buggy.

Okay, I have installed as you suggested, going to try run the CMake again now, will come back with the results when I know if it's working or not.
