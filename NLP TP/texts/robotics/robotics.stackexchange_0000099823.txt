Q:

osrf/ros2:testing docker image not working

Running:
docker pull osrf/ros2:testing
docker run -it osrf/ros2:testing

Throws an error:
/ros_entrypoint.sh: line 5: /opt/ros/rolling/setup.bash: No such file or directory

Am I doing something wrong, or is the docker image broken?

A:

EDIT:
This was intended behaviour. Quoting from a response to the issue,

While the osrf/ros2:testing does include the same ros_entrypoint.sh script to keep it interchangeable with other ros image tags, it does not pre-install any ros specific packages, as it is intended to be used as a base image for child Dockerfiles that would install user specified ros dependencies. If you do want to spawn containers directly from the osrf/ros2:testing tag, you could override the default entrypoint by specifying a different one via the docker run arg:
docker run -it --rm --entrypoint="" osrf/ros2:testing

ORIGINAL:
I've raised an issue in osrf/docker_images about this.
