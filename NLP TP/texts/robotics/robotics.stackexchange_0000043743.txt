Q:

Cost Map 2D Setup

Hi all,
I'm still trying to figure out a way to generate a reasonable map using sonar data alone. I've given up on gmapping for now.
Thought I'd look at the navigation stack's cost map 2d - questions I have are:

Do I/can I just write a node only creating a cost map 2d like in section 3 in  http://www.ros.org/wiki/costmap_2d

2)Or would I be better off just setting up the navigation stack as per http://www.ros.org/wiki/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup
Thanks
Mark

Which one you find it efficient to use? Can the robot be able find out it's coordinate position from the global cost map?

Hi Brian - thus far I've had no luck with either giving me any kind of representation of the environment. Which is kind of a shame because software I've written myself can generate a reasonable map - true no where near as good as a laser etc but I am able to see boundary and object outlines

go through this link it might help you.

A:

You can run just the costmap in a node without the other parts of navigation by running rosrun costmap_2d costmap_2d_node after you have set the appropriate parameters on the parameter server.
However, this method relies on having the proper transforms in place, i.e. very accurate odometry.
