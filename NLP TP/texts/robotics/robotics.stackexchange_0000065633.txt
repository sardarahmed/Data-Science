Q:

Can't run unit tests for KnowRob

I'm trying to do so according to the documentation. For example:
rosrun rosprolog rosprolog-test comp_temporal

A:

I've just tested on Indigo/Trusty and got the same error. In the SWI Prolog version that comes with trusty, the 'plunit' unit testing library is installed by default, which has not been the case in Precise. We therefore still have a copy of plunit in the knowrob_common package. As a workaround, you can try to delete the file knowrob/knowrob_common/prolog/plunit.pl. I'll have a look at this later and try to find a cleaner solution.
