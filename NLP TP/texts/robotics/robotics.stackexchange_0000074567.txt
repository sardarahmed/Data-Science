Q:

Passing arguments to launch file from Python API

I'd like to do the equivalent of
roslaunch a.launch foo:=bar
in Python. Right now I'm using the ROSLaunchRunner, but that's not important to me if there's another way to do this.

A:

It's not well, documented, but the roslaunch.core.Node class supports all the same parameters that the rosrun and 'roslaunch' commands support.
So, if you were to launch a node with:
rosrun mypackage mynode.py _param1:=123 _param2:=abc

you could do the same thing from Python with:
import roslaunch

node = roslaunch.core.Node(
    package='mypackage',
    node_type='mynode.py',
    name='mynode',
    args='_param1:=123 _param2:=abc',
    output='screen')
launch = roslaunch.scriptapi.ROSLaunch()
launch.start()
process = launch.launch(node)
# do stuff
process.stop()

this doesn't work with launch files.
