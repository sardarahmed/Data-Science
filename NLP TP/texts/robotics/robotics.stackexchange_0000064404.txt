Q:

ROS master URI is not set

I followed the procedure exactly in the Ubuntu ROS installation page. After installation in ubuntu 12.04 with rosbuild the command 'roscore' returns the error - "ROS master URI is not set".
The following lines are included in ~/.bashrc
ROSLISP_PACKAGE_DIRECTORIES=""
ROS_DISTRO="groovy"
ROS_ETC_DIR="/opt/ros/groovy/etc/ros"
ROS_MASTER_URI="http://localhost:11311"
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH="/opt/ros/groovy/share:/opt/ros/groovy/stacks"
ROS_ROOT="/opt/ros/groovy/share/ros"
source /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash
Please help me out

A:

What instructions did you follow? This should not be in your .bashrc. It should only have added:
source /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash
