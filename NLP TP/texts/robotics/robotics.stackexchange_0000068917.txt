Q:

Is it possible to get the distance from the robot to an AR Tag?

I am using the ar_track_alvar package to detect ar tags found here: markers
I launch the package using this command:

roslaunch ar_track_alvar ar_track_alvar 4.4 0.08 0.2 /camera/depth_registered/points /camera/rgb/camera_info /base_link

The tag detection works really well and the Kinect is able to detect the tags pretty well. I was wondering however if I could continuously get a distance from the robot to the tag with my callback function with the tag detection. I need some way of getting a distance to the tag. I am using a Create Base and using ROS Groovy.
I appreciate your help!

A:

Using the markers as @Falko and @Mehdi. said is not the correct way to do this. Markers are intended for visualization only. ar_track_alvar broadcasts a tf frame for each ar tag. You can find the distance by using tf to lookup the transform from whatever robot frame you're interested in (e.g. base_link) to the tag's frame.
See:
