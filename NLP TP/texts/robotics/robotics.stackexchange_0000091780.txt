Q:

How to make the downlaodaed ros package under /opt/ros/kinetic/share?

Hi all!
I am currently trying to read the Sick s300 raw data for my navigation project. I created workspace using
catkin_make

and my problem is when I am inside the workspace and call
source devel/setup.bash 

I can have my package in the respective workspace path.
But I need to make the package under
/opt/ros/kinetic/share

Can anyone help me with making the downloaded package under /opt/ros/kinetic/share
your assistance is always appreciatable.
thamk u!

Edit: @gvdhoorn Thanq sir for ur valuable time!!
I received the error of
-kinetic-cob-sick-s300 
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
You might want to run 'apt-get -f install' to correct these:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 ros-lunar-navigation-experimental : Depends: ros-lunar-assisted-teleop but it is not going to be installed
E: Unmet dependencies. Try 'apt-get -f install' with no packages (or specify a solution).

I tried apt-get -f install
E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend - open (13: Permission denied)
E: Unable to acquire the dpkg frontend lock (/var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend), are you root?

I am very new to ROS. Please help me in clearing this error.
Thanq sir!

@jayess S sir!

A:

because I cant run my launch file and I am getting the error of cannot launch node.

From #q323846 it seems you are trying to use cob_sick_s300. Is that correct?
If so: do you really need to build that package from source? It's been released into Kinetic, so a simple sudo apt update && sudo apt install ros-kinetic-cob-sick-s300 should work.

If you're installing via apt, you need to use sudo:
sudo apt install <package>
