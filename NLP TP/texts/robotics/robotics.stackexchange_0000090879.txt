Q:

error unable communicate with master

Hello,
I'm trying to setup a workstation to work with a Turtlebot.
I've followed the tutorial here : wiki.ros.org/Robots/Turtlebot/Network%20Setup
Robot IP is : 192.168.0.152
Workstation IP is 192.168.0.122
In .bashrc
I set up ROS_MASTER_URI in both bashrc at this value : http://192.168.0.152:11311
Both Hostname are set up with the IP of the machine
I can ping in both ways.
Roscore is launched on the robot and rostopic return "/rosout" and "/rosout_agg"
But still when I launch "rostopic list" on the workstation, it doesn't work and returns "Unable to connect with master"
Has someone any leads that we could follow please?
Thank you :D

Have you set the IP of the workstation as ROS id? If workstation isn't properly identified, roscore can't connect it to the topic.
"export ROS_IP=192.168.0.122" in the bashrc file on the workstation?
