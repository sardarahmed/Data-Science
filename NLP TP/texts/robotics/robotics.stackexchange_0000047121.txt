Q:

How to search for ROS packages?

Hi!
I'm just starting with ROS.
I wonder how I should search for ROS packages? Why there isn't any catalogue for packages with some topics? I mean catalogue with such topics as: SLAM, Motion control, Infrastructure, Object recognition, Image processing and so on..
I understand that this is a very basic question and so I just do not understand something basis about ROS.
Thank you in advance.

ROS is indeed lacking a lot of portal pages. If you know what you need you can search in browse software.

A:

There is a catalog: The ROS wiki.
As to why it isn't sorted with topics: I guess because nobody did that, yet.
However, I think it might be a good idea to have overview pages, e.g. for SLAM that list all SLAM algorithms implemented as ROS packages. It's probably just a matter of starting that and people will add to that.
