Q:

Need help calculating the thrust on quadcopter motors

I'm trying to calculate the lifting capability of my four quadcopter motors. I tried using eCalc but it doesn't have battery I'm using. Are there any equations to keep in mind for doing these calculations? Here are some relevant details:
Battery: 2200mAh 3S 25~50C LiPo
ESC: 25A
Motor: 1240kV Brushless
Propeller: 8x4
Any help would be much appreciated, thanks!

A:

You could probably calculate this value, but the sensible thing to do would be to just measure it directly.  
Just turn it upside-down and put it on a kitchen scale as shown in this video.
