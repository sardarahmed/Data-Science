Q:

Can ROS message declare as type list and set?

I would like to define a ROS message,
and I try to declare one of them as type "list" and "set"
however it cannot catkin_make, it said that type "list" has nothing to depends on
Do anyone have experience in this situation?

A:

list and set are not natively supported field types in the ROS msg idl.
Unbouned arrays would probably be equivalent to a list.
I don't think there is a way to get set semantics (ie: collections with a uniqueness guarantee on items) without user-level code (ie: msg producer and consumer) enforcing that.
