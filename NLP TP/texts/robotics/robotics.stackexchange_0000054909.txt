Q:

How do I install PyQtGraph?

$ rosrun rqt_plot rqt_plot
[DEBUG] rqt_plot.plot: import of PyQtGraphDataPlot failed (trying other backends)
This is on a fresh install of U13.04 and ROS-Hydro. rqt_plot does revert back to MatPlot, but I would like to know how to install the above library, since I assume it's better. ;)

A:

http://www.pyqtgraph.org/
Install the .deb from the site, since it's not available from the Ubuntu repositories.

Yes, that's the only way to install rqt_plot's dependency for now, due to the limitation discussed here.
