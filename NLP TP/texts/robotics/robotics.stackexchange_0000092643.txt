Q:

Hi, I am trying to install ROS hydro on Ubuntu 12.04.05 LTS. But it seems that hydro repository is not available?

I added this Repository:
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu precise main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'

As I tried it for the other repository that listed in ROS hydro installation.
But when I want to install ros hydro :
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-desktop-full

It returns
Unable to locate package ros-hydro-desktop-full

Everything was working fine before last may!

A:

Because of what is explained in #q325039, all older releases of ROS were moved to the snapshot repositories.
You'll want to read SnapshotRepository and setup your system to use the final snapshot of hydro for precise.
Edit: there is actually a Hydro snapshot available, even though SnapshotRepository does not list it.

The list is only for periodic snapshots. There are final snapshots for all EOL distros.
