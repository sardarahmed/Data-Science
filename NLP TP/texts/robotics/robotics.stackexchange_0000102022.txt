Could you please refrain from using CAPITALS everywhere?
I've already removed quite a few (changed them to regular title case), please keep it in mind for next time.
Comment by Ris on 2022-06-24:
yeah sure, I will keep that noted the next time.

A:

FILE CONTENT OF smartphone.py:
#!usr/bin/env python3

this is not a correct shebang (and technically also not a ROS problem).
The first line should read:
#!/usr/bin/env python3

note the first /, which is important.
Without it, the path is relative to the current working directory, which for roslaunch would be $ROS_HOME. There most likely isn't an env binary in /home/rishav/.ros/usr/bin.
