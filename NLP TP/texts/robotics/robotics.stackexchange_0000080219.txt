Q:

how to install velodyne_msgs for python

I need to read velodyne_msgs in python. When I import velodyne_msgs it says that the package is not found, so I must install it.
I am running on an Ubuntu 14.04 machine with ROS Indigo installed.
I tried this to install velodyne_msgs:
roslocate info --distro=indigo velodyne_msgs > /tmp/velodyne_msgs.rosinstall
rosinstall ~/self-driving-car/catkin_ws/ /tmp/velodyne_msgs.rosinstall

Here ~/self-driving-car/catkin_ws/ is the one and only catkin workspace on my machine.
When I ran the above commands, it gave me a rosinstall error:
rosinstall operating on /home/ubuntu/self-driving-car/catkin_ws from specifications in rosinstall files  /tmp/velodyne_msgs.rosinstall

How do I fix this?
