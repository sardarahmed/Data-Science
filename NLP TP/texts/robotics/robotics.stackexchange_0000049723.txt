Q:

rosjava Gradle build: Could not copy MANIFEST.MF

When I try to build rosjava, I am running into this very strange error:

:rosjava_messages:jar
FAILURE: Build failed with an
exception.

What went wrong: Could not copy MANIFEST.MF to
'/Users/Yeison/ros_java/rosjava_core/rosjava_messages/build/tmp/jar/MANIFEST.MF'.

When I listed the file, it shows the proper permissions.  The file is owned by me.  However, it contains 0 Bytes.  I even tried deleting the file and rerunning the gradle install.  The same problem persisted.
-rw-r--r--  1 Yeison  staff     0B Mar 25 06:45 /Users/Yeison/ros_java/rosjava_core/rosjava_messages/build/tmp/jar/MANIFEST.MF

Is something creating the file prematurely?  I'll take a look to see if I can find that.

A:

This problem can be resolved by making sure that the setup.bash file is sourced.  I accidentally opened a new terminal and forgot to re-source.
