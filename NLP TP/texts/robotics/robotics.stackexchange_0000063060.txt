Q:

Turtlebot 2, Indigo Installation problem, "Cannot locate rosdep" for turtlebot_stdr, turtlebot_dashboard and turtlebot_gazebo

Hi,
I'm experiencing problems installing turtlebot 2 on indigo in a Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty). I'm following the installation tutorial documented at http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot/Tutorials/indigo/Installation . When installing the workspaces (point 4) I do:
$ mkdir ~/turtlebot
$ cd ~/turtlebot
$ wstool init src -j5 https://raw.github.com/yujinrobot/yujin_tools/master/rosinstalls/indigo/turtlebot.rosinstall source ~/kobuki/devel/setup.bash
$ rosdep install --from-paths src -i -y
the last command fails and I get:
~/turtlebot$ rosdep install --from-paths src -i -y
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
turtlebot_stdr: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [stdr]
turtlebot_dashboard: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [create_dashboard]
turtlebot_gazebo: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [create_gazebo_plugins]
Has anyone experimented the same problem? any hint?
thanks.

That's what I did at the end. it works for now but I still have problem with Kinect, even though Asus xtion pro works well. The option "-r" just ignores the errors and keep installing the required dependencies.
