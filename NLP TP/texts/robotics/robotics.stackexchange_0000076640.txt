Q:

Is there a Turtlebot package software for iRobot Roomba 600 series base?

Hi!!
I'm trying to make my own Turtlebot using a Roomba 645 base, a Kinect sensor and ROS Indigo. I would like to use this platform to make maps (SLAM) using Gmapping package for example.
I've trying to use it with some packages changing the parameters for the roomba base, but the communication fails.
Does Someone has try to use the Turtlebot package for roomba 600 base with success?
Thanks!!!
Greetings

A:

You can take a look at AutonomyLab/create_autonomy: ROS driver for iRobot Create 1 and 2. . According to its REAME, it may support the 600 series.

Thank you Mani!!!
I've worked it and it works but I don't know how to use it with the Kinect and the Gmapping package. I'm newbie in this.

You are welcome. Now that the base is working, you need to pretty much go through all the tutorials regarding how to setup your custom robot, setting up its kinematic (TF) tree and how to do gmapping/amcl and how to navigate your robot with the ROS navigation stack.

You might be able to re-use many components of the current turtlebot packages, essentially replacing the base driver with create_autonomy, update the description files and tweak the launch/configuration files.
