Q:

Could Video4Linux (V4L) usb camera worked with Jetson TX2 running ROS Kinetic?

Hi,
Below please find my proposed setup:

Board version --> Nvidia Jetson TX2
OS version --> Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
ROS version --> Kinetic Kame
ROS package for V4L driver --> usb_cam
V4L utilities Ubuntu package that used by usb_cam --> v4l-utils
ROS package for interface btw ROS and OpenCV --> cv_bridge

My application requirement is to use a Video4Linux (V4L) vision camera to take a footage. The footage will be handled by the usb_cam node and publishes as a ROS image message. The ROS image message is converted into the OpenCV image data via cv_bridge node. The OpenCV image data can then be analyzed for pattern recognition or other purpose.
I have tried all these on a laptop and is functioning, will it work under Jetson TX2.
Many thanks for your kind advise.

Why did you delete your previous question? You can edit your question next time instead of creating a new one.

A:

I have a setup with Ubuntu 16.04, ROS Kinetic, and using usb_cam, that definitely works on the TX2. You'd have to check for the cv_bridge, especially if you use OpenCV4Tegra, but you can also install OpenCV now.
Good luck!
