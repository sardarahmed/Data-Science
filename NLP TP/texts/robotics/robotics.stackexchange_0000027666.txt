Q:

What are the SDF Damping Units?

Here's the description of SDF joint --> axis --> dynamics --> damping, "The physical velocity dependent viscous damping coefficient of the joint."  Can you tell me what units this number is interpreted as having.

A:

It is Neutons per (meter per second), i.e.   N * s / m (force per velocity ) or N * m * s (torque per angular velocity) depending on joint type.

Whence did this info come?

http://gazebosim.org/tutorials/?tut=ros_urdf#Joints, "the dynamics element with a viscous damping coefficient of 0.7 Nms/rad".
