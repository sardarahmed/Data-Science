Q:

bus error on subscribing to topic on arm plattform

Hi all,
Recently I changed my hardware from x86 to a Pandaboard (arm).
But now I have problems to subscribe to a "const nav_msgs::Odometry::ConstPtr&" publisher. I allways receive a "bus error" (sigbus) subscribing to the topic.
Here ist the trac of the error:

Program received signal SIGBUS, Bus
error.
allInOne<ros::serialization::IStream,
geometry_msgs::Point_std::allocator<void

&> (m=..., stream=)
at /opt/ros/fuerte/include/geometry_msgs/Point.h:208
208         stream.next(m.z); (gdb) quit

Can anyone confirm this problem or give me a hint to solve it?
Thanks
Robin

A:

This is a bug in the deserialization code in ROS, interacting badly with the arm hard-float support (armhf). I've had good success running ROS Electric and Groovy on Ubuntu Oneiric armel. (soft-float).
I suspect it will work with later versions of Ubuntu armel, but I haven't had time to try.

I have had the same issues.  Armel seems to work very well, but when I moved to armhf, I got the bus error.  I posted a similar issue at: http://answers.ros.org/question/52326/arm-architecture-with-armhf-port-move_base-bus-error-alignment-trapexception/

Is there anyone solve this problem, I had same issue Bus Error with odom. I run in UDOO

This has been fixed for quite a while now. You may want to try running your node in a debugger, and if that doesn't help, open a new question and include which version of the UDOO, which version of ROS you're using, and the code for the subscriber that is crashing.

The relevant issues where this was fixed are https://github.com/ros/roscpp_core/pull/8 and https://github.com/ros/roscpp_core/pull/14
