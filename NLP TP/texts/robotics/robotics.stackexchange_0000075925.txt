Q:

[solved] UWsim installscene.sh command not found

Hi, I just start with ROS and UWsim
I am trying to install new scenes because i want to modified a scene for my project.
I follow the guide on this answer

http://answers.ros.org/question/234836/uwsim-unable-to-execute-scene-installer-script-for-package-based-installation-of-uw-sim/

I download the sh file from this link

http://www.irs.uji.es/uwsim/files/scenes/installScene

then
copy and paste the file into the path
/opt/ros/indigo/share/uwsim/data/scenes

Then I try to run the line:
sudo /opt/ros/indigo/share/uwsim/data/scenes/installScene.sh -s pipes_scene.uws

and I get:

root@wilmer-VirtualBox:~# sudo
/opt/ros/indigo/share/uwsim/data/scenes/installScene.sh
-s pipes_scene.uws sudo: /opt/ros/indigo/share/uwsim/data/scenes/installScene.sh:
command not found

what am I doing wrong?
