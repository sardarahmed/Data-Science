Q:

Rosserial on ARM-32 (S32K14X family) works?

I have to define which MCU my team will use to communicate via ROSserial (TCP/IP) between a computer and a hardware I/O board (that we need to develop WITH THIS MCU or can be other - depends of the answers). We came across with S32K148 MCU (datasheet: https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/S32K-DS.pdf) and we thought this MCU will be great to use due the support on ethernet, some other libraries, industrial protocols support and great amount of I/O. Question is: the rosserial-mbed support this type of MCU? Anyone already tested it? In ROS support I can't find the hardware compatibility, only say that works on ARM-32 Cortex-M family (S32K148 is a Cortex-M4F). Need help to define this. Plz.
Sry for my bad english..

A:

If you look at README in ROS Serial MBED git repository it says that LPC1768, KL25Z, and NUCLEO F401RE are supported over the UART.
Personally, I am thinking it would be faster to implement a simple message passing protocol myself.  ROS Serial is a very heavy weight solution
another option is  ros_bridge
