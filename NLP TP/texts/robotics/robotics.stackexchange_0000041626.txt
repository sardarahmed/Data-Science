Q:

ros node for mecanum/omniwheel steering

Is there a ros node configured to drive a robot with an omniwheel setup? I'd like to import such a node and use it to simulate and test a robot with that type of wheel configuration.
Thanks,
-Ethan

A:

The PR2 navigation systems should work relatively well with mechanum wheels.  You will need to write the low level driver to convert the /cmd_vel into velocity commands for your motors, which is specific to your geometry.
