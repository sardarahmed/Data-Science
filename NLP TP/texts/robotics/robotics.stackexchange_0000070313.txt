Q:

how to install bullet on Indigo in Ubuntu

I have been trying to build this project, it has tf2_bullet which is part of geometry_experimental in it and depends on bullet,
So I have been getting this error message whenever I try to do catkin_make
 add_subdirectory(geometry_experimental/tf2_bullet)
-- checking for module 'bullet'
--   package 'bullet' not found
 

I have done some research and I could not find bullet package. I installed bullet3 from bullet github but that did not solve the problem
Any help would be appreciated...

A:

You could use rosdep for figuring out what package you need to install. Checking out this yaml file, I see that the you are supposed to install libbullet-dev to satisfy the bullet requirement.
From the command line you could use a command similar to
rosdep install --from-paths WORKSPACE --ignore-src --rosdistro=ROSDISTRO

in order to automatically install all system dependencies of all source packages in your WORKSPACE. Note I found the yaml file above with the command
rosdep where-defined bullet

sudo apt-get install libbullet-dev resolved this for me in Rasberry-Pi
