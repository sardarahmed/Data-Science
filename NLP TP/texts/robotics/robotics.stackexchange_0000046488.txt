Q:

rqt_console and rqt_logger_level

Hello,
I'm am very new to ROS, I am using Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS and ROS Fuerte. I have been going through the tutorials and I came across a problem, when I type the command:
rosrun rqt_console rqt_console
I get:
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named rqt_console below /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/rqt/rqt_console
[rosrun] Found the following, but they're either not files,
[rosrun] or not executable:
[rosrun]   /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/rqt/rqt_console
[rosrun]   /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/rqt/rqt_console/src/rqt_console
and similarly with rqt_logger_level, although the rqt_gui/rqt_graph works fine. Is there a solution to this problem?
Thanks and best regards,
Khalid Yousif

A:

The tutorial works for ROS groovy, but not fuerte. I will create a bug report.
EDIT3:
It seems the rqt_gui command has been replaced by a global rqt command in groovy, so from now on these should work in Groovy:
$ rqt 
$ rqt -s rqt_console
$ rqt -s rqt_logger_level

in Fuerte, (and for some time during Groovy beta), you could do this instead:
$ rosrun rqt_gui rqt_gui

and select Plugins > Console in the menu. That has the same effect.
EDIT:
Or, to get exactly the same, run
$ rosrun rqt_gui rqt_gui -s rqt_console
$ rosrun rqt_gui rqt_gui -s rqt_logger_level
