A:

I'm not usually about advertising my papers in this venue, but I think some work here could give you some good context https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07589 "A Comparison of Modern General-Purpose Visual SLAM Approaches". The aim of the paper was comparing existing openly available VSLAM systems for practical service robot application.
While we do not specifically focus on "Outdoor" you can see extensive discussions about the weaknesses and strengths of different methods given access to different hardware in various service environments (including outdoors as an important subsection).
