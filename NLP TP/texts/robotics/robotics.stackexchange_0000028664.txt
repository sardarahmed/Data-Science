Q:

Where is the source code of libgazebo_ros plugins?

I am currently using the libgazebo_ros_projector plugin and while using it in urdf it calls the binary ".so" file as follows:
<plugin name="projector_test_controller" filename="libgazebo_ros_projector.so">

Where can I find the source code of it?

Thanks! I discovered just recently that the source codes don't have the "lib" prefix, that's why I couldn't find anything :)
