Q:

getting segfault in a group of related projects

I am getting segfaults on several  projects rgbdtam rgbdslam_v2,  lsd_slam
I get either a sexit  code 11 or if I run as rosrun the just the line segfault.
How can I investigate these errors further...they seem to be related to a group that may be dependent on pcl or such.
I am running ubuntu16.
How can I investigate and localize the responsible subsystem.
