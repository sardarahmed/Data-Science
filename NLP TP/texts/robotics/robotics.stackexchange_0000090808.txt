Q:

How to run launch file with many packages

Hi,
i wrote launch file which use some different packages and i want to do one file which contains folders with this packages and folder "launch", where this launch file exist (3 folders with packages + 1 folder with launch files). I cant run this launch file cause i got error:
RLException: [allTags.launch] is neither a launch file in package [tag_detector_ros] nor is [tag_detector_ros] a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

I was trying with catkin_make and source devel/setup.bash. Can someone tell me how can I do it correctly?
LaunchFile:
<launch>
 <arg name="tag" default="1" />
 <group if="$(eval tag == 1)">
 <include file="$(find package_name)/launch/launch_file_name.launch"/>
 </group>

<group if="$(eval tag == 2)"> 
<include file="$(find package_name)/launch/launch_file_name.launch"/>
</group> 
</launch>

output of rospack find tag_detector_ros:
[rospack] Error: package 'tag_detector_ros' not found

output of find $(rospack find tag_detector_ros) -name *.launch:
[rospack] Error: package 'tag_detector_ros' not found

Can someone tell me how can I do it correctly?

WIthout seeing the launchfile? No.
Comment by Filip4 on 2019-03-06:
Just a simple launchfile with including others launchfile (from this additional packages). Even if launch file is empty error occurs. Added launchfile code on main post.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-03-06:
Please also show us the exact steps you perform (building workspace, sourcing it and invoking roslaunch).
Comment by Filip4 on 2019-03-06:
catkin_make -> source devel/setup.bash -> roslaunch package_name launch_file_name
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-03-06:
That is paraphrasing. Exact commands mean: copy-paste.
Comment by Filip4 on 2019-03-06:
catkin_make,
source devel/setup.bash,
roslaunch tag_detector_ros allTags.launch
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-03-07:
What is the output of rospack find tag_detector_ros and find $(rospack find tag_detector_ros) -name *.launch?

A:

[rospack] Error: package 'tag_detector_ros' not found

well it would seem that 'tag_detector_ros' is just not a package in your workspace, and looking at the output of the find command, it would appear to actually be a directory, containing other ROS pkgs (ie: aruco_ros, apriltags2_ros, visp_auto_tracker, etc).
roslaunch can only launch launchfiles from actual ROS packages, or if you don't have a package, you can provide it with an absolute path to a launch file.
In your case using the latter option would probably be possible. Something like this should work (provided there are no problems with the launch file itself):
roslaunch /path/to/your/catkin_ws/src/tag_detector_ros/launch/allTags.launch
