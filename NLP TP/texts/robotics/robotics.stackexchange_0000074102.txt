can this node be used to convert to point cloud data directly from the "scan" topic which is in laser reading format or does the topic need to be a point cloud data publishing topic ?

A:

The bag_to_pcd file will use the topic that you choose as input, and turn each sensor_msgs/PointCloud2 message on that topic into it's own PCD file.
If you want a single PCD file, you need to use a tool like the point_cloud_assembler (http://wiki.ros.org/laser_assembler) to concatenate all of the clouds together into a single cloud.  You can then use the bag_to_pcd tool to save that new single cloud.
