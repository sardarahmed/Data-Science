Q:

ar_track_alvar image topic to point cloud

Hi there!
This is my first time using AR Tags in ROS.
I already had my camera with /image_raw and /camera_info topics published.
However, when I ran "roslaunch ar_track_alvar pr2_indiv.launch"
there was an error saying:
"Could not process inbound connection: topic types do not match: [sensor_msgs/PointCloud2] vs [sensor_msgs/Image]"
I believe my sensor_msgs/Image topic already correct, since I can visualize them in rviz and in image_view.
Is this a bug? since in the instructions it is clearly stated that Image topic is used...
Thanks for your help!

A:

If you are using ar_track_alvar with a normal camera (not with a Kinect) use the pr2_indiv_no_kinect.launch launch-file.
