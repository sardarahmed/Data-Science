Q:

RGB-D Handheld Mapping with RealSense R200

I was following the RGB-D Handheld Mapping  tutorial . First I ran the following command
$ roslaunch realsense_camera r200_nodelet_default.launch

While the realsense_camera node is running, in a new tab I ran
$ roslaunch rtabmap_ros rtabmap.launch rtabmap_args:="--delete_db_on_start" depth_topic:=/camera/depth_registered/sw_registered/image_rect_raw

The RTABMAP GUI is launched as expected but there is no image.
In the terminal that I launched the RTABMAP GUI, I am receiving the following warning.
[ WARN] [1532462055.394145038]: /rtabmap/rgbd_odometry: Did not receive data since 5 seconds! Make sure the input topics are published ("$ rostopic hz my_topic") and the timestamps in their header are set. 
/rtabmap/rgbd_odometry subscribed to (approx sync):
   /camera/rgb/image_rect_color,
   /camera/depth/image_raw,
   /camera/rgb/camera_info

Same thing happens when I run
$ roslaunch rtabmap_ros rtabmap.launch rtabmap_args:="--delete_db_on_start" depth_topic:=/camera/depth/points/image_raw

Can you help me solve this issue? Thank you.
I am running Ros Kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit machine.

I think the RTABMAP GUI is not looking for the right topic; there is nothing matching "/camera/depth_registered/sw_registered/image_rect_raw". What should I change the
$ roslaunch rtabmap_ros rtabmap.launch rtabmap_args:="--delete_db_on_start" depth_topic:=/camera/depth_registered/sw_registered/image_rect_raw

command with?
Edit 2
As Martin suggested, I tried running
$ roslaunch rtabmap_ros rtabmap.launch rtabmap_args:="--delete_db_on_start" depth_topic:=/camera/depth/image_raw

Again, there's no image in the GUI. I also ran "rostopic hz /camera/depth/image_raw" and got:
$ rostopic hz /camera/depth/image_raw

This shows that we are receiving something from this topic. I also ran
Run the following command
$ rqt_image_view

just to check if the camera is working and it is indeed working:

Please notice that the chosen topic is "/camera/depth/image_raw".

Looks like first we need to check what the topic is. "rostopic list" should display it, afterwards try "rostopic echo --noarr " to see if you get some data.

Hello @Humpelstilzchen can you check my edit? Thank you.
Comment by matlabbe on 2018-07-24:
Which realsense_camera package version do you have? Just tried with latest version of their indigo-devel branch and /camera/depth_registered/sw_registered/image_rect_raw should be published by realsense_camera node.
Comment by matlabbe on 2018-07-24:
Just found the difference, try roslaunch realsense_camera r200_nodelet_rgbd.launch instead like in the tutorial.

@matlabbe This one worked. Thank you very much!
Comment by jayess on 2018-07-24:
Can you please attach your images directly to the question?

A:

From all the topics you listed, /camera/depth/image_raw looks like it's the only candidate. First make sure that you're receiving something on that topic:
rostopic hz /camera/depth/image_raw

Then change your command to:
$ roslaunch rtabmap_ros rtabmap.launch rtabmap_args:="--delete_db_on_start" depth_topic:=/camera/depth/image_raw

Just for somebody stumbling on this later: The comment by @matlabbe solved this problem.
