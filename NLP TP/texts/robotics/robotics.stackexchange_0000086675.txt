Q:

Xacro arguments not appearing in MoveIt! Setup Assistant

Hello,
I am on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and on ROS Kinetic. I have worked with MoveIt! several times and I had to change my MoveIt! package more than one time because I added more links and joints to my URDF model. At the time, I launched the moveit setup assistant and clicked on "Edit Existing MoveIt Configuration Package" and selected the path to the MoveIt! config package that I had previously created. After that I would write arguments in a text box named XACRO arguments (or someting like this) in order to load some parts of my model (because my original URDF is the Husky robot and I am also loading other additional parts like the kinetic, etc.). The problem is that this XACRO arguments text box used to appear below the text box were I type the path for my MoveIt! config package, but now it's not appearing anymore and I don't know why. This makes it impossible for me to even load and see correctly my MoveIt! config package in the Setup Assistant and I also can't alter it like I want. Do you know why this is happening?
Best regards,
Jos√© Brito

A:

The xacro argument field was added only recently in March and has not been released yet.
If you want to use it at the moment, make sure you build moveit from source in the kinetic-devel branch.

Hello @v4hn, thanks for your answer. Yes you are right, I used Synaptic to delete all my MoveIt! pacakges and then I downloaded and compiled everything from source in the kinetic branch and now the text box appeared again! Thanks a lot! :)
