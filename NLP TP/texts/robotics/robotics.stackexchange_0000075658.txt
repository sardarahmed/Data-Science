Q:

Running ros image to cv image conversion node

I am trying the example node given here to convert ros images into opencv images. When I run the node I don't see anything on the screen. My Opencv version is 2.4.8 and am using Indigo on Ubuntu 14.04. Below is my CMakeLists.txt:
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)
project(roscv_conv)

find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
  cv_bridge
  image_transport
  roscpp
  sensor_msgs
  std_msgs
  
)

find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED)

include_directories(
  ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS}
  ${OpenCV_INCLUDE_DIRS}
)

add_executable(roscv_conv_node src/roscv_conv_node.cpp)

target_link_libraries(roscv_conv_node
   ${catkin_LIBRARIES}
   ${OpenCV_LIBRARIES}
)

add_dependencies(roscv_conv_node sensor_msgs_generate_messages_cpp std_msgs_generate_messages_cpp)

Do I need to add anything to my CMakeLists.txt or is it because I need to install any additional drivers or a different version of opencv? I run the node and the cursor keeps blinking on the screen and doesn't display anything else. What am I missing here?

Are you running another ROS node that is publishing images?

I don't think so. I have installed libuvc camera driver and am trying to figure out how to get it published.

A:

I have realized that the problem was the absence of any nodes publishing images (I know, it's silly). I have got this working with the topic /camera/rgb/image_rect_color, using zed camera and its ros wrapper. Thank you ahendrix.
