Q:

Robot Web Tools – data not loading

I've been trying to see any of the robot web tools demos – I can manipulate the area (seeing the coordinate frame rotate when I click and drag) but no models nor maps show up. I don't receive any error messages in console.
Has anyone experienced the same problem or have any idea what the solution is? Thanks!
Edit: removed one of the two problems I'd experienced (was simply a path issue).

As for my specs: I'm using a retina MacBook Pro and connecting to both the demos through Chrome (though I've tried Firefox as well, to no success).

A:

Looks like the demo ROS servers we are running went down. I will investigate!
