Q:

android tutorial teleop: missing ids in R.java of honeycomb

Hi
In the MainActivity of android_tutorial_teleop there are some things wrong I think:
In MainActivity.java these are used:

R.id.virtual_joystick_snap
R.id.virtual_joystick
R.id.visualization

And in res/menu/settings_menu.xml

@+id/virtual_joystick_properties
@+id/virtual_joystick_snap

And in res/layout/main.xml

@+id/virtual_joystick

The compiler looks for these ids in the R.java of android_honeycomb_mr2 but the only (relevant) id that is in there is public static int virtual_joystick_layout=0x7f05003b;.
How can I solve this. I could really use this tutorial.
Cheers!
