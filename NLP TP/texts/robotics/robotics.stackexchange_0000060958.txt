Q:

Why don't Log outputs end up in Bags? Can I force them to?

I am a big fan of rosbags. Right now I am doing a series of pretty complex tests on some mobile robots. I like to bag everything for each test, so that I can go back and review what happened to catch bugs. Rqt_bag's visualization capabilities make debugging certain aspects of my system extremely easy. However, I am continually frustrated that Log information produced by calls to ROS_ERROR(), ROS_INFO(), ROS_DEBUG(), etc. does not appear to be stored in my bag files. I can see that rosout has messages publish in it similar to:

header
level:  8
name: /PelicanMMS
file: /asctec/PelicanMMS/PelicanROS/src/VTOL...
function: startHandler
line:  38
topics

This can point me to the exact origin of one of my debug calls, but it does not contain the actual text of the call! I know that the text from my log calls can be found in the generated log files, or captured with rqt_console; but, I want the logging text stored in my bag. My questions are:
Is there some system setting or configuration that I could specify to make the text logging information get bagged?
If this is impossible, is there a simple work around?

A:

I suspect you're running into this bug: https://github.com/ros-visualization/rqt_common_plugins/issues/226
In short, your log output is there, but rqt_bag isn't displaying it due to a bug.
A couple of things to try:

Upgrade to a newer version of rqt_bag
Use rosbag play to play back your log files into rqt_console.

That is it exactly! The bug is with rqt_bag; I can publish from rqt_bag into rqt_console and see the 'msg' field, but rqt_bag does not display it internally. Thank you so much for pointing me in the right direction!
