Q:

realsense_dist runtime error

Hello,
I'm using Intel Realsense R200 camera and Realsense ROS SDK. When I run realsense_r200_launch.launch, I encountered following error.
[ERROR] [1446254837.488498054]: DSAPI call failed at /home/turtlebot/catkin_ws/src/realsense_ros/src/r200_camera_nodelet.cpp:509! status:  DS_FAILURE details: Internal exception: Failed to grab the Z frame hit return to exit 

Any comment would be appreciated.

I think you'd have a better chance of getting a response at intel-ros/realsense/issues (apparently the 'official' repository for Intel Realsense support in ROS.
