Q:

How to setup pointcloud_to_laserscan?

I've got a pointcloud from my kinect, and I'd like a laserscan for amcl to play with.
The wiki page really doesn't give any usage instructions, and seems to indicate it's a part of "TurtleBot" - but the installation hints say it should be part of "perception_pcl".
What do i rosrun to get this thing to go? Is there a ros command line tool to search which package something is in?

A:

Try using this launchfile (add it to pointcloud_to_laserscan/launch, I called it openni_laser.launch). I think I'm trying to achieve similar things you are. My question here. I'm assuming you have openni_kinect installed. The fake laserscans will be published in the /scan topic, you can see them in rviz.
<launch>
  <!-- kinect and frame ids -->
  <include file="$(find openni_camera)/launch/openni_node.launch"/>

  <!-- openni_manager -->
  <node pkg="nodelet" type="nodelet" name="openni_manager" output="screen" respawn="true" args="manager"/>

  <!-- throttling -->
  <node pkg="nodelet" type="nodelet" name="pointcloud_throttle" args="load pointcloud_to_laserscan/CloudThrottle openni_camera">
    <param name="max_rate" value="2"/>
    <remap from="cloud_in" to="/camera/depth/points"/>
    <remap from="cloud_out" to="cloud_throttled"/>
  </node>

  <!-- fake laser -->
  <node pkg="nodelet" type="nodelet" name="kinect_laser" args="load pointcloud_to_laserscan/CloudToScan openni_camera">
    <param name="output_frame_id" value="/openni_depth_frame"/>
    <remap from="cloud" to="cloud_throttled"/>
  </node>
</launch>

Okay, I see a /scan topic now - I did have to change things from waiting on openni_camera to openni_manager, otherwise it didn't load. Thanks for the help!

Yes, they're published to the default /scan topic. As far as I understand this, it's not the output_topic that's being remapped, but the coordinate frame's name. I'm using the default openni_node.launchfile, I didn't change it.  See also Patrick's answer in the link I provided above, may help you.

Also, did you change your openni_node.launch any? If i set my nodlets to wait on openni_camera like you did they never go - I can set them to wait on openni_manager but i don't know if that's a good idea.

They're published to the '/scan' topic? What is this doing, then:

Hi, thank you so much!! I just wanted to highlight below @Bart - for fuerte with precise you need to add the mods that are in that launch file i.e:
