Q:

simulated turtlebot kinect data

Hello,
Is it possible to get simulated raw image or create Point Cloud in Rviz with simulated Kinect and simulated Turtlebot "out of the box"? Because I can only get laser data posted on /scan topic. I tried to build Point Cloud but there is no published topic to do that. Is that even possible in simulated environment or do I have to reroute some of the data to other topic.
I'm using Ubuntu 11.10 and Electric.
I would really appreciate any tips because I'm new to ROS :)
Thank you.

A:

This is a bug in the gazebo.urdf.xacro file. The camera frame names were not correct and therefore the gazebo plugins couldn't initialize properly. It's fixed in 330:4253a4e5f257 . I'll push out a release today with the fix, turtlebot 0.9.2

It worked fine for me before i updated my packages recently. I started using real turtle n hence couldn't notice this issue. Anyways thanks for the update :)

I've done this as well previously, although I may have done an update since then. In that test I added a table to the world and viewed the pointcloud in rviz.
