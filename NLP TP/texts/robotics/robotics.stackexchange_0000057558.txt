Q:

ROS package release status

If a package's documentation status does not list a specific release does that mean it is not supported in that release? For example, I'm interested in potentially using executive_smach, but it is not in the index for hydro on the wiki. Similarly, I would like to run the tabletop_object_detector but it is not listed for hydro either. Thank you.

A:

You will find all released packages with their version number and the status of the Debian packages on the debbuild status pages:

http://www.ros.org/debbuild/indigo.html
http://www.ros.org/debbuild/hydro.html
http://www.ros.org/debbuild/groovy.html

All documented packages will have the corresponding distro tab on their wiki page, e.g.: http://wiki.ros.org/executive_smach
E.g. executive_smach is released into hydro (currently version 1.3.1-0 as listed on the debbuild status page) but does not have documentation for hydro (missing tab in the wiki). The maintainer has only registered the package for release but not for documentation as you can see in the rosdistro file: https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/blob/7218e3476c4df432d79a93b3e12b9599a3a1597c/hydro/distribution.yaml#L949
You could poke the maintainer / fill a ticket to also register it for documentation.
