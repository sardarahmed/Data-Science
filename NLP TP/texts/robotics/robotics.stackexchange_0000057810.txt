Q:

[catkin_make] Cmake Error

Hi everyone.
I'm doing this thing (youbot ros-hydro-wrapper-for-kuka-youbot) trying to make youbot by Kuka working and there's an error on the last "$ catkin_make".
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
    $ git clone github.com /youbot/youbot_driver_ros_interface.git -b hydro-devel
$ cd ..
$ catkin_make
$ sudo setcap cap_net_raw+ep devel/lib/youbot_driver_ros_interface/youbot_driver_ros_interface

it's my first time with Ubuntu and ROS, so I don't really know what gone wrong.

CMake Error at
/opt/ros/hydro/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:72
(find_package):   Could not find a
package configuration file provided by
"brics_actuator"   with any of the
following names:
brics_actuatorConfig.cmake
brics_actuator-config.cmake

Add the installation prefix of
"brics_actuator" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
or set   "brics_actuator_DIR" to a
directory containing one of the above
files.  If   "brics_actuator" provides
a separate development package or SDK,
be sure it   has been installed. Call
Stack (most recent call first):
youbot_driver_ros_interface/CMakeLists.txt:5 (find_package)
-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred! make: ***

A:

It looks like the youbot driver requires the brics_actuator package but you have not installed it on your system or put it in your workspace. You'll need to resolve that dependency before you can build that package.

Thanks, well the next question will be: how to do that.
I've found brics_actuator git, but I really new at linux so I have no idea what to do with that. :(
Comment by runout on 2014-03-29:
found it. That's what I was needed.
brics_actuator. [$ sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-brics-actuator]
pr2_msgs. [$ sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-pr2-msgs]
Now I got new problem with:
[youbot_driver.launch] is neither a launch file in package [youbot_driver_ros_interface] nor is [youbot_driver_ros_interface] a launch file name
But I guess that's another question.

$ sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-youbot-driver-ros-interface
I edited the youbot-ethercat config file from eth0 to eth1 (path is /opt/ros/hydro/share/youbot_driver/config, you'll need sudo access to edit it).
But I am getting an error
[ERROR] [1400149466.933178411]: No EtherCAT connection:
[FATAL] [1400149466.933450442]: No socket connection on eth1
Excecute as root
(I have the manipulator at eth1 only.) Help please?

For Simulation, how to bypass that error? I'm not intended to use the real hardware. Any suggestions!
