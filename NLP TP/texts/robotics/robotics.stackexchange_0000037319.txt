Q:

problem with debug messages in rxconsole

Hi
I have 2 computers: master and lowlevel. I log in master where I run roscore. I ssh to lowlevel to launch some nodes there. THe whole thing works fine so I guess the setup is configured properly.
I am trying to debug a node on the lowlevel computer, written in python. logdebug messages do not print anywhere: neither in the logfile, the screen or rxconsole.
In rxconsole, when I try to set the node's verbose level to debug, my node does not appear in the list of nodes.
If I init_node with log_level=rospy.DEBUG, the following message appears in the log file:
"Unable to report rosout: time is not initialized. Have you called init_node()?"
see complete log file here: http://pastebin.com/5sL91492
thanks

A:

I don't believe the log level setting in rxconsole works for Python nodes.
I usually end up editing the script changing the message levels to INFO.

How to override logging levels is documented here: http://www.ros.org/wiki/rospy/Overview/Logging#Advanced:_Override_Logging_Configuration
