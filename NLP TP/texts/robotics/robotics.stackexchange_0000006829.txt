Q:

Robotics SLAM datasets - scaling factor

There are several robotics datasets for SLAM, like this one.
In this webpage you can see that the depth image is scaled by a factor of 5000, so that float depth images can be stored in 16 bit png files:
The depth images are scaled by a factor of 5000, i.e., a pixel value of 5000
in the depth image corresponds to a distance of 1 meter from the camera, 10000
to 2 meter distance, etc. A pixel value of 0 means missing value/no data.

I do not understand why this value is chosen. Why not simply 1000, so that there is a conversion of meters to millimeters? 

A:

PNG does not support float numbers (afaik). Hence the depth value needs to be encoded as a fixed point value. The fixed point was chosen, I guess, to get a good trade-off between accuracy (0.2 mm) and range (13 m).
