Q:

How can I input a publisher as a parameter to a function?

I am planning on defining the following publisher in a main() file
 ros::Publisher pub_navigation_msg = nh.advertise<rtklib::Navigation>("nav_topic", 10); 

But I want to use publisher inside my function so I want to define it as a parameter to the function like
static void myfunct(ros::Publisher pub, stream mymsg){
.....
.....
pub.publish(mymsg);

}

I think I cannot define a publisher outside a main() file because main would consist of Nodehandler and other important ros features.

how do you do it finally? I want to use in different files

A:

I'm not sure how publisher react to copying (my guess is it would be safe), but it should be better to just pass it by reference here.
