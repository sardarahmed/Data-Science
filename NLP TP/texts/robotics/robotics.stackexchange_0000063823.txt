Q:

installation on OS X Yosemite

Has any brave soul tried this yet? Any luck?
I'm keen to upgrade, but have a working ROS installation running natively on my Mac for first time ever.
Not particularly keen to break it!!

I tried it, and when I attempt to install the dependencies via rosdep, I get an error regarding the fact that vtk-java is missing.

A:

Just bit the bullet, and it worked for me as a update from 10.9.5 to 10.10. However im using brew python, and not the system python that mac comes with. Im not sure if system python gets updated during this update or not, but i can confirm i have it working on hydro for yosemite. Gazebo, rviz, rqt, and roscore packages all work.
Using brew python 2.7.8

I upgraded to Yosemite, but I'm unable to install the dependencies as well - collada-dom and pcre. You had the installation right from 10.8 or did you fresh install in 10.9? Since 10.9, stdlib for clang is libc++ instead of libstdc++. Link to question: http://bit.ly/1yHpSCv. Thanks!

im pretty sure i bought my mac during 10.9, but one way or another fresh 10.9 install --> 10.10 upgrade. I installed ROS and solved all dependency issues while still on 10.9, and then when i upgraded, nothing broke and everything worked

(everything worked, meaning everything that previously worked on 10.9)
