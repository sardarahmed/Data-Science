Q:

Actions and nested goal states

Greetings. Since it is possible that a array is a data structure for an action goal, I would assume that more complex data structures may also be possible. I would like to give my action server a list of poses so it can calculate and execute a path.
How can I define a nested data structure inside my action in order to hold the poses?

A:

You can nest message types inside message types, service types and action types in both ROS1 and ROS2.
See section 2.1.1 of the documentation
