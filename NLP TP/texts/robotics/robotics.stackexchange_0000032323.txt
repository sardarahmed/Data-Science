Q:

Loading a file from a python ros node

Hello,  I'm writing a python node and I need to load an XML file.  I want to try to keep the XML file in my package so that way it travels with the ROS package.  However, since I typically launch nodes from my home directory, and the node is in my ROS development area, it seems I have to specify a full path in order to load the XML file.  Is there a way to ask python to give me the relative path to the current package?

A:

The Best Way To Do This (tm) is probably to use a rosparam to set the path to the file, and then load it that way.
If you really just want the path to the file, a proper call to roslib.rospack modulefind the directory for you.
