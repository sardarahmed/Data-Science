Q:

How to create an executable in the $package/bin directory?

I tried to use this in my CMakefile :
rosbuild_add_executable(arp_core.arp arp_core_main.c)
INSTALL(TARGETS arp_core.arp RUNTIME DESTINATION bin)
but the exe does go into the bin directory, it stays in the root of the package folder.
I also defined theses :
set( CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX ${${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME}_SOURCE_DIR})
set(EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/bin)
set(LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/lib)

A:

You're not doing any installing so the install command doesn't come in to play.  This should do it:
set(RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/bin)

see the docs at
cmake --help-full | less

You'd need to post your whole cmakelists for me to be sure.
