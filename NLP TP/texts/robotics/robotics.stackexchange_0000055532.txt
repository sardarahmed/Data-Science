Q:

Monte Carlo Localization with Ros Hydro

How can i use my custom monte carlo localization code to localize my robot?Because i do not want to use ROS AMCL, i want to try my own localization code.Is there any source which implements monte carlo localization algorithm and uses in in ROS?
And how can i run that code on my robot?
Thanks.

A:

AMCL is a monte carlo localization/particle filter based approach. So even if you do not want to use it, you can still look at the code to get an idea how a ROS interface for your own code could look like.

amcl is documented on the wiki at: http://wiki.ros.org/amcl as linked above. Which includes references to the source.
