Q:

Running same source code for Baxter and Fetch arm movement?

Is it possible for running same source code for Baxter and Fetch arm movement? For Fetch actionlib stack is used for arm and gripper movement whereas in Baxter, actionlib stack is not used. Please help.

Seeing as one uses actionlib and the other doesn't, I'd venture a guess and say: no, you won't be able to use the same source code, but perhaps with some changes it could work.

A:

If you want to run the same code on both Baxter and Fetch, likely you'll need to look at a different abstraction layer. I'd recommend using MoveIt's move_groups. Theoretically (as I have not tried this myself) with minimal changes, you'll be able to abstract away the actual details of arm controllers and kinematics using MoveIt code.
