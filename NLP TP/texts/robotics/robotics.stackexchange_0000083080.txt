Q:

Is there a plan to clean up Tags on ROS Answers site?

I'm not suggesting that it be a manual effort.  There definitely should be an easy-button for admins to accomplish this task.  and maybe eventually it could even be completely automated.
But I just earlier asked a Universal Robots question and the following three Tags were all available for me to use:
universal-robot 
universal-robots 
universal_robot 

Not knowing which was the most popular choice, I chose to tag my post with all 3.  Which is not ideal.  For several reasons.
Is there an effort or a plan to reduce examples like this to a single commonly used Tag?  It's website maintenance that would need to be done on a regular basis, because users will continue to make sloppy in-informed Tags.

What's worse is that spam tags apparently live forever- I think the spammer here was caught and the posts deleted, but the tags are still polluting the system: https://answers.ros.org/tags/?t=tag&query=90013&search=

A:

There's not a specific plan to do so. Anyone with enough Karma is allowed to retag questions. In this case I'd strongly recommend using the tag that matches the package name, thus the underscored version. If anyone notices these inconsistencies please go ahead and homogenize the tags. Every little effort like this will help, even if you fix one or two at a time that helps.

There's no admin interface available that allows mass CRUD of tags?

There's also a feature request to avoid new users creating new tags: https://github.com/ASKBOT/askbot-devel/issues/564

There's no admin interface for tags. I also opened a new Enhancement request to sort the suggestions by popularity as well as display the number of usages: https://github.com/ASKBOT/askbot-devel/issues/734

I've +1-ed both. ASKBOT needs those improvements, badly.
An admin interface for tag CRUD would also be nice.

I agree that every little effort will help.  But how do you incentivize and make it easy for site visitors to clean up tags?  Is there at least a Badge for it?  When tagging a new question, does the user interface make it simple and easy for that user to merge multiple tags into one?
