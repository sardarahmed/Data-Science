Q:

How to change sdf parameter static from GUI plugin?

I created GUI plugin with button that spawns objects. For objects i have sdf files with default parameters. Only parameter that i change in plugin is pose, where i use mutable_pose like this:
    msgs::Set(msg_.mutable_pose(), ignition::math::Pose3d(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);    

This is working correctly. Is there any way to do something similar for static parameter?
My sdf objects have static set to false, but i'd like to change it to true by clicking button. Thanks for any help.

A:

I assume you're using a gazebo::msgs::Factory message to spawn your models.  As you can see in the message description, there's a field to override pose, which you're using, but no field to override static. So one thing you could do is edit the model's SDF before spawning.
