thanks Felix Endres, i have make the rgbdslam package ok  with http://www.ros.org/wiki/rgbdslam ,and pc is 64 bit , not 32 bit .

A:

Although that page appears to say you can only run on a 64-bit Oneiric system, I suspect it really only means that the developers used that system for testing. It should work on other versions and platforms.
Why don't you try it on your 32-bit machine and see?
If it does not work, please edit your question, explaining what you tried and what happened.
