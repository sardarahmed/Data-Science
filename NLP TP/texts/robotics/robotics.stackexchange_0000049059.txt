Q:

How do I install gscam in groovy?

How do I install gscam in groovy and how do I find out in which deb a package is or find out that the deb does not exist anymore?

A:

gscam has sort of been abandoned. There are several forks in the wild:

https://github.com/jhu-lcsr-forks/gscam (forked from experimental svn here which currently looks broken)
https://github.com/BeLioN-github/gscam
https://github.com/RLAB/gscam
https://github.com/uml-robotics/brown_perception

I really think these should be unified, since there are a lot of bugfixes in these non-trunk versions that have not been merged. I'm about to start using it again, too.
UPDATE: I've updated the JHU-LCSR fork to be a buildable in a catkin workspace.

If you want to maintain a merged version, it could go in https://github.com/organizations/ros-drivers

I might do just that...

I've updated my fork (https://github.com/jhu-lcsr-forks/gscam) and e-mailed the original authors to get their OK for moving it over to ros-drivers.
