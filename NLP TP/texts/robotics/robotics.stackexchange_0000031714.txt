Q:

error met when rosmake openni_kinect

Hello,
I met a big problem when I want to rosmake the openni_kinect package.
The following is the printed-out msg during the rosmake procedure.
Could anyone help me out of this problem? Really appreciate!
walon@walon-ROS:~/ros/drivers$ rosmake openni_kinect --rosdep-install

Actually the version of openni-dev now is 1.1.0.41-3+lucid1. But for installing nite-dev, it request for the openni-dev (= 0.1.0~lucid).  So I guess I should find out the older version of openni-dev... But I cant find out one.

Hm, package conflicts. "sudo apt-get update" could help you, but I guess not...

A:

Here is the state of packages I use (on ubuntu 10.10). Maybe you can force the versions manually (e.g. apt-get install packagename=packageversion)
Package: libcppunit-dev            Version: 1.12.1-1build1
Package: python-sip4-dev           Version: 4.10.5-0ubuntu1
Package: libgraphicsmagick++1-dev  Version: 1.3.12-1
Package: libhdf5-serial-dev        Version: 1.8.4-patch1-2ubuntu1
Package: libqhull-dev              Version: 2009.1-1
Package: python-wxgtk2.8           Version: 2.8.11.0-0ubuntu4
Package: nite-dev                  Version: 0.0.2~maverick
Package: openni-dev                Version: 0.0.2~maverick
Package: ps-engine                 Version: 0.0.2~maverick
Package: python-wxgtk2.8           Version: 2.8.11.0-0ubuntu4.1

The backup solution would be to compile openni_kinect from source yourself. If you want to try that, checkout the mercurial repository somewhere into a directory you add(ed) to the front of your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:
hg checkout https://kforge.ros.org/openni/openni_ros
rosmake openni_ros

There will be no version conflicts then, but you'd still need to install all requirements.
