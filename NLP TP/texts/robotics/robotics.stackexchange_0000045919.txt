Q:

Getting Started with KnowRob

Hi,
I was read at Getting Started at KnowRob Wiki
1-I try this command,
svn co svn+ssh://svn@svnradig/knowledge/trunk/owl ~/work/owl

actually I do not expect what should the output be
but it seems that I have a problem
2- please any explain to that command parts
amal@amal-HP-G62-Notebook-PC:~$ svn co svn+ssh://svn@svnradig/knowledge/trunk/owl ~/work/owl
svn: To better debug SSH connection problems, remove the -q option from 'ssh' in the [tunnels] section of your Subversion configuration file.
svn: Network connection closed unexpectedly

Thanks,

Ok thanks :)

A:

The page you probably got this URL from is filed under "Deprecated" in the wiki. "Deprecated" means that the information is outdated and you should not use it unless you know what you are doing. There is plenty of documentation for getting started with KnowRob (which I guess you know already, given your other posts).
The URL only works in our internal network, which can also be seen by the missing global domain of the host 'svnradig'. The links Lorenz posted are those that should be used.
