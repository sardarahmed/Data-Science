Q:

Why would a LaserScan topic produce different results inside code?

I'm running a turtlebot simulation, and when I use rostopic echo /scan I get a huge array of ranges, but when my subscriber gets it, I only find 24 elements. I've verified that the subscriber is set to /scan, and it seems to reliably get the first 24 every time, but I'd estimate that there are supposed to be about 500 points. What could cause this?

can you post the code you are using in your subscriber ?

A:

The problem here was that I misunderstood the data type that was being used. I was using sizeof(msg), expecting it to be an array, when it was in fact returning a vector and the correct term to use was msg.size().
