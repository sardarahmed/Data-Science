Q:

ROS2 Control Argument not available

I'm trying to run ROS 2 Rolling on Ubuntu 22.04. I'm building the Debian Package via sudo apt install ros-rolling-desktop. The installation process is fine, but after sourcing the installation, there is no control package so it's not possible to run e.g. ros2 control list_controllers.
Output is the following:
ros2 control list_controllers
usage: ros2 [-h] [--use-python-default-buffering]
            Call `ros2 <command> -h` for more detailed usage. ...
ros2: error: argument Call `ros2 <command> -h` for more detailed usage.: invalid choice: 'control' (choose from 'action', 'bag', 'component', 'daemon', 'doctor', 'extension_points', 'extensions', 'interface', 'launch', 'lifecycle', 'multicast', 'node', 'param', 'pkg', 'run', 'security', 'service', 'topic', 'wtf')

ROS_VERSION=2
ROS_PYTHON_VERSION=3
ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=0
ROS_DISTRO=rolling

A:

I think I am missing your question, but for reference, this is to be expected if all you did was install ros-rolling-desktop. The ros-DISTRO-desktop installation does not include ros2_control - it includes core ROS packages, some tutorials, and some tools. You can see exactly what gets installed with apt info ros-rolling-desktop.
ros2_control and ros2_controllers are considered too application specific to be included with the desktop installation. That being said, they are very easily installed with sudo apt install ros-rolling-ros2-control ros-rolling-ros2-controllers
