Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: robot_pose_ekf

hello,
I'm using turtlebot, distro hydro,i did the stack navigation with odometry, now i want working with odom-combined (robot_pose_ekf), is there anyone who did that, can help me.i didn't know what changes do I need to do.
Is what I have to change all odometry term to  odom_combined term, and remove the transformation between odom and  base-footprint since robot poses ekf node will make the transformation between odom_combined and base-footprint
Any help please !
Thanks in advance

A:

Thanks for your response  :)
what I understood so the only role of the robot_poses_ekf   is the transformation which he offers between odom combined and basefootprint.
So in the stack navigating we didn't need to work with odom_combined ? we must keep the odom parameter (for example for the local costmap in the global_frame)
in fact my work is to compare two trajectories done by a robot one with Odom and the other with the odom_combined.
