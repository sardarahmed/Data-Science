Q:

URDF tutorial robot falls

Hello,
I followed the R2D2 URDF tutorial and constructed a nice R2D2 robot. Now when I drive the robot, R2D2 tilts to his back. It is like his wheels have so much grip, that they run away under his body. I tried different configurations of mu1, mu2, kd, kp but none of it really worked.
Hope this picture makes my problem clear.
And here is my URDF-File
Would be great if somebody has a hint, where to look at, or had a similar problem.

A:

The tutorial aims to show the basic workings of the interaction with Gazebo, and falls a bit short of presenting a usable robot model. You should be able to drive at a lower speed and have it not tip over. Best of luck.

Thanks for your reply. Do you have any recommendations for a tutorial of a "usable" model? Or any idea, how to make R2D2 usable?
