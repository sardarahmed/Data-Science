Q:

Undefined symbol after source ros

Hello,
I create my own library with setuptools. When I run the command in terminal :
python3.8 

Then I import my library, it works properly.
But if before starting python3.8, I run source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.sh
I get an error when I import the python library   :
import vmpbcvt
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/vmpbcvt-1.0-py3.8-linux-x86_64.egg/vmpbcvt.cpython-38-x86_64-linux-gnu.so: undefined symbol: _ZN19VisionModuleManager15SetCurrentImageB5cxx11ERN2cv3MatEb

Can you explain me how it could be possible ?

A:

Thank you for all you answer.
I finally find the problem. In fact previously I add a library in my catkin workspace build folder, the one I now build externally.
When I source the devel/setup.sh, the library used was not the library located in /us/lib/ ... but the older library in catkin_ws.
Thank you Mike Scheutzow and bluegiraffe-sc for your time.
