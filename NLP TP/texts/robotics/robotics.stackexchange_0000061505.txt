Are you asking how to get/set parameters programmatically using python? Or are you asking how to get/set parameters using the rqt gui?

Programmatically using python because I need to create a rqt plugin

A:

This link should have all the information you need.
There are many ways to get:
global_name = rospy.get_param("/global_name")
relative_name = rospy.get_param("relative_name")
private_param = rospy.get_param('~private_name')    
default_param = rospy.get_param('default_param', 'default_value')

# fetch a group (dictionary) of parameters
gains = rospy.get_param('gains')
p, i, d = gains['P'], gains['I'], gains['D']

And set:
rospy.set_param('a_string', 'baz')
rospy.set_param('~private_int', 2)
rospy.set_param('list_of_floats', [1., 2., 3., 4.])
rospy.set_param('bool_True', True)
rospy.set_param('gains', {'p': 1, 'i': 2, 'd': 3})

rospy.get_param('gains/P') #should return 1

You can do a lot of other things like delete params, check and see if a param exists, list all params, etc. All of it is covered in that link.
This might be of interest to.  It looks like someone already had something like this but used the rx stuff (I just skimmed it, you might want to look closer).
Lastly, if you do build a plugin, please let people know about it  here to prevent duplicate efforts. I also notice on that page that the description of the  Node_Manager plugin says something about managing params, you might want to look at that to.

Glad to help. If that answers your question, please mark it as the answer (the little check mark).

Done. Thanks

Is http://wiki.ros.org/rqt_reconfigure not an option?
Comment by Airuno2L on 2014-08-07:
It looks like that only works for parameters that are setup with dynamic_reconfigure.
"In the future, arbitrary parameters that are not associated with any nodes (which are not handled by dynamic_reconfigure) might become handled. However, currently as the name indicates, this pkg solely is dependent on dynamic_reconfigure that allows access to only those params latched to nodes."
Comment by 130s on 2014-08-08:
Yeah, I just thought if OP specifically wants to handle non-dyn-reconf parameters wasn't clear.
