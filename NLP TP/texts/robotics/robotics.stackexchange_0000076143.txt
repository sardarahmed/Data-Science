A:

rospy.Time.now() just returns the current 'wall clock time' (or the simulated clock, depending on whether you have a Clock server running).
rospy.Time(0) constructs a Time instance that has special significance in TF contexts: it will cause lookupTransform(..) and friends to return the latest available data for a specific transform, instead of the data at a specific point in time.
