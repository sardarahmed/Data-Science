Q:

Adding new dependency after running catkin_create_pkg

How can I add a new dependency to my package, after the package has been created?
In my case:
1st step: catkin_create_pkg beginner_tutorials std_msgs roscpp
...
Next step: I want to add a dependency to pcl and pcl_ros
Is there an easy way to achieve this?
After editing CmakeLists.txt/package.xml or creating a new package from scratch I get this error when running catkin_make in the root work folder:
CMake Error at /opt/ros/hydro/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:72 (find_package):
Could not find a configuration file for package pcl.
Set pcl_DIR to the directory containing a CMake configuration file for pcl.
The file will have one of the following names:
pclConfig.cmake
pcl-config.cmake

A:

Have a look at the CMakeLists.txt/package.xml and see how e.g. roscpp is used there. Play around a bit. Shouldn't be too hard too figure out.

9 years later, surely there is a better answer than this?
