Q:

Roscd cannot find catkin_make 'd package

I run ros kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04. I try to use openpose ros wrapper on my platform. I share the error log below.
Best,

Please only include the console output that actually shows the error message in future questions.

A:

$ catkin_make
    $ roscd openpose_ros

$ roslaunch openpose_ros_node

I don't see a source devel/setup.bash in your copy-pasted console text.
You need to "activate" your workspace after you've built it using catkin_make, otherwise utilities like roscd and roslaunch will not know where to find the new packages that you just built.

Edit: I only now see this:

$ roslaunch openpose_ros_node

roslaunch takes either one or two arguments:

a direct path to a .launch file
a package name and a (package relative path to a) .launch file

Your invocation is neither: openpose_ros_node is not a package name (that would probably be openpose_ros), and it's also not a launch file name.
From the build output you show, it would appear openpose_ros_node is a ROS node (ie: an executable binary).
Those you should start with rosrun $pkg $node_name, not roslaunch.

Thank you for your answer. How can I activate it? I already exported it on .bashrc.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-03-25:\

I already exported it on .bashrc

Doing it that way, your workspace is only sourced (ie: activated) when you start a new bash session (ie: open a new terminal). Any pkgs that you add in such a session will not be found, untill you catkin_make and source devel/setup.bash yourself. Or ..

.. when you start a new terminal.
A simple rule is this: add or created a new package -> build your workspace and source $CATKIN_WS/devel/setup.bash.
If you don't, your new package(s) won't be found.

Hello, I had this issue previously and solved it with the way you showed. Today I changed the name of my node to make it easier to understand. I cleaned with catkin_make clean, rebuilt with catkin_make, and source devel/setup.bash . However now ros cannot locate my renamed node, nor it can build it.

Delete your build and devel folders, rebuild your workspace, then try again.

If this is a Python script, make sure that it has executable permissions set as well.
Comment by tolga-uni-lu on 2018-04-10:
I solved it with going inside the catkin_ws/src/gesture_detector and executing catkin_create_package
I did not need to call chmod +x after this.
