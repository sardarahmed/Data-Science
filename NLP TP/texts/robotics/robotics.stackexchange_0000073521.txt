Q:

ROS indigo and opencv seems not to work correctly

I'm trying to check if I could use opencv with ROS Indigo and also with PCL 1.7, based on this tutorial here, and it seems there would open a window to show the Image, but nothing happens in my Cmakelists.txt I added find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED) and target_link_libraries(xxx xxx ${OpenCV_LIBRARIES}).
I also tried with another packages that I found to work I a project, but also happen something similar, when I need to show an image sometimes appear a window, but with nothing inside and starts to turning to black, I think that some programms were made based in ROS hydro, so it's not easy that works with ROS Indigo isn't?
Than you

A:

The node in your link subscribes to a topic and displays the images. If the topic doesn't exist or there are no images, it will not display anything.
You should check:

that you have an image publisher running (camera driver or rosbag playback)
that you can view the images with rqt_image_view
that the topic name on your opencv subscriber is correctly mapped to the topic that your image publisher is using.

Yes, you are right what for me seems something strange is that the constructor of the class might "open" a cv::namewindow, or with ROS is different, because in OpenCV if you just create a cv::namewindow it appears and  you can load a Image or just it will be there. I really appreciate your answer
