Q:

which sensor will give out the MultiEchoLaserScan sensor msgs? Which brand and which type?

The backpack demo_2d  cartographer uses MultiEchoLaserScan Message for Lidar data. I wanna know that which sensor is giving out this kind of data? I want to have this configuration for large area mapping also.

A:

Hokuyo UTM-30-LX-EW supports multi-echo mode.
Just randomly find out this and reminds me I asked a question here. Hope can help someone who is playing with cartographer and wondering the same thing. Below are the two ref links.
