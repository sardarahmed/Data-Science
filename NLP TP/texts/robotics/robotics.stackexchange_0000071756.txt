Q:

Connecting ROS and the Amazon Echo

Hi everyone,
I'd like to be able to tell my Amazon Echo the name of a location in my apartment as a goal for my robot to go to.
How would you recommend I proceed, knowing that the Alexa skill will run as an Amazon Lambda function?
Precisely, how to connect my computer running ROS with the Amazon Lambda function, any idea? (Robotics is a hobby for me, I'm not a CS magician, my robot is running ROS Indigo and the navigation stack)
Thanks for the help!
Olivier
