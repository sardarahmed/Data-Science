Q:

How do I install a missing ROS package?

hello,
How do I install packages that I can't use roscd to find?
I try to type something like rosdep install pr2_2dnav_gazebo,
and I got:
sam@sam-desktop:~/code/ros$ rosdep install pr2_2dnav_gazebo
executing this script:
 set -o errexit
#No Packages to install
sam@sam-desktop:~/code/ros$ 

Then I try to open another try to use roscd but failed again...
How I install any package I missed like pr2_2dnav_gazebo?
Or how I install all packages on ros.org?
thank you~

A:

ROS packages may have two kinds of dependencies: (1) system dependencies, and (2) other ROS packages. The rosdep command is for system dependencies.
When you need a ROS package that is not currently available on your system:

See what stack contains the package you need:

Stacks are the basic unit of release and installation in ROS. Installing individual packages often works, but I do not recommend it.

For this example, find pr2_2dnav_gazebo in the ROS wiki.

The containing stack is wg_robots_gazebo.

Check whether that stack has a released binary package for your system (if it's a supported Ubuntu distribution).

If so, apt-get the corresponding Debian package name:
$ sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-wg-robots-gazebo

If not, download the stack from its source repository:

The source URI is listed on the stack wiki page, for this example https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/stacks/wg_robots_gazebo/trunk.

Use rosinstall like the example here to add that stack to your ROS tree.

Compile the new package and its dependencies:
$ rosmake pr2_2dnav_gazebo --rosdep-install

unstable means you shouldn't expect the code to keep working, nor have a consistent API you can build on.

Thank you~And I have a simple question: what's the word 'unstable' means? I have tried the example slam work correctly. It hasn't output any error or crashed.
Comment by kwc on 2011-08-28:
It needs to be fixed; you could potentially install from source, but, in general, the wg_robots_gazebo stack is not a stable set of software that you should depend on.
Comment by sam on 2011-08-27:
So is there any replacement stacks? Or just losing these kind of useful functions?
Comment by kwc on 2011-08-27:
wg-robots-gazebo is currently not available in Diamondback due to compatibility issues.
Comment by sam on 2011-08-26:
When I use apt-get dist-upgrade,I found that 'sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-wg-robots-gazebo' says wg-robots-gazebo can't be found. What's the new stack for wg-robots-gazebo?
Comment by kwc on 2011-02-25:
In addition to the wiki page, you can also type "roslocate info stack_name", which will tell you the full version control information for it.
