Q:

Is there a way to get ROS_INFO, ROS_ERROR, etc to output line numbers?

The title says it all. Is there a flag somewhere I can set to get the ROS_INFO/ROS_ERROR/... macros to output line numbers, or is that something I'm going to have to feed to ROS_INFO myself by using LINE?

A:

This page's section about Console Output Formatting is what you are looking for.
Essentially
export ROSCONSOLE_FORMAT='[${severity}] [${time}]@${line}: ${message}'

${line} for \__LINE__
* ${function} for _func_
${file} for \__FILE__
* ${node} for the node name, no pre-processor equivalent.
