Q:

issues launching Gazebo

I am getting this response in the terminal when attempting to run Gazebo. Does anyone have any idea what is going on and how I may resolve the problem.
[gazebo-2] process has died [pid 2687, exit code 139, cmd /opt/ros/indigo/lib/gazebo_ros/gzserver -e ode /home/tenicho/ros_ws/src/baxter_simulator/baxter_gazebo/worlds/baxter.world __name:=gazebo __log:=/home/tenicho/.ros/log/5b625bd4-730c-11e6-89ca-08002710caa1/gazebo-2.log].

A:

139 could be a SEGFAULT (128 + 11). Common causes for gazebo to SEGFAULT: running in a VM, not having proper/correct 3D hw drivers installed, (unstable) CPU overclocks, etc. The second error is just telling you that something is calling a service that doesn't exist anymore.
