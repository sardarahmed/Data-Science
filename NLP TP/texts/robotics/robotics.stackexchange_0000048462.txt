Q:

Navigation Stack Without sensor

Hi,
I wanted to ask if there is a way of using the navigation Stack without the sensor. As I am working on Youbot (Kuka) and we just want to do Goal Point movement using Navigation Stack.
I tried the example from the kuka-youbot website but its giving the error "/base_scan was not update" so because of this the /vel_cmd are not sent to the base to move the base to desired X,Y.
So is it possible to set the navigation stack without using the sensor.
With Regards
Ali

A:

Yes, it is possible.
Of course, you won't have any collision avoidance and your movements will be based on dead-reckoning.
Depending on the setup, you'd probably have to remove all obvervation_sources from the costmap setup and switch the global frame to whatever your robot can provide, e.g. /odom.
