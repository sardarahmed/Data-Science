Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: CMake Error

Hello everyone, I am totally new to ROS and I started install this afternoon. Unfortunately, I have a CMake error  during the installation and I do not know how to fix it.
Does anyone has time to support?
I am running on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
I will not paste the complete install prompt but the 2 faults below.
ImportError: "from catkin_pkg.package import parse_package" failed: No module named 'catkin_pkg'
Make sure that you have installed "catkin_pkg", it is up to date and on the PYTHONPATH.
CMake Error at /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/safe_execute_process.cmake:11 (message):

We need more info: what exactly are you doing? Installing from src? compiling your own Workspace? Have you chacked what the error msg tells you to?

I have a CMake error during the installation [..]. I am running on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

With "installation", do you mean basic ROS installation? There are binary packages available for 16.04 (amd64 and ARM), and those typically don't require any CMake invocations to install.

A:

Actually I removed ROS and reinstall and it worked, I must have missed a step in the insall.Thanks both for your quick action!
