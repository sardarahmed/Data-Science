Q:

How to avoid installing files like setup.bash more than once?

I use "catkin build" and "catkin config --install". Then each package will install for example setup.bash. How can I avoid that. I would like to only install these files in one package.
The reason I would like to do that is that I use CPACK to build a debian package for each ros package. And I get duplicate files in the debian packages.

A:

You can pass the CMake argument -DCATKIN_BUILD_BINARY_PACKAGE=1 to suppress the generation of setup files. All ROS packages except catkin itself use that flag during the release process.
