Q:

Sensors in ROS2 without driver

I got a new LiDAR from a seller who unfortunately does not provide any ROS2 support. Rather there is only a Point Cloud Visualiser .exe in Windows. I would like to use the LiDAR in my project of developing Autonomous Farming Vehicle but dont know how I can use this in ROS2 without any Package or Driver. Is it possible to use it somehow or develop a ROS2 supported package of the LiDAR??

A:

If there is an API or a device protocol specification available, then it would be possible to develop your own driver for the hardware.  This is how all existing drivers for ROS 2 have started.
Typically, people write a library that is independent of ROS, and then provide a ROS wrapper to make the sensor data available over ROS topics/services.
Example drivers that you may want to reference:

https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/tree/humble-devel/velodyne_driver - Velodyne LIDAR driver, the lidar connects over ethernet and the driver uses PCAP to receive packets and expand them into sensor_msgs/LaserScan
https://github.com/ros-drivers/ros2_ouster_drivers - Ouster lidar drivers
https://github.com/ros-drivers/urg_node - Hokuyo lidar driver, wraps the official urg_c library

In the case that a manufacturer does not provide an API, then you will have to write the lower-level hardware driver yourself.  An example of this in the above list is the Velodyne driver, where the manufacturer provides a datasheet describing the packet format and the driver interprets the packets accordingly.
