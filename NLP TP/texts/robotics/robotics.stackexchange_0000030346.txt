Q:

Cannot get the left image with bumblebee2 camera by "bumblebee1394" package

Hi,
There some confusion for me by bumblebee1394, that i always cannot get the left image.
I try
$ roscore
$ coriander
$ rosrun bumblebee1394 bumblebee1394
$ rosrun image_view image_view image:=/dcam_1300157075816067926/left/image_raw
$ rosrun image_view image_view image:=/dcam_1300157075816067926/right/image_raw

where there always get the same image which is published by right camera. And I read the code carefully that i cannot get any idea. Have somebody faced this problem by bumblebee2 camera?
and for more, when I command $ rosrun bumblebee1394 bumblebee1394
that the terminal show:
~$ rosrun bumblebee1394 bumblebee1394 
[dcam] Reset bus

A:

the bumblebee stereo camera only transmits stereo images when configured to send images in format7 mode3.
about the second part, the node bumblebee1394 loads a number of parameters from the parameter server. if you start the node with the command: "rosrun bumblebee1394 bumblebee1394" you start it with its default parameters. this means it takes iso speed 400, 30 fps and 640x480 mono 8 bit images.
the bumblebee1394 folder also contains a launch file which you can use as example on now to set you own settings on the parameter server.

the bumblebee2 node sets the values for rectification(done by stereo_image_proc(http://www.ros.org/wiki/stereo_image_proc)) hard coded in the function: updateBumblebee2CalibrationData(). stereo_image_proc uses the calibration set in the CameraInfo message.

Thanks u, and for my first question. How to get the rectification stereo images to do process follow-up? i found some ros-packages which turned out all to be failed. I decided to get the right rectification image which by bumblebee2 itself or not ROS. Do u have some ideas about it?
