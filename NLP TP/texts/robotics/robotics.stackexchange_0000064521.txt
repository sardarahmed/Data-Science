Param xml is <param command="rosversion roslaunch" name="rosversion"/>  

So I deleted the log through:$ rosclean purge
Than refer to the website http://answers.ros.org/question/44996/cannot-run-roscore-due-to-error-in-rosversion/
remove the old rospkg:
 $ sudo pip uninstall rospkg

than install the latest version.$sudo pip install -U rospkg
When I run roscore there is always  the same message.
please help me. Thank you very  much.

A:

This usually happens when the rosversion can't be found, or when the rosversion command can't find your ROS installation.
I would check that you've sourced the setup.bash for your ROS installation.
You can also debug a bit more by running the command in question:
rosversion roslaunch

Now,the roscore can run normally.It is really due to setup.bash. I add many ROS_PACKAGE_PATH to the setup.bash.when I deleted  them the roscore can run successfully.Can not add too many ROS_PACKAGE_PATH to the setup.bash?

If i add  many ROS_PACKAGE_PATH,it will show: `$rosversion roslaunch
cannot locate [roslaunch]`

Comment by ahendrix on 2014-12-10:
I've never seen an instance where a user's ROS_PACKAGE_PATH was too large. What's more likely is that you're overwriting your original ROS_PACKAGE_PATH instead of appending to it, and losing the part of the path which points to the core packages.
