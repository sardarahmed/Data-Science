Q:

problem with pr2 kinect model

Hello everyone,
I am trying to launch

pr2_kinect_empty_world.launch

However, the kinect on top of the pr2 seems huge. I was able to launch the same file a few days ago, I guess something changed with the model. Anyone happen to realize similar problem?
Thanks in advance
Cheers

A:

Hi again,
I guess, I've solved the problem by comparing kinect_prosilica_camera.urdf.xacro and kinect_camera.urdf.xacro files.
It turns out mesh information wasn't scaled to the meter-scale when the kinect.dae file is generated, but mm-scale instead. It seems scaling can be done after this file is generated by adding scale="0.001 0.001 0.001" at the end of the corresponding line in the urdf files, as shown below,
<mesh filename="package://pr2_description/meshes/sensors/kinect_v0/kinect.dae" scale="0.001 0.001 0.001"/>

Probably, this has been overlooked by the developers in the recent updates.
Cheers

I came across with this problem again after an upgrade, and decided to open a ticket for this time. But it seems John already created a ticket for this https://code.ros.org/trac/wg-ros-pkg/changeset/54208 .

both fuerte 1.7.2 and electric 1.6.2 should have the updates, though it might take a day or two for the fuerte debs to be out.
