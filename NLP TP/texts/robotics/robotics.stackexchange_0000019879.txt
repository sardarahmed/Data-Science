Q:

Visual-Positioning Method

I'm working on mobile manipulator and trying to do visual-positioning of the end-effector.

My camera will located around 1-2 meters from the robot. 
I'm sure i cant use color tracking method because the color of end-effector not unique to the environment and i can't get the orientation of end-effector. If I'm using neural network, the computation cost will high (not reliable for high-speed control). What method of visual-positioning can i use for this case?

A:

So it sounds like you have an external camera system to track the end effector position and orientation?
In that case I would use QR codes or april tags. Stick a couple of these on your end effector, and make sure that you put enough of them that 1 is always visible from your camera. The apriltags library provides the ability to extract position and orientation.
