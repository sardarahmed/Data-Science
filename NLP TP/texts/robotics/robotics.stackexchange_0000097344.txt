Q:

[ROS2 Foxy] Setting log level in launch file

Node( package='nav2_planner', executable='planner_server', name='planner_server', output='screen', parameters=[configured_params], remappings=remappings),
How would you set the debug log level here?

A:

You can add an arguments section to your Node, where you can specify a log level. It'll be look like:
Node(
    # (...)
    arguments=['--ros-args', '--log-level', 'DEBUG']
)
