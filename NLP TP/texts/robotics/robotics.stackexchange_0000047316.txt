Q:

robot_pose_ekf hardcoded topics and tf

Why are "odom", "imu_data" and "base_footprint" hardcoded in robot_pose_ekf? Why not pass these as parameters similar to "odom_combined"? see below:

nh_private.param("input_odom", input_odom_, std::string("odom")); 
nh_private.param("input_imu", input_imu_, std::string("imu_data")); 
nh_private.param("robot_frame", robot_frame_, std::string("base_footprint"));

The above parameters are not currently defined in robot_pose_ekf.

Edit #1:
I think you are correct about about base_footprint. I was a bit suprised to see it was not a parameter. You should file an enhancement ticket.
On the other hand, topics such as odom, imu_data and vo can remapped on the command line and in roslaunch. See here for roslaunch remapping and here for command line remapping.
The original answer below does not answer the question.

Those are the default values of the parameters. You can still pass in these parameters and the default values will be overwritten. See the parameter server documentation and the C++ API.

Those parameters are not defined in robot_pose_ekf. The code I posted was my suggestion.
