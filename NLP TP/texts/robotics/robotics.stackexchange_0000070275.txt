A:

The pi_tracker package was created a long time ago as an entry for the early ROS 3D contest.  I don't have plans to develop it in the future but I just now created an Indigo branch that differs from the Hydro branch only in the addition of default queue_size parameters for the ROS publishers in the two tracker nodes.
Note that the pi_tracker package depends on either the openni_tracker package or the skeleton_markers package (for which I just created an indigo-devel branch).  Under ROS Indigo, I have only had success using a Microsoft Kinect with these package.  It seems the Asus Xtion Pro Live can be difficult to get working with skeleton tracking on newer USB 3.0 machines and Ubuntu 14.04.
