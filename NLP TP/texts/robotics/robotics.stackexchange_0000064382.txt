Q:

What is the component for the messaging system?

I want to have a close look at the messaging i.e. how ROS sends messages from publishers to subscribers. For that I would like to have a look in the code. What is the component that represent the messaging transport system that ties together publishers and subscribers? Where do I find the code?

A:

I would start by looking at the publisher and subscriber classes within roscpp and rospy, and dig into the supporting packages from there.
Most packages provide an auto-generated source link on their wiki page: http://wiki.ros.org/roscpp . For roscpp, the code is in ros_comm/clients/roscpp
