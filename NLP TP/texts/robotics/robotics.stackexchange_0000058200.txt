Q:

Can I get force information in gazebo? and how?

Hello! I want to simulate the force control of robots using gazebo. But I don't know how to get the force information in gazebo. I can get the joint position and velocity by pr2_mechanism_model::RobotState. However, there is no function to get the joint effort. Thank you very much

A:

Use GetForce in Joint in Gazebo's Physics library. You'll find more in here and there.
Also, you'll get better response for Gazebo questons in http://answers.gazebosim.org.
