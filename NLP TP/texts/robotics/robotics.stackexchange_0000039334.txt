Can you use doxygen or codeviz?

Thank you. I found that I can use doxywizard to generate each function's call graph,but where is the whole picture call graph? Another question is codeviz should patch compiler,so it seems very hard to work on ROS. How to do it?

I also found that doxywizard just generate partial call graph. Because I found that the function it generate call graph failed (roscpp init.cpp init() ). Is there any tool can generate complete call graph? Thank you~

A:

As with any binary in Linux, you can use valgrind / callgrind to collect the information during run time. A visualizer for the results is e.g. http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net/html/Documentation.html.
You can install the package in Ubuntu with
sudo apt-get install valgrind kcachegrind
