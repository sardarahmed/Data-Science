Q:

Adjust robot_state_publisher publish frequency

Hello,
I was working with my URDF model and the robot_state_publisher and I noticed that: for the fixed joints, the tf is computed at the beginning and has no associated publish rate (in the rqt tf_tree plugin it is displayed 10000), however when I look at the other joints the frequency displayed varies depending on RST.
My question is, there is a way to adjust the robot_state_publisher publish frequency to avoid the shatter showed in the following video:
TF problem
I tried to adjust the publish_frequency in the robot _state_publisher node, but with no avail, because the average rate of the joints tf is the same no matter what frequency I pass as a parameter.
Thanks.
Edit:
Testing different things I have noticed that this issue is related to the way I launch files. I mean, when only the description (with the RST and JSP) is launched, the publish frequency is not correct, while when I launch gazebo with the same set up (but with no JSP) the average publish frequency is the one I requested.

A:

I just solved the issue by adjusting the rate in the joint_state_publisher node. Actually, was that node the one delaying the system publish rate.
Adding this solved the issue:
<node unless="$(arg sim)" name="joint_state_publisher" pkg="joint_state_publisher" type="joint_state_publisher">
  <param name="rate" value="50" />
</node>

Thanks for the help.
