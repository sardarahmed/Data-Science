Q:

LED RGB in Gazebo

Hi All,
I'm creating a model for our robot AISoy1 and I need to add its LED RGB on it. I'm trying to find robots using that, but I found nothing. I know it can be done in other simulators like Webots, do you know if that is possible in Gazebo?
If it isn't, how would you do that? I was thinking about showing a .png simulating the LED, one for each  of the basic colours...
thanks

A:

It's probably possible but you should ask gazebo questions on http://answers.gazebosim.org
