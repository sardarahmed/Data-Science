Q:

answer.ros.org askbot inbox icon is red when inbox is empty

The envelope icon next to the username on the askbot site is stuck red.  I cleared my inbox (dismissed all notifications) but the icon is still red (it used to be white).
Update: This is a bug. A bug has been filed upstream. A fix was checked into askbot April 25th to prevent further occurances. However to fix stale inbox counts on the current install the following command must be run:
python manage.py fix_inbox_counts

Can some admin please run this?

This is happening to my account as well.

A:

After testing it seems that it will remain red until you dismiss the notifications.  You can talk to upstream about whether that's the correct behavior.

I've recently started experiencing this bug (even with all notifications dismissed) - was the patch mentioned in the update to the question ever applied to the AskBot running ROS Answers?
