Q:

pcl for laser sensor

I'm really confused. I want to make a map of the environment by using laser scans. I know I have to use pcl, but I cannot understand what is the use of pcl does it store all the scan over a period of time and hence i can plot it ? Please help. I tried reading PCL online, didnâ€™t really help.
