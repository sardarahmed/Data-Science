Q:

Could NOT find combined_robot_hw (missing: combined_robot_hw_DIR)

Hi, I tried cloning the repository following the instruction on the master branch (https://github.com/xArm-Developer/xarm_ros), however while doing catkin_make I am getting the following error, please help me through this. I feel like something is wrong with the controller package on their github.
```
-- Could NOT find combined_robot_hw (missing: combined_robot_hw_DIR)
-- Could not find the required component 'combined_robot_hw'. The following CMake error indicates that you either need to install the package with the same name or change your environment so that it can be found.
CMake Error at /opt/ros/noetic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:83 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "combined_robot_hw"
  with any of the following names:

    combined_robot_hwConfig.cmake
    combined_robot_hw-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "combined_robot_hw" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "combined_robot_hw_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "combined_robot_hw" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.

let's not jump to conclusions too quick.
Did you follow the steps in the Install other dependent packages section of the readme?

A:

As @gvdhoorn has pointed out, it seems that you have not installed dependencies. Please follow the documentation carefully.
For the error mentioned above, the combined-robot-hw package can be installed with the following command:
sudo apt install ros-noetic-combined-robot-hw
