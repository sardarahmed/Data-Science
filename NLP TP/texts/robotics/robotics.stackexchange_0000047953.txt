Q:

Message format rosbridge v2.0

Hi, I have to publish on topic \cmd_vel a message:'{"linear":{"x":1,"y":0,"z":0}, "angular":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0}}', of the type geometry_msgs/Twist using rosbridge v2.0. I have written:
connection = new ros.Connection("ws://localhost:9090");
connection.publish('/cmd_vel', 'geometry_msgs/Twist', '{"linear":{"x":1,"y":0,"z":0}, "angular":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0}}');
But the format message is for rosbridge v1.0.
What I can write to publish the same message in the correct format of rosbridge v2.0?
Thanks a lot!
Chiara
