Q:

For URDF files what alternatives to xml are there?

I find that working directly with XML is unpleasant at best. What alternatives exist for creating URDF files either graphically or otherwise?
What I have found so far:

SimMechanics to
URDF
SW URDF

A:

I tried using python as a data description language for URDF's and it seems to work well. Less verbose and easier to read than xml. There is the added benifit that one does not need to use a preprocessor like xacro since the full capability of python is available.
