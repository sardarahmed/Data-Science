Q:

Linking CXX executable - /usr/bin/ld: cannot find

Hi ROS Experts
I just made a fresh install of Ubuntu 12.04 and ROS.
My old installations was also on ubunru 12.04, and it worked great.
But now when i try to rosmake on of my project, i get the follwing error:
  Linking CXX executable ../bin/robot_task_execution
  /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lrw_sandbox
  /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lrw_control
  /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lrw_algorithms
  /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lrw_pathplanners
  /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lrw_pathoptimization
  /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lrw_task
  /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lrw_simulation
  /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lrw_opengl
  /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lrw_lua
  /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -llua51
  /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lrw_proximitystrategies
  /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lyaobi
  /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lpqp
  /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lrw
  /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lrw_qhull
  collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

Do you have any idear how to fix this?
I installed ROS like this
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu precise main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
wget http://packages.ros.org/ros.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-desktop-full
echo "source /opt/ros/fuerte/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
. ~/.bashrc
sudo apt-get install python-rosinstall python-rosdep

Best regards
Bjarke

Could you please update your post with the contents of manifest.xml?

A:

These are things I can recommend to check.

Make sure your project (and all its dependencies) are located somewhere browsable by ROS, in other words: Check $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.

Use rosdep install : Maybe there are some failed system-wide dependencies.

Use rosmake --pre-clean : Maybe old compiled objects are making problems

Updating your question with the contents of manifest.xml will be helpful.
