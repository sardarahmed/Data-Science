Q:

rqt plugin not listed

Hi,
I tried everything mentioned in other posts and I still can't see my own plugin in rqt. I did --force-discover, I deleted the config file but it won't show.
I am wondering if I am missing some PATH variables or if I need to compile it differently. My plugin works when I run "rosrun gcs_gui gcs_gui". "rqt -s gcs_gui" returns that no plugin with this name was found. Any ideas?
Update: I was obviously missing the plugin.xml. But there I don't know how I need to set it up. What is my class type? I programmed the plugin in C++ but is the base_class_type rqt_gui_py::Plugin anyway? Do I need to use a python file somewhere?

Hi Vinni,
it's rather difficult to help you without any further information.
I suggest you use this (great) repo catkin_create_rqt which creates a boilerplate for an RQT GUI with properly set CMakeLists.txt and plugin export file.
Then you can just copy and past your functions to the newly created boilerplate.
Regards,
Marco.

Hi Marco,
that is actually how I started off (well, with catkin_create_qt_pkg). I altered my code from there but it is not running. I will try setting it up as another package and see if I can get that to work. Main problem for me is setting up the plugin.xml correctly...

I get a strange error like this:
Failed to load nodelet [rqt_gcs/View_1] of type [rqt_gcs/View]: Could not find library corresponding to plugin rqt_gcs/View. Make sure the plugin description XML file has the correct name of the library and that the library actually...

Worked in the end. Great tool.

good to hear that it worked eventually! What was the issue?

I tried somehow merging it right away with my old files. That didn't work. Simply running the script and executing the files worked. Unfortunately my workflow is not done yet. I can't get it to work the way I'd like to... Any idea? See https://answers.ros.org/question/292328/gui-creation-through-rqt
