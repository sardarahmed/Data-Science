Q:

Can I use a rosnode to communicate with a server?

I need to GET and POST some data to and from the server. Can I simply create a C++ code that creates a node and uses < boost/asio.hpp> library to connect to the server, obtain the data, convert from JSON to ROS msg and publish that message to the topic? And vice verca (publishing the message to server using < boost/asio.hpp>

As has been said. This is definitely possible. A c++ ROS node is simpley an application which includes the ROS libraries. So you can do anything in it that any other application can do.

A:

Sounds perfectly possible. There are already similar packages, for example the mqtt_bridge that converts between ROS and MQTT.

Yes but it uses mqtt broker which is an extra step. I want a pure api thing. So what is the purpose of libraries like roslibjs if I can do it everything inside the node code?

the mqtt_bridge was only an example in which ros-messages are streamed into the not-ROS-world
