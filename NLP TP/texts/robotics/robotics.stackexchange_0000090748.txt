Q:

How to get x,y coordinates of turtlebot

Hello, I'm trying to get the x and y coordinates of a turtlebot in the simulated world. Currently I have subscribed to the odom topic and have been able to get pose.pose.position.x and pose.pose.position.y. However when I get these values they are not x=0 and y=0 as I expect as the turtlebot has not yet moved. Is there something wrong with my assumption and/or am I not using the right rostopic to get desired x and y values?
Thanks.

Why did you delete and close this question?

A:

So what are the values you see, instead of 0, 0? Keep in mind that a simulator typically uses numerical approximations that may result in drift even though the model should be at rest/idle.

When I run "roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch "
x: -1.05240047001e-06
y: 8.27266784267e-07
