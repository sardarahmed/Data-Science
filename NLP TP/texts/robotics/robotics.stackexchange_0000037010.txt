Q:

How to redirect warnings to the screen?

Hello all,
I am writing code C code that uses ROS and my OS is Linux.
I also use launch file in order to run my program.
My problem:
I don´t see the warnings on the screen after compilation. The only thing I am able to see is this message:

[rosmake-3] Finished <<< guiPackage
[PASS] [ 4.21 seconds ] -- WARNING: 2
compiler warnings

My Questions:

Is this problem connected to the launch file or not?
Whatever the answer for 1 is, how can I see the warnings on the shell screen of Linux in this case?

Thank you all for your time,
Felix.

Hi Felix,
this cannot be connected to any launch file, since the launch file is not used during compile time.
There are two ways of seeing the warnings:

There is a message at the beginning of the rosmake output, which looks something like this:
[ rosmake ] Logging to directory/home/martin/.ros/rosmake/rosmake_output-20120112-135426

All logs (including the warnings) are in files below that directory.

You can run make instead of rosmake to see the warnings. Note however that make doesn't build the dependencies. Also you'll probably need to run make clean beforehand to see anything interesting going on.

Also you can run rosmake with verbose turned on '-V' option.
