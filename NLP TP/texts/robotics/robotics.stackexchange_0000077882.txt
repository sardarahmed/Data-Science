Q:

Problem even catkin_make'ing my ROS Images to OpenCV node -- Library issues?

I am trying to create a node that will help me take an ROS Image and convert it to an OpenCV image.
I am following the "Converting between ROS images and OpenCV images" tutorial.
At step 9, I have created a cakin package with the required dependencies. When I paste the code given in the tutorial, and catkin_make, I get a ton of errors of style "...  undefined reference to..." (this is a truncated example of my errors)

but I have checked and all of those included libraries exist in /usr/include, as well as other locations. What is the problem?

A:

Assuming you have the libraries installed, which I think is likely you need to make sure to link your node against all those libraries in you CMakeLists.txt
If you edit your question to include your CMakeLIsts.txt we might be able to help you more.

This was a downloaded package that I had working before without any changes. Maybe I downloaded the wrong version. Checking now..
