Q:

pointgrey camera works only once

When I launch my camera using:
roslaunch pointgrey_camera_driver camera.launch

it starts working and publishing all topics, very normal!
Then I launch my node that subscribe to /camera/image_raw and it works fine.
But when I shut down my node and launch it again, it doesn't work! even though the topic is still published.
Also
rostopic echo /camera/image_raw 

doesn't give anything after that.
I noticed I get that error:
[ERROR] [1491313248.152009223]: PointGreyCamera::grabImage Failed to retrieve buffer | FlyCapture2::ErrorType 41 There is an image consistency issue with this image.

What's the issue?
I'm using:
Ubuntu 16.04
ROS kinetic
Camera Blackfly 0.9 MP Color GigE PoE (Sony ICX692)
Driver camera:

A:

The image packets are getting dropped, might be due to bandwidth congestion. Try increasing the packet delay or decreasing the packet size.
Have a look at these two:
Increase Packet Delay
Increase PC Buffer capacity
