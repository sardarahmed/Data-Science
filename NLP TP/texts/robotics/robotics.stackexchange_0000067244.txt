Q:

How to build Gazebo packages with Indigo

I'm trying to follow this tutorial to build a myrobot_gazebo package for Indigo with Gazebo 5.
I create my package with:
catkin_create_pkg myrobot_gazebo gazebo5_msgs gazebo5_plugins gazebo5_ros gazebo5_ros_control myrobot_description

then, when I try to update my dependencies with:
rosdep update
rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src --rosdistro indigo

I get the error:
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
myrobot_gazebo: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [gazebo5_ros]

How do I fix this?

A:

The ROS packages names for the Gazebo 5 packages don't include the version number, even though the apt package names do.
For example, if you've installed ros-indigo-gazebo5-ros, your dependency should still be on gazebo_ros

Thanks. I can't believe I missed this. I actually ran catkin_create_pkg with the non-version numbers first, and received a different error from rosdep, so I changed it to the versioned names. After I installed the gazebo5 packages with apt-get, I forgot to rerun the catkin_create_pkg.
