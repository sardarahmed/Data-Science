Q:

What is Neato laser scanner rotation speed

Hi,
We have a Neato laser scanner which we are interfacing to the xv-11 laser node.  But, our scanner is rotating quite slowly, about 2 hz (120 rpm), on 3.0 volts dc.  Conflicting web data says it should be rotating at 5 or 10 hz.  Could someone tell me the speed of a properly operating unit?  Has anyone had to use voltages significantly higher than 3.0 vdc?
Thanks,
Alex

Is that the output rate of the laser (according to say, rostopic hz /scan?

A:

While the original IEEE ICRA paper says 10hz, every production model I have seen is only 5 Hz.

Yup... ours was 5Hz as well.
