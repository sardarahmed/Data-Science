Q:

How to playback pointcloud in rviz which was recorded using rosbag

Hi my friends, I am quite new to ROS and pointcloud. I am running some experiments with pointcloud using kinect.
after running roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch and rosbag record /camera/depth/points for a few seconds, i terminate the recording and get a .bag file in /bagfile.
Now i want to play back the .bag file and visualize it in rviz. Any clue how to achieve this?
Thanks a lot for your kind instruction!

A:

You'll want to set use_sim_time to true (do this BEFORE starting rviz):
rosparam set use_sim_time true

Then use rosbag, and republish the clock:
rosbag play name_of_bagfile.bag --clock

Thanks fergs! It works!
btw, it should be " /user_sim_time"

No, it should be use_sim_time, just as @fergs wrote.

sorry~~my fault, should be "use_sim_time" or "/use_sim_time" ,both are fine

Do you mean that first 'rosparam set use_sim_time true' and then run rviz and then 'rosbag play name_of_bagfile.bag --clock'? I do the same procedure but cant play back the data. Furthermore, my rosbag record just record only 2 seconds for the kinect. How can I fix it? Thanks a lot.

Yes, rosrun rviz rviz after setting param true. What I do is,run as above, quickly set the topic, then run the bag again and the topic will show as expected inside rviz. You have a bag that was recorded for 2s - dont set the time and you can record as long as you like: rosbag record -O subset /topic
