hi
Does anyone know a package for base controller for differential mobile robot which subscribes twist messages and publishes odom to ardunio board??

Hi,
have you looked at the rosserial package? Specifically at the rosserial_arduino, it has a lot of tutorials on how to use ROS code on Arduino. It is not a complete base_controller but you can program it to get what you need.
Regards,
Gary

yes i have looked. But as you said it does not have a tutorial or something like it to for example send a velocity command to DC motors by arduino. Is there any good source that i could learn these programmings between arduino and ROS except these tutorials???

I have a pretty generic application of rosserial for a diff robot that takes in cmd_vel and publishes odom from encoders. If you want take a look ros_arduino, it can easily be changed to used different motor drivers.
