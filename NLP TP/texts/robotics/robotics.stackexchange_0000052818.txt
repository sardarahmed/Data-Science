Q:

rqt_reconfigure doesn't seem to find new nodes

Using Groovy, Ubuntu 12.04.
When I start a new node that uses dynamic_reconfigure, the rqt_reconfigure gui does not see it. The node does appear when the gui is restarted, though. I did not have this issue with the dynamic reconfigure gui on Fuerte.

A:

If the $ rosrun dynamic_reconfigure dynparam list returns what you want while rqt_reconfigure doesn't, then please open a ticket here with sufficient information (incl. how to reproduce, version of ROS, rqt_reconfigure (available by dpkg -p ros-groovy-rqt-reconfigure for example)). If dynparam list doesn't return what you want, then there might be something wrong in your nodes.
