Q:

Checking if workspace is properly overlayed by the setup script

I am following this tutorial: http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace
The last step is to make sure that workspace is properly overlayed by the setup script.
For that, I entered this:
$ echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

As I have ROS Indigo, so I was expecting this:
/home/username/catkin_ws/src:/opt/ros/indigo/share

But I am getting this:
/home/username/catkin_ws/src:/opt/ros/indigo/share:/opt/ros/indigo/stacks

What does this additional :/opt/ros/indigo/stacks mean and why does this appear? Is this some problem?

A:

No, this is expected.
/opt/ros/indigo/stacks is added for backwards-compatibility reasons: in earlier versions of ROS, that is where all content of packages was placed (distributed in stacks, hence the name). As there could still be some old packages that depend on artefacts to be located there, the directory is still added to the package search path.
Note that even though the directory is added to the search path, whether it actually exits on your FS depends on whether you have installed any package that places artefacts there.

A 'similar problem', or exactly the same? If similar, please search to see whether there is already a post dealing with yours, otherwise post a new question.

Note that ROS_PACKAGE_PATH will only be set after you have run source /path/to/your/setup.bash, where appropriate setup.bash may be found in the devel directory in your workspace, and in /opt/ros/kinetic.
