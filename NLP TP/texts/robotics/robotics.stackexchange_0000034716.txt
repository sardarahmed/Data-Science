Q:

hector_slam tf error

Hi, does anybody try to run hector_slam with only laser scanner?
The type of laser scanner is URG-04LX-UG01.
I tried to run mapping_box.launch & geotiff_mapper.launch and rviz.
However, I always got the error says waitForTransform timed out...
Anyone knows how to deal with the transform problem?
Thanks a lot! I am really fresh bird with it.

A:

That error message of course is not very verbose. I just changed it to be more informative, you'll just have to update your svn working copy and rebuild.
Now for the error itself, it seems there is no transformation information available between the base_frame and the laser frame. These tutorials should give you an idea on why and how to fix that:

The easiest way to publish such a transform in case you don't have a URDF model is to use a static_transform publisher as described here:
