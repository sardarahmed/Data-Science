Q:

Is there a way to change the /tf in a rosbag?

I currently have a rosbag with a /tf topic containing only static transforms. Is there a way I can alter one of the transforms?
I have tried creating a new filtered rosbag not containing the /tf and generating the /tf from a launch file. But I get issues when trying to display the pointclouds in rviz.
I get the error : "Message removed because it is too old" when trying to display PointCloud2 topics.

A:

Hi There,
Set the param use_sim_time true before you start both rviz and rosbag and play your rosbag File using
rosbag play --clock <yourfile.bag>

This will cause your BAG to publish Sim time and rviz to believe it was lauched at the time the BAG was Recorder.
