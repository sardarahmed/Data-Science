My ros version is fuerte and I installed the knowrob stack by "apt-get install ros-fuerte-knowrob".
I ran "rosrun rosprolog rosprolog mod_srdl"

Can anybody help me? Thank you, and sorry for my poor English.

A:

As mentioned in the installation instructions, the Fuerte packages are broken. Some global paths have not been adapted, that's why you get these weird errors. Since no new releases for Fuerte are possible, this cannot be fixed. You can, however, easily install KnowRob from source, which runs on Fuerte, Groovy and Hydro.

Hi friend, could you tell me your email or any other contact methods that we can communicate conveniently. I'm a rookie, and wanna learn from you. Thank you.
