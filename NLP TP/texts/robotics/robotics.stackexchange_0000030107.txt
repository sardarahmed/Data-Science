What OS are you on? Which version of ROS (Cturtle/Diamondback/Unstable)?

A:

okay, here's a solution, after trying the above mentioned approaches I still had the same problem but I finally figured it out.

Open System->Administration->Synaptic
manager, search libusb and then
select
libusb-1.0-0-dev, libusb++-0.1-4c2 for
installation.

and rerun rosmake ni --rosdep-install. It works perfectly
if it doesn't work then for reference I have the following lib-usb* packages installed
libhpmud0,libusb-0.1-4,libusb-1.0-0,libusb-dev,libusb-1.0-0-dev, libusb++-0.1-4c2,libusbsr,libftdi1,libusbmuxd1.
Make sure you have these and if you still have a problem then let me know
Best,
CV

Thanks bro! I fixed it by running this command: " sudo apt-get install libusb -1.0-0-dev libusb-dev".
