Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: modbus_wrapper

Hello all,
I'm running on Ubuntu 14.04. I have installed the full desktop indigo distribution of ROS as in  "Installing and Configuring Your ROS environment" tutorial, also configured the ROS workspace.
I've successfully lunched roscore and several rosnodes like turtlesim.
What I try to achieve is to exchange data with a Siemens PLC using Modbus TCP.
For this I have followed the steps presented at the wikipage of ROS modbus package: http://wiki.ros.org/modbus
I have also installed the prerequisites as: https://github.com/HumaRobotics/modbus/tree/master/modbus
After restarted my PC I started a new terminal and had the following instructions:

cd to my catkin workspace
source devel/setup.bash
check the return of echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
in the same terminal I run the command to start a modbus server as stated in the above link:
rosrun modbus_wrapper modbus_server.py _port:=1234

In terminal I got the following message:
[rospack] Error: package 'modbus_wrapper' not found
Can anyone provide a hint of what I am doing wrong?
I checked in: /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages and I found pymodbus library.
I also have python 3 and 3.4 on ubuntu, none of them have pymodbus library. Is it possibile that my ROS environment not to be linked with python 2.7?
Thanks a lot!
Best regards,
Mircea.

A:

They have changed there modbus_wrapper package name or never had that name. Try
rosrun modbus_cognex_insight .. .. . or just have rosrun modbus ..... see the package names insided and also the cmakelist and package.xml you will know which one to use.
