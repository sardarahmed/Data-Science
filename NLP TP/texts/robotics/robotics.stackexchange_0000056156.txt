Q:

fatal error: file massage.h not found

I cloned package from git repository. After that I tried to make it with catkin, but it fails. Firstly I use my package in groovy, but robot is on hydro. Maybe it makes any difference. This is an output of catkin_make:

I checked catkin_ws/devel/include/ path, but there are no generated .h files. What's wrong?

A:

I assume that the message is part of your package. You need to add a dependency from your library/executable target to the target which performs the message generation.
Please see at the bottom of this documentation: http://docs.ros.org/api/catkin/html/howto/building_msgs.html

I found this question while looking to solve a similar issue, note that Dirk's link is now broken.

http://docs.ros.org/api/genmsg/html/usermacros.html is probably the updated link.
