Q:

Problem with cob_bringup: Property 'laser_front_roll' not defined in "/opt/ros/indigo/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/xacro/init.py" (line 369)

Hi,
I'm trying to launch the robot ($ roslaunch cob_bringup robot.launch), however, I get the following error:
Invalid <param> tag: Cannot load command parameter [robot_description]: command [/opt/ros/indigo/share/xacro/xacro.py '/opt/ros/indigo/share/cob_hardware_config/raw3-2/urdf/raw3-2.urdf.xacro'] returned with code [1].

Also ($ rosrun xacro xacro.py /opt/ros/indigo/share/cob_hardware_config/raw3-2/urdf/raw3-2.urdf.xacro
) returns:
Traceback (most recent call last):

    raise XacroException("Property wasn't defined: %s" % str(ex))
xacro.XacroException: Property wasn't defined: u'laser_front_roll'

Having a look at this link wouldn't solve my problem though cuz mine has sth to do with exception about laser_front_roll which doesn't exist.
Can anybody help me out with such problem?
Cheers,

A:

Seems as you don't have the correct version of the cob_calibration_data package where laser_front_roll is defined. Are you  using the release version or do you have overlays?

running ( $ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-cob-calibration-data )  returns
ros-indigo-cob-calibration-data is already the newest version.

It should be a release version, am not sure though cuz it's a lab's pc.

And this problem popped up when I updated and upgraded ros operating system.
   $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

before it was working totally fine.

The package version is 0.6.4-0trusty-20160110-105926-0800, and the parameter files seems to be there.

Some packages were held back by the package manager. Now everything seems to be up to date but some transforms are missing.
