Q:

How to install ROS on a Raspberry Pi?

I am trying to install ROS on a RPi 3 to use it to train middle school students in single arm industrial robotics.

pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cat /etc/os-release
PRETTY_NAME="Raspbian GNU/Linux 8
(jessie)" NAME="Raspbian GNU/Linux"
VERSION_ID="8" VERSION="8 (jessie)"

In order to use apt-get install for ROS I used instructions in the ROS wiki to modify my apt sources list. My ros-latest.list file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d reads

deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main contrib non-free

but I get the following error when I run sudo apt-get update
W: Failed to fetch http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu/dists/$(lsb_release/-sc)/binary-armhf/Packages  404  Not Found [IP: 140.211.166.134 80]

I suspect that I am doing something wrong with the $(lsb_release -sc) part of the ros-latest.list file.
Any ideas? I also plan to install Gazebo the same way if I can get ROS installed.

A:

First I would advise to use Ubuntu Mate 16.04 rather than Raspbian.
If you use Raspbian there are no binaries available for you to install ROS directly (see this page, there is no armhf build for Debian); you have to compile all the ROS packages you need to get things running; this might take a considerable amount of time, it is a tedious/complicated process.
Also note that there is a bug in RViz preventing to visualize STL files on ARM architecture: RViz bug report
Install from binaries (Ubuntu MATE)
If you use Ubuntu MATE 16.04 you will be able to install ROS following the standard procedure because binaries for the ARM hard float (armhf) hardware architecture are available.
One major drawback with Ubuntu MATE is that hardware acceleration is not enabled, 3D graphics (RViz) will be very slow! These information are summarized here.
You can get Ubuntu MATE 16.04.2 here
To install ROS Kinetic on Ubuntu MATE 16.04 with your Raspberry Pi 3 just follow the standard instructions for Ubuntu.
Compile / install from source
Instructions are here.
