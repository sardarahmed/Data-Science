Q:

Changing size and pose of the geometry of a Gazebo entity from a gz-sim system plugin

Is it possible to change the size and position of the geometry (box shape) of a collision entity and a visual entity, at runtime from a Gazebo sim system plugin?
What I intend to try is the following:

Retrieve the geometry component and pose components of the entity,
Change these, and
Hope it has an effect :-)

But it would be great to get some feedback first, as I don't fully understand the interaction between gz-sim, gz-gui and gz-physics, so I can't assess if this will work (and I rather assume not).

A:

gz-sim currently does not handle requests to change geometry properties like size. You can however move models by setting the WorldPoseCmd component but not collisions. You maybe able to change the pose of visuals by setting the entity's Pose component. For geometry size changes, one workaround (not ideal) would be to delete and spawn a new model.
