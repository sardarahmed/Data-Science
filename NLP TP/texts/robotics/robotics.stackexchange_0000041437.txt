Q:

Rosjava - could not instantiate node

Can anybody shine some light on this error?
Exception in thread "main" org.ros.exception.RosRuntimeException: Unable to instantiate node: TestNode at org.ros.RosRun.main(RosRun.java:60) Caused by: java.lang.IllegalAccessException: Class org.ros.internal.loader.CommandLineLoader can not access a member of class TestNode with modifiers "" at sun.reflect.Reflection.ensureMemberAccess(Reflection.java:95) at java.lang.Class.newInstance0(Class.java:366) at java.lang.Class.newInstance(Class.java:325) at org.ros.internal.loader.CommandLineLoader.loadClass(CommandLineLoader.java:240) at org.ros.RosRun.main(RosRun.java:54)
Edit: Apparently roslaunch needs the class(es) to have public visibility.

A:

As you said, the RosRun class expects NodeMains to be public.
