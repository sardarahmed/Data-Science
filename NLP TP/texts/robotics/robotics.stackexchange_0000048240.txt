Q:

Is there a way to save all rosbag data into a .csv or text file?

Hi all!
I would like to extract the data from the rosbag and convert it into text or .csv file to use the data into Matlab and Excel. Is this possible ?

good question

A:

This is taken from this answer for a similar question:

For simple message formats, you can convert directly to CSV from the command line:
rostopic echo -b file.bag -p /topic
This won't work well if your bag file contains arrays/images/pointclouds/etc... as it renders the entire message to text.

What are the meaning of the -b and -p flags ?
Comment by IanCol on 2019-07-23:\
Display messages in a bag file.
-p
Display messages in a matlab/octave-friendly plotting format.
From here.
