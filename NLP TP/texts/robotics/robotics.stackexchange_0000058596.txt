Q:

segmentation fault at rosrun rviz rviz

I came across a segmentation fault while trying rosrun rviz rviz. This issue has been discussed on this web( http://answers.ros.org/question/11376/rviz-segmentation-fault-at-launch/ ), but I think that essential issue has been not solved. The solution in the comment and the answer was to delete all of file in ~/.rviz. I also deleted all of files as I follow the instruction. But, the error doesn't go out.

[ INFO]rviz version 1.10.14
[ INFO]compiled against OGRE version 1.7.4 (Cthugha)
[ INFO]Stereo is NOT SUPPORTED
[ INFO]OpenGl version: 2.1 (GLSL 1.2)
Segmentation fault

I have checked the article (http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/Troubleshooting). I can't find the way to solve the issue on the article. Could anyone give me clues? Thank you in advance!

A:

The type of graphics card you use always is crucial when looking at rviz crashes (you can edit your answer to add that information). The rule of thumb is: "Nvdidia GPUs with propietary drivers generally work well, others might crash occasionally (or always in a absolute worst case)". With your GPU and driver known, I´d recommend googling something like "rviz crashes ros answers [your graphics card type]". There are tons of posts on rviz crashes on ROS Answers and it´s likely that there will be useful information in some of them.

@Stefan Kohlbrecher: I was looking over the article on the web(http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/Tutorials/Rviz%20in%20Stereo). Do you think that this contents connects with my issues?

Unless you try something with stereo mode, no. I assume you installed from .deb packages?

I don't make sense, I was googling to search for the cause and how to fix it. I also tried the method on the web
(https://github.com/ros-visualization/rviz/issues/713), but segmentation fault didn't go out. I will reinstall.
