Q:

rviz crash at boot-up using robot-upstart indigo

Hi,
I'm trying to use robot-upstart indigo to start my roslaunch script automatically at boot-up, my launch file contains rviz and I'm looking to show lidar pointcloud.
When I reboot my laptop, nothing show up. I used this command to check whats the problem
$ sudo tail /var/log/upstart/velodyne.log -n 30

and I found this error
rviz: cannot connect to X server 
No handlers could be found for logger "roslaunch"
[rviz-12] process has died [pid 1354, exit code 1, cmd /opt/ros/indigo/lib/rviz/rviz -f /world __name:=rviz __log:=/tmp/0d6492c4-a815-11e6-997a-47731f04dcc5/rviz-12.log].

Does someone has an idea?
Thanks

A:

This could either be a permission problem, or there really is no X server running when robot_upstart starts your launch files.
If the first, see robot_upstart: could not open port /dev/ttyUSB0 as a related question. To clarify: robot_upstart runs your launch files under the same user as the one that installed them, but (from robot_upstart 0.2.0 documentation » The install script - permissions):

The roslaunch which executes does not have its user’s group memberships.

This could lead to the rviz instance not having any access rights to the X server.
The second (and looking at the error message, likely) option is that at the moment that your jobs are being started, the X server hasn't started yet, and as RViz needs one, it can't continue.
PS (and pedantic): technically RViz didn't crash: one of the prerequisites for it to work is to have a working X server. Since it can't connect to one, it can't initialise the application successfully, and just exits (most likely here).
