Q:

Monocular camera calibration

Hi guys,
I have followed the monocular calibration tutorial and have calibrated my Firefly_mv (which uses the DC1394 drivers)image. The calibrations seems to be successful since the /camera/camera_info is publishing the correct information:

However, when I type rostopic echo /image_rect , nothing seems to be published. Where can I find the rectified/calibrated image?

A:

Are you running the image_proc node? See for http://www.ros.org/wiki/image_proc details, but mainly, you have to run something like:

ROS_NAMESPACE=camera rosrun image_proc image_proc image_raw:=/camera/image

and to test

rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/image_rect_color

Thanks for your reply, I am running the image_proc node and able to view my colored images. I do not have camera/image_rect_color though. I edited the question above to include the output from the rostopic list command.

I agree with Thomas that it is very strange that the rectified topics are published in the global namespace while the camera has its own namespace, i.e. /camera. Could you specify how do you run the image_proc node? rxgraph could help to see if the node is properly subscribed to the right topics.

I forgot to do the remapping from image_rect to camera/image_rect in my launch file. I think this should solve the problem. I will try it later and update you.
