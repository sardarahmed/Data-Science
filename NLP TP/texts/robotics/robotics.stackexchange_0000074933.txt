Q:

How to use Mocap_pose_estimate for sending Optitrach mocap pose data to fcu

I wish to send Optitrack mocap pose data (using vrpn_client_ros) to Pixhawk FCU through mavros_extras - mocap_pose_estimate plugin. However I do not see an executable made for mocap_pose_estimate plugin. So how do I use it ?
How to use that mocap_pose_estimate? Do I need to add executables for that in the CMakeLists.txt?

A:

It is a plugin so you have to load into mavros node using a yaml as done here.

Thanks for the reply @tonybaltovski. But I dont get it completely. I added mocap_pose_estimate in the px4flow_pluiglists.yaml file and launched the px4flow.launch. I do not think that is the right way.
Can you please explain in detail on how to use the mocap_pose_estimate pluigin?

I edited apm_pluiginlists.yaml file. I moved mocap_pose_estimate from blacklist list to whitelist. As a result of that now on running mavros I can see "Pluigin mocap_pose_estimate" loaded and initialized. However I dont yet get it. What is the next step?
Plugin needs to subscribe to pose and tf.How
