Q:

how to use trac_ik library?

Hi there,
I am trying to use the new library trac_ik in order to improve efficiency of the inverse kinematic process but I am not sure how to do it. Does anyone find out a way to use it?
thanks

Can you clarify a bit? What is it that you actually want to do with it?

right, instead of using KDL's ik, I'd like to use trac_ik. So basically, I received a position and orientation from an haptic device, and I want to process the inverse kinematic in order to get angular position of my robot arm and finally send the arm to this position. thanks

A:

I think the API is pretty straightforward given the README for the library.
https://bitbucket.org/traclabs/trac_ik/src/HEAD/trac_ik_lib/
There is a constructor and a CartToJnt() method that are both provided with the typical use case above.
If you are using MoveIt!, then you don't call TRAC-IK directly, you just ask MoveIt! to use TRAC-IK instead of KDL.

UPDATE: The latest version has a) an example program for how to use the stand alone library (non-MoveIt! plugin) and b) a constructor that takes the URDF location on the rosparam server (e.g., "/robot_description") and that base and tip link of the chains, making use easier for KDL novices.
