A:

In theory, the image transport library in ROS supports an unlimited number of video streams and an unlimited number of robots.
In practice, the number of simultaneous video streams that you can have will probably be limited by your network bandwidth.

hi, for the multiple of ardrones, is it possible to do so? because i have tried with 2 ardrones at the same time, i still have some issue with video streaming.

That is a completely different question. I'd suggest that you ask a new question and carefully describe the specific problem you're having.
