Q:

error compiling visual_feature_detectors packages -- opencv don't match

Hi,I have installed cturtle using Ubuntu packages (Maverick 64), and have the package ros_cturtle_vision_opencv.
I'm trying to install visual_feature_detector from source: https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/branches/trunk_cturtle/stacks/. When I try to compile i get errors like:
/ros/stacks/visual_feature_detectors/brief_descriptor/examples/video_homography.cpp:15: fatal error: opencv2/opencv.hpp: No existe el fichero o el directorio
-------------------
cv.h:47: warning: #warning "This is a deprecated opencv header provided for compatibility. Please include a header from a corresponding opencv module"
-------------------
/visual_feature_detectors/features_2d_ros/include/features_2d_ros/any_detector.h:15: error: no matching function for call to ‘cv::FastFeatureDetector::FastFeatureDetector()’

I think that visual_feature_detector needs other opencv version, if this is correct, where can i found a version of visual_feature_detector that works with  ros_turtle_vision_opencv prebuild?
thanks

A:

Hello Charias,
you are correct in your assumption: you have the wrong openCV installed.
The stack.xml file of visual_feature_detectors refers to the stack named vision_opencv.
<depend stack="vision_opencv" /> <!-- opencv2, image_geometry, cv_bridge -->

This stack contains the package opencv2.1 (as a lib) and some other packages built around it (like image_geometry, cv_bridge and opencv_tests).
Running the following command should install the correct version on your system:
sudo apt-get install ros-cturtle-vision-opencv

Hope this helps
Raph
