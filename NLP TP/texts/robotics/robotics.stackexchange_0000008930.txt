Q:

Modified DH Parameters?

Is the notation of the geometry of robots from Khalil and Kleinfinger be considered as one of the probably "many" Modified DH Parameters?

A:

Khalil himself says that it is a form of the modified D-H parameters.  See, e.g., Section 2.1 of the 2000 Springer-Verlag book Advances in Robot Kinematics.
