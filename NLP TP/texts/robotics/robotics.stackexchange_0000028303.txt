Q:

Building imported into Gazebo not visible in Rviz

Hey, I am trying to import a complete building model into Gazebo (including the interiors like tables, chairs etc.). I am not sure if my approach is correct and I am in need your some assistance.
I converted the building file format into a .dae file and successfully imported it into gazebo by calling it as a mesh. Unfortunately, when I spawn my quadrotor to visualize the building, it is not detected by the camera or the LIDAR (but I am able to visualize the building in the gazebo environment, and all the interiors are visible)
I suspect this has to do with the material of the building when it is being imported into gazebo?! but i am unsure how to edit or change the same. When I tried spawning the quadrotor on the building, it fell right on to the ground plane ( is the building not physically present or created in the gazebo? not sure why).
Can someone guide me on where I am going wrong? Need some help here. I've attached my world file C:\fakepath\world.world

A:

Did you add collisions to the building? The lidar sensor detects collisions in a model. However, you should be able to see the camera images in Rbiz. I would check and verify that images are being published to the ROS image topic

Oh, I did not do that as it was blocking the windows or doors, but i will be sure to give it a shot soon. Also, I checked the image topics it is printing properly though.
