Q:

rqt_graph font too large

Hi all,
I've been progressing through the tutorials, but have hit a snag with rqt_graph.  On my high-dpi screen (3200x1800, 262ppi) the font used for node/topic labels is far too large and obscures important details of the graph.  Is there a way to lower the font size?
Screenshots follow:
At my normal resolution (3200x1800):

...and at a lower resolution (1920x1080):

Thanks for your help!
-Jack

I would like just to mention that I have the very same problem, and I do think it would be important to address it.

A:

I think the tool currently has no feature to change font size and only remedy will be is someone writes a patch. See http://wiki.ros.org/rqt_graph for the package's issue tracker where you can send a patch (pull request on github).

Only as a comment. It would be nice if it were possible also move nodes and topics, when the project is to large, it is impossible to see the connections using rqt_grap.
