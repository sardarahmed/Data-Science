Q:

What is the difference between ros::NodeHandle nh("") and just ros::NodeHandle nh?

I understand that ros::NodeHandle nh("~") is a private namespace and that ros::NodeHandle nh("/") is the global namespace but what exactly is the difference between ros::NodeHandle nh("") and ros::NodeHandle nh, are they the same thing?

A:

You could easily answer this for yourself by looking at the c++ constructor in /opt/ros/melodic/include/ros/node_handle.h.
The answer is: Yes, nh and nh("") construct the identical object.
To help other people who need to read your code, you should use the first version.

That was a clear answer, the constructor is NodeHandle(const std::string& ns = std::string(), const M_string& remappings = M_string()) in /opt/ros/melodic/include/ros/node_handle.h, as you said. Leaving it empty will result in ns = std::string() and using nh("") would also result in an empty string. So effectively they are both the same
