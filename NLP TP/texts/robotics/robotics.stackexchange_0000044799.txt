Q:

Problem with navigation stack base_link to map with costmap

Hello everybody,
I'm trying to bring up a navigation stack on a custom robot. The Warning I'm getting is the following :
[ WARN] [1349902108.687242123, 83.600000000]: Waiting on transform from /base_footprint to /map to become available before running costmap, tf error: Lookup would require extrapolation into the past.  Requested time 83.500000000 but the earliest data is at time 1349902098.858861163, when looking up transform from frame [/base_footprint] to frame [/map]

My launch file looks like this:

 

The static transform publisher doesn't solve the problem either ... .
I would be happy about any advice.
Best regards,
Thomas

<param name="/use_sim_time" value="true"/>

after the  should solve the problem.
