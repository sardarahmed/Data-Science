A:

I answered this previously here. Hopefully that will also make it clear how to treat the contents of your .bashrc file. Note that if you have your own source code then you will need to rebuild it after switching which version of ROS you are using.
As @joq says you will find it very difficult (at best) to use two versions of ROS at the same time. You may find more success in using the newer version of ROS as a system install, then any packages (or stacks) that you want to use from older versions of ROS you can install and build from source in one of your user directories. That approach has its own downsides (find fixes to make package work with newer version of ROS) but will be much easier than using two versions of ROS.
