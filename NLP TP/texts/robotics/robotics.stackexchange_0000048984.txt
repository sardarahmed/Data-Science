Q:

Installation of explore package in Groovy (ubuntu 12.10)

Hello,
I have been trying to install the ROS explore package: http://www.ros.org/wiki/explore Unfortunately, there are no binaries available in the form of

apt-get install ros-groovy-*

Therefore, I downloaded it from the svn repository and tried to compile it with rosmake, but I have received the following error:

/opt/ros/rosws/exploration/explore/include/explore/explore_frontier.h:45:34:
fatal error: LinearMath/btVector3.h:
No such file or directory compilation
terminated.

I googled the error, and tried to install several packpages like libbullet-dev liblinear-dev but the problem is still there, thus any help is appreciated. Thank you!

hello, have you solved the problem? I meet the same problem with you, if you get it through, please help me, thank you.

A:

When I looked into the explore package a few months ago, it wasn't compatible with Groovy, and looked like it was unmaintained. In particular, I think the navigation or costmap API has changed, and explore hasn't been updated to match.
I remember it working in Electric, and I don't think I tried it on Fuerte.

Do you know if the explore package has been updated to be compatible with Groovy now?
