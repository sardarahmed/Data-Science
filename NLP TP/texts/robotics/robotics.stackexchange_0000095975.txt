Q:

Default parameter file in navigation2

Hi,
im searching for the default parameter file but could only find in opt/ros/dashing/share/nav2_bringup/launch/nav2_params.yaml some parameters but not the recovery plugin. I know the Turtlebot uses the  Spin recovery but i dont know where to change it. I'm trying to fine-tune my Turtlebot Burger from this link.

A:

Not all parameters are described in the params file. Any not included parameters will utilize the defaults set in the code.  You may tune any value in the documentation link by adding it to either that file (not recommended) or your own file you are version controlling.
PS: if you fine tune anything for the TB3, feel free to submit a PR with updates to that yaml file. We haven't done any excessive tuning yet for that platform.

PR means pull request. Its a way of submitting your updated parameters to the nav2 repository on GitHub for all users to use.

so there are two .yaml files that are used. One is opt/ros/dashing/share/nav2_bringup/launch/nav2_params.yaml the other one is in /home/turtlebot3_ws/src/turtlebot3/turtlebot3/turtlebot3_navigation2/paramer  the question is which one is the dominant one when one parameter is False and the other True? Also how can i disable a plugin like the ’spin’ recovery if i don't want to change the file in the opt/ros/dashing directory
