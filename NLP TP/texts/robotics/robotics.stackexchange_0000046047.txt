Q:

How do you install a rosdep dependency under catkin/groovy?

I've added these lines to foo/package.xml
<build_depend>mylib</build_depend>
<run_depend>mylib</run_depend>

and this to foo/CMakeLists.txt:
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS mylib)

and I added this rule to my local rosdep yaml file:
mylib:
  arch: mylib-syspkg

but when I run rosdep keys foo, I get a blank line, and if I try rosdep install foo, I get "#All required rosdeps installed successfully". A rosdep resolve mylib call prints out "mylib-syspkg".
If I run catkin_make:
CMake Error at /opt/ros/groovy/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:71 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "mylib" with any of
  the following names:

    mylibConfig.cmake
    mylib-config.cmake

It looks as if nothing is associating the mylib dependency with the foo package. Is there some new command I should run to install a wet package's rosdep dependencies?

A:

Looks like it's fixed in rosdep (but not released yet).
$ sudo pip2 install -I https://github.com/ros/rosdep/archive/master.tar.gz

$ rosdep keys foo
mylib
