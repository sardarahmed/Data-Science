Q:

Visual plugin loaded twice

       Hello everybody,
I'm having an issue with a visual plugin. Similarly to Illuminatur in this thread, the plugin I'm using is loaded twice.
More precisely, it's loaded twice only when the model of the robot I'm using is loaded in addition to the model that uses the plugin.
The plugin I'm referring to is here, it's a plugin to put texture on an object via YARP.
The robot I'm simulating is the iCub (sdf files here)
Is that a known/desired behavior? Is there a simple way to prevent Gazebo from loading it twice?
Thank you

A:

When you launch a gazebo world that has a camera sensor, two rendering scenes are actually created (server + client). So the visual plugin is loaded twice because it's loaded once on the server (for the camera sensor) and another time on the client (for the main UI window).

Hello Iche,
Thank you very much for your answer. I would upvote if I could. I will now contact the people who developed that plugin!
