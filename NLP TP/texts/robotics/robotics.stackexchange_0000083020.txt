Q:

I have encountered problem when installing phidget

I have followed the step given by ros wiki. Everything was alright until to set up the udev rules for the phidgets usb devices. After enter [sh src/phidgets_drivers/phidgets_api/share/setup-udev.sh], I have the following error,
cp: cannot stat ‘udev/99-phidgets.rules’: No such file or directory
Phidgets udev rules file has been copied to /etc/udev/rules.d/

Any kind soul can render help to solve this issue.

A:

The script makes an assumption about the location of the rules in relation to the working directory. https://github.com/ros-drivers/phidgets_drivers/blob/kinetic/phidgets_api/share/setup-udev.sh#L1
I'd suggest trying:
cd src/phidgets_drivers/phidgets_api/share/ && sh setup-udev.sh

Thank you so much. This command has cleared. but I cant find the launch file for high speed encoder. Is there a pre-set launch file or I have to manually create a new launch file?

That's a new question. Please accept this answer and ask it as a new question and make sure to include more information. This doesn't currently have enough information for me to understand what you want to do: http://wiki.ros.org/Support

Also a PR to fix the documentation I'm sure would be appreciated by the maintainers.
