Q:

How do I display my own URDF in rviz?

Hello!
This might be a dumb question, but how do I view my own URDF File in rviz?
My approach so far:

Create a new catkin package named "myrobot_description" with dependencies on the urdf package

Create a folder urdf in the folder myrobot_description/urdf

Create a valid URDF-File (as far as check_urdf is concerned)

Build the package with catkin_make install

Source the package by invoking source setup.bash in the install folder

Copy the launch files and folder from the urdf_tutorial folder to the install/share/myrobot_description folder (this doesn't feel right.)

Copy the URDF folder from the src/myrobot_description/ folder to the install/share/myrobot_description folder (wtf, this doesn't feel right AT ALL)

Edit the display.launch file like this:
<launch>
<arg name="gui" default="False" />
<param name="robot_description" textfile="/home/viki/catkin_ws/install/share/myrobot_description/urdf/myrobot.urdf" />
<param name="use_gui" value="$(arg gui)"/>
<node name="joint_state_publisher" pkg="joint_state_publisher" type="joint_state_publisher" />
<node name="robot_state_publisher" pkg="robot_state_publisher" type="state_publisher" />
<node name="rviz" pkg="rviz" type="rviz" args="/home/viki/catkin_ws/install/share/myrobot_description/myrobot.rviz" required="true" />

Launch rviz via roslaunch myrobot_description display.launch

End up with a white block in rviz and Errors concerning a missing base frame

Now, as you can see, I just play around helpless and do not understand the whole process - but I do not find any ressources on how to craft a correct launch file or on "registering" my package or using rviz or which directory I should use for building URDF models etc.
I appreciate any help and pointers in any direction.
Thanks. :)

A:

You are right 6,7 steps not required.
After launching rviz, add robot model to rviz display and edit  fixed frame in Global options to "base_link" (this is the link name which you gave in .urdf )

So, how do I craft a launch file then? Just create a new folder "launch" in the install folder and create a file "display.launch" with the same content as the one from my original Post? Or is there an easier, more streamlined way?
By the way, changing the fixed frame got rid of my white-box Problem

keep launch folder parllel to your src folder inside your package. Check this https://github.com/ros/urdf_tutorial hope will make things clear about folder structure and others

I created a video showing the process. You can check it here: https://youtu.be/yhcdc-8dStQ

@R. Tellez that's a 9 minutes long video for something that simple!
