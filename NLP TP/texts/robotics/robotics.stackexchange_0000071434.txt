Q:

cmake error suitesparseconfig.cmake

hi, i've got an error when i compiled mcptam.
After catkin_make, then i had message like this
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindSUITESPARSE.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "SUITESPARSE", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "SUITESPARSE" with
  any of the following names:

    SUITESPARSEConfig.cmake
    suitesparse-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "SUITESPARSE" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "SUITESPARSE_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "SUITESPARSE" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.

please help me guys. :)

A:

You're missing the dependency SUITESPARSE in your environment.
