Q:

Rospack find error

Hello. I write question first time in this page, so please let me know if I had some mistake.
I use Autoware 1.13 in Ubuntu 18.04 and ROS Melodic, but it can't find some packages.
I already use

source /install/setup.bash

This code is effective to find 'lidar_localizer' but not effective to find 'runtime_manager'. I should use

roslaunch runtime_manager runtime_manager

to start the autoware. Why the source command didn't applied in runtime_manager package?
And, How can I use this package?

A:

I assume you're using the release repo when you compiled it from the source. If that is the case, then there are two options,

You could use Mate terminal
Modify ~/autoware.ai/install/runtime_manager/share/runtime_manager/scripts/run script to accommodate your terminal. In my case, I was using Terminator terminal, hence I added the following lines,

elif [ $(which terminator) ]; then TERMINAL=terminator
Cheers.
