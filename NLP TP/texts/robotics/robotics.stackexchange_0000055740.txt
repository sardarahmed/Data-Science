Q:

Any example of integration of Qt in some ROS package?

Hello
I would like to use an QT as an user interface for my mobile platform. I have a sensor package consist of IMU , Laser, Kinect and wheel encoders. Would like to have an input button that run a rose node than do something with the data and gives an output results. Any help or advice, or code suggestion regarding this?
Thanks

you can add QT library in your pkg and use it like qt

A:

In principle just use as any other library or as using Qt in any other cmake project.
This might help simplify the process: http://wiki.ros.org/qt_ros

Depending on what you want to do, check out rqt.

I have Fuerte version of ROS. Is qt_create works with Fuerte? Is there in general problems Using Qt in Fuerte version of ROS or do I need Electric one?
Comment by dornhege on 2013-11-27:
I don't know if this works on fuerte, but Qt definitely works with problems. You'd just set that up like any other Qt + CMake project. ROS doesn't care about that.  The only thing I usually add is: ADD_DEFINITIONS(-DQT_NO_KEYWORDS) as I had some conflicts with signals/slots.

You mean Qt definitely works without problems or??
Comment by dornhege on 2013-11-28:
Qt definitely works!
Comment by Astronaut on 2013-12-01:
Ok. Thanks. So how you run it???
Comment by Astronaut on 2013-12-03:
Hi dornhere. What is the difference between qt_ros and rqt? I could compile and run the deme from qt_ros. But I dont know which way to go? Using 1t_ros or rqt. What do you suggest?
Comment by dornhege on 2013-12-04:
qt_ros AFAIK are just some tools the make creating a ROS package with Qt code easier. rqt is ROS' gui framework, where you can easily write plugins usually for visualization or simple commands (i.e. not processing).

I could not make working qt on ROS Fuerte. All my ROS code is on Fuerte and I dont wonna migrate to other ROS version.

In my job I have experience in making GUI both in qt_ros and rqt. I initially started from qt_ros, which worked great for me on fuerte. But if your Qt work is specific to GUI development, I recommend rqt, which has limited functionality in F-turtle but still works nice.
Comment by Astronaut on 2013-12-04:
what do you mean F-turtle IsaacSaito ? Furte turtle? I would like to develop GUI. But if rqt has limited functionality in Furte than make no sens to develop GUI with rqt. Im bit confuse
Comment by dornhege on 2013-12-05:
f-turtle is fuerte. The basic decision is: Use rqt and build something for that vs. using a custom Qt built GUI in your program. That depends on what you need. If you just need a couple of buttons to trigger ROS calls or something like that rqt might be easier.
Comment by Astronaut on 2013-12-08:
I dont think i need something simple. I need GUI that can start a launch file, run hactor mapping, run certain node ( i have 7 nodes, and need to choose with a button which node to be run), than have some output based on some extracted parameters from that node. So its not a simple one.
Comment by dornhege on 2013-12-09:
This still sounds like it might be doable with rqt. There might even be some plugins that can run launch files. You might want to check that out.
Comment by Astronaut on 2013-12-09:
so whats the advantage doing with rqt than with qt_ros?
Comment by dornhege on 2013-12-09:
It's just different. Check out the rqt docs, examples, etc. especially with regard to what you get in fuerte. When you have seen what rqt does, you can decide for yourself.
Comment by Astronaut on 2013-12-09:
ok..I check and seams there are many functions that are not available in Fuerte. For example running launch file no option on rqt  Fuerte.. I think will start with qt_ros.
