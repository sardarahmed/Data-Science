Q:

Pushbutton in GUI in ROS

I need to trigger a specific function in my ROS node by the user. There a simple pushbutton function that can be setup within the rqt dynamic reconfigure? Currently I am just using a workaround of just triggering the function whenever an int value is changing, but that is not really a great interface.

Using dynamic_reconfigure for this sounds like a bit of an abuse of the infrastructure.
Creating UIs like this is typically done in RQT, which is the same framework that rqt_dynamic_reconfigure is built on top of. See wiki/rqt. Has both Python and C++ bindings.

so far I only used dynamic_reconfigure, but this is something i should probably investigate. thx

It's a bit hacky but if you're using Rviz then you can use the 2D nav goal message that is triggered using the Rviz GUI, you can ignore the content of the message and use the message itself as a trigger for an event.

A:

As someones pointed out already I'm afraid asking about dynamic reconfigure for your purpose sounds like an XY problem.
That said, another option is in jsk_rqt_plugins there's a rqt_yn_btn rqt plugin that calls a specific ROS Service.
