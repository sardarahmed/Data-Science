Q:

Hi, isogenerator to create ISO with ROS from wiki (http://wiki.ros.org/isogenerator) are out of service now. Code is not available from https://code.ros.org/svn/ros/stacks/ros_release/trunk. Is there existing code on other uri? or is there any open sourced solution to build ISO with ROS?

A:

I don't believe there is any specific tool to generate ISO images for ROS, but seeing as ROS is essentially deployed using a set of Debian packages onto an Ubuntu OS, you could probably follow just about any procedure to customise an Ubuntu LiveCD/USB.

Thank you for your information.
Find the Ubuntu ISO native tools: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/InstallCDCustomizationHowTo, we need to customize by ourselves.
