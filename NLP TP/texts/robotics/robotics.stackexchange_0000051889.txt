Q:

ROS Beginner Tutorials: Writing a Simple Service and Client (python) - need some help

Hi guys,
I'm following the ROS Tutorials and currently doing the item Examining the Simple Service and Client using the Python language ((http:// www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/ExaminingServiceClient)).
However when I try to run the client using the python command, I get this error:
viki@ROS:~/catkin_ws$ rosrun beginner_tutorials add_two_ints_server.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/viki/catkin_ws/src/beginner_tutorials/scripts/add_two_ints_server.py", line 3, in <module>
    from beginner_tutorials.srv import *
ImportError: No module named beginner_tutorials.srv

I just can't figure it out what's happening. I'm almost sure I've done all the steps in the previous tutorial ( [link text](http ://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/WritingServiceClient%28python%29) ), 'cause everything seemed to work just as hoped:
viki@ROS:~/catkin_ws$ cd ~/catkin_ws
viki@ROS:~/catkin_ws$ catkin_make
Base path: /home/viki/catkin_ws
Source space: /home/viki/catkin_ws/src
Build space: /home/viki/catkin_ws/build
Devel space: /home/viki/catkin_ws/devel
Install space: /home/viki/catkin_ws/install

#### Running command: "make cmake_check_build_system" in "/home/viki/catkin_ws/build"
####
####
#### Running command: "make -j1" in "/home/viki/catkin_ws/build"
####
viki@ROS:~/catkin_ws$

Can anybody help me? Thanks in advance,
Batta

Did you do step 1.3 of the previous tutorial? http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/WritingServiceClient%28python%29#rospy_tutorials.2BAC8-Tutorials.2BAC8-WritingServiceClient.Building_your_nodes

Yes, the program built as hoped...

I see nothing indicating that beginner_tutorials was built. Is it in your workspace?

A:

The problem was stemming from misspelling in the package name. It's now resolved.

What was the misspelling? I have seen this mentioned in another question about the same problem so perhaps the misspelling stems from the code give in the tutorial.
