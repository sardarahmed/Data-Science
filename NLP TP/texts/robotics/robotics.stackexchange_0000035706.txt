Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: ros mapping

hi im using an asctec quadrotor, and i would like to map the environment, the only odometry data that i can provide is the velocity, can someone please suggest which form of mapping is the most suitable ?
im using a hokuyo urg lidar as my sensor

A:

There are two open source options available that I know of and that should work 'out of the box' after setup of the system (robot model, tf frames etc.) :
The mapping system developed within the CityFlyer project from CCNY uses a scanmatching approach for generating a odometry estimate and feeds this to gmapping. Described here.

hector_slam uses fast scan alignment at 40Hz directly and does not require odometry data. Both available tutorials should help with robot setup. Described in this paper. (Note I'm involved here, shameless plug and all :) )

Both approaches have been tested successfully with datasets recorded on quadrotors.

using the wiki syntax instead of raw HTML seems to work in both the preview and final result..

Hm, in the "preview" section when editing the message, the above mess of links looks clean and correct as intended. Any ideas on what's wrong?

Hi, the first link about the CityFlyer project is not working. Is this one? http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5980460   Thanks in advance.
