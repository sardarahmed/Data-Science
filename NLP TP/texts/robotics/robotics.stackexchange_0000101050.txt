Q:

/joy_node when running headless

Hi all,
I have Ubuntu 20.04 running on a Jetson Nano. I recently got the Nano hooked up into my robot so I've been running it headless (no display connected) to test things after I SSH in. However, I have found that when I run
ros2 topic echo /joy 

I do not receive any messages from my Sony Dual Sense controller, even though it is connected via bluetooth. However, if I plug in a display and log in to Ubuntu desktop environment and then launch my ROS2 package, then I can see all of the expected messages under /joy node.
Any thoughts on why this might be?
Thanks!

A:

Solution to this was to enable automatic login for my user on the Jetson Nano.
