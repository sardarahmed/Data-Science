Are you trying to upgrade a clearpath vehicle to ROS Kinetic? Or do you just want to use the messages in clearpath_base for your own purposes?

Hi
I want to use the messages in clearpath_base for my own purposes?
Specifically 'clearpath_base/AckermannSetpt'. Because it contains timestamp, steering, throttle and braking. Exactly what I need.
Thank you.

I would suggest to take a look at ackermann_msgs.
Perhaps that can be used.
It's already a stand-alone msg package and easily installed as it's released into Indigo, Kinetic and Melodic.

Problems with ackermann_msgs are its variable names can be misleading to someone and its data types are 'float', I prefer 'double'.
Is there no way to install clearpath msg ?

A:

I would suggest using ackermann_msgs as:

it's a message that is used by many other nodes and controllers
clearpath_msgs is old, unused and unmaintained

If you must use clearpath_msgs, you can find it here.
You'll have to git clone .. it to your Catkin workspace, make sure to have all dependencies installed (see #q252478 for the general procedure) and then build the workspace.

This I don't understand.

and its data types are 'float', I prefer 'double'.

It's up to you, but for values this small I would be surprised it really makes a difference.
