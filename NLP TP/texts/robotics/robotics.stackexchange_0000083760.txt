Q:

Is OpenCR available to buy?

The OpenCR board on my TurtleBot3 has stopped working. Is it possible to buy a replacement? If so, from where?

A:

You can get OpenCR from the address below.
Since last month, parts of TurtleBot3 have begun to be sold separately and soon there will be more shops that can be bought through branches and agencies.
