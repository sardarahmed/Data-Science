Q:

Lego NXT-ROS working on Groovy Galapagos?

Hi,
I'm just wondering does anyone know if the NXT-ROS package is compatible with the Groovy Galapagos release? There doesn't seem to be any documentation except the wiki and that recommends using the diamondback release(with electric being the newest release even mentioned.) Also are there any other packages that anyone could recommend to control a Lego NXT Robot?
Thanks in advance,
Tadhg Fitzgerald.

I'll answer this since nobody else did; the answer is no, if you are using NXT-ROS you should use the Electric release

A:

Old, but just saw it.
Here I modified NXT for Groovy

Nice! Do you plan to make an announcement, integrate it into ROS wiki etc.? If it's at too early stage to "announce", then I'd suggest to start discussion in SIG like ros-sig-edu.

I'm trying to use the compass with this if you can help me please let me know.

I will add my repo to the wiki soon.
As my modifications where very minor, I dont think we a need a SIG.
I started a related Question here: http://answers.ros.org/question/67831/is-there-a-newer-nxt_ros-stack-using-nxt-python-222-instead-of-120-on-raspberry-pi/

@boog I donâ€™t have a compass, also no Gyro IR or Color for further Testing :-(
You could try to build your compass like the AccelerometerSensor(DigitalSensor) and by looking in a newer version of nxt-python. If it works, Send me a Pull Request plz

I got it to work by combining a patch I found here https://code.google.com/p/foote-ros-pkg/issues/detail?id=24 my files are a mess otherwise would send you.

Do I have to do anything special to get yours working on a raspberry pi? Thanks.
Comment by msieber on 2013-08-01:
I did not look at the issues, my nxt-python version problem is also a Issue(15) there. It should work on the RPi. I only modified sensor car for my needs. Tell me if it works, or what your errors are.

@msieber, the nxt_msgs won't compile and neither will nxt_ros as it looks for an x86 lib in /usr/lib during rosmake. Any idea how to fix this? (On rpi).
