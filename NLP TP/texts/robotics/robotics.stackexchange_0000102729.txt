Q:

How to make the gmapping algorithm use only laser scan topics to build mapsï¼Ÿ

I learned from reading the relevant links of gmapping that gmapping uses odom and laser scan to build maps. Is there any way to let gmapping only accept laserscan data to build maps

A:

Gmapping node subscribes to the odometry data of your robot (topic name) and also the laser scan. The only package I know about that uses only laser scan data to build map is hector mapping ...for that to work you have to get a transform from map to base_link to laser_frame  of your robot .

I have used Hector to get the map I want. I want to ask again what method can I use to build a map with the topic of odom?
