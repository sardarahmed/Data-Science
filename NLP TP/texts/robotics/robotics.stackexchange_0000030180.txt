Q:

Custom simulation using Stage

Hi,
I want to simulate a custom robot using ROS Diamondback. I figured that Stage is the package I should be using for simulation. I have read up the documentation on setting up a .world file for my simulation and have a world file with a robot and the intended simulation arena. However I am stuck as to how to proceed further. I have some code which does controlling/path planning for my robot, but how do I integrate the code with Stage ?
Could someone point me to some documentation / How-tos on this ?
Thanks,
Sagnik

@Sagnik : Have a look, this is primarily gazebo but there is some information on how to use stage/stageros with world files - http://mobotica.blogspot.com/2011/09/using-gazebo.html

A:

A good place to start would be to read over the Stage ROS API available on the stage wiki page. In particular, note that Stage publishes an odom topic for odometry information, a base_scan topic for planar laser scans and subscribes to the cmd_vel topic for velocity commands. Stageros also outputs the tf information required to transform laser scans into the odometry frame.
An important thing to keep in mind is that Stage is not a full-on physics simulation so code that does low-level control may not be appropriate to simulate if it is dependent on physical properties of your platform (I'm referring to things like control loops or PIDs that may need gains tuned to the particular robot platform).
