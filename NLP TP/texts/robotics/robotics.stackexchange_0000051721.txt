Q:

Does IMU data improve odometry in Gazebo?

Hello,
Would using /robot_pose_ekf to fuse odometry and IMU data give me a better pose estimate in a Gazebo simulation? Or does Gazebo provide perfect odometry data without slip and drift?
Thanks!

A:

The question is a bit unclear.  Gazebo can give you a ground-truth pose with respect to the gazebo defined origin.  If you are defining your own origin and using a package to calculate the odometry, then depending on the noise the IMU data can improve or degrade the odometry calculations.
