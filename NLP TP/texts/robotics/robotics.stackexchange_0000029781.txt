Q:

Are there somebodies use OpenCV2.2 with ROS?

I want to translate my previous code by opencv2.2 into ROS, and I have found many differences between opencv and ROS in image type and some other types. So I wander if some one have already developed  a long time on it, please give me some advices?
Thanks a lot!

A:

ROS default install uses OpenCV 2.0
You can upgrade to 2.2 if you replace the ROS opencv2 package with the one available her:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/vision_opencv
just do svn co https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/vision_opencv/trunk
and make it.
