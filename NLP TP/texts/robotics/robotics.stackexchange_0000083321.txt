Q:

Trouble installing Kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04

I've followed these instructions exactly:
http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu
I've tried changing the Download from: setting in Software & Updates  from Main Server to Server for United States.
If I use Main Server, I get an unmet dependencies error and ros-kinetic-desktop ros-kinetic-perception ros-kinetic-simulators ros-kinetic-urdf-tutorial are not going to be installed.
If I use Server for United States, I get 404 errors for several files and the install won't complete:

Everything else appears to install. Are these libs necessary?

A:

These are weird errors. all of the 404s are not ros specific. Perhaps you should go back to the factory settings for the ubuntu repos. When using the Main server, can you output the full error, and ensure that sudo apt update works without error?

I think that actually answers my question. I have a horribly botched install of NVIDIA's CUDA toolkit that I haven't cleaned up yet. apt-get update fails because of this. Good to know these aren't ROS-specific.
