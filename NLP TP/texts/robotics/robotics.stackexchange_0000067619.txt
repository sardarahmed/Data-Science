Q:

Upstream Repository vs Release Repository

I could not figure this out from the tutorials (http://wiki.ros.org/bloom/Tutorials/ReleaseCatkinPackage & http://wiki.ros.org/bloom/Tutorials/FirstTimeRelease), and I wanted to clarify this: if I commit something to the upstream repository, does this also update the release repository? Or do I have to release a new version each time I make a change?

A:

if I commit something to the upstream repository, does this also update the release repository?

No. The upstream and release repository are separate repositories that have no direct (physical) relationship.

do I have to release a new version each time I make a change?

Well, no. You don't have to. It depends on what you find 'release worthy'. Releases typically group a bunch of changes.
I guess you could say that releases are somewhat of a convenience for your users: if every change was followed by an immediate release, your users could just as well clone your development repository (I'm obviously ignoring things like packaging and installation, compatibility guarantees, etc).

So, that means that the release repository is only updated when you do a bloom-release, right?

yes. Obviously you can also manually modify your release repository, but in typical ROS-ified interaction, only bloom and its scripts do something with it.
