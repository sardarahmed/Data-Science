Q:

leg_detector for ROS Kinetic

Hi,
I was wondering how to install properly the leg-detector package in ROS Kinetic?
Unfortunately, I recieve this as the output while installing ros-kinetic-people
   The following packages have unmet dependencies:
   ros-kinetic-people : Depends: ros-kinetic-leg-detector but it is not installable
   Depends: ros-kinetic-people-velocity-tracker but it is not installable

Thanks in advance for your help,

A:

It would appear that the leg_detector package (and some others) have been removed from the people metapackage (temporarily) as they don't build on Kinetic (or really: with OpenCV3).
See wg-perception/people#47 and wg-perception/people#53 for some related discussion and a PR.
Note: you can always use the package status page (this is the one for Kinetic) to see whether a package should be available.
Here is the status for all packages in people.
