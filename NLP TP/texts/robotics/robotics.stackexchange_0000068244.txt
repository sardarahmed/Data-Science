Q:

Image overlap (RViz and Gazebo world)

Hello people,
I am working with a robot equiped with a stereo camera rig, but when trying to see the image in RViz, I get an overlap of the two worlds, Rviz and gazebo:

Running image_view to see the image I don't get this problem:

I am not understanding why, and if someone could help me I would be very grateful.
