Q:

homebrew: Failed to detect successful installation of [gazebo]

I had ROS Hydro installed and uninstalled in to install ROS Jade. During the install I'm getting an odd error. I'm being told that gazebo i already installed but that it can't be detected. How do I get around this?
 $ rosdep install --from-paths src
--ignore-src --rosdistro jade -y executing command [brew install gazebo] Warning: osrf/simulation/gazebo1-1.9.7 already installed ERROR: the following rosdeps failed to install   homebrew: Failed to detect successful installation of [gazebo]

Can you add to your question the output of brew tap and brew list | grep gazebo | xargs brew info?

@William I added the outputs to the bottom of the question. Let me know if you need to see anything else. Also, I found that I can safely move to the next step and ros installs fine.

A:

You probably will have to uninstall "gazebo1" and install "gazebo". I'm not sure exactly how it got into that state, but rosdep resolve gazebo gives:
#homebrew
gazebo

So that should be the equivalent of brew install gazebo. If you're satisfied that you have gazebo installed you can also give the rosdep install line the extra argument --skip-keys gazebo.

I was facing the same issue and brew uninstall gazebo1 and brew uninstall gazebo5 and later brew install gazebo solved it. Thanks William.
