Q:

roslaunch using find packages on different machines looks for packages on local machine

I'm using roslaunch a lot to spawn different nodes on different machines I'm working on. Doing this using the launch syntax together with the machine tag works fine. However, I just found out that when using the $(find PkgName) syntax in a node which is spawned on a remote machine, ros actually starts looking for the package on my local laptop. I expected it to do that search on the remote machine however. Is this known (expected) behaviour or should I file a bug report for it?

A:

This is expected behavior: the roslaunch parameters are evaluated on the local computer, before being copied over SSH to a launch file on the remote machine (and thereafter executed).

OK. The packages I want to run on the remote machine are however not installed on my local pc. So I not only have to install those locally as well, the search doesn't make any sense here, as the actual execution will happen on the remote machine ?!
