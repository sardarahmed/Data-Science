Q:

How to use existing ROS package to build my own self navigation robot?

I have designed a differential drive robot similar to Turtlebot in solidworks and launched it in Gazebo successfully after developing a URDF model out of it. I want to simulate the robot in gazebo for self-navigation using ROS navigation stack. I want to use the existing ROS stakes developed for robots like Turtlebot but i cant get clear idea about how to proceed with this. Can anyone direct me to the resources.

The newly released book has good chapters that go through that systematically

I am not involved in it in any way, I have just read it.
