Q:

add opencv to indigo

The Opencv packages aren't built in the ROS Indigo anymore. So what should I do if I want to add opencv2?

A:

Note that for compatibility with Hydro and general simplicity it is recommended to use cv_bridge as a dependency to pull in opencv for Indigo packages (a bit hacky though, as this pulls in other related packages). See discussion on github and Indigo migration guide on OpenCV.

Given the OP asks about Indigo, I think this looks more appropriate ROS-way and should be chosen as the answer IMO.
