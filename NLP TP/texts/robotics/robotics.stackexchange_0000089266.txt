  set "tf2_sensor_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.

  sure it has been installed.

A:

There are already some questions about this issue : #q138236, #q305359 for exemple.
It's just that you haven't installed the package tf2_sensor_msgs :
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-tf2-sensor-msgs

It should solve your issue.
