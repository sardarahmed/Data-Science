Q:

Error launching the openni_tracker

Hi guys,
I am new in Ubuntu and ROS.
The system I am using is ROS Fuerte. It is running in the Ubuntu 12.04 Lts.
When I try to open the openni_tracker I get the following error message:
"[rospack] Error: stack / package openni_tracker not found."
Some months - doing the same procedures - I could normally run the openni_tracker. What might be happening?

A:

It looks like the openni_tracker is not in your ROS package path. Did you source the correct setup.bash file (The one that you used at the time when it worked)?
