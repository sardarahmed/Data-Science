Q:

Can I run rviz on ubuntu arm with hydro

I'm tring to run rviz out of a beaglebone with Hydro.
I know the port is still ongoing due to missing lisp libraries, but is the rviz package  affected?
I'm asking because in the rviz user guide page there is a command for getting it out of the apt repo and I can't find the package...

A:

The Beableboard runs on an arm processor.
Rviz  is likely too heavy to run on the Beaglebone.
However, you can launch rviz on a distant computer and visualise data on the distant computer using:

Well that is a good solution too. But for the sake of the argument, why can't I find the rviz in the repo?

Mostly because it is too heavy to run on the beableboard, since it is useless to take time to do the port.
Some tried: http://answers.ros.org/question/52098/unable-to-compile-rviz-on-ubuntu-armhf/
but i have no echo of a succesful build.
