Q:

Real life SMACH examples?

Hello,
I have run through most of the SMACH tutorials and I was hoping to find at least one example where SMACH is used on a real robot.  For example, was SMACH used for the PR2 marathon tests?  Or the "beer me" demo?  If so, is the source code available somewhere?  Any other examples would be welcome too.
Thanks!
patrick

A:

I'm not sure about marathons -- but the pr2_plugs application used SMACH
