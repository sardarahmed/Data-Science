Is there an entry in /etc/hosts for localhost?

A:

Are you running ROS on multiple machines?
Probably this might be a network problem. See ROS network setup for more information. Also, check your bashrc file and see whether it is properly configured for your ip.
Check you host name using
sudo nano /etc/hosts

For example:
export ROS_HOSTNAME=136.159.101.186 
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://136.159.101.186:11311

If you're going to be using IPs, then use ROS_IP, not ROS_HOSTNAME.
