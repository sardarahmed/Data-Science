Q:

How to find the nonlinear equations of motion of a seesaw-cart electromechanical system?

So what I have here is a single pendulum with a cart system. The pendulum is composed of a set of rigidly connected parts integrated in a seesaw-like structure which can freely pivot around the axis on its bottom. The weight attached to the vertical rod of the pendulum is an additional element to the pendulum.
What I need to do is to derive equations of motion and state-space representation of this system and put it all into MATLAB to model this system. I am just getting to learn Newton's and Langrange's method and I have no way of knowing if my solution would remotely be correct.
The two figure below represent the described model, with the second being a more simplified model of the seesaw model.
The system's constant parameters necessary to model the dynamics of the system are as follows:

a height of center of mass of the pendulum, excluding the weight B (i.e., point A in the figure = center of mass of the light gray
shaded parts),
b position of the weight B on the vertical rod )the weight is modelled a point concentrated mass at point B),
d height of interconnection points of ropes which connect multiple pendulums (this is irrelevant to the given problem since I want to
model the system for a single pendulum),
c height of the center of mass of the cart (point C in the figure),
h height of the rack for cart propulsion,
J moment of inertia of the pendulum, excluding the weight B,
m1 mass of the pendulum, excluding the weight B,
m2 mass of the weight in point B,
m3 mass of the cart.

The cart is driven by a DC motor.

Any help with this I would greatly appreciate.

Took some time but this right here might be the solution to the problem. I did this by hand so I hope the handwriting is not a problem. Thanks to Chuck for the help! :)
