Q:

Trouble starting gazebo_experimental - Failed to load plugin [gazeboGuiDisplayImage]

Hello.  I'd like to contribute to gazebo_experimental, and have successfully built everything from source on a clean Ubuntu 16.04 desktop. I followed this tutorial to build all dependencies from source (in debug mode).  Then I followed instructions here to attempt to build (in debug mode) and run.  The build was clean, and all tests pass.  But when I run gazebo -v 4, I get the following errors:
[GUI] [Msg] Init app
[GUI] [Err] [PluginLoader.cc:89] Library[] does not exist!
[GUI] [Err] [Iface.cc:244] Failed to load plugin [gazeboGuiDisplayImage]
[GUI] [Err] [PluginLoader.cc:89] Library[] does not exist!
[GUI] [Err] [Iface.cc:244] Failed to load plugin [gazeboGuiDiagnostics]
[GUI] [Msg] Create main window
[GUI] [Msg] Run main window
QMetaObject::invokeMethod: No such method QMenuBar::aboutToShow()

My ENV variables are set as follows:
vagrant@vagrant:~/dev/gazebo/gazebo_experimental/build$ echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
/usr/local/lib
vagrant@vagrant:~/dev/gazebo/gazebo_experimental/build$ echo $GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH 
/usr/local/lib:examples/dummy_demo/systems/   

Any help would be appreciated.

A:

I answered my own question.  I was missing the IGN_GUI_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable.  I set it to the full path of my gazebo_experimental build src/gui directory and was able to run the dummy_demo.
