Q:

Problem communicating with multiple ROS units: rostopic list is visible but not rostopic echo. ($ROS_IP is already set)

I am communicating with my desktop PC as master and my Raspberry pi as slave.
When I start a node on the Raspberry pi and publish a topic (/scan), the desktop PC shows the topic (/scan) in the rostopic list but no new messages in the rostopic hz /scan.
The conditions are as follows
<Desktop PC: ubuntu 18.04 / melodic
Contents of ~/.bashrc:
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.30.109:11311
export ROS_HOSTNAME=192.168.30.109
export ROS_IP=192.168.30.109

<Raspberry pi: ubuntu18.04 / melodic>
Contents of ~/.bashrc
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.30.109:11311
export ROS_HOSTNAME=192.168.30.110
export ROS_IP=192.168.30.110

Note that I tried deleting ROS_HOSTNAME, but it did not work.
Also, I don't know if this information is necessary, but when I do rqt_graph, Nodes/Topics(all) shows both /scan and the node that is publishing, but Nodes/Topics(active) shows only /rostopic
****************** only appears.
Please let me know if there is anything else I should check.
I am a Japanese speaker, so there may be some things I am not doing well.
Thank you in advance for your answer.

I typed the following commands on both my desktop PC and Raspberry pi.
sudo ufw allow 11311
sudo ufw allow 22
sudo ufw reload

I am aware that 11311 is the port used for ROS communication and 22 is the port used for ssh.

I solved the problem by typing the following command on both my desktop PC and Raspberry pi!
sudo ufw allow 1024:65535/tcp
sudo ufw reload

Thank you so much to ignacio and Mike973 for your comments and answers.
I may come back to ask again, so please help me again if you like.

A:

Your firewall changes are not sufficient to allow ros1 to work. ros1 requires that you allow incoming tcp connections to all port numbers >= 1024 from the other host.
