Q:

OpenNI camera calibration yaml file not found

This is my first question, so forgive me for any formatting issues.
I'm trying to use the  visp_calibration package to calibrate an Xtion pro live camera. This uses the camera1394 package, which is giving me errors.
When I run
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch

followed by
roslaunch calib-live-firewire.launch

from the tutorial, I receive a camera not found error and the warnings:
Using default parameters for IR camera calibration.
Camera calibration file /home/baxter/.ros/camera_info/depth_1205220468.yaml not found.
Using default parameters for RGB camera calibration.
Camera calibration file /home/baxter/.ros/camera_info/rgb_1205220468.yaml not found.

I checked the terminal and get these same warnings when i run
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch

I looked at OpenNI: Camera calibration file not found and have run:
baxter@13:24:~/ros_ws/src$ ls /home/baxter/.ros/camera_info
ls: cannot access /home/baxter/.ros/camera_info: No such file or directory
baxter@13:24:~/ros_ws/src$ ls /home/baxter/.ros
latest  log  roscore-11311.pid  rosdep  rospack_cache_02456348576439424157

Should I have the yaml files? If so, how do I get them? I can launch the camera, but it needs to publish under the /camera/image_raw topic for the calibration to work, and it seems to be publishing under /camera/rgb/image_raw and /camera/ir/image_raw.
