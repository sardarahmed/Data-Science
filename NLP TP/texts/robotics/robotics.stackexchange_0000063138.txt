Q:

Has anyone made a Lightware SF10/A laser altimeter driver?

It comes with a USB interface and terminal program in Windows is available.  I believe there is just one message at up to 32 Hz.

A:

We now have a basic one available (using cereal).  Let us know if you are interested.  The sensor works very nicely.

Do you have the code in a repository somewhere?

Nice. Thanks. Is the cereal pkg you included in any way different from the standard one?
Comment by Timo on 2015-03-04:
Hi, the cereal package is used to read out the messages from the /dev/ttyUSB0 device. This is a catkinized version. I believe the one on wiki.ros.org is not.
cheers Timo

Right, indeed. According to rosindex/cereal_port there are indeed no registered catkin versions. Perhaps you would be interested in releasing the one you migrated?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2015-03-05:
One of the authors (Gon√ßalo Cabrita) of cereal apparently has a catkinized version on his github account.

Thanks, have moved our catkinized version to a separate repo, likely very similar.
