Q:

chart recorder for ROS?

Any suggestions for strip chart recorder software for use when viewing live (and recorded) streams of timeseries data? Ideally, the software would have a nice GUI that allows one to zoom both vertically and horizontally and show multiple ROS topics simultaneously.

A:

I think what you are looking for is rxplot.
This will produce a strip chart that updates for you while ROS is running.  It can also be used with playback.
For pure playback, you can use rxbag.  rxbag is also slightly more extensible than rxplot, and you can right plugins for visualizing any application specific data you may need.

The problem with rxbag is that it cannot plot simultaneously data from different topics (in the same figure). rxplot can

Actually I learned recently (over here: http://answers.ros.org/question/432/analyzing-ros-messages) that you can also use rxbag to plot topics at runtime, and not only when playing back bagfiles.
