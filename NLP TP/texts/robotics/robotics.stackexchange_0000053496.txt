Q:

best way to create a topic

Hi,
I have 2 nodes that need 1-way communication of an array of floating point values, so I want node 1 to publish to a topic (e.g. ref), and node 2 to subscribe to that topic. I've searched on how to create a node with topic, but the tutorial only shows a message topic. Now I've tried 2 approaches: using a yaml file and using a launch file according to working examples, but so far neither creates a new topic.
So the question is: how do I best create a new topic for 2 existing nodes ?
Thanks

A:

I'm not sure you understand the concept of topics and messages quite correctly. It might help you to go through the main tutorials again, in particular UnderstandingTopics and WritingPublisherSubscriber(c++).
Messages are always broadcast on topics. To create a topic, one node needs to advertise that they will broadcast messages on that topic. Then another node subscribes to that topic and receives all messages broadcast on that topic.

Further, the message type that you are likely interested in using will be one of the multiarray datatypes in the  http://www.ros.org/wiki/std_msgs/

TY @tbh and @trinighost. I did understand but just a minor misconception. The multiarray type did the trick.
