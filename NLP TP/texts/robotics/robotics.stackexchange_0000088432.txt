Q:

Navigation - how to use my own Local and Global costmaps?

Hi,
I have my own node that provides Global Map and Local Map as nav_msgs::OccupancyGrid messages.
I would like to use them in the navigation stack and I cannot figure out how to do it.
Have someone done this kind of operation?
Thank you
Walter

A:

Generally speaking, you can just subscribe to the OccupancyGrid messages as a "static" layer

The maps are updated constantly (SLAM), I cannot use a static layer.
The Global map normally is updated at 1 Hz, the local map at 5 Hz

"static" is a bit of a misnomer. It will subscribe to the topic as long as you publish on it. Whether that's going to be efficient is another matter.

Ok, I saw the code and I understood how it works.
Thank you you have been of great help

David, I have a last question for you. Can you explain me the meaning of the message "_updates"?
I have my idea about it, but I want to understand if I need to publish "myMap" and "myMap_updates" too...
Comment by David Lu on 2018-08-14:
You don't have to publish both, but publishing updates can be more efficient. If you have a 1000x1000 global map and change one pixel, you can either send the entire 1000x1000 map again or you can just send the update.

Good, this is really important for me since I have this information.
The documentation of "map_msgs" is really poor.
