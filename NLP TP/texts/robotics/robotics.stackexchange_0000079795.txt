Q:

Rosparam fails silenntly with a wrong param?

How can I see the type of parameter I can pass to when I set a Rosparam?
I do

$rosparam list

and got:

/background_r
/background_g
/background_b

etc
those are intuitive enough to predict that are ints
but if i need the type by doing

$rosparam type /background_r

I got an error since that command is not existing...
on the other hand, doing:

$rosparam set /background_r "foo"

fails silently...
what am doing wrong?

A:

Actually Ros has a parameter server that is nothing else as a Dictionary,
parameter there has not type as you are specting...
so to the question: when you do:
$rosparam set /background_r "foo"
How you now it is failing? is not actually, you just wrote the parameter /background_r to "foo" in the dictionary
you can verify that by getting the value: just do:
$rosparam get /background_r
and you will get foo
