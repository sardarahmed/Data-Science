Q:

RGBD SLAM GUI not displaying any video feed

Hi, I am using ROS Diamondback on Ubuntu 10.04 running on VMware Player. I have also connected a Kinect camera via USB. I think I have installed all required drivers and build all the necessary files without failures.
However, when I execute this command:
roslaunch rgbdslam kinect+rgbdslam.launch
The RGBDSLAM GUI opens up, but it doesn't display any video. Two windows in the bottom say "Waiting for monochrome image..." and "Waiting for depth image..."
When I press space and stop, I see that 0 bytes of data has been recorded. The same thing happens when I press enter to get a single frame.
I am sort of stuck at a dead end, and really have no clue where things are going wrong. Any help would be appreciated.
