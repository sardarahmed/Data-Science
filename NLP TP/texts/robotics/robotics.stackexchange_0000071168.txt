A:

If you're using a newer version of ROS such as Indigo or Jade, the ability to set the frame rate is built into rviz.
In the "Displays" panel (usually on the left side of the window), within "Global Options", there should be a option for "Frame Rate", which defaults to 30. Change this value to 60.
