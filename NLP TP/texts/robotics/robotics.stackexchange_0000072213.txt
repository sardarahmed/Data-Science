Q:

How to turn off motors for selected arm joints on PR2?

I'd like to only turn off some of the arm motors. I basically want to mimic the effect of turning of the arm controllers for the PR2, except I still want to control the wrist flex and roll.
Is there a way to turn off all of the other motors but still control the wrist roll/flex?
Thanks!

A:

I figured out a hack to do this, which is to set the desired joints for the controller on the parameter server and then unload and reload the controller.

rosparam set r_arm_controller/joints "[r_wrist_flex_joint, r_wrist_roll_joint]"

rosrun pr2_controller_manager pr2_controller_manager stop r_arm_controller

rosrun pr2_controller_manager pr2_controller_manager unload r_arm_controller

rosrun pr2_controller_manager pr2_controller_manager load r_arm_controller

rosrun pr2_controller_manager pr2_controller_manager start r_arm_controller
