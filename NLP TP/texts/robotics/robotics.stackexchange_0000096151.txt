Q:

No autoware.ai folder, when launching autoware in Docker

Hey, guys,
when running autoware after first installation from docker, no autoware folder is found, do you have any clues?
proceeding every steps with the latest guides, until :'
cd autoware.ai '
Docker is successfully installed with Ubuntu 18.04 and launching with tag cuda off.

update
only folder  'Autoware' and 'shared_dir'  exist

autoware@w-VirtualBox:~$ ls
Autoware shared_dir

Terminal

w@w-VirtualBox:~$ sudo docker run hello-world

...
Hello from Docker!

What shows up if you ls in the Docker container?
Also, FYI - launching the container using sudo is not our typical setup. We assume that people have followed the Post-Installation Steps for Linux after install to allow them to run Docker commands as a non-root user.

if ls, only "Autoware" and "shared_dir" exist,  but no autoware.ai,
autoware@w-VirtualBox:~$ ls
Autoware  shared_dir
thanks for the user group information, I add it, but still have no clue on the unfound directory.

A:

Most of the tutorials are written assuming you're building from source. In the from-source build instructions, we have you create a folder called autoware.ai to use as your workspace. In the Docker, containers, however, the workspace folder has always been called Autoware. This is a discontinuity but it was a decision between changing an existing pattern to match a new one or keeping what is expected by existing users. We chose the latter. So, if you follow any tutorials using Docker, just replace autoware.ai in the path with Autoware
If you would like this changed, feel free to submit an issue at https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.ai/docker/-/issues.
