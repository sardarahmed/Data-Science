Thanks!

A:

Do you mean an IR camera, an IR proximity sensor, or an IR motion sensor?
For the first and third, Gazebo would need to have some model of IR spectrum (which it doesn't). For the second, the plugin mentioned here might do the trick:

I meant proximity sensor. I checked the links before, but I thought it's using laser instead of IR, could you please clarify it a little bit for me? I'm new to robotics so please forgive me for the naive questions. Thanks a lot!
