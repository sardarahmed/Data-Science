Q:

Lidar data is reflected 180 degrees

Hello everyone I use Slamtec S1 lidar in conjunction with Jetson Nano running Ubuntu 18 and ROS2 Eloquent. I'm using the sllidar_ros2 package and everything looks great. But when I added lidar to my urdf file, in rviz2 I see that lidar data is displayed the other way around. I also have ZED 2, with which I get an IMU, it is also added to urdf and thanks to it my robot is moving in the right direction. However, I don't understand what is wrong with lidar, how can I turn it?
Here is a part of the urdf description with lidar, it is located in the front part of the robot, along with ZED2. Unfortunately, I can't attach files yet, but rviz2 shows as if there is a wall in front of my robot's face and a large space behind, although in reality it's the opposite.

A:

You probably have not correctly specified the yaw for the fixed lidar_joint. For a urdf joint, the order of operation is translate then rotate. Try setting yaw to 3.14159 (radians).
