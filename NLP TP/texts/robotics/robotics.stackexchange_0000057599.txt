Q:

rospy Reaction to ROSCore Shutdown

When running a node in python (or C++), is there a way to detect the loss of ROSCore or the ROSMaster?  I understand how to detect shutdown of the node itself, but need to be able to handle, in my own way, loss of ROSCore.

Are you asking how to handle something like that or how to detect that this happened to be able to handle it?

Sorry, asking how to detect the loss.

A:

In case that it's lost there is obviously nothing left to ask if it's gone.
The simplest way might be to perform some xmlrpc call like getUri or similar and see if there is a reply.
The negative behavior (i.e. not reply) would be the same that a node sees that tries to interact with a non-existing master.

Thanks.  That is what I expected, but I wasn't sure if there was some unknown function that I have not found.  I currently have a thread that does the "getUri" call and it works.
