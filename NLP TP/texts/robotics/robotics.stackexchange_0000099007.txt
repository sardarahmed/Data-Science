Q:

Uncertain behavior of hand eye calibration

Hello there,
I am collecting samples from different pose for move it hand-eye calibration. Instead of solving it shows the far position of my camera after solving sample 5  as shown in the picture. Am I forgetting some steps?

What my robot looks like is described in the below image.

On the six-axis, I have attached an Iron rod and at the end of that rod, there is tool0 (My tool point). In the iron rod, after 10 cm from the axis-six, I have kept the camera at 3.5cm height(Z+ from the rod.).
I don't know the issue, Is something wrong with my configuration or the issue is with the hand-eye calibration?
The hand-eye calibration setting is described below.

Thanks for the help!

Thanks, @Piotr for this answer.
We did some hand-eye calibration but we got mixed results. You might want to try to:

Increase the separation between ArUco makers. I think 1 mm is to small of a gap. Our board had a 1cm gap. Also we've noticed that the bigger the markers are the better camera position estimate.
Try different software. We used this package: https://github.com/IFL-CAMP/easy_handeye. In it you can also find some tips on what kind of robot movements are the best for the calibration process.
I'm not sure if I understand the package instruction correctly, but I would try to set, depending on what you want to achieve, the "End-effector frame" as the last link of the robot or as your TCP (create a new frame at the end of the rod). Next roughly measure the distance of the camera from that point and put it in as the initial guess.

I hope some of this suggestions will help.
