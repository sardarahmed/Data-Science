Q:

Why doesn't the karto package build?

Hello all,
I checked out the karto package and built it initially using rosmake but the node wasn't built. After going through the CMakeLists.txt, I found out that the lines to build the node were commented out and un-commenting and building the package again led me to errors.
I was wondering if this package is still maintained. I am using running ros-electric on my machine. Thank you in advance for your help.
Cheers,
Hozefa

The karto node generation from the cpp source code is commented in the CMakeLists.txt because the code related with the TF API is broken. See the patch I've attatched below.

A:

I managed to compile 36074 revision.
cmake complained about the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH variable, to solve this:
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/path/to/your/karto/checkout:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

After this:
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" .
make
