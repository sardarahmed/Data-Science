Q:

How to insert breakpoints and step through a Gazebo plugin?

Hello,
Does anyone know if there's any way to insert breakpoints and step through a Gazebo plugin? This would be very useful to help with debugging logical errors. I've tried inserting breakpoints in the eclipse editor, compiling and running the launch file but it doesn't seem to work. As such, I've just resorted to printf([var])'s for now.
Thanks very much!
Angus

I've been curious myself. Here are two resources that I found on the issue from the gdb world. Hope they're more useful for you than they were for me!
