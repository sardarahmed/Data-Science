Q:

rosdep 2 install system dependencies

Hi,
it seems like i do not totally understand rosdep2. I could easily add my own system dependencies in rosdep. in the sources.list file I tried to add local yaml file addresses as:
yaml /opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros/opencv.yaml
in order to use my own built opencv-svn (Opencv2.4) package, but it rejects it because:
url must be a fully-specified URL with scheme, hostname, and path
How can I add system dependencies to rosdep2?

You probably need to add something like file:// at the beginning.
