Q:

Kinect point cloud to pcd files

Hi, I'm using the openni_launch stack to gather data from the kinect sensor. I'm currently able to visualize the points cloud with rviz. I need to save each incoming frame as a .pcd file for data processing, is there a easy way to do so with ROS?
thanks

A:

Use pointcloud_to_pcd stated in pcl_ros.
You're able to visualize the points cloud with rviz, so I assumed that you know which topic is transmitting the pointcloud you need.
You can store the pointcloud to a pcd file by simply running
rosrun pcl_ros pointcloud_to_pcd input:=<your target topic name>

If the data in "your target topic name" is valid pointcloud data, this executable will automatically save the pointcloud to a pcd file.

Will this still work with ROS Hydro?
