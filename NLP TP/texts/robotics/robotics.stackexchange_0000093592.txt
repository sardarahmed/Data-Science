Q:

roslint python errors to stdout?

I'm running roslint within travis like this:
catkin build $(catkin list --depends-on roslint -u) --no-deps --catkin-make-args roslint

When there is a lint error in C++ it is visible in stdout and is easy to read, but python errors are in a log file like this:
Errors     << foo_pkg:make /home/lucasw/catkin_ws/logs/foo_pkg/build.make.472.log                                                                                                                                                                                                     

Adding --verbose works but there is a ton of other output also obscuring the actual error- is there a way to just get the python lint error?

A:

You can do so by making pep8 redirect stdout to stderr with the following in your CMakeLists.txt
set(ROSLINT_PYTHON_OPTS "1>&2")
roslint_python()

That works, but it seems like there ought to be a standard option to do that, I looked at the roslint pycodestyle.py source and tried out some options but they didn't have any effect when deliberately introducing pep8 violations:
set(ROSLINT_PYTHON_OPTS "--show-source")
set(ROSLINT_PYTHON_OPTS "--show-pep8")
set(ROSLINT_PYTHON_OPTS "--verbose")

or in combination
set(ROSLINT_PYTHON_OPTS "--show-source" "--show-pep8")

I think the key is to have outputs print to stderr which is what cpplint does.  However, there doesn't seem to be any option to have pep8 output to stderr.

Example of disabling all the default ignores (E121,E123,E126,E226,E24,E704,W503,W504):
set(ROSLINT_PYTHON_OPTS "--ignore=''" "1>&2")
