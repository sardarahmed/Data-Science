A:

From the tutorial here you can find out how you can a apply a downwards force
rosservice call gazebo/apply_body_wrench '{body_name: "top::my_top" , wrench: { force: { x: 0.0, y: 0, z: -0.1 } , torque: { x: 0.0, y: 0 , z: 0.0 } }, start_time: 10000000000, duration: -1000000000 }'

Just apply a force in x-direction.
