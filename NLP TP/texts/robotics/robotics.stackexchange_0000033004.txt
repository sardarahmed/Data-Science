Q:

openni_camera error "bad parameter"

I am able to use the openni_camera node with the command "roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch". However, if I try to use any other nodes that require openni_camera (such as openni_tracker or rviz), openni_camera fails. Previously, I had a different error that was solved, but I do not know if this new error is a result of the solution or not. This is what is output.  The problem is in the last few lines.
