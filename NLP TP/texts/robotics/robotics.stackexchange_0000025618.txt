Q:

Should URDF in Gazebo tutorials be replaced with SDF?

Migrated from ROS' community's website.
In the QA thread "SDF vs URDF what should one use?" (on answers.gazebosim.org), URDF is not recommended on gazebo in favor of SDF. But from the answer in this thread, sounds like URDF will still be supported on gazebo. Can we keep the tutorial using URDF?

A couple of comments there:
It would be better to have one standard (and also use the new version 
of Gazebo in ROS), would prevent a lot of problems. But URDF is also 
used in RVIZ which doesn't care about the extra proporties like 
friction. @davinci

2nd:
I'm in favour. I'm new and the learning curve is steep when I need to 
pull bits of advice off of gazebosim (usually SDF) and ros answers 
(URDF) and figure out what's valid where and in which version of Gazebo.

A:

Thanks for the advice. We'll be migrating the documentation to use SDF. Our primary blocker right now is releasing a standalone library of SDF.
