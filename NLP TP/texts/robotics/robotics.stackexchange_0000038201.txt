Q:

rosrun gscam on ubuntu 11.10

I am using ROS electric on Ubuntu 11.10.
I have installed gscam and its rosmake was successfully.
For running gscam, as in the gscam wiki is mentioned, I did these steps:
roscd gscam
cd bin
export GSCAM_CONFIG="v4l2src device=/dev/video2 ! video/x-raw-rgb ! ffmpegcolorspace"
rosrun gscam gscam
but it says:
Gstreamer Version: GStreamer 0.10.35
Failed to PAUSE.
In the gscam wiki is mentioned that If you see a message about a "failure to PAUSE" or something similar, the most likely cause is a permission issue with the available video devices.
Anybody can help me for this problem.
Many thanks!
Parisa.

just change export GSCAM_CONFIG="v4l2src device=/dev/video2 ! video/x-raw-rgb ! ffmpegcolorspace" with export GSCAM_CONFIG="v4l2src device=/dev/video0 ! video/x-raw-rgb ! ffmpegcolorspace"

A:

I assume you've already tried:
sudo chmod a+rw /dev/video2
or similar to no effect?
