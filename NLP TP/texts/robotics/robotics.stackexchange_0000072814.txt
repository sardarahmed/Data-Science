Please add more information: from apt-get or from source? Which commands do you execute? What is the expected behaviour? What is the behaviour you experience? Which robot (you have cob4 and cob3 in the video)?

From the 12min video we mainly see terminals, the few glimpses of rviz, a few glimpses of gazebo which seems fine...
What do you want to do and what does not work?

hi!
I got it from apt-get
the commands are here
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D3kirMhOmmdbQGCCTGCvioP3tMIhid20cN8izyi75tw/edit?usp=sharing
I tried all the robots on simulation
the problem is that the robot simply does not move when there is a command like 2-d pose estimate etc

A:

With the release version the robot is not moving because there is a conflict with the cmd_vel topic name. The navigation publishes the twist command to /base_controller/command and gazebo is subscribed to /base/twist_controller/command.
The problem is already fixed but, at the moment, you have to use the actual source version.
You can create a cob3-2_navigation.rosinstall file with the following lines:
 - git:
    uri: 'https://github.com/ipa320/cob_common.git'
    local-name: cob_common
    version: indigo_dev
- git:
    uri: 'https://github.com/ipa320/cob_control.git'
    local-name: cob_control
    version: indigo_dev
- git:
    uri: 'https://github.com/ipa320/cob_driver.git'
    local-name: cob_driver
    version: indigo_dev
- git:
    uri: 'https://github.com/ipa320/cob_robots.git'
    local-name: cob_robots
    version: indigo_dev
- git:
    uri: 'https://github.com/ipa320/cob_navigation.git'
    local-name: cob_navigation
    version: indigo_dev

 

And install the necessary packages using the commands:
rosinstall ~/YourWorkSpace/src cob3-2_navigation.rosinstall
rosdep install --from-path ~/YourWorkSpace/src -i -y
source ~/YourWorkSpace/devel/setup
