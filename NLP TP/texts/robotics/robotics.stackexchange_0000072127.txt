Q:

Including files from another catkin workspace

I'm having difficulty setting the include paths that I need for a ros node I'm building.
I need to include some header files from a different catkin workspace in order to use some services from another custom node. The catkin workspace path of with the header files I need is '~/ptu47_wss' under this the path '/src/dp_ptu47_pan_tilt_stage/include/dp_ptu47_msgs' contains the include files I need.
The catkin workspace for the project I'm working on is called 'catkin_project' and is in my home directory the same as 'ptu47_wss'
How do I set up my CMakeLists.txt file so that these header files can be included in my project?
Thanks, Pete

Could this be an xy-problem? Workspace overlaying as mentioned by @joq would certainly work, but do you have any particular reason for not placing the dp_ptu47_pan_tilt_stage package in the same workspace as your other node?

Good point. Overlays are not required if all your dependencies are together in your main workspace. (But technically, any dependencies on /opt/ros/indigo/ are also a sort of overlay.)

A:

The feature you're looking for is called overlaying a catkin workspace.
