Q:

error while installing ros groovy on ubuntu 12.04 armel

Hello, I want to install ROS groovy from source on ubuntu armel 12.04 according to this page http://wiki.ros.org/groovy/Installation/Source. I have download the ros-comm to  /ros_catkin_ws/src. Than  run :
$rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro groovy -yr

I get the following error
 executing command [sudo apt-get install -y python-rospkg]
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package python-rospkg

Package sbcl is not available, but is referred to by another package.
This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
is only available from another source
However the following packages replace it:
  sbcl-source sbcl-doc

E: Package 'sbcl' has no installation candidate

  apt: Failed to detect successful installation of [python-catkin-pkg]
  apt: Failed to detect successful installation of [sbcl]
  apt: Failed to detect successful installation of [python-rosdep]

In fact,  I have successfully installed  rospkg  , catkin-pkg  and   rosdep.
So,I install them again.
$sudo pip install rospkg catkin-pkg rosdep 

I  got the following:
Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): rospkg in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): catkin-pkg in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packs
Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): rosdep in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages

Please help me to solve this problem. thank you very much.

A:

rosdep cannot detect the installation of packages through pip. You can ignore any errors for packages that are installed through pip (python-rospkg, python-rosdep and python-catkin-pkg).
There is no version of sbcl available for the armel version of Ubuntu, so you'll have to go through your ROS source tree and remove the packages that depend on sbcl. (probably roslisp and friends). You'll also want to remove any other packages that actually use sbcl, and edit the package.xml for ros_comm to remove the dependency on sbcl.
PS: I'm still going to recommend that you install an armhf version of Ubuntu instead of trying to make things work on armel. The armel packages perform poorly; you won't be able to run any interesting packages like navigation or use the OpenNI/Kinect drivers.

Thank you ahendrix .Now the roscore can run succesfully on arm when I remove the roslisp. At the same time,I   am finding  an armhf version of Ubuntu,too.I want to try the boths way.
