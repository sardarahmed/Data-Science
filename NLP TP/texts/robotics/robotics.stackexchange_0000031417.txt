Q:

Possible bug in move_base.launch

Hi all,
For several days, I (a relative newbie) have been trying to get the nav stack working.  My map always came up offset from the robot in rviz (origin at lower left corner of map).
I finally found that the move_base.launch file in the "Setup and Configuration of the Navigation Stack on a Robot" tutorial (para. 3.5) is using a deprecated version of map_server arguments (as noted in the map_server code).  It uses the "map_server  " form rather than the "map_server <map.yaml>" form.  The deprecated version doesn't work properly  and the associated ROS_WARN message that map_server apparently should be displaying didn't show up on my terminal.
I suggest that the launch file be updated.  This was pretty hard to track down.

Please file this as a ticket using the appropriate trac. There's a link on the navigation wiki page.
