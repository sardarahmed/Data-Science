Q:

Where can i find the source code of tf::StampedTransform class and function

Hi All,
I have downloaded the tf sourcecode package but can not find the sorce code of tf::StampedTransform class. I want to see the sourcecode of the getRPY function in the example code as below:
tf::StampedTransform transform;
tfListener.lookupTransform(source_frameid, target_frameid, ros::Time(), transform);
double yaw, pitch, roll;
transform.getBasis().getRPY(roll, pitch, yaw);

Can any body give me some hint?

A:

tf::StampedTransform is derived from tf::Transform (see implementation of tf::StampedTransform here and the docs of tf::Transform here).
getRPY is actually not a function of any of those clases, but of the Matrix3x3 Type, which is a member of tf::Transform that you get via the getBasis() function. The docs of Matrix3x3 can be found here.

Thanks a lot!
Is there a easier way to tranform Quaternion to EulerAngle besides getRPY(roll, pitch, yaw) in ROS?
