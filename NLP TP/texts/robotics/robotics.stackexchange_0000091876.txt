Are you mixing ROS 1 and ROS 2?

Also do you want to tell us some more about what you're trying to do. Posting us little more than an error message isn't very helpful.

yes I first installed ROS1 with kinetic distribution and then I know about ros2 which support real time interface so also  installed ROS2 with kinetic distribution. I also getting roscore problem when I run roscore command. So how do I fix it.Thanks for help

A work-around would be to not (auto) source the ROS 2 Ardent setup.bash file.
ROS 1 catkin should probably be fixed to not error-out with this setup, but if you don't source the ROS 2 setup file it should work as normal.
Also: why did you install Ardent? That is 4 ROS 2 releases old now (and no longer supported afaik).
