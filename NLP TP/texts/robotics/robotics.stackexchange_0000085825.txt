Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Python Nodelet

Is there a way (or even a tutorial) to write nodelet plugins in Python?
I have one python node in my image processing pipeline. All the other nodes are roscpp nodelets.
The question nodelets in python suggests it should be possible?

A:

Nodelets are a performance optimization for C++ nodes, and they avoid the serialization and copying by running multiple nodes in the same process. If you're writing image processing nodes in Python, these costs are probably less than the other costs incurred by running the python interpreter.
Since you're asking about nodelets, you're either trying to use them because they're there (in which case, don't worry about it) or you're trying to make your code faster.
If you're trying to make your code faster (and as always with performance optimization), the best course of action is to measure the performance of your system through profiling. This will give you a much better idea of which parts of your code are slow, and how much performance you may gain by optimizing each part of your program.
