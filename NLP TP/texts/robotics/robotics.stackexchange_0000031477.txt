Q:

Package dependencies cannot be resolved

Package dependencies cannot be resolved:
When I try to install full ros desktop package in Ubuntu 11.04, I get the error above. When I tried to use terminal window installation, it states that a lot of dependencies are missing such as tutorials and slam g-mapping and gives broken package error in the end.

A:

Support for 11.04 is still under development. Posting the full output of the error message might help get this resolved -- providing a patch to the developers will certainly resolve it even faster.
