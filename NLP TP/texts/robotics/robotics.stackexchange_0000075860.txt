Q:

catkin_generate_changelog issue with a repo that consolidated multiple repos

On a repository that consolidated packages from multiple repos, I can't seem to update the existing CHANGELOG.rst. What's the issue and is there a way to proceed?
$ cd moveit
$ catkin_generate_changelog
Found packages: moveit, moveit_commander, moveit_controller_manager_example, moveit_core, moveit_fake_controller_manager, moveit_ikfast, moveit_planners, moveit_planners_ompl, moveit_plugins, moveit_ros, moveit_ros_benchmarks, moveit_ros_benchmarks_gui, moveit_ros_control_interface, moveit_ros_manipulation, moveit_ros_move_group, moveit_ros_perception, moveit_ros_planning, moveit_ros_planning_interface, moveit_ros_robot_interaction, moveit_ros_visualization, moveit_ros_warehouse, moveit_setup_assistant, moveit_simple_controller_manager
Querying commit information since latest tag...
ERROR: Could not fetch latest tag:
fatal: No names found, cannot describe anything.

With --all option, I can create a new CHANGELOG.rst file for a package that misses it (moveit, metapkg).
$ catkin_generate_changelog --all
Found packages: moveit, moveit_commander, moveit_controller_manager_example, moveit_core, moveit_fake_controller_manager, moveit_ikfast, moveit_planners, moveit_planners_ompl, moveit_plugins, moveit_ros, moveit_ros_benchmarks, moveit_ros_benchmarks_gui, moveit_ros_control_interface, moveit_ros_manipulation, moveit_ros_move_group, moveit_ros_perception, moveit_ros_planning, moveit_ros_planning_interface, moveit_ros_robot_interaction, moveit_ros_visualization, moveit_ros_warehouse, moveit_setup_assistant, moveit_simple_controller_manager
The following packages already have a changelog file and will be ignored: moveit_commander, moveit_controller_manager_example, moveit_core, moveit_fake_controller_manager, moveit_ikfast, moveit_planners, moveit_planners_ompl, moveit_plugins, moveit_ros, moveit_ros_benchmarks, moveit_ros_benchmarks_gui, moveit_ros_control_interface, moveit_ros_manipulation, moveit_ros_move_group, moveit_ros_perception, moveit_ros_planning, moveit_ros_planning_interface, moveit_ros_robot_interaction, moveit_ros_visualization, moveit_ros_warehouse, moveit_setup_assistant, moveit_simple_controller_manager
Querying all tags and commit information...
Generating changelog files with all versions...
- creating 'moveit/CHANGELOG.rst'
Done.
Please review the extracted commit messages and consolidate the changelog entries before committing the files!

There's no git tag yet in the repo.

Thank you.

UPDATE) I just selected the answer.
Also tried but not working for my particular case where the new repo is simply an aggregation of multiple packages and maintains the folder structure of original repos, I went down into each "original" folder and ran catkin_generate_changelog. But because the original .git files are removed in order for the new repo to work as a single git repo, the command fails.

A:

I don't think this tool will work anymore because the tags from the old repositories were not (and probably could not) be migrated. You'll probably have to create the missing changelog files and manually craft the changelog entries for the first version that has a tag in the merged repository. After that it might "just work" again.
