Q:

Subcriber callback within a while loop?

Is it possible for a subscriber to make a callback within a while loop?...
if so how then..
In my case i am Subscribing to topic which giving me a position of a robot.
I have a array of 8 positions.
double position[8] = {2.0 , 3, 3.0, ...}

And in a while  in a loop, I make to robot walk to those position, one after one.
i
nt  i = 0
while(i<8)
{
    robotposition = position[i];
   if(real_position == robotposition){
    i++;
   }
}

Here is the real_position, the real position of the robot, which I receive from a callback function..
The problem here is though that this value doesn't get updated when it is in the while loop.. and i don't why.. how do i do that?

A:

Call ros::spinOnce() in the loop. That will cause callbacks to be called.
