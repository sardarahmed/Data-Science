Q:

Best way to get the relevant log file from ~/.ros/log

Log files in ~/.ros/log are quite useful especially when diagnosing someone's issue remotely. What's not so easy is to figure out which .log file or directory is the one that the user is dealing with since there can be quite a few number of files/directories.
An easy workaround is to ask the user to run the problematic run and make a tarball immediately out of the most recent file/directory, found at the top of the result of ls -l. This is not, however, something that the users always are happy to do.
Is there a ROS way to get it done nicely?

A:

The roslaunch-logs command will show the current log directory that is in use.
It's documented in more detail on the wiki
