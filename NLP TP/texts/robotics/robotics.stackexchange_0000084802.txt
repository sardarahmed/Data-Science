Q:

rtabmap_ros tutorial not working : executable not found

Hey :-)
System: Ubuntu 16.04
ROS: Lunar (tried Kinetic before) Desktop Full
rtabmap version : 0.13.2
My approach ist to use the rtabmap feature in cooperation with Tango ROS Streamer which is already running fine.
I followed the instructions on this tutorial :
http://wiki.ros.org/rtabmap_ros/Tutorials/Tango%20ROS%20Streamer
At step 6 it fails at this command
rosrun rtabmap_ros pointcloud_to_depthimage cloud:=/tango/point_cloud camera_info:=/tango/camera/color_1/camera_info _fixed_frame_id:=start_of_service _decimation:=8 _fill_holes_size:=5

with the error:
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named pointcloud_to_depthimage below /opt/ros/lunar/share/rtabmap_ros

I already installed rtabmap via:
sudo apt install ros-lunar-rtabmap-ros

What could go wrong ? -_-
best regards and many thanks in advance for any help
Mark

Did you get any errors when you installed rtabmap? Have your sourced the setup.bash file for ros?
Comment by Markovicho on 2018-01-19:
No errors on the installation...
setup.bash is attached to my ~/.bashrc as well running "rosdep init && rosdep update"

A:

I have already seen the same error, but forgot to write an error report.
pointcloud_to_depthimage seems not to be included in the deb package or is not installed.
I've compiled rtabmap from source.
