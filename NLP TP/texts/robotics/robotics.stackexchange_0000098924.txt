Q:

Difficulty with the openai_ros turtlebot2 tutorial when using noetic

I am new to ROS and i have been working through the TurtleBot2 with openai_ros tutorial (http://wiki.ros.org/openai_ros/TurtleBot2%20with%20openai_ros).
When i get up to training the script (step 2) and run :$ roslaunch my_turtlebot2_training start_training.launch. I get the errors:
"No link elements found in urdf file"

 "Failed to load nodelet [/cmd_vel_mux] of type [yocs_cmd_vel_mux/CmdVelMuxNodelet] even after refreshing the cache: According to the loaded plugin descriptions the class yocs_cmd_vel_mux/CmdVelMuxNodelet with base class type nodelet::Nodelet does not exist."

After getting this error i then tried to install the yocs_cmd_vel_mux package however, this package does not appear to be available for Noetic. Do i need to use another version of ROS that does have the yocs_cmd_vel_mux package (melodic and kinetic) or is there another solution?
I am using Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS 64-bit and Noetic.
I hope i have provided enough information.
Some help would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you!

Hi, I have the same problem for the same tutorial. I'm also using noetic on ubuntu 20.04. I tried to install the repo from git https://github.com/yujinrobot/yujin_ocs . But (probably because this repository have no compatible branch with noetic), I wasn't able to catkin_make it. I had to install git@github.com:ros-perception/ar_track_alvar.git , to get the required package, and then catkin_make give me a lot of errors (I can't even copy the stack track because I have so much errors than it don't fit in my terminal).
Is there is a way to execute the launch file given in this tutorial using ros noetic ?

A:

yocs_cmd_vel_mux is not installed. It is not release for noetic, you can put this repo. https://github.com/yujinrobot/yujin_ocs in your /src and catkin_make it.
