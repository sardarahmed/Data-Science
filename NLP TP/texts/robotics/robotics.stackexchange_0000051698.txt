Q:

microstrain_3dmgx2_imu rosmake fail

I am following tutorial from microstrain_3dmgx2_imu/Tutorials/UsingTheIMUNode
Trying to get my 3DM-GX3-25 to work
When i rosdep install microstrain_3dmgx2_imu everything is fine
when I do rosmake microstrain_3dmgx2_imu I get
[rosmake-4] Starting >>> microstrain_3dmgx2_imu [ make ]
[ rosmake ] All 2 lines
{-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mkdir: cannot create directory `build': Permission denied
[ rosmake ] Output from build of package microstrain_3dmgx2_imu written to:
[ rosmake ]    /home/J/.ros/rosmake/rosmake_output-20130605-132831/microstrain_3dmgx2_imu/build_output.log
[rosmake-4] Finished <<< microstrain_3dmgx2_imu [FAIL] [ 0.06 seconds ]
[ rosmake ] Halting due to failure in package microstrain_3dmgx2_imu.
[ rosmake ] Waiting for other threads to complete.
[ rosmake ] Results:
[ rosmake ] Built 38 packages with 1 failures.
When i tried to continue to the next step after plugging in the imu and typing  ls -l /dev/ttyUSB0
I get   ls: cannot access /dev/ttyUSB0: No such file or directory
Is my problem due to rosmake failing or is it the usb port problem or is it both?
I tried rosmake with root and it has no error but the directory is still not found o.O
I refered to the troubleshooting page for microstrain_3dmgx2_imu but my problem is not listed :(
