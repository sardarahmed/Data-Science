Q:

Is there a visualizer/tool for developing path planners?

Hi,
I'm working on a path planner that incorporates dynamic obstacle avoidance. I was wondering if there is a visualizer or any tool available for developing path planners?
Some of the requirements would be:

To visualize a 2D (or even 3D) space
Include static and dynamic obstacles programmatically
Visualize robot position and goal
Visualize the progress of the path planner as it searches the space (whichever path planner is used, eg: A*, RRT etc.)

Something similar to this: http://qiao.github.io/PathFinding.js/visual
Thank you.

A:

You can definitely visualize all of the above using Rviz, using nav_msgs/Path and nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid outputs from your algorithm.
If you algorithm fits into the move_base state machine approach, it may be best to develop your planner as a plugin (probably for the local planner). If not, you'll probably still find reusing layered costmaps as a very helpful for sensor processing and world state.
