Q:

How to set a right revolute joint coordinate?

Okay guys, im trying to use gazebo to simulate my simple arm but i'm stuck at second joint.
Idk why, but it rotates based on some other axis(or some other coordination).
the arm is at the right place when i don't move them,  so changing  coordinate would changes arm's position.
i want to keep my arm that position and want to rotate based on the shaft( black horn with green part).
anyone had a same problem and solved it?
what i am thinking about is that i change joint coordinate and changes link's visual coordinate.
but i am not sure this is the right way to solve this problem.
Help me guy thx!

A:

You can right-click your model and select View -> Transparent then View -> Joints to see where the joint axis currently is. Then I would suggest you change your link and joint <origin>s on URDF until the axis shows up in the correct place (on top of the green part).
Visualizing link frames with View -> Link Frames should also help you.
