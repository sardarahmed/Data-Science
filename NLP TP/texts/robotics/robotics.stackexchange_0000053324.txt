A:

Well, if you have managed to cross-compile ROS for the NAO, the next part is going to be easy :) Download nao_robot from here and install it in your robot, you will also need this package. For more detailed instructions check the ROS wiki out.
Once that's installed you can control the head by publishing nao_msgs/JointAnglesWithSpeed messages to the joint_angles topic. But there are many, many more things you can do; I'd recommend you read the documentation carefully.
Here's a quick example that you can run from the terminal (of course you can also use proper ROS messages)
$> rosrun nao_driver nao_controller.py
$> rostopic pub /joint_angles nao_msgs/JointAnglesWithSpeed -- '[ 1, now, Head]' '[HeadYaw,HeadPitch]' '[1,-1]'  1.0  0

The second command was taken from this question.
Ask if you need more help!
