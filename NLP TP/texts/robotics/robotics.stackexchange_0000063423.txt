Q:

setting sensor port permissions

I'm working with different sensors that all require I run things like:
$ sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyACM0
$ sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSB0
to set the port permissions before ROS can see the sensor data. I would like to set these permanently (or somehow in a config or launch file) so I don't need to manually process this step with each attempt to run my app.
Please advise.

A:

Add yourself to the dialout group using sudo adduser MyUser dialout and log out.

Thanks Tony!!

The answer works because those devices you listed are owned by the dialout group. The more general way to do this is with udev rules. See this page: http://www.reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html#ownership
