Q:

gzclient crash with heightmap

Hi
I obtain an ogre exception each time I try to use an heightmap
e.g., using
gzserver -u worlds/heightmap.world

the gzclient crash with the following output
Qt has caught an exception thrown from an event handler. Throwing exceptions from an event handler is not supported in Qt. You must reimplement QApplication::notify() and catch all exceptions there.

terminate called after throwing an instance of 'Ogre::Exception'
what():  OGRE EXCEPTION(2:InvalidParametersException): Named constants have not been initialised, perhaps a compile error. in GpuProgramParameters::_findNamedConstantDefinition at /build/buildd/ogre-1.7.4/OgreMain/src/OgreGpuProgramParams.cpp (line 1425)
Aborted

I'm running Gazebo 1.4 by repository binary packages on a xubuntu 12.04 in virtual machine.
In particular I've tried both vmware and virtualBox, both with the same results.
I've found online other thread about similar problems, but I can't face a solution for my one.
Any suggestion? Avoid the usage of virtual machines? Compile and install from source code?

@SImone, I am not sure but probably your problem could be related to: http://answers.gazebosim.org/question/25/run-gazebo-in-virtualbox/
