Q:

robot_arm not moving in Moveit but is moving in Gazebo

HI! everyone!
I have a robot model,and i want to get the joint_trajectory form moveit!,I use the Gazebo to publish the arm controller.
Everything looks good,but When i set the goal and use plan and excute.Robot_arm not moving in Moveit but is working in Gazebo.
I think it is the problem about the topic /joint state did not receive anything.But I have another topic named robot/joint state published by  arm controller or gazebo.
I already saw the same problem
but i still did not know how to solve this problem.
There have another problem after moveit compute the trajectory.
Moveit always showed the warning :
Controller /utlr_arm_controller failed with error code GOAL_TOLERANCE_VIOLATED
Controller handle utl/r_arm_controller reports status ABORTED
In some articles tell me add the <param name="allowed_goal_duration_margin" value="5.0"/>,but it did not work!
Please help me to solve these two problems! and thanks for any help! I can provide any file you need to check!
attach is the picture about the problem:picture

A:

You need to remapic the topic /joint_states to /robot/joint_states in move_group.launch, inside the move_group node. I had this same problem as well and this worked just fine for me. You will need to change back to /joint_states though when running MoveIt! without the Gazebo simulation.
As for the other error, I just ignore it since the end position is nearly identical to the MoveIt! trajectory goal. Forgot where in the MoveIt! Google groups this was mentioned, but I looked into it as well.
