Q:

Error with roslaunch in remote machine

I am try to launch my setup remotely. This is my launch file:
<launch>

  <machine name="auriga" address="192.168.1.103" user="auriga" />
  <machine name="local"  address="localhost" />
 
  <param name="robot_description"     textfile="$(find auriga_model)/auriga_robot_box.urdf" />

  <node  name="laser_hokuyo"          pkg="hokuyo_node" type="hokuyo_node" machine="auriga" respawn="false" output="screen">
    <param name="calibrate_time"      type="bool"       value="false" />            <!-- Starts up faster, but timestamps will be inaccurate. -->
    <param name="port"                type="string"     value="/dev/ttyACM0" />     <!-- Set the port to connect to here -->
    <param name="intensity"           type="bool"       value="false" />
    <param name="min_ang"             type="double"     value="-2.08621" />
    <param name="max_ang"             type="double"     value="+2.08621" />
  </node>

    <node  name="laser_broadcaster"     pkg="tf"                    type="static_transform_publisher" machine="auriga" args="0 0 0.73 0 0 0 base_link laser 50" />
    <node  name="robot_state_publisher" pkg="robot_state_publisher" type="state_publisher"            machine="auriga" />
    <node  name="visualization"         pkg="rviz"                  type="rviz"                       machine="local"/>

</launch>

And I get the following output:
... logging to /home/jose/.ros/log/0db3bbbc-651b-11e0-ad9f-00032d122e94/roslaunch-RoboIcaro-2938.log

May it be a bug?

A:

It's a bug that it's not caught, but it also means your network is not configured properly.  It's important that you have a proper network setup if you intend to use ROS with remote machines.
In this case, RoboIcaro is not a valid hostname, which is why roslaunch is raising an exception.
Please read: http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/NetworkSetup
for a guide on how to test your network config.

Thank you, after configure the network everything works fine.
