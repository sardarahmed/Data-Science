Q:

Subscriber topic field

Hi, to optimize cpu cost, I would like subscribe to a field of topic. Although it is not the exact case, the problem is subscribe to topic type sensor_msgs Temperature containing a header field. It is posible? I'm try with rostopic echo and run but with rostopic info thows a non-existent topic.
Thanks in advance.

A:

No, you cannot subscribe to a single field in a message.

Although it is not the exact case, the problem is subscribe to topic type sensor_msgs Temperature containing a header field.

I don't really understand what you are trying to say. Perhaps if you describe it more clearly, we can help come up with some alternatives.

Well, in any case: you cannot subscribe to a single field. If this is a custom msg, you could always consider splitting it up into multiple messages (and synchronise later if required, using the timestamp).
