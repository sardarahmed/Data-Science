Q:

What is the equivalent documentation for datatype transforms for tf2?

For tf, there is https://docs.ros.org/api/tf/html/c++/transform__datatypes_8h.html which provides a bunch of convenience functions for converting between messages and tf classes.
What is the equivalent of this for tf2?

A:

There's a new package tf2 conversions interface with a tutorial on doing conversions
As well as tutorials on how to implement conversions for your own datatypes: c++ and python

I think the first link "tf2_conversions" is linking to this question

sorry I forgot to paste the link. It had no url. Updated.

@tfoote: the link you added links to tf_conversions. Was that intentional?
Comment by tfoote on 2019-11-22:
Nope that was me trying to fix it too quickly. The updated API is built into tf2, API docs now linked above.
