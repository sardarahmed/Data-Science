Q:

groovy fails install on OSX

I am trying to install Groovy on OSX using homebrew. I follow the instructions on the installation page. When I get to the cmake step, I get the following error:
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/ros/groovy -DSETUPTOOLS_DEV_LAYOUT=OFF
-- Using CATKIN_DEVEL_PREFIX: /Users/jkp/groovy_underlay/build/devel
-- Found gtest: gtests will be built
-- catkin 0.5.58
Traceback (most recent call last):

    from catkin.environment_cache import generate_environment_script, generate_static_environment_script
ImportError: No module named environment_cache

  returned error code 1
Call Stack (most recent call first):

  CMakeLists.txt:15 (include)

-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

Is there something I have missed?

It looks like the Python modules from catkin are not found. Can you please post line 11 (the one before the failing import) of the mentioned generate_cached_env.py file?

You can also try updating your version of catkin_pkg with sudo pip install -U catkin_pkg

Also I am going to be updating the instructions soon to reflect the new method of building ROS from source show here: http://www.ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/Source

Thanks for your comments. The update of catkin did not help.

A:

This can happen if you have the fuerte environment variables set. Just comment out the line in your .bashrc which sources the setup.bash (or whatever you have depending on your shell) and try the cmake step again (after opening a new terminal).

What is a fuerte environment variable?
Comment by kartikmohta on 2013-01-01:
I meant to say the ROS environment variables from a fuerte install, things like ROS_ROOT etc.
Comment by WilliamWoodall on 2013-01-04:
kartikmohta is correct. Make sure you don't have a fuerte environment sourced or that you don't have catkin installed to /usr/local or somewhere else on your python path. you can test this by opening python and ensuring that import catkin fails.
