Q:

roslaunch ros2 equivalent to 'rosparam command="load"'

What is the ros2 equivalent to '<rosparam cmd="load" ../>'?
Looks like there are three possible cases:

loading parameters in the root of the parameter server
loading parameters privately into a node
loading parameters in a "group namespace"

For example, how would you translate the following ROS1 roslaunch file that contains these three cases?
<launch>
   <rosparam command="load" file="$(find mypackage)/config/config.yaml" />

   <node pkg="mypackage" name="mynode" type="mynode">
        <rosparam command="load" file="$(find mypackage)/config/node_config.yaml" />
   </node>

  <group ns="myns"/>
        <rosparam command="load" file="$(find mypackage)/config/node_config.yaml" />
  </group>
</launch>

A:

Try:
<param from="$(find-pkg-share mypackage)/path/to/params.yaml" />

See the migration guide for launch

It is weird. You are right about the migration guide. But I am still getting a python launch error. This is my example:
<launch>
<node pkg="mypkg" exec="mynode" name="mypkg">
    <param from="$(find mypkg)/config/mynode_config.yaml"/>
</node>    
</launch>

It is interesting, if I use the rosparam xml tag (instead of param) it does not fail (no matter if I use the attribute "from" or "file"), but parameter values do not seem to load.
I also double checked that there the configuration file is in install/share/mypkg/config/mynode_config.yaml.
So by the moment I don't know what it is happening.

I think in many scenarios "unknown" tags like  are silently ignored; hence parameter values not loading.
Can you share the Python error that you see? Note, the find substitution has been replaced by find-pkg-share, I guess that is responsible for the error.
