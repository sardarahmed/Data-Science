Well ... in guide : http://www.ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Installation/Overlays
I try to do this command:
roslocate info turtlebot | rosws merge -

File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/rosinstall/rosws_cli.py", line 551, in rosws_main

I receive : - hg:
local-name: turtlebot
meta:
repo-name: turtlebot-ros-pkg
uri: https://kforge.ros.org/turtlebot/turtlebot
version: default
What is the result in this case? And I have to put the result in "fuerte_workspace"?

That's a bug, thanks for reporting it. I filed it here:
https://kforge.ros.org/vcstools/trac/ticket/65
will investigate
In the meantime, you can just call:
roslocate info turtlebot

and add the result to the .rosinstall file in your workspace
