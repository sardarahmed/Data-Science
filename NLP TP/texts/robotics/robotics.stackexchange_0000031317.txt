Q:

Subscribing to the odometry topic

Hi,
I am very new to ROS and I'm using stageros as a simulator for my robot. I'm trying to write a c++ application that subscribes to the odometry topic (of type nav_msgs) and just write the contents to terminal.  I have tried everything but I can't get it to work.
Any help would be appreciated.
Best regards.

A:

I would recommend reading the Writing a Simple Publisher and Subscriber (C++) tutorial. If that still doesn't help, asking more specific questions about the problems you're having will make it easier for people to offer advice.
