Q:

Viewing laser scan data coming from Raspberry pi using Laptop

I have a Raspberry Pi 4 running Ubuntu 22.04 with ros2 humble. My laptop is running Ubuntu 20.04 with ros1 noetic. I have connected a Slamtec RPLIDAR A3 with my Raspberry Pi and want to view its laser scan in RViz. I have added their ros2 package for my Raspberry Pi board. the launch file in the package opens the rviz2 in the Raspberry Pi, but there is no display connected to my Raspberry Pi.
Can I view the laser scan readings from my raspberry pi using my laptops Rviz?
Thank you for your time.

I was able to set it up after setting x11 server and x11 forwarding. Thank you for all of your support as well.
