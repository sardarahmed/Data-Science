Q:

flat surfaces become "waved" using stereo_image_proc

Hi,
using stereo_image_proc I observe that flat surfaces appear waved in the
resulting point cloud - with growing "wavelength" for farer points. Is this
because of the quadratic interpolation done by stereo_image_proc for subpixel
accurancy? Is there any option to reduce this effect (which is really bad for
drivability analysis)?
Curious about your answers,
Sabrina
P. S. I also posted these questions on the ros-users mailing list.

A:

After some more tests I found out that this seems to be an issue related to texture rendering in our 3D simulator (not gazebo) that I am using.  With our real stereo cam this effect is hardly visible. Thus it is not a stereo_image_proc specific problem.
