Q:

Rosserial with ChipKit Max 32

I'm trying to setup rosserial communication together with my ChipKit Max32 microcontroller.
When I try to compile I get this error:

Sketch_nov11a.cpp:7:17: fatal error: ros.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.

I've tried to use the same code for my Arduino Mega 1280 board and it works fine. I have looked at the tutorial for rossial_client but wasn't able to make a code for the ChipKit board.
I am a new programmer but I think the problem is that the ChipKit board have PIC32 architecture instead of the traditional avr.
My system details :

Ubuntu 10.04
As MPIDE: Arduino 022-chipkit-linux32-20110619

Downloaded from https://github.com/chipKIT32/chipKIT32-MAX/downloads

So, my question is how to setup the rosserial_package for my ChipKit Max 32 board?
Any suggestions will be appreciated.

A:

Please see the tutorial on adding new platforms. You have to create a hardware definition and then create ros.h as described so that you can use your hardware definition.
