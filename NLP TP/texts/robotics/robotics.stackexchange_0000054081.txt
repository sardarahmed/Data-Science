Q:

how to bootstrap ROS?

Hi guys.
I have an error.
The next message appears when i type source ~/ros/setup.bash  in the command line:
"rospack could not be found, you cannot have rosbash features until you bootstrap ros"
How can i fix this? By the way, i'm using slackware 14.0
Greetings

What version of ROS are you installing? What instructions are you following.  The recommended install from source is here: http://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Installation/Source

Hi. Thanks for answering, i'm tryiing to install groovy. I followed the instructions of this page: http://ftp.isr.ist.utl.pt/pub/roswiki/diamondback(2f)Installation(2f)Slackware.html
But no luck when i type "source ~/ros/setup.bash" in the command line.

Forgot to mention that i selected the ful desktop install with this command:
rosinstall -n ~/ros "http://packages.ros.org/cgi-bin/gen_rosinstall.py?rosdistro=groovy&variant=desktop&overlay=no"
before typing "source ~/ros/setup.bash"

A:

You're following a diamondback tutorial but trying to install Groovy.  I suggest you follow the Ubuntu Source installation page: http://wiki.ros.org/groovy/Installation/Source You will need to substitute all the system dependency commands for slackware.
If you'd like to contribute your efforts to adapt the Ubuntu Source installation into a new version of the Slackware instructions I'm sure that would be appreciated.
You might be able to get diamondback to run from the old URL but diamondback is very old and has not been supported for close to a year, not all sources may still be available.
