Q:

how to use packages with are organized in stacks with catkin?

how can I use packages with are organized in "old-style" stacks within packages with are build with catkin? e.g. gps_common which is within the stack gps_umd. rospack does find it, but not find_package(gps_common REQUIRED).

A:

As far as I know, you can't. Catkin packages ("wet", new-style) can only depend on catkin packages (or regular CMake) while stacks ("dry", old-style) can depend on other stacks (using rosbuild & manifest.xml) and catkin packages (using CMake). Thus the need to slowly convert packages from the bottom of the dependency chain upwards to "wet" packages, like a rising water level.
