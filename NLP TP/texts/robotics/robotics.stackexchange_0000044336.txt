Q:

Virtual service callbacks

Hello Community,
This might seem a strange question. Is it possible to declare a service callback as virtual? Or more importantly can I override the service callback with another function if required?
Thanks

A:

You can use Boost.Bind to binds methods and use them as callbacks.
Callbacks can be changed at runtime (the API usually allows it but in the worst case you can destroy and recreate a publisher/subscriber) so it is not necessary to use complex dispatch methods. Of course, if it benefits code readability, using virtual methods is good too :)
