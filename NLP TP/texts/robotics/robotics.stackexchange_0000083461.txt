Q:

razor_imu_9dof can not install with SparkFun 9DoF Razor IMU M0

I just buy SparkFun 9DoF Razor IMU M0, https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14001  ,
want to install http://wiki.ros.org/razor_imu_9dof，but failed
problem is :in razor_imu_9dof tutorial，it's using old IMU ,  SparkFun 9DoF Razor IMU (SEN-10736) - Initial release, featuring an ATmega328, ADXL345 (accelerometer), ITG-3200 (gyroscope), and HMC5883L (magnetometer).
I buy the new one :SparkFun 9DoF Razor IMU M0 (SEN-14001)
what should I do in http://wiki.ros.org/razor_imu_9dof#Load_Firmware_into_Razor_Board   ?
Firmware can not upload to IMU M0 .
Razor_AHRS.ino:
// HARDWARE OPTIONS
/*****************************************************************/

A:

Hi There, I'm currently working through the same problem, trying to get the razor_imu_9dof ROS node to work with the new 14001 based sparkfun boards. I'm (hopefully) almost there, I've found the git repo below that does work with the new board. It outputs the linear and angular accelerations fine although as far as I can tell the orientation estimate is wrong, I'm getting incorrect values or NANs.

Depending on your application this may solve your problem straight away, if you only need the acceleration values.
