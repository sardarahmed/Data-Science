Q:

Navigation goal offset

I am using the default navigation with TrajectoryPlannerROS and the global_planner. I realized that the robot never really reaches its exact goal. So I assume there is a certain threshhold, like an offset in which the robot needs to be from the actual goal.
My question is: How can I set this offset? (If there is one)
The problem I have is, that the robot often rotates a lot next to the goal, which I think is due to this offset being to small.
Thanks for your help! :)

That is actually quite embarrassing. I really am aware of the parameters of the local planner. I just was not able to find those particular ones before. Sorry for that.
