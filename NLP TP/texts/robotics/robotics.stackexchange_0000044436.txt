Q:

ROS, Openni and Kinect not working on a new Ubuntu System

Hello,
after updating my laptop to a new one, i am not able to get ROS, Openni and a Kinect back to work.
On the new Laptop(Acer Aspire V-571) and Ubuntu 12.04 64Bit i installed ROS Fuerte(+openni-camera, openni-lauch).
After starting the
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch

i tried rviz and image_view like on the openni_launch website and my own written node, but i get no picture.
it seems like the kinect is publishing no pictures over the nodes, an rostopic echo on the picture topics shows nothing.
The turtlesim nodes from the Tutorials are working and publishing messages over the topics.
lsusb shows the 3 (Motor, Audio, Camera) Devices correct.
Things i have already tried(found as possible help on other answers here):
using all USB Slots (USB2 and USB3), even an external USB Hub
killall XnSensorServer
rmmod gspca_kinect
a new (old) Ubuntu Installation with 11.10 and ROS Electric

I am not sure what i can test next or where the failure comes from, the Kinect Sensor is working with freenect-glview and on the laptop of a colleague with the same installation steps that doesnt work on my laptop.
the output of roswtf in openni_launch shows:
sem@semlaptop:/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/openni_launch/launch$ roswtf openni.launch 
Loaded plugin tf.tfwtf

but i am not sure how to interprete this or which output/logfile could be more usefull.
Thanks in advance.

i tried it in every combination (Ubuntu 11.10/12.04 - ROS Electric/Fuerte) with the USB2.0/USB3.0 Port and an external USB HUB.

A:

Be sure to connect the Kinect to a USB2.0 port not a USB3.0 (I think there is still some issue between Ubuntu and USB3.0).
If your USB is 3.0 take a look at this question
Good luck!

This helped me a lot! I didn't even consider that as a possible problem before reading your answer.
