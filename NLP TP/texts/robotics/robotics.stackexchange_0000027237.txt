Q:

What are the various joint types available in gazebo?

Revolute, prismatic, continuous and what else?
Could somebody point me to the right resource to look at to get such information.
Thanks.

A:

You can find the joint types supported by SDF in the SDF documentation:

The type of joint, which must be one
of the following: (revolute) a hinge
joint that rotates on a single axis
with either a fixed or continuous
range of motion, (gearbox) geared
revolute joints, (revolute2) same as
two revolute joints connected in
series, (prismatic) a sliding joint
that slides along an axis with a
limited range specified by upper and
lower limits, (ball) a ball and socket
joint, (universal), like a ball joint,
but constrains one degree of freedom,
(piston) similar to a Slider joint
except that rotation around the
translation axis is possible.

Thanx. This is the link I need. All new documentation refers the reader to sdformat.org.

Actually piston is not a valid joint type. Here's a list of ODE joint types.

I had the same problem than pmaini, the list of valid joint types cannot be found on sdformat.org, which is a pity

http://sdformat.org/spec?ver=1.5&elem=joint has been updated, thanks for pointing that out.

Just for the sake of consistency: There is now also a fixed joint: "(fixed) a joint with zero degrees of freedom that rigidly connects two links".

Hi there, thank you so much for the valuable question. I was wondering how to add a ball and socket joint in gazebo, I mean what would be the xacro syntax for that, I would really appreciate if you would kindly point out any example.

I could not find a ball joint example or simulate it properly.
