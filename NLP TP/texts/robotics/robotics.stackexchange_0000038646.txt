Q:

Robot_Pose_EKF filter TF fails

When running the Robot_Pose_EKF filter the transforms start to fail (the model in rviz flashes )
Originally  this was a long post that I solve before posting while the solution is self evident in hindsight it has taken a while to find.
I had to disable the TF transform that was published by my base controller  for it to work
