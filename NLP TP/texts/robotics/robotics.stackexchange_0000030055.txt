Q:

Unable to get data from sick laser on Pioneer

I am using sicktoolbox_wrapper to get laser scans from sicklms200 in diamondback. I am following the procedure described here (http://www.ros.org/wiki/sicktoolbox_wrapper/Tutorials/UsingTheSicklms)
I get the following message and nothing happens after that.
    *** Attempting to initialize the Sick LMS...
    Attempting to open device @ /dev/ttyUSB0

The program waits here indefinitely.
No data is being sent on the topic "/scan" as well. (Ran 'rostopic echo /scan'. )
Any help?
Update
I have tried using the null modem cable too. The program still waits indefinitely. BTW, I am using Ubuntu 10.10 and Diamondback RC3

I am using p3dx but the laser turns on only when the sicklms node is launched.

Are you using this on a Pioneer (or some other robot that only turns on the laser when a driver attempts to access the laser)?

A:

This was merged officially into the ROS forks of sicktoolbox and sicktoolbox_wrapper about 2 years ago.
If you're running Groovy or Hydro from debs, please set the connect_delay parameter to something like 30 seconds for the Pioneer.
https://github.com/ros-drivers/sicktoolbox_wrapper/blob/hydro-devel/ros/sicklms/sicklms.cpp#L207
You DO NOT need to modify the source code, it's already included in the ROS fork of sicktoolbox.
