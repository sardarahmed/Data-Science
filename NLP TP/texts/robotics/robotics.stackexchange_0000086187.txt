Q:

ROSCORE server on android

Hi,
is it possible to run a ROSCORE or a minified version of it on an Android phone?
What i want to do is i have a ROS Node A and Android cellphone B without a ROS MASTER (Ubuntu). A and B will be either linked via wifi or bluetooth and i want to gather information from Node A to Android B.
Is it possible to do this?

A:

Yes. I can't find it in the docs on the ROS Wiki at the moment, but from Running a roscore in an android smartphone:

Clicking either New Publish Master or New Private Master will create a ROS master on the Android device.
The private instance will not be accessible by other hosts, the public one will be.

Edit: note that you're not actually running roscore (ie: the actual program itself) on the phone this way, but a Java re-implementation that offers similar services over xml-rpc.
