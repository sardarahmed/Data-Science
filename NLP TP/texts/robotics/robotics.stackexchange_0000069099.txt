Q:

ira_laser_tools not working

Hi guys,
I am trying to use the ira_laser_tools.
I did the following:
cd catkin ws/src
git clone https://github.com/iralabdisco/ira laser tools

Then compile the package (make sure you have PCL [4] installed):
cd ..
catkin make

and its compiling but when I am trying to run the launch file it says:

ERROR: cannot launch node of type [ira_laser_tools/laserscan_multi_merger]: can't locate node [laserscan_multi_merger] in package  [ira_laser_tools]

I really want to use this package but I have no freaking idea what the problem is.

A:

You did source the setup.bash of the devel space of the workspace?

I've also had this issue but nothing is fixed when I do: ~/catkin_ws/devel$ source setup.bash. Any ideas?
