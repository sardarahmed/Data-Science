Q:

Installing both Fuerte and Electric

Hi everybody,
I'm getting crazy with ROS/Ubuntu versions, on my laptop I installed Ubuntu 11.10 because I had to work on a university project written for ROS Electric, now (for another exam) I should install a stack called dvo_slam that is hard to install on Electric (I guess it's designed with Fuerte in mind). So my first thought has been to install Ubuntu 12.04 as a virtual machine on top of 11.10 and run Fuerte in it (horrible! ain't it?), then I found this link:
http://ros.org/reps/rep-0003.html#fuerte-turtle-mar-2012
there it's stated that Fuerte can run also on 11.10 so my question is: can I install also Fuerte on my OS? Is it a mess??

Yes, you can. Why should it be a mess?
