Q:

how to call a service inside a node?

I am working with summitXL. After reaching the target point I would like to set the odometry by calling the ros service "/summit_a/set_odometry". How can I call the service inside the node. Thanks in advance.

thanks for the ans. but all I need is to call a predefined service inside my node.

Which is exactly what the service client tutorial teaches you.

but I have to call the service in the callback function where it has no nodehandle object.

You should store the NodeHandle somewhere that can be accessed inside the callback so you can use it.

Instead of writing all these, a simple answer would be convenient for everyone. Besides, even in that tutorial, it's not clear. There is add_two_ints variable, said to be handle, but should it have the same name when it's a function or a variable, it's vague.
