I had the same problem. I was publishing the image and the camera_info correctly, but the image would still not show up. Solution: republishing my static tfs at 10 Hz, using tf instead of using tf2_ros. This solved the issue. I think that similar problems are common with rviz in ROS Indigo.

A:

Two days ago, i meet this problem too. And below is how i solved it :
1, using rosconsole to open rviz node debugging mode.
rosconsole set /rviz_1492690688381763966 ros.rviz.message_filter debug

rviz_1492690688381763966 was your rviz node's name
and it shown the messages came from your camera with the frame name was head_camera(i used [usb_cam](http://wiki.ros.org/usb_cam) driver)
2, modify map to head_camera in Fixed Frame field of rviz.

instead of changing the global frame, you could also provide tf data between the global frame and the camera frame (described here)
