Q:

ROS Beginner Tutorials: Examining the Simple Service and Client (python) - need some help

Hey guys,
I'm following the ROS Tutorials and, using the Python language, I'm currently having some issues trying to solve the item Examining the Simple Service and Client item ([link text](http: // www.ros .org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/ExaminingServiceClient)).
When I try to run the server (the first step in the tutorial), I get the following message:
viki@ROS:~/catkin_ws/src$ rosrun beginner_tutorials add_two_ints_server.py
Unable to register with master node [http :// localhost:11311]: master may not be running yet. Will keep trying.

And then my Terminal window gets blocked. Before that, when I compiled the code (from the previous tutorial: http :// www.ros .org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/WritingServiceClient%28python%29) everything seems to work fine:
viki@ROS:~/catkin_ws$ catkin_make
Base path: /home/viki/catkin_ws
Source space: /home/viki/catkin_ws/src

viki@ROS:~/catkin_ws$

When I try roswtf I get no error:
viki@ROS:~/catkin_ws$ roswtf
No package or stack in context
================================================================================ Static checks summary:

No errors or warnings
================================================================================

ROS Master does not appear to be
running. Online graph checks will not
be run. ROS_MASTER_URI is
[http :// localhost:11311]

I haven't found any clues on the web related to this and I can't figure it out what's really happening.
Can anyone help me? Thanks in advance,
Batta

A:

This is normally the problem when you have not done Environment setup
There are few steps you need to perform before doing any thing else. I think you missed one step out of that which we need to perform after proper installation of ROS that is Environment setup 
Please visit following link and make sure you have perform steps from 1.1 to 1.7 if you have not done so far .... 
http://www.ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/Ubuntu
If you have already done the environmental setup then you need to run roscore command that is the master program through which all other program communicate to get performed in ROS .....
$ roscore

I hope your problem will be solved by that.

Since catkin_make succeeded, the environment is probably configured properly.
But, as @lifelonglearner says, you must start roscore in a separate terminal before you can issue rosrun beginner_tutorials add_two_ints_server.py.
