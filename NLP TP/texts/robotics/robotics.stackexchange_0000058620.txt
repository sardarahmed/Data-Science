Q:

How do I link a non ros library dependency in a catkin package?

So I am trying to use the biotac_drivers package here: https://github.com/kth-ros-pkg/biotac_driver
I would like to link to "/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2".
I know how to link a ROS package just fine but I'm coming up empty on how to link system dependencies.
On hydro, Ubuntu 3.11.10
Just incase I'm completely wrong on what I need to do here is the error:
Linking CXX executable /home/ablasdel/catkin_ws/devel/lib/biotac_sensors/biotac_pub
/usr/bin/ld: CMakeFiles/biotac_pub.dir/src/cheetah.c.o: undefined reference to symbol 'dlsym@@GLIBC_2.2.5'
/usr/bin/ld: note: 'dlsym@@GLIBC_2.2.5' is defined in DSO /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 so try adding it to the linker command line
/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2: could not read symbols: Invalid operation

That link broke with the package format 2 rollout here are the latest links:
http://docs.ros.org/api/catkin/html/howto/format2/system_library_dependencies.html
And for legacy format 1 if you are into that:

Thanks for noticing. I updated that link to the format2 version.
