Q:

How do I integrate thirdparty Python Dependencies?

Hello,
I'd like to make my package have a dependency on a Python package called pymorph.  Is there a supported way to require a dependency like this?
Thanks,
Bradley Powers

A:

You could either wrap the source for pymorph in a ROS package, or you could write a script in the rosdep.yaml that downloads and installs Pymorph. You can see rosdep.yaml examples here: http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosdep/rosdep.yaml#Examples
If you use the rosdep solution, please see the first two tutorials on the rosdep page:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosdep
They will walk you through adding a rosdep dependency and declaring support for it in your OS.  NOTE: rosdep dependencies should be ones that are easily available via package managers like apt and macports.

So, I certainly know how to add a regular dependency in the manifest.xml file, but the issue is that pymorph isn't available via apt...
