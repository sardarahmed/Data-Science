A:

   Err:8 http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu jammy Release

you appear to have the ROS 1 package repository configured on your Ubuntu Jammy system.
ROS 1 does not support Ubuntu Jammy, hence there is no "release file" there for apt to download.
You'll have to either:

remove the line which says something like deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu jammy main from /etc/apt/sources.list, or
remove the .list file from /etc/apt/sources.list.d (note the .d there) which contains that line

then try again.

Such line, as mentioned in 1, doesn't exist there, but 2 worked for me. The file name was ros-latest.list.

how you solve this ? i can't delete the .list !!!
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2023-05-08:
You'll probably have to remove it using sudo rm, as /etc/apt/sources.list.d is only writable by root (or users with root-level access).
