Q:

Where can I find the Ubuntu source packaging?

It doesn't seem to be available on http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu.

A:

AFAIK there are no source packages (as for apt-get source).
There is the source based install for the basic ROS system.
For other packages, look in the wiki at ros.org for the packages that you are interested in. Usually there is a download/checkout link.
