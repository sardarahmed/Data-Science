Q:

I wang to build a simulation environment of underwater robot(or AUV) to test my SLAM algorithms, but many things in ROS  can't be found, such as sonar. I konw UWSIM, but there is something is wrong while installing it.

Have you ever managed to implement SLAM for AUVs?

A:

Hi, you could try the UUV Simulator package. I am working now on making more realistic simulation of the sensors, but controllers and vehicle models are already available.
