Q:

What is the state-of-the-art in ROS navigation with dynamic obstacles?

Just wanted to know the state-of-the-art in path planners that incorporate dynamic obstacle avoidance. And some of the well known libraries for this sort of stuff.
UPDATE: I'm not talking about local planners like the dynamic window approach that approach dynamic obstacles as a static path planning problem with the additional dimension of time.
I'm looking for approaches like the velocity obstacle and others that model and/or predict the motion of obstacles and plan accordingly.
EDIT: Someone mentioned OMPL and MoveIt! in the comments. But AFAIK, OMPL is only for sampling based planners? And so these are not as useful for field robotics. Also, dynamic obstacle avoidance should involve much more than planning in a static space?
Thank you very much!

I think robotics.stackexchange is the right forum for this question.

Changed Q to be ROS specific.

Not sure why this was closed, it seems like a relevant discussion to have.

I'd like to know the answer too. If you know anything plz send it here hossam.moghrabi@gmail.com
thanks

A:

I'm not aware of any ROS packages that implement 2d navigation with dynamic obstacle avoidance. You may want to expand your search to robotics journals.
