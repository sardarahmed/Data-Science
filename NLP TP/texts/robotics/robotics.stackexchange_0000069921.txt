Q:

Mavros actautor topic conflict

I am following this tutorial here: https://pixhawk.org/dev/ros/ground_rover
I have sussessfully got this to work using the mavros in the past but I have since built mavros from source and now I am getting this error when I try to publish to the /mavros/actuator_control topic:
[ERROR] [1444603771.272545431]: Client [/mavros] wants topic /mavros/actuator_control to have datatype/md5sum [mavros_msgs/ActuatorControl/9eea0a80c88944fe2fb67f3b3768854b], but our version has [mavros/ActuatorControl/ba56d1663d64ac435b80a3508d6ce1d2]. Dropping connection.

Not sure how it is relevant but I can see there is a different folder structure with my workspace: ~/catkin_ws/src/mavros/mavros_msgs/msg/ActuatorControl.msg
Compared to this: /opt/ros/indigo/share/mavros/msg/ActuatorControl.msg
How can I resolve the issue?

A:

Never mind I got it. Was using the wrong header. Should be #include <mavros_msgs/ActuatorControl.h> instead of #include <mavros/ActuatorControl.h> and then nh.advertise<mavros_msgs::ActuatorControl> instead of nh.advertise<mavros::ActuatorControl>
So painfully obvious now that i know, should I laugh or cry ;)
