Q:

editing CMakeList.txt

I was going through pr2_controller tutorials and came across the portion where we must build and run the program.
It says
make the binary by typing make in the drive_base_tutorial directory.
Where must I type this? In the CMakeList.txt file? and what does it mean by make the binary?
Thanks in advance

A:

It means exactly what it says.
In your terminal, run:
roscd drive_base_tutorial
make

roscd drive_base_tutorial will take you to the drive_base_tutorial directory (you can also use cd for this).
make is a build tool; it will call cmake, which will use the information in your CMakeLists.txt to call the compiler and the linker, converting your C++ code into an executable.
