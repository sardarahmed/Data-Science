Q:

First CNC router, where should my zero position be?

I have homing switches and I'm unsure if my zero should be right after they are done homing or if the zero is supposed to be the center of my build volume?

A:

The location of the homing position does not make any theoretical difference, you can zero (or set to any constant value) your axis positions at any desired position. 
From a pracitcal point of view, you can consider the following aspects:

switches might get in the way of chips, switches might be damaged or the other way around, switches might get in the way of chip evacuations. From this point of view, the exteremity of the axes is probably a good option. 
homing position should be easy to find, even if encoder values are not to be trused (e.g. axes can be ofset manually, without power). From this point of view, an axis extremity is a good option, since you can just drive the axis in one direction until you hit the switch. 
The toolchainge position, if you have automated toolchange is an important position, having a precise toolchange position is important. Colocating the toolchange position with the homing position might be also a good idea (event better when the above criteria are also met with the toolchange position).
