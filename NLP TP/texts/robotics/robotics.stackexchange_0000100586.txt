Q:

(x,y) origin for 3 wheeled robots

I have a 2-differential drive wheels in front, and caster in rear, of my rectangular platform.  I haven't been able to find a definitive answer on where (x,y) = (0,0) should be in the footprint parameter in the costmap yaml files.  Is it the turn pivot location between the 2 drive wheels or the physical center of the robot frame.  I have seen both used in different posts.  I am using ROS Melodic.
Thanks

A:

It should be mid-way between the two drive wheels. It is at the rotation point when the drive wheels cause the robot to spin in place.
