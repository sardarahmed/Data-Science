Q:

text inverted in rviz

Update additional data: Note in this image the global map is also inverted as the text.
Not sure how they are related because the local frame is not inverted.

I am showing inverted text on tf axis in rviz. The model and lazer data are not inverted as can be seen in the image below. What could be causing this? The image is not inverted this is actually how it shows in the rivz display.

A:

The text inversion resolved on its own after switching between views when switching back the text appeared normal thereafter.
