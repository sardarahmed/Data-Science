Q:

Gazebo can't startup occasionally with 'undefined symbol: _ZN3ros13isInitializedEv'?

I startup the gazebo8 by roslaunch and use with my own GUI plugin. But the gazebo can't startup occasionally with the output:
gzclient: symbol lookup error: /home/xxx/catkin_ws/devel/lib/libxxxplugin.so: undefined symbol: _ZN3ros13isInitializedEv
I am sure that the plugin is loaded. What is the reason?

A:

Add ${catkin_LIBRARIES} in target_link_libraries may help.
