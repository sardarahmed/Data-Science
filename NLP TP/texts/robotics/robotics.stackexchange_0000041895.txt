Q:

rosed for read-only files

I'm a newbie- and I was trying to use the "rosed" command to edit one of the .cpp source files that came in the package image_view.
However when I follow the instructions here:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/UsingRosEd
after I make the change I cant save it-- it says:
"/opt/ros/electric/stacks/image_pipeline/image_view/src/nodes/extract_images.cpp" E212: Can't open file for writing
How do I change the permissions? Obviously "sudo" won't help.
Any help is highly appreciated.

A:

You should not edit files in /opt/ros since they by system packages. Instead, create an overlay. Have a look at the rosws tutorial and this answer.
