Q:

apt-get doesn't find ROS packages at all

I've tried running sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-ros-tutorials ros-indigo-geometry-tutorials ros-indigo-rviz ros-indigo-rosbash ros-indigo-rqt-tf-tree but it outputs:
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-indigo-ros-tutorials
E: Unable to locate package ros-indigo-geometry-tutorials
E: Unable to locate package ros-indigo-rviz
E: Unable to locate package ros-indigo-rosbash
E: Unable to locate package ros-indigo-rqt-tf-tree

apt-get seems to be able to download other things such as nmap but the ROS packages simply are un-locatable. Any ideas? I'm pretty new to Raspbian (I'm on a RPi) and feel a bit at a loss.
Thanks!

did you run sudo apt-get update beforehand?
Comment by Tetrachromat on 2015-11-18:
Yes. I did it, but no luck.

A:

The Raspberry Pi does not use the same binary format as standard desktop computers, so the standard ROS installation setup does not work.
Have a look at the ROS Indigo on Raspberry Pi instructions.
If you're using a Raspberry Pi 2, you can also install Ubuntu on it, and use the Ubuntu for armhf instructions: http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/UbuntuARM

I did run the setup from that installation page. Roscore does actually run, but specifically there's a problem downloading packages.

Which installation page? I linked to two.
Comment by Tetrachromat on 2015-11-18:
First link.
Comment by ahendrix on 2015-11-18:
The first link describes an installation of ROS from sources, and the final section (5.2) describes how to add additional packages from source. You can't use apt-get to add packages to a source install, and the apt packages aren't available on Raspbian.

Have you had any luck with this?  I have been having the same issue for several days now.  This is the first part of the tutorial that hasn't worked.  Can we just download each package from the source instead?

@LukeH: the answer is pretty clear - if you're following the from-source installation on the Raspberry Pi, you can't use apt to install additional packages. Use the instructions in section 5.2 for installing additional packages from source.
