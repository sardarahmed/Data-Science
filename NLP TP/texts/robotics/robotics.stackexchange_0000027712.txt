Q:

Gazebo Tutorial: Build error

I am going through the following tutorial link . Have been struggling with a build error at step 5. Below is the output of the compiler.
[100%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/velodyne_plugin.dir/velodyne_plugin.cc.o

I am using the default CMake build script provided in the tutorial. Also i am running ubuntu 14.04 + gazebo 6.6.0 + GCC 4.8.4. I am not sure what i am doing wrong here, i have looked through gazebo plugins source code and pretty much every default plugin interface uses the same method. Also i do not have any other versions of gazebo installed on my machine for causing any version conflicts. I have sourced the setup files. Being a noob i'm a little out of depth here. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Maybe the tutorial is skipping some steps. Have you tried compiling the code under "Create an API" -> 4.?
Comment by talha on 2016-04-13:
Yes thank you. How stupid of me. The latter part of the tutorial includes the data members of the class. Although it is a bit misleading since it does instruct you to build the plugin without properly declaring all the required data members. Thank you for pointing me in the right direction.

Glad it works now, I ticketed an issue and added an answer.

A:

It looks like the tutorial is incomplete, I ticketed an issue on gazebo_tutorials.
For now, skip to the code in "Create an API" -> 4.
