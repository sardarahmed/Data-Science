Q:

use ros header files in c++ project

Hi,
I am new to ROS. I want to include ros header files (for example #include <rosbag/bag.h>) in a c++ project. I do not want to create a node and start roscore. How can I include this header + other dependencies in a CMakeLists file ?
Thanks.

A:

See #q238955
catkin (http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials) which makes use of CMake is the best supported way to go, otherwise you could do cmake on your own like:
find_package(roscpp REQUIRED)
include_directories(${roscpp_INCLUDE_DIRS})
...

Replace roscpp with whatever library you need.
pkg-config also can get ros libraries and includes.

using these lines in my CMakeList :
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.12)
project(writeBag)
find_package(roscpp REQUIRED)
I get this error :CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:3 (find_package): By not providing "Findroscpp.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked CMake to find a package

../..
configuration file provided by "roscpp", but
CMake did not find one.
Could not find a package configuration file provided by "roscpp" with any
of the following names:
roscppConfig.cmake
roscpp-config.cmake

Add the installation prefix of "roscpp" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set..

I fixed this issue : I needed to source the ROS setup.bash file...
