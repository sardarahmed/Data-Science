Q:

Pelican pose control accuracy

Hi,
This question mainly to all those ROS UAV users working with an Asctec Pelican quadrotor: what's the typical hovering accuracy you can obtain? I got a first basic controller working but, before I start trying to optimize is, would like to have an idea of the typical performance I can achieve.
regards,
Steven

A:

Since your question isn't about ROS, it should be asked elsewhere, such as on the asctec-users mailing list.
