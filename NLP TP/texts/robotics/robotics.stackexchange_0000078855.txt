Q:

How to achieve quadcopter autonomy after successful implementation of 2D SLAM using RPLidar and "hector_slam" ROS package in indoor environments?

I have a Naza M Flight Controller which can give me the IMU readings (I don't know if I can extract this information by interfacing it with ROS, else I will have to use an external IMU). I also need suggestion for a sonar sensor (my application is for indoor environments) to integrate elevation data in hector_slam . Further, is it even possible to achieve autonomy with an RPLidar, IMU data and Sonar Data?
looking forward!
Thanks
