Q:

scan_tools runtime error undefined symbol cblas_dtrsv ubuntu 12.04.2LTS

I have downloaded the scan_tools source code from git: it did build successfully, but at runtime I get:
"laser_scan_matcher_node: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libgsl.so.0: undefined symbol: cblas_dtrsv".
When I run ldd on the laser_scan_matcher_node binary, I see that libgsl.so.0 is linked, but NOT libgslcblas.
I am on ubuntu 12.04.2LTS.
What could I do to make it work, please ?

A:

By browsing the web, I have found a way to build it on ubuntu 12.04.2.LTS.
In fact only the laser_scan_matcher triggers the symbol lookup error.
STEPS:

rosmake scan_tools

sudo apt-get remove binutils-gold (this one doesn't link libgslcblas correctly, as stated on this page: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14405601/gnu-scientific-library-cblas-symbol-lookup-error ).

rosmake --pre-clean laser_scan_matcher : the build will not finish correctly (problems with libboost),but next step will finish the build:

sudo apt-get install binutils-gold

rosmake laser_scan_matcher : the build finishes successfully.

This time when I run "ldd laser_scan_matcher_node" on the binary, libgslcblas is linked correcly, and the laser_scan_matcher works :)
