Q:

RoboEarth installation problem

Hi all,
I want to install RoboEarth on Ubuntu 12.04. So far, I followed this guide ros wiki with some minor modifications. I've done the following steps:
1.
rosinstall ~/ros /opt/ros/fuerte 'ros wiki source'

That gave me an error, so i just downloaded the roboearth.rosinstall file and used the path to that instead of the url.
2.
Added "source ~/ros/setup.bash" to the .bashrc
3.
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-ias-common ros-fuerte-perception-pcl ros-fuerte-opencv2 ros-fuerte-octomap-mapping ros-fuerte-client-rosjava-jni libsuitesparse-dev

...and what is important but not listed there
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-knowrob

rosmake roboearth

My problem is when I execute rosmake roboearth I get the following and cannot find a way to proceed any further:
[ rosmake ] rosmake starting...

Thanks in advance for you help!

A:

I'm not sure if things still work in fuerte -- you can at least try to install rosjava_jni using the .deb packages. It's in the package ros-fuerte-client-rosjava-jni. Alternatively, please try to install knowrob and its dependencies from source as described here.

Thank you for your feedback, Moritz
However, I already have rosjava_jni installed. I checked it's there in /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/client_rosjava_jni . When I try to rosmake knowrob according to the procedure you mentioned it gives me the same error: cannot find required resource: client_rosjava_jni

Have you re-loaded your bashrc? It's not listed above -- just open a new terminal and use that one, or type 'source ~/.bashrc'
Comment by Andrii Matviienko on 2014-02-23:
Yes, I did. Currently it contains those 2 lines:
source /opt/ros/fuerte/setup.bash
source /home/andriimatviienko/fuerte_workspace/setup.bash
You also mentioned that those things might not work in fuerte. What version of ROS would you then recommend to use for roboEarth?
Comment by patrickl on 2014-03-07:
you tried to install the package from source?
git clone https://github.com/gheorghelisca/rosjava_jni.git client_rosjava_jni
maybe this will work

That helped! Thank you! After installation I had to add the path to it manually by 'export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/client_rosjava_jni'. Afterwards I had the same problem with other packages from stacks folder and I manually added them to $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, what fixed the problem

After that I had the exact same problem as listed here http://answers.ros.org/question/68773/problem-compiling-re_comm/ and deleting UnizarRoboEarthInterface.java from ~/fuerte_workspace/stacks/roboearth/re_comm/src/roboearth/wp1 fixed the problem
