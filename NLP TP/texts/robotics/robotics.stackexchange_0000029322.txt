Q:

How to disable binary ignition?

I have a binary installation of ignition gazebo fortress, but want to build ignition gazebo garden from source too.
Is there a way to "disable" the binary fortress without uninstalling it? (In ROS, this can be achieved by not sourcing the setup file for the binary version.)

A:

I don't believe "disabling" is possible since the binaries are installed in system paths that are normally part of your PATH environment. However, building garden from source should be possible without uninstalling fortress, i.e, they are meant to be able to coexist side-by-side (python bindings might be an issue, so I'd have a different recommendation if you need to use them).
