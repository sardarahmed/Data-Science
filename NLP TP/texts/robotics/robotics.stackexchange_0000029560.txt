Q:

ROS + Lego NXT + Kinect?

Here's a question I received recently, thought it would be good to put up here:

My project group is going to try
programming a Lego Mindstorm NXT robot
and the Kinect.
We are currently still trying to
figure how to interface the Kinect
with our NXT robot.
We have read on the internet that it
is possible to used ROS-Kinect and
ROS-NXT. Also, we have explored the
possibility of using C# on OpenKinect.
However, we are unable to figure how
to interface both the NXT and Kinect
such that the Kinect is able to
control the NXT. Also, may we ask
which software/IDE/platform which we
could use to program both the NXT and
Kinect at the same time?

A:

I don't have experience with NXT, just the RCX, but I will try to help out.
You will need a host computer to act as the remote brain.  This computer will connect to the USB of the Kinect, and it will also connect to the NXT over USB.  ROS does not actually run -on- the NXT, it will simply command it from the remote computer.
The remote computer must be Linux.  You won't have any luck in Windows or Mac with ROS + Kinect + NXT.  I don't use an IDE.  I use GVim and vim to edit files and compile and run things from the command line.  ROS is very friendly with the command line.
So get Ubuntu running and see http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Installation
If you haven't gone through the ROS tutorials I suggest you start there, it'll only take a day or two to get through them all: http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials
Then figure out how to control your NXT robot from ROS http://www.ros.org/wiki/nxt
So make a ROS node to control your robot.
The next step is to get the Kinect working http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_kinect
Then you can make a ROS node to listen to the Kinect data and send commands to the node controlling your NXT robot.

I use both command line (gedit, rosmake) and Eclipse IDE as described at http://www.ros.org/wiki/IDEs. The gdb (debugger) integration with ROS and Eclipse works fine, but you have to set up the debug config ROS environment variables properly if using multiple networked computers.
