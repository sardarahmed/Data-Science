Q:

Unable to build rgbdslam on groovy

Hi, i followed the guide for building the package and everything run smooth till i reach the rosmake section that fails with this error
home/alessio/RosWorkspace/rgbdslam_freiburg/rgbdslam/src/openni_listener.h:65:5: error: ‘signalMessage’ was not declared in this scope, and no declarations were found by argument-dependent lookup at the point of instantiation [-fpermissive]
/home/alessio/RosWorkspace/rgbdslam_freiburg/rgbdslam/src/openni_listener.h:65:5: note: declarations in dependent base ‘message_filters::SimpleFilter<sensor_msgs::Image_<std::allocator<void> > >’ are not found by unqualified lookup
/home/alessio/RosWorkspace/rgbdslam_freiburg/rgbdslam/src/openni_listener.h:65:5: note: use ‘this->signalMessage’ instead

It seems like a problem with the source code... what am I doing wrong?
System description: ubuntu 12.10 64bit with ros-groovy

Weird, because I have the same config as you, and I don't have the problem...
Have you tried to rosdep first ?
Comment by Alex2309 on 2013-03-20:
yes and all the dependencies are installed...

hi, I am trying to install RGBDSLAM package on hydro. It says that follow the instruction on groovy first. But I cannot find a step by step one. Could you please give me a link?
Also, do you install the package in a catkin workspace or a rosbuild space?

A:

Solved!,
it was some issue with the GCC compiler...
If you edit the /rgbdslam_freiburg/rgbdslam/src/openni_listener.h file changing from "signalMessage(...)" to "this->signalMessage(...)" it will compile without error.

wtf? Sounds like something boost. I'll update the repository after easter.

I changed that in the repository. So it's not required to do this anymore. Thanks for sharing.
