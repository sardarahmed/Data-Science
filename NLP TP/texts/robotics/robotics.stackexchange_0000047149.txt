Q:

Problem with PCL messages

Hi,
I have encountered problem with the PCL messages, there is a number of messages:
pcl/ModelCoefficients
pcl/PointIndices
pcl/PolygonMesh
pcl/Vertices

but there is no makefile and the messages are not build. Meaning that they can't be used in the python. Why is that?

A:

They are defined in Python.
What ROS distro are you using? For Groovy on Ubuntu, those files should be in /opt/ros/groovy/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pcl/msg/.
How did you import the message definitions? Something like this?
from pcl.msg import ModelCoefficients

Did you declare your dependency on the pcl package?

I'm using Fuerte, the messages are defined in /opt/ros/fuerte/share/pcl/msg/ but not generated.

I can confirm it: There are no python messages in the (ubuntu/debian) package ros-fuerte-pcl.

Please post a bug ticket, specifying that the problem is in ROS Fuerte. The PCL issues page seems to be here: http://dev.pointclouds.org/projects/pcl/issues
