Q:

how can i detect/prevent non linear movement

As you can see below, the "robotic arm" first goes "cartesian" correctly, but then it cannot follow "cartesian".
i want to use cartesian path, If the cartesian path cannot be solved i want to detect
Please check out the gif iamge below. 
I want the robot arm to go linear 
If the robot arm goes out of linear path, I must stop. 
i use OMPL->RRTstar ,track_ik

thank you

I do not understand what question you are asking. What do you mean by "non cartesian path"? What about the arm motion do you think is wrong? Also tell us which planner you are using.
Please add this information to your text using the "edit" button at the end of the description.

A:

As far as I know, none of the cartesian planners guarantee that the arm links or joints move thru the minimum possible distance. You will have to write your own planner if you need that. Note that some planners can be configured to allow searching more of the state space, but that still does not guarantee you get the "best" solution.
