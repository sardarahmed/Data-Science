Q:

shadow_hand spawn on gazebo electric don't move

hi,
i have an haptic glove, and im using it to move the fingers of the shadow hand spawn on gazebo electric.
first i was working on fuerte and doesn't a problem all was good, but i have to down to electric for collision part that i need and on fuerte gazebo version is broken.
the values of sensors are publishing on this topics
sh_mfj3_mixed_position_velocity_controller/command
  sh_mfj0_mixed_position_velocity_controller/command
  sh_lfj3_mixed_position_velocity_controller/command
  sh_lfj0_mixed_position_velocity_controller/command
  sh_ffj3_mixed_position_velocity_controller/command
  sh_ffj0_mixed_position_velocity_controller/command

well, the same sh_xf#_mixed_position_velocity_controller/command for the 5 fingers.
to spawn shadow_hand i use
roslaunch sr_hand gazebo_hand.launch
EDIT:
well i'm thinking is an error or here miss something. see when i run this on fuerte the rxgraph show me the node of the communication and the publishin on the topics of contrtollers like see in the image 
but it electric is happenin this

here is like the hand looks after some minutes, and nothing happens when is running rostopic pub 
Log when run roslaunch sr_hand gazebo_hand.launch

A:

Install arm_navigation stack and you should be able to build:
sudo apt-get install ros-electric-arm-navigation
rosmake shadow_robot
