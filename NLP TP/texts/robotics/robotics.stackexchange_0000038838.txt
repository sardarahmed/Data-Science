Q:

ROS service tutorial -- make error

I am just learning ROS. I was following the tutorial here:
[http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/WritingServiceClient%28c%2B%2B%29](Service and Client using c++)
Then I tried to 'make' the package, beginner_tutorials, but this is the output I got. There cannot be an error in the already made tutorial packages. Am I missing something?

[ 75%] Building CXX object

In the last paragraph, the tutorial offers some hints to fix failing builds. Did you already double-check those?

Make sure you've performed the following tutorial, regarding the creation of the srv file, successfully: http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingMsgAndSrv#Creating_a_srv. Seems to be a problem there.
