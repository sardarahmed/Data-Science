Q:

Message data type and accessing message fields

I'm trying to use the /body_msgs/skeletons message (from the MIT hand_interaction demo).  I'm trying to write a subscriber callback function.  How can I tell the type of the message (for the callback prototype declaration)?
Also, this message has many fields (x,y,z coordinates of various joints).  How would I access any individual coordinate such as left_hip/y ?
Thanks,
Paul

A:

I recommend following the relevant ROS tutorials on writing publishers and subscribers for your relevant language:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials
e.g. "Writing a Simple Publisher and Subscriber (C++)"

Multiple fields is no different from a single field: you just access the field by its name.  i.e. if you type "msg.data", you are accessing the 'data' field.

Thanks kwc.  I have worked through these tutorials.  I'm still not clear on how to access fields of a message or what is the type of a message composed of many variables.  The tutorials use standard types having only a single field.  Apologies if this is basic.
