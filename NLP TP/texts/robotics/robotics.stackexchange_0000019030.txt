Q:

Is This A Colour Sensor?

Hi Iam new to robotics and stack exchange and Iam 13 years old,this is a IR sensor, can you tell me that  is this thing have a colour sensor on it?

A:

I believe this is just IR sensor. This sensor wont able to differentiate color between red, green,blue etc. But you can use this sensor to differentiate black line and white floor (in case u wanna build line follower) because if it was white floor it will reflect more infrared transmitted from this device to its photodiode. U can see the infrared by turning on this sensor and look through your phone camera. You will see purple light.
If you wanna sense another color. You need color sensor. Just google it.
Hope this help :)
