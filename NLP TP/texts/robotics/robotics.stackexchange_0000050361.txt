Q:

rxtools not found in Groovy

In order to use RosoutPanel in C++ I include rxtools/rosout_panel.h in my class and depend on rxtools in manifest.xml. In Fuerte this works fine, but in Groovy I get a compile error because it cannot find rosout_panel.h:
fatal error: rxtools/rosout_panel.h: No such file or directory

The .h-file is present on the file system (/opt/ros/groovy/share/rxtools/src/rxtools), so why is it not found?

I believe it's just your typo but rosout_panel.h not rosoutpanel.h ok?

Sorry about that, I am including rosout_panel.h in the code :-)

And I assume you're using rosbuild via rosmake? If so, can you share CMakeLists.txt?

I made a very simple example that works in Fuerte but not Groovy: http://www8.cs.umu.se/~ringdahl/ros/rxtest.tar.gz

A:

rxtools is deprecated and replaced by rqt_common_plugins in groovy

But since the package (and the h-file) is still there it should still work right?

does roscd rxtools work for you in groovy? It does not for me, so I can see why it does not find the file. Just having the .h file in your fuerte workspace will not help your groovy compilation
Comment by Ola Ringdahl on 2013-04-17:
Yes I can roscd to it and the h-files are present in the Groovy workspace as well. You have to install rxtools separately in Groovy, so that may be why why you cannot roscd to it. I used apt-get to install it.

The problem is that the .h files are not inside /opt/ros/groovy/include/rxtools but in /opt/ros/groovy/share/rxtools/src/rxtools. You could fix that by just copying the files into the right folder or use rqt which would be the nicer solution

They are in the share folder in Fuerte as well. Is this something that has changed in Groovy that they have to be in the include folder?
