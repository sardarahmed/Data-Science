A:

cv_bridge is failing because it cannot find opencv: brew install opencv
I cannot tell what the problem with other one is, rosmake is hiding part of the error, please post the full build log for camera_calibration_parsers.
Also, I wouldn't recommend rosmake -a, you should instead build things as you need them, i.e. rosmake <some stack or package that you want to use>

I have included a link to the log as it is quite a long file. Thank you for your help.
