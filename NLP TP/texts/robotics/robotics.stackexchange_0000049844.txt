Q:

wstool Source path failure

When trying to set up a workspace i use the code
mkdir -p ~/catkin/src
cd ~/catkin/src
wstool init ~/catkin/src /opt/ros/groovy
the error I get is that
Using initial elements from: /opt/ros/groovy
ERROR in config: wstool does not allow elements without vcs information. {'other': {'local-name': '/opt/ros/groovy'}}
any thoughts?

I was following the install ROSARIA instalation for groovy but I would get an error which I cannot recall and so I was trying to correct the updated tutorial but it has since updated again and now I'm running into new problems. But thanks for the help. I was just trying to understand the wstool.

A:

This is not how you use wstool, can you explain what you are trying to achieve? Are you trying to just create a catkin workspace for your packages, or are you trying to build ROS from source, or are you following a particular tutorial?
