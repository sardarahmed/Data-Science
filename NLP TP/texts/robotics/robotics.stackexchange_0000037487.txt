A:

I am a developer of navigation system with taking elevators in JSK.
The codes are in jsk-ros-pkg (http://jsk-ros-pkg.svn.sourceforge.net/),
and the main package is elevator_move_base_pr2.
We are using Euslisp programming language for describing procedure of
taking elevator and geometrical elevator call button models.
And navigating between multiple maps, we have to change grid map in move_base and amcl.
These scripts are in jsk_maps package.

Thank you! In case anyone else is looking, the package multi_map_server is under the jsk_ros_patch folder.

Thanks to sourceforge weirdness, one needs to look at http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsk-ros-pkg/ and then the tab "Code", not the tab "Files".

Looks like the jsk code repo has moved to github.
