Q:

Robot Global Position

Let's say the robot is at the origin(O) at the beginning. The goal is to move the robot to points A,B,C. If the robot is at point A at the first step and the next step I want to move it to B, then it has to go to B directly without going back to the origin.
I guess in ROS, we always have the origin at the robot. Hence, when the robot is at A. I don't know how to move it to B directly without knowing the position of the robot in the map. This comes to my question. I want to transform from robot_base coordinate to global coordinate. I tried rosrun tf tf_echo /map /base_link but it does not work.

the robot global position is published as Odometry.
This is the position that robot thinks to have from the initial position.
I really suggest you to buy and read the book I suggested you.

A:

A library called tf does exactly what you need. Going through its tutorial will get you some idea of what it is.

If you use ROS Hydro or later, you're encouraged to use tf2, a rewrite of tf. Link to tutorial.
(Not recommended as of Jan 2015) If you're on ROS Groovy or earlier you should use tf. Tutorial.

Yes, I have some idea what tf does, but I still do not have an idea how to transform everything to world position.
Comment by 130s on 2015-01-03:
So, have you gone through the tutorials? Use lookupTransform as this example does.
Comment by newcastle on 2015-01-03:
Yes, but I am not sure what frames to use. I suppose I need to transform from /base_link to /map?
Comment by 130s on 2015-01-03:
I have no idea what frame names you use. Use rqt_tf_tree to see the base frame (in the screenshot in the link, it's /odom_combined).
Comment by newcastle on 2015-01-03:
what frame is /odom_combined?
Comment by 130s on 2015-01-03:
/odom_combined is nothing but an example that was used in the screenshot in the link I referred to. What I meant was that you have to find the base tf frame in your own application (by e.g. using the tool I mentioned).
Comment by newcastle on 2015-01-03:
I know that the base_footprint is the robot frame. Is /odom_combined a global frame? In my rqt_tf_frame, I have odom_combined at the top of the tree just like in the screenshot.
