Q:

Can't launch turtlebot_gazebo example, kobuki_description not found

Background : Ubuntu 14.04, ROS indigo, gazebo 2.
I want to launch the example in turtlebot_gazebo:
roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch 

The following error appears:
... logging to /home/osboxes/.ros/log/8aed81da-765e-11e6-b998-000c29a1f7dd/roslaunch-monmon-6172.log
Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.

while processing /opt/ros/indigo/share/turtlebot_gazebo/launch/includes/kobuki.launch.xml:
Invalid <param> tag: Cannot load command parameter [robot_description]: command [/opt/ros/indigo/share/xacro/xacro.py '/opt/ros/indigo/share/turtlebot_description/robots/kobuki_hexagons_asus_xtion_pro.urdf.xacro'] returned with code [1]. 

Param xml is <param command="$(arg urdf_file)" name="robot_description"/>
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

I think the important thing is rospkg.common.ResourceNotFound: kobuki_description
Please help to solve
And YES, I have tried searching before asking such as:
this1
this2 this3
But they don't really give solution/fix the problem for me
Any help will be appreciated

A:

In my prev post , I uninstall and reinstall the turtlebot.
Turns out that I ALSO have to uninstall the kobuki , before reinstalling so
sudo apt-get remove turtlebot-*

sudo apt-get remove kobuki-*

sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-turtlebot ros-indigo-turtlebot-apps ros-indigo-turtlebot-interactions ros-indigo-turtlebot-simulator ros-indigo-kobuki-ftdi ros-indigo-rocon-remocon ros-indigo-rocon-qt-library ros-indigo-ar-track-alvar-msgs

It works for me !!
