Q:

ccny_rgbd with vo+mapping rosservice call error

Hello Dryanovski and fellow campaigners,
I am using ROS Groovy on an i3 laptop and ATI 6770m. I use your ccny package. Nearly everything works fine. I can start all launch files an see the rgbd screen (Topic: /rgbd/cloud) in rviz. Just one problem: I want to see the whole map in rviz, but it disappears. I think i must call the service
rosservice call /publish_keyframes ".*" to publish all keyframes an set the delay time unequal zero. But i get just the error message after the call:
ERROR: service [/publish_keyframes] responded with an error:
nothing else :(
In rviz i can set the topic to "keyframes", but no pointcloud!
I tried different detector types and change their params...no effect...
Thanks for your help,
Regards,
rossi

Hello,
The keyframes are not published on rgbd/cloud, but on keyframes instead. I'm not sure why the error is occurring. Can you visualize the keyframes in rviz without the service?
