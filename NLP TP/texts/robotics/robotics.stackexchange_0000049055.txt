Q:

Geo-Referenced Mapping interface for ROS/RVIZ

Hi Guys,
I found this video on Youtube of a QuadCopter mapping a building on a Georeferenced Map:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vtm46eGtU
The interface looks to be RVIZ, with the map laid across the ground plane.
Does anyone know how to import a georeferenced Map, such as a geotiff, into RVIZ to get this same effect???
I am looking for a mapping interface that can take geo-referenced maps of satellite imagery and plot the robots path and sensor information on top of it, just like the video.  I would also like to select GPS waypoints on the map, and send those to the robot to navigate too.
This needs to be done without connection to the internet.
The only other things I have found are:
rosworldwind - http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosworldwind: World Wind is not supported very well in Ubuntu
ground_station - http://www.ros.org/wiki/ground_station: Related to QuadCopters, and is no longer being updated
gpsd_viewer: http://www.ros.org/wiki/gpsd_viewer: Does not zoom in very good and is no longer being updated
marble_plugin: http://www.ros.org/wiki/marble_plugin: No high resolution Satellite images.
Google Earth/Maps: Google Earth/API has a lot of limitations and there licenses strictly forbids its use with autonomous vehicles. See section 10.2.C at https://developers.google.com/maps/terms
osm_cartography: It displays map features from Open Street Maps into rviz. OSM though does not provide satellite imagery unfortunately.

Looking for your guys thoughts/ideas.
Thank you

UPDATE
Some packages to maybe look into for implementation into rqt are: OSSIM (http://trac.osgeo.org/ossim/wiki) a QT geo app. Here is an example of their viewer: http://trac.osgeo.org/ossim/wiki/OssimPlanet . Also some others: http://www.osgeo.org/

A:

Maybe qGIS would be an option (http://www.qgis.org) too. It's not the easiest to use, but pretty powerful if you are familiar with GIS techniques and other GIS software (it uses GRASS internally to implement may of its geographic processing tools).  It's been around a while and is pretty mature and stable. It's similar in purpose to ArcGIS, and maybe OSSIM (but probably with more of a vector map emphasis than imaging); it's a general GIS toolbox  not just a viewer.

How did you use qgis?  Did you have to write your own rviz plugin?
