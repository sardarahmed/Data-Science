Q:

rosdep update groovy.yaml file not found on groovy

Hello all!
I am following the Raspberry Pi (Raspbian) Source install tutorial after installing most packages from the repository on http://www.ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/Raspbian but I am getting this file not found erros:

Is it expected behavior?
Thanks!

A:

The repository linking from http://www.ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/Raspbian was outdated, as pointed out by po1.
It has been updated to contain version 0.10.20 and this solved the issue.
I would like to thank everyone that contributed for their help! Please keep sharing!
