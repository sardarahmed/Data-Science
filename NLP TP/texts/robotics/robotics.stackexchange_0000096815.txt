Q:

rosdep install fails with ament_pep8: No definition of [python3-pep8] for OS version [32] on Fedora 32, deprecated

Fedora 32 replaced python3-pep8 with python3-pycodestyle so the following step from Install dependencies using rosdep fails:
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro dashing -y --skip-keys "console_bridge fastcdr fastrtps libopensplice67 libopensplice69 rti-connext-dds-5.3.1 urdfdom_headers"
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
ament_pep8: No definition of [python3-pep8] for OS version [32]

I tried to install the Fedora 31 version of python3-pep8 and got more dependency issues:
dnf install https://download-ib01.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/31/Everything/armhfp/os/Packages/p/python3-pep8-1.7.1-4.fc31.noarch.rpm

Error:
 Problem: conflicting requests
  - nothing provides python(abi) = 3.7 needed by python3-pep8-1.7.1-4.fc31.noarch
  - nothing provides python3.7dist(setuptools) needed by python3-pep8-1.7.1-4.fc31.noarch
(try to add '--skip-broken' to skip uninstallable packages)

Any work-around available?

A:

Thanks to the Fedora Robotics mailing list I got around this. The full command looks like this:
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro dashing -y --skip-keys "console_bridge fastcdr fastrtps libopensplice67 libopensplice69 rti-connext-dds-5.3.1 urdfdom_headers python3-pep8"

However the next command, colcon build --symlink-install fails, so I started another thread.
