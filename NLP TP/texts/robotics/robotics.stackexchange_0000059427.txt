Q:

rgbdslam indigo

Hi,
Is there any work on rgbdslam ?
It seems that the last version is under fuerte, and not a catkin package.
I've tried to use it under hydro, but I didn't find a way to do it.
Has someone some experience about rgbdslam under hydro ?
Thanks

A:

There is no indigo version. There is a beta release for hydro here: http://felixendres.github.io/rgbdslam_v2/
I am currently too busy to migrate to indigo (and Ubu 14.04), but I am interested to see, whether people here get it to work. For those willing to try, here's the ROS migration guide.
