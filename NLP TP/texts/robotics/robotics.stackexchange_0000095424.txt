Hello,
Can anyone provide me the details of ROS docker repository (github), where ros docker installation files are maintained?
Is there any guide on how can I contribute there?

A:

If you click on one of that tags of official ROD Docker images on Docker Hub  (tags are located on Description tab) then it will take you to the source code of Dockerfiles located on GitHub - I think that is what you are looking for:
https://github.com/osrf/docker_images
