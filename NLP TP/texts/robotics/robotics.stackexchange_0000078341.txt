Without more context (OS, how you installed things, what you are trying to do, which version of ROS, etc), the best I can do is that it would seem you don't have PkgConfig installed. Try installing it and see whether that helps.

Please update your original question (use the edit button/link) and give us enough information to help you. What exactly are you trying to do, and what set of steps led to the error message that you copy/pasted.

I have no direct experience with the NDK integration, but from the error message I would say that the docker image that is being used does not have PkgConfig installed or CMake can't find it. I recommend you open an issue here.

Well, thank you very much.

Currently we don't support using PkgConfig with the ROS NDK, you will need to use a workaround to specify the correct variables for the library you need to use (in this case libusb). Here's an example on how we do that for another package.
