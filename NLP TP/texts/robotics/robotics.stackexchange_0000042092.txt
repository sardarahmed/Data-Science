Q:

no such option --rosdep-install

Hi all,
I am attempting to install the source code modifiable version of VSLAM. I need to run "rosmake --rosdep-install vslam_system" and it fails with this error
yglee@yglee-VirtualBox:~/ros_workspace/VSLAMDIR$ rosmake --rosdep-install vslam_system
Usage: rosmake [options] [PACKAGE]...
rosmake: error: no such option: --rosdep-install
I have rosdep downloaded via pip and easy_install (I tried both just incase). Does anyone know why rosmake doesn't find the option rosdep?
Thanks,
Grace

A:

Internal use of rosdep inside rosmake was removed in ROS Fuerte (see REP 125)
You'll now have to use
rosdep install PACKAGE
rosmake PACKAGE
