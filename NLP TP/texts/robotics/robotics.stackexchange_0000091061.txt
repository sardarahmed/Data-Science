Q:

Executing two callbacks of two subscribers parallelly. How?

If one sub1.callback is on execution and meanwhile msg arrives on other sub2. I want to process sub2.callback parallely. Is it possible? How?
ros::Subscriber image_sub= nh.subscribe("/rgb, 2, &class::imCallback, &class);
ros::Subscriber depth_sub= nh.subscribe("/depth", 2, &class::depthCallback, &class);

I read many posts on callback queues, MultiThreadedSpinner, boost. I am confused which way is good for my application !!

A:

Use ros::MultiThreadedSpinner: http://wiki.ros.org/roscpp/Overview/Callbacks%20and%20Spinning to execute multiple callbacks in parallel.

Thanks @ahendrix
So, seperate callback queues for each subscriber is not required?
