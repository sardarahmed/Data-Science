Q:

Calling other callback from callback class

Hi,
I'm using the callback class like
class X{ callback(){} X(){ros::publisher sub1 = n.subscribe(&callback); callback();} run()};
but can you do from this callback method: callback(){ ros::publisher sub2 = n.subscribe(&callback2); callback2():}. I couldn't find about this.
I hope the question is clear. Thanks.

A:

Your code is a bit fuzzy and won't compile, but in principle yes, you can do all of that.
A callback is just a method that you can call manually if you need to. You can also create subscriptions whenever you want.
There is only one flaw in your code: The subscribers/publishers are declared locally, so once the function is done, they will be destroyed.

You say the code won't compile. Assuming you don't mean my example code (which indeed won't compile), can you please explain why ?

For example, you're assigning a publisher to the result of a subscribe call...
