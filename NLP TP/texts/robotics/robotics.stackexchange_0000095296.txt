Q:

How to use ROS on Windows 10

Hello, I am new in ROS.
I need to use ROS on Windows 10. I have installed ROS and I can run "rosrun".
I had followed this instruction http://wiki.ros.org/Installation/Windows . It works.
But I dont understand how to use packages which I need. For example, I need "libuvc_camera" or "usb_cam", "stereo_image_proc" and "rtab_map".
But I don't find any information about how to launch them using ROS on Windows.
Shall I compile them by myself?
Please, explain me what I need to do for make it works. Thanks.

Sorry for the delay in responding.
We have quite a bit of documentation on http://aka.ms/ros/docs which walk though the process of consuming ROS nodes.
There is a Windows specific Camera node, which is custom tailored for performance on Windows.
For ROS nodes without binary packages, you'll want to clone them into your workspace, and may have to do tweaks to build them. Here's a link to the docs consuming a package
If you have any problems, feel free to create an issue on https://github.com/ms-iot/rosonwindows.
