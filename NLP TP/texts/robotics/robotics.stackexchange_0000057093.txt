Q:

Knowrob_gui installation

I'm new to Knowrob. I would like to install also the semantic map editor, and I followed the guide.
Once I do rosmake knowrob_gui, I get many errors, like this:
      /home/lwr/Development/ros_workspace/ros/knowrob_gui/src/edu/tum/cs/ias/knowrob/map/SemanticMapEditorForms.java:589: cannot find symbol

            if(theControlEvent.getName().equals("rot_y")) {

A:

Hmm, do you use an up-to-date knowrob from github? The binaries are quite outdated and somewhat broken.
You'll need the 'complete' version from here if you want to use the GUI.

Hi @moritz, you're right. I installed the .deb version. Now with source installation seems working.
