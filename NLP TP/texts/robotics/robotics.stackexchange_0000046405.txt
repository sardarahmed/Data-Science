Q:

How to download roboearth from roboearth.rosinstall?

My roboearth.rosinstall:
  - svn:
      uri: https://ipvs.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/roboearth/repos/public/tags/latest
      local-name: roboearth
  - git:
      uri: http://robotics.ccny.cuny.edu/git/ccny-ros-pkg/ccny_vision.git
      local-name: ccny_vision
      version: master
  - svn:
      uri: https://tum-ros-pkg.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/tum-ros-pkg/knowledge
      local-name: knowledge
  - svn: 
      local-name: knowrob
      uri: http://code.in.tum.de/pubsvn/knowrob/tags/latest

When I run:

A:

As your error messages indicate, there is an SSL problem with SVN. I guess this is due to the self-assigned SSL certificate of the RoboEarth server. http://ros.org/wiki/roboearth gives some hints on how this may be solved (Section 2.1 callback_ssl_server_trust_prompt required error message).

I am having the same problem. I entered the command to accept the self-assigned certificate and it does not solve my problem. I am using ros groovy, I replaced /opt/ros/fuerte with /opt/ros/groovy/ . Sam, how did you solve your problem? Is Roboearth working with groovy yet?
Comment by moritz on 2013-09-02:
This problem is independent of RoboEarth and even of ROS, it's just an SVN problem. Try to call the command manually from the command line and follow the instructions at the given link to fix the issues. 'svn co  "https://ipvs.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/roboearth/repos/public/tags/latest" /home/sam/code/ros/cram/roboearth'
