Q:

What is the ROS roadmap?

Is there a roadmap of when new versions of ROS are expected to come out and what packages are expected to be included? For example, I have seen talk of Fuerte testing, but don't know when the code freeze is for final testing. If such a thing exists, suggest linking it to the front page of ros.org so others can find it easily.

A:

I agree this is not very easy to find, unless you already know where to look.
Some useful pointers:

REP-0003 Target Platforms
Fuerte planning
Fuerte release page
