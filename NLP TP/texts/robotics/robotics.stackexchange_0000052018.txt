A:

I am unsure of what you want. I guess you want it to start by itself, not wait until a button is pressed. In that case set the parameter "start_paused" to "false" in your launch file:
<param name="config/start_paused"                  value="false"/>

or use rosparam set /rgbdslam/config/start_paused false prior to starting rgbdslam.
