Q:

No definition of [libsensors4-dev] for OS [osx]

Hi guys,
I'm trying to install Ros Indigo on my macbook pro running OS X Yosemite. I'm following the instructions on the installation guide exactly, and everything runs smoothly until I have to run the following command:
$ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro indigo -y

which fails with this error:
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
diagnostic_common_diagnostics: No definition of [libsensors4-dev] for OS [osx]

I couldn't find a solution for this problem in the troubleshooting section of the installation guide, or anywhere else online. Does anyone know of a workaround for this?

A:

I think this is the result of the recent addition of the libsensors node to diagnostics: https://github.com/ros/diagnostics/pull/34
I've opened a ticket for this: https://github.com/ros/diagnostics/issues/36
As a workaround, you can remove the dependency on libsensors4-dev from the manifest in diagnostic_common_diagnostics and remove the build rules for the libsensors-monitor node from its CMakeLists.txt.

This should be fixed in the latest version of diagnostics, 1.8.7.
