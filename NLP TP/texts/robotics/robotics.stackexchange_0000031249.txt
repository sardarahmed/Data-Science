Q:

importing PIL into a rosnode

when I have the line
"from PIL import Image"
in a node, I get the following error when running my node via rosrun
"ImportError: No module named PIL"
of course, PIL is installed in
/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/site-packages/PIL
but is not an ROS library.  How can I change my manifest.xml to find PIL?  If I understand correctly, rosrun clobbers my existing PYTHONPATH (when running python I can import PIL just fine).

A:

I resolved it by explicitly putting PIL in my .bashrc's PYTHONPATH
oddly, however, python from the command line runs python 2.6.6, but rosrun on a python node somehow invokes python 2.6.1
