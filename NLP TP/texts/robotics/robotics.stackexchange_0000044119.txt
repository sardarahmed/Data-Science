Q:

Unable to include .model files for objects in .world file (for simulation) in Ubuntu 12.04 fuerte

Hi,
After installing Ubuntu 12.04 and fuerte (today), I am unable to launch most of my world file, which were running smoothly on electric on Ubuntu 11.10.
as per the error I think there is some new way to include  .model file of an object in the .world file. Kindly provide me the pointers for that.
To test (that error is not with my made .world and .model files), I included simple_office_table.world file from gazebo_world package.
The .model files are included as : (in simple_office_table.world file)

.
.
  <model:physical name="desk4_model">
    <xyz>2.28  -0.21  0</xyz>
    <rpy>0.0 0.0 0.0 </rpy>
    <include embedded="true">
<xi:include href="../objects/desk4.model" />
    </include>
  </model:physical>

  <model:physical name="desk5_model">
    <xyz>2.25  -3.0   0</xyz>
    <rpy>0.0 0.0 0.0 </rpy>
    <include embedded="true">
      <xi:include href="../objects/desk5.model" />
    </include>
  </model:physical>
.
.

and my launch file is

<launch>
  <arg name="use_sim_time" default="true"/>
  <arg name="gui" default="true"/>

  <group if="$(arg gui)">
    <node name="gazebo_gui" pkg="gazebo" type="gui" respawn="false" output="screen"/>
  </group>

</launch>

When I launch it in fuerte I get error saying Opening and ending tag mismatch, as:-

apart from the  harmless AttributeError as discussed at : http://answers.ros.org/question/34304/exception-attributeerror-when-starting-roscore/
A similar error is also posted at : http://answers.ros.org/question/29622/import-dae-gazebo-100-rc2/
Am I missing some small configuration or tags somewhere? Kindly help me out.

A:

No your fault, the parser does not work with <include> tags correctly, ticketed.  Thanks.
