Q:

"Are your messages built?" error from echoing that message (Groovy)

Hello, everyone,
I've followed the steps closely defined here
to create a custom message, editting my CMakeLists.txt, my package.xml, and my msg/data_logger_measurement.msg to create a new message.
I've been able to display the data with "rostopic echo /data_logger_measurement" in the past; however, now that I've rosbagged the data to revisit it a few weeks later, I cannot "rostopic echo /data_logger_measurement" when I'm playing a rosbag.
Instead, I get the error:
ERROR: Cannot load message class for [external_sensor_interface/data_logger_measurement]. Are your messages built?

The only changes that I can remember making are updating ROS when I performed a software update on Ubuntu.
Does anyone have any possible leads?  (I may have made a few other changes in the past few weeks to ROS, but I cannot currently remember them.)
Thanks very much in advance!

Can you roscd to your package from that shell? If not, your ROS environment is not set up correctly.

Ah, this has got to be the problem.  roscd won't tab-complete to that package.  Under the old flavor, I could just change my package path to fix this.  How do I resolve this in the Groovy?

There are several ways. The recommended approach is here: http://www.ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/Overlays

A:

Not sure if this will help you or not but I figured I might as well add...
I was having this same problem a couple of weeks back and here is what I learned:

Make sure that you have a package called "external_sensor_interface" that contains a msg directory with your "data_logger_measurement" msg defined there. This package should be on your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH (see http://ros.org/wiki/ROS/EnvironmentVariables). Changing it should look something like...
echo ROS_PACKAGE_PATH="/path/to/your/project/":$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

Build your messages - You need to edit your CMakeLists file (and you indicated that you already did this..) and rebuild your project. NOTE: This is where I was having problems - specifically with catkin. I switched my entire project to use rosbuild and I had smooth sailing from that point forward.

If all that worked correctly, you should be able to do,
rosmsg show data_logger_measurement

which will display your message details...From there you should be good to go.

Oops!  I forgot to source my setup.sh script in the devel folder.  Afterwards, my ROS_PACKAGE_PATH points to the right directory and the ROSBAG that I wanted to play will now display the data from data_logger_measurement.  Thanks everyone!

I did the #1. As for the #2 it does not work, but then again it does not work either for some messages that work correctly!
