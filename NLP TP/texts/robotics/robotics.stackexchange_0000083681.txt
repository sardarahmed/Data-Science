Q:

How to include remote machine "y.launch" and run it from local "x.launch"?

Cannot launch remote machine "launch" file from local machine. Is there a way to accomplish that?
<launch>
  <machine name="machine_y" address="192.168.1.130" env-loader="/opt/ros/fuerte/env.sh"/>
  <include file="/path/to/remote/y.launch" machine="machine_y"/> <!-- doesn't work -->
  <node pkg="package_y" name="package_y_name" machine="machine_y"/> <!-- works -->
</launch>

A:

I don't know if it's somehow possible using only launch files but it should be possible with bash scripts and ssh. Assuming we have local_bash.sh, remote_bash.sh scripts with local.launch and remote.launch launch files. To run local.launch on local and at the same time remote.launch on remote machine I would do something like this.
local_bash.sh:
roslaunch ros_package local.launch
ssh user@hostname 'bash -s' < remote_bash.sh

This will run remote_bash.sh script on your local host.
remote_bash.sh would then look like this:
roslaunch ros_package remote.launch

I thought that there is a way by using only launches. Thanks, though.
