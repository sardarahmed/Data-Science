Q:

Why do I need I-gain in my outer-loop?

I'm implementing a set of loops to control pitch-and-roll angular positions.
In an inner-loop, motor speeds are adjusted to achieve desired angular rates of rotation (the "inner-loop setpoints").
An outer-loop decides these desired angular rates (the "inner-loop setpoints") based on the aircraft's angular positions.

Outer-loop

Frequency = ~400Hz
Outer PV = input angular position (in degrees)
Outer SP = desired angular position - input angular position (in degrees)

Inner-loop

Frequency = ~760Hz
Inner PV = input angular rotation (in degrees-per-second)
Inner SP = constant1 * Outer MV (in degrees-per-second)
PWM = Inner MV / constant2 (as percentile)

I understand what I-gain does and why this is important, but I'm not able to see any practical reason for also having I-gain specified in the outer-loop. Surely the inner-loop would compensate for any accumulated error, leaving no error to compensate for in the outer-loop, or is my thinking flawed?
Any example gain values to elaborate would be greatly appreciated.

A:

In my own experience, it is not necessary Integral term in any of these loops. I got a fine PD tuning of both inner and outer loop. See for instance this paper, where I firstly tuned PD only with PSO. 
Wikipedia shows a simple animation of each of the effects of P-I-D in any tuning https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller#Manual_tuning.

A:

Integral gain is how you eliminate steady state error. An integral gain in the inner loop means you'll (eventually) have no steady state error on the angular velocity.
What ensures no steady state error on angular position, which is arguably the more important of the two? Outer loop integral error.
