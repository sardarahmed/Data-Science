Q:

hokuyo node can not see the laser scan in rviz

dbb@ubuntu-dbb:~$ rosrun rviz rviz -d `rospack find hokuyo_node`/hokuyo_test.vcg[ INFO] 
[ERROR] [1322120397.245512167]: No techniques available for material [PointCloudMaterial0Billboard]

[ WARN] [1322120397.466217922]: Message from [/hokuyo_node] has a non-fully-qualified frame_id [laser]. Resolved locally to [/laser]. 

This is will likely not work in multi-robot systems.
This message will only print once.
File radeon_swtcl.c function r100_swtcl_flush line 323
Rendering was 1 commands larger than predicted size. We might overflow  command buffer.

A:

The material errors you are getting is because Ogre (rendering engine of rviz) cannot render the pointcloud material on your graphics hardware. Maybe try upgrading your driver or your hardware. Alternatively you can try to change the material definition, maybe you find something that works with your hardware.
Check the Ogre.log file, it should contain more information on the error.
