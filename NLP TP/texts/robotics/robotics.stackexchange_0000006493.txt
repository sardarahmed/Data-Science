Q:

2 wheeled, 2 motor robot control

I decided to work on a 2 wheeled robot position mapping problem. For that I have 2 DC motors with encoders from pololu.
I have the following two questions:

Do I need to know the model of each motor in order to tune a controller?
What are the steps/approach used to get a good mapping (let's say 1 mm maximum error)?

A:

As Gouda mentioned, you cannot get any reasonable accuracy without knowing exactly how the control inputs translate to wheel movement. 
This is a very hard problem: Imagine knowing only that approximately 6 volts are being applied to each motor, but not knowing anything about the efficiency of the motors in converting this to torque, the friction of the gears which translate that torque to the wheel, or the friction of the wheels and the floor in translating that torque to movement. This goes on an on. I have never heard of this working, or even being attempted. 
Instead, encoders are used to measure the effect of the control inputs on the wheels, but counting how much the wheel rotates. This is called using odometry to estimate the path of the robot, and was answered here
