Q:

usarsim_inf not working with teleop_twist_keyboard

hello, I am trying to navigate a robot(P3AT) spawned in usarsim environment using keyboard from another computer where ros is installed, but its not working, please help me out, i tried a lot but can't figure out the mistake.
I am following these steps given below:-

In one terminal Run $roscore
Spawn a Robot in usarsim, for this i am following these steps:-

A. Start usarsim, which is in another windows machine.
B. In another ros terminal Run the the following command:
    $roslaunch usarsim_inf usarsim.launch

This spawns a P3AT robot in usarsim environment. and following output appears:-
    ... logging to /home/cr-lab-tu/.ros/log/e3f28b38-4729-11e4-959a-2c27d7efa01b/roslaunch-crlabtu-HP-Z800-Workstation-3277.log
    Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.
    Press Ctrl-C to interrupt
    Done checking log file disk usage. Usage is <1GB.

    started roslaunch server http://crlabtu-HP-Z800-Workstation:39055/

You've already asked this before. Please update your old question instead of asking a new question.

hello @ahendrix, in the old question i asked regarding teleop_twist_keyboard's issue with executive_usarsim package,
but in this question i asked that usarsim_inf not working with teleop_twist_keyboard.
so they are not the same question because they are dealing with different package.

A:

Please type following commands on the terminal window of PC2.
terminal-1:
    $ echo “source /opt/ros/fuerte/setup.bash” >> ~/.bashrc
    $ . ~/.bashrc
    $ sudo apt-get install python-rosinstall python-rosdep ros-fuerte-brown-remotelab ros-fuerte-control ros-fuerte-common-msgs ros-fuerte-slam-gmapping ros-fuerte-hector-slam
    $ rosws init ~/fuerte_workspace /opt/ros/fuerte
    $ echo “source ~/fuerte_workspace/setup.bash” >> ~/.bashrc
    $ mkdir ~/fuerte_workspace/sandbox
    $ source ~/fuerte_workspace/setup.bash
    $ rosws set ~/fuerte_workspace/sandbox
    $ source ~/fuerte_workspace/setup.bash
    $ roscd
    $ cd sandbox
    $ git clone git://git.assembla.com/usarsim.git
        (Under the proxy, try “git clone http://git.assembla.com/usarsim.git&#8221")
    $ rosmake usarsim_inf
    
    At this point if making usarsim_inf is successful, then use these steps,
    
    terminal-1: $ roscore
    terminal-2: $ export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:`pwd`
                    $ roslaunch usarsim_inf usarsim.launch
    terminal-3: $ rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py

now navigate using key. It works.

I think 'PWD' should use backticks instead of single quotes.
Comment by Aarif on 2014-10-14:

Comment by sumant on 2014-10-18:
yes @gvdhoorn it is
