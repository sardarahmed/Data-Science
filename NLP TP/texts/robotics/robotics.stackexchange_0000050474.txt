Q:

Trouble with winros installation

Hello guys,
I'm trying to install winros on Windows 7 (64 Bit) and have some trouble with the step "winros sdk configure" like described in http://www.ros.org/wiki/win_ros/Msvc%20Build%20Environment%20-%20Fuerte.
This is my console output:
"Configuring the build"

"You may now proceed with 'winros sdk build'"

The Problem is that there is only a "catkinConfig.cmake" in directory C:\work\build_sdk\catkin\catkin_generated\installspace but I'm guessing that this is not the right one because that file will be created by the build process which is started with "winros sdk configure". The advise to adjust CMAKE_MODULE_PATH to find Findcatkin.cmake is also not working for me because there exists no Findcatkin.cmake.
Has somebody experience with that problem?
Thanks

A:

Glad to see you got it working.
The navigation stack won't work out of the box - it's got a few dependencies we haven't ported yet (porting is a bit painful, not only the usual cross platform bugs, but each package needs to implement all of the windows declspec macros).
It's not too hard and I'm looking forward to the day people start porting some of the ros stacks themselves (some early notes here), but for now, the winros builds are primarily intended as a way to link your linux robot to the windows world, or a windows based driver.
Ubuntu virtual machine sounds like the way to go for you.

Thank you very much for your quick reply. I think I will go back to Ubuntu

@Daniel How do you appraise the work to port a stack like the navigation? Isn't it very hard and lots of work because of all the package dependencies?
Comment by Daniel Stonier on 2013-05-19:
It will still be easier and better running a 'linux ros robot' for many reasons. Because of this we're generally avoiding robot stacks and just working on those which will let you link and work with a 'linux ros robot'. e.g. rqt, tf etc.
