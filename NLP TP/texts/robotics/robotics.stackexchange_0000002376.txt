Q:

Kinect for Xbox: SDK selection

My application is basically about sound source localization and visual servoing. I selected Kinect as the main hardware.
I already know the basic differences between Kinect for Windows and Kinect for Xbox. I cannot access to windows version from my country (no reseller here in Turkey), but the xbox version is there at the stores. I am not sure about problem specific software selection.
I found out that the latest Kinect SDK supports sound source localization (and beamforming) using the built-in microphone array. Can I use that SDK within the xbox version? Or is there another SDK for xbox, having the same support? I am not sure because I also read that OpenNI does not provide the best audio API.
I will also apply some processing on image & depth outputs, so I will be using OpenCV. I also want to use Qt for threading, GUI etc. So, another question: Is it possible to use the microsoft official kinect SDK within another IDE, not Visual Studio?

A:

You can use all versions of the Kinect for Windows SDK, even with an Xbox-version. Some parts are limited and you require a Kinect for Windows in commercial scenarios (more information on my blog).
In your scenario you should be able to use the official Kinect for Windows SDK v1.8 to use the speech/sound scenario. If you are going to do speech/voice recognition, in this post I set up a basic version to controll my drone which should be the same.
You don't need to use VIsual Studio but C#/C++/VB.net require a compiler to run the code.
CONCLUSION - The official SDK will fit your needs, incl. support for speech/voice, but if you want to deploy the application in public you'll need the Kinect for Windows sensor for the public license.
