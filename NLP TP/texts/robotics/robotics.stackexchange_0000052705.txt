Q:

Is axis_camera working in groovy?

Is axis_camera working in groovy?
I did
git clone https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/axis_camera.git

but when running I get:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/tompe/ros_groovy_git/axis_camera/nodes/axis.py", line 13, in <module>
    import camera_info_manager
ImportError: No module named camera_info_manager

A:

Have you installed camera_info_manager_py? For instance, by doing sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-camera-info-manager-py?

No, I had not done that since "apt-file search camera_info_manager_py" only returned fuerte packages. This is annoying since I trust apt-file. I thought that the apt-file indexing was fixed...

After installing ros-groovy-camera-info-manager-py the server starts at least.

And the display of the image worked also. I am using an Axis P7214 Video Encoder.
