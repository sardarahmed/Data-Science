Q:

How to play rosbag using launch file?

I'm trying to play a bagfile using following launch file.
<launch>
  <node pkg="rosbag" type="play" name="rosbag" args="8tags.bag"/>
</launch>

However, it gave me an error like this when I launch it.
[FATAL] [1368634083.754058723]: Error opening file: 8tags.bag

A:

You have to explicitly give the path to the file, for example :
<node pkg="rosbag" type="play" name="player" output="screen" args="--clock /home/me/ros_files/my_file.bag"/> 

You can also use arguments, if you have multiple files to include
<arg name="path" default="/home/me/ros_files/" />
<arg name="file_1" default="my_file_1" />
<arg name="file_2" default="my_file_2" />
<node pkg="rosbag" type="play" name="player" output="screen" args="--clock $(arg path)$(arg file_1).bag $(arg path)$(arg file_2).bag"/> 

I hope it helped you. Go to this page to have more info on options you can use.
Have a good day,
Bests regards,

What does the --clock option do and if you want to specify a relative path, will it be relative to the package directory, or the launchfile directory?
