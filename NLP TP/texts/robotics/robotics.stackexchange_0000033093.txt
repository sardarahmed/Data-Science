Q:

Running processes on different machines causes md5sum incompatibility issue

Hi, I am trying to run the 'sr_control_gui' on a different machine to the rest of the system and I am getting this error:

[ERROR] [1311084061.470869449]: Client [/sr_control_gui] wants topic /object_manipulator/object_manipulator_pickup/result to have datatype/md5sum [object_manipulation_msgs/PickupActionResult/37706bf50c1b11b7802944213b641a54], but our version has [object_manipulation_msgs/PickupActionResult/f5b810c9cd81bc41f3d404d9b45717b9]. Dropping connection.

From what I understand of it, there is an incompatibility between the messages/topics being published by the different computers, manifesting as an issue with "md5sum"? How can I fix it?
Thanks in advance.

A:

I think you forgot to paste in the actual error. But anyway, the md5sum is a hash of the message and an md5sum mismatch means that the different machines are using different definitions for the same message type. Very likely this is because the message was modified but not compiled on one of the machines.
EDIT: What dornhege said, while I was typing mine. :) But still:
Note that this is a pretty common error and is mentioned on the Troubleshooting page; please have a good look there next time you run into trouble.
