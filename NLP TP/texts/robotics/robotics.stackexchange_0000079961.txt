Q:

Shall I use ROS plugins to make ROS communicate with my Library?

Hello all,
I am new to ROS and want to use it to communicate between the nodes of my own library. I want to know whether I shall create plugins to make it communicate with the parts of my library ?
for example https://nengoros.wordpress.com/ is a neural networks simulator and it uses ROS to make it communicate between it's modules(nodes). I am working on something similar but not sure whether I should use ROS plugins.
Any information will be helpful.
Thank you

A:

If I understood well what you need to do is having some c++ class that you need to use in your node. If this is the case simply use add_library in your CMakeList.txt to define your library with a name. Then, make sure you like your library to your node using target link libraries command.
If you need to share a C++ library in your environment so other packages can use it as well, u need to export your library.
