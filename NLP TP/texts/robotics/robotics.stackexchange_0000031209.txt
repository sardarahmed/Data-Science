Q:

getting click position from pcl_visualizer

Hi,
I wanted to get the coordinates where a user clicked inside the pcl_visualizer. Preferably, I would like to get the equation of the 3D line that corresponds to back-projection of the point  which was clicked.
Thanks,
Abhishek

You would probably get the best answers for this on the PCL mailing list.

A:

Unfortunately you can't get the coordinate of a single point using pcd_viewer in pcl_visualization.
