Q:

How to convert LaserScanner msgs to 2D cartesian cooridnates?

I'm trying to convert LaserScanner msgs to 2D vector(cartesian coordinates,(X,Y) pair) in C++ without using any library.Main problem is that I'm using a formula X=rcos(phi)  and Y=rsin(phi),and if ranges[i] is r,how can I find phi?

A:

The information is in the LaserScan message. You can angle_min for the start angle, and each range is angle_increment * i + angle_min for the phi.
