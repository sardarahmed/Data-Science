Q:

How to execute a ros callback just once

I want to subscribe to openni's "camera/rgb/camera_info" topic to get the camera matrix. Since the matrix doesn't change, I would like to execute the callback just once. How could I achieve this? Is the only way to unsubscribe? Or is it possible to use a ros service for this?
Regards,
Oier

A:

Since camera_info is published with every image frame, the simplest solution is to subscribe to it. In you message callback: collect the data, then unsubscribe.
It is possible your callback may run a few more times after you unsubscribe. Just to be safe, set a flag when you unsubscribe and return immediately if you get called again.

What is the reason for the callback running a few more times after unsubscribing?
