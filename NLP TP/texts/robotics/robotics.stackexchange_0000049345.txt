I think this is not a proper question for ROS Answers. By the way, I have a lot of ideas. If you invest 3 million dollars on me then I shall let you know.

A:

I think it's a reasonable question. The idea on the turtlebot was good - it just ran into the problem that development got terminated and there wasn't a scrap of documentation (except for browsing code) that explained how it worked.
We're actually currently moving towards that model ourselves and will be upgrading the idea of an appable robot over the next couple of months. Hopefully we'll land a prototype of it in hydro for turtlebot.
I'll be announcing a design review for it on ros users in the coming days. In the meantime, we've got some information on the ros wiki for the rocon_app_platform. Input would be welcome.

Hmmm... A robot is different from a PC or iPad because it is more specialized. Some robots need a good arm but just a wheelbase while others want good legs but simple arms, etc. So how to design a general-purpose app-able robot?

Dive into the available documentation and you will find out! :-) Don't miss to take a look at the concert. We will be happy to provide more information in case you have specific questions.
