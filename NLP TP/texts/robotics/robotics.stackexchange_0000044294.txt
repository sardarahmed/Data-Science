Q:

WARNING using viso2_ros mono_odometer: "The tf from '/base_link' to '/camera' does not seem to be available, will assume it as identity!"

Hi everybody,
I can run mono_odometer application properly, but I continue to get the warning showed in the title. How to fix it?
How can I set the tf from /base_link' to '/camera' ?
Kind regards.
Aldo

A:

Do you know the tf library? If not, read up on that.
You need to define a transform from /base_link to /camera, i.e. basically where it is mounted on the robot. If that is fixed, you can use a static_transform_publisher, otherwise define a URDF description.

I know how to create a tf object , but I don't know how to set it. In particularly, I don't know how to set base_link_frame_id tf of viso2ros.

Use a static_transform_publisher or create an urdf. You can also use a custom TransformBroadcaster if necessary.

ok, I've used roscd tf
./bin/static_transform_publisher 0 0 2 0.0 0.0 0.0 /base_link /camera 100

I'd advise to use rosrun. Also units are in meters, so 2 seems large (but might be correct)
