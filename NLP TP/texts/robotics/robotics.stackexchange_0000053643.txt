Q:

Unbound prefix error in xarco file

I am getting an unbound prefix error when I try to use an xarco macro. I do have the xmlns:xarco defined however. This is my xarco file:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<robot xmlns:xacro="[link to xarco wiki]" name="flexible">
  <xacro:macro name="test_macro" >
    <test name="x"/>
  </xacro:macro>

  <xarco:test_macro/>
</robot>

And this is the error I am getting:
Expat parsing error.  Check that:
 - Your XML is correctly formed
 - You have the xacro xmlns declaration: xmlns:xacro="[link to xarco wiki]"

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/hydro/share/xacro/xacro.py", line 60, in <module>
    xacro.main()
  File "/opt/ros/hydro/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/xacro/__init__.py", line 571, in main
    doc = parse(f)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/xml/dom/minidom.py", line 1920, in parse
    return expatbuilder.parse(file)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/xml/dom/expatbuilder.py", line 928, in parse
    result = builder.parseFile(file)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/xml/dom/expatbuilder.py", line 207, in parseFile
    parser.Parse(buffer, 0)
xml.parsers.expat.ExpatError: unbound prefix: line 7, column 6

Any help would be appreciated.

A:

There is a typo in the xml in the OP: <xarco:test_macro/> while it should be <xacro:test_macro/>. That could be the cause of the error.

This is it. Now I feel like I'm a dunderhead here...

Typos are always the hardest to spot.

This is the top Google result, so I'll add: I just had an xacro file give this error because the opening line was <robot name="foo"> instead of <robot xmlns:xacro="http://ros.org/wiki/xacro" name="foo">. Take note.
