Q:

GZWeb: Open and Save Worlds

Hi everyone,
I'm learning to use gzweb, the web client for Gazebo, and I'm quite a fan. However, it seems that documentation on it is rather lacking, and I can't figure out the simplest task. How can I open and save worlds on the server? Is there a way to open and save them from the web client, or does it have to be done on the server somehow?
Thanks!

A:

Opening worlds can only be done server-side via the command line for now. Starting gzserver like this for example:
gzserver <path>/my_world.world

For now, I think the only way to save the world is through gzclient. You can create your world on GzWeb, then open a gzclient on a new terminal and do File -> Save World As.
I just created an issue for saving worlds on GzWeb's client-side.
