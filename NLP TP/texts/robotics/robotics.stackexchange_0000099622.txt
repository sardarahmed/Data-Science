Q:

how to increase resolution of map in yaml file

Hello,
I am using rtabmap to get map of environment. For saving 2D projection of map I type:
rosrun map_server map_saver -f map

As a result I get a yaml file with a resolution is equal to 0.05. Is there a way to increase this resolution?
Thanks

A:

There's a parameter Grid/CellSize whose value can be modified from the default 0.05 (source code).
As stated in the documentation, call the node rtabmap with --params to show all available parameters.

I tried to launch rtabmap with Grid/CellSize parameter is equal to 0.05 and 0.5 but the resolution in the yaml file was the same for both cases.

The parameter may not be correctly set:
<node pkg="rtabmap_ros" type="rtabmap" name="rtabmap" args:="--delete_db_on_start --Grid/CellSize 0.1">
...
</node>

or
<node pkg="rtabmap_ros" type="rtabmap" name="rtabmap" args:="--delete_db_on_start">
   <param name="Grid/CellSize" value="0.1"/>
</node>
