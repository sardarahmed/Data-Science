Q:

answers.ros.org comment formatting

You used to be able to use backticks for inline code, * for italics and bold, and even name links in comments on this site, but lately, all of these characters just show up as literals in comments.
How can this be fixed?
EDIT
According to answer from @georgebrindeiro there is a github site for reporting these kinds of bugs.  Perusing that issue tracker revealed this bug report complaining about this same issue.  It was closed with the argument being that significant formatting isn't really expected in the comments.

A:

The proper way to deal with this is issue, I guess, is starting a new issue on GitHub.

Thanks for the link, I was unaware this site had a github.

No problem, I wasn't aware either until I made a similar question. By the way, most things in ROS have migrated to GitHub, so if you have any issue with the core libraries in ROS or infrastructure stuff (ROS answers, Wiki, etc), the best way to contact devs is through that channel.
