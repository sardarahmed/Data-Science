Q:

How can i do ROS -> Gazebo -> GUI communication

I want to do this kind of communication but i don't know how, there are some source codes that i can see? I know that ros can communicate with gazebo easily, but i want to return the gazebo informations to another node, as a GUI application.

yes, i saw these tutorials, what i'm trying to do is control the robot on ROS by teleoperation, make the robot move on gazebo and return the robot vision in another interface created by me (Like RVIZ), i need to know how ROS and gazebo do these communications.

Hey were you ever able to figure this one out?

A:

I'm afraid we'll need a little more detail about what you're trying to do in order to help you. Have you seen these tutorials?
