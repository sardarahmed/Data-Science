Q:

libpcan header files not found, where are they?

I need to compile some C++ with a libpcan.h include. According to the wiki libpcan is contained within cob-extern As I am using Ubuntu Precise I installed the ros-fuerte-cob-extern package. However it seems this does not include the required headers.
I then tried installing from the git repo but I get the following error when running the make file:
[rosbuild] Downloading https://code.ros.org/svn/release/download/thirdparty/peak-linux-driver-6.24.tar.gz to build/peak-linux-driver-6.24.tar.gz...Traceback (most recent call last): ... File "/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros/core/rosbuild/bin/download_checkmd5.py", line 28, in main urllib.urlretrieve(uri, dest) ... IOError: [Errno socket error] [Errno 1] _ssl.c:504: error:140770FC:SSL routines:SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO:unknown protocol make: *** [build/peak-linux-driver-6.24/unpacked] Error 1
Edit
The SSL error seems to be to do with me being behind a proxy. I hosted the tarball locally and changed the url and that worked.

A:

libpcan is downloading a tarball from code.ros.org. Are you sure you have internet access and code.ros.org is available from your location?
I just did a fresh checkout and successfull build on ubuntu 10.04, 11.10 and 12.04 for electric and fuerte.
