Now, I'm using ubuntu14.04 installed ros indigo. I found the package from    http://wiki.ros.org/vrpn_client_ros    and git clone the code form     https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/vrpn_client_ros.git    into my folder ~/catkin_ws/src. but when I run
catkin_make

,
it came to errors like ths:

A:

You are missing the vrpn dependency for the package.
You could install all dependencies for your workspace via rosdep (rosdep install --from-paths .)
Or you could just install debians, which will pull in dependencies automatically (sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-vrpn-client-ros). Is there a reason you want to run from source?

Thanks a lot! It works. I want to connect Optitrack and ROS together, and then connect to pixhawk, then fly quadrotor indoors, I don't know what to do next. Can you give me some advice?

I have kind of similar problem I tried to run catkin_make after cloning to catkin_ws and exporting it but I received this error

Running command: "make cmake_check_build_system" in "/home/kidus/catkin_ws/build"

Hi Paul, I am using ros lunar and met this error. I copied the source package into my workspace and catkin_make, the same error occurs. I tried to install the  VRPNConfig.cmake vrpn-config.cmake related package/library, but failed. DO you have any idea to solve this?
