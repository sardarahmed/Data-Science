Q:

Is there an implementation for move_base_msgs::MoveBaseAction for ros2?

Hi! Sorry for all mistakes, English is not my native language. So, I migrating my project from Noetic to Foxy and I have there code, that looks like this

typedef actionlib::SimpleActionClient<move_base_msgs::MoveBaseAction> MoveBaseClient;

And I have problems with understanding, how it should look on Foxy. There are no MoveBaseAction.h header for ros2, or at least I could't find it. I appreciate any help.

Hi. Sorry to disapoint, but no. I marked Nav2 as right answer because it is more or less what I was looking for, but, in the end, we simply using code that does not involve actionlib for now.

A:

Hi there, when using ROS2 you probably want to rely on Nav2(https://navigation.ros.org/). This is the "successor" of the ROS Navigation stack we had for ROS1.
Check ros1-to-ros2 for further information about changes in the navigation stack when moving from ros1 to ros2.
