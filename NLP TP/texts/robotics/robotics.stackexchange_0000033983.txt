This is well and truly an open research problem; reading the PCL tutorials could tell you what that library can do, but there's no cut-and-dried solution to this.

Why not, actually? I mean, it's a pretty common task, isn't it? There could be some baked solution for finding instances of cloud A in cloud B, returning their poses... (sorry for exhuming this old thread)
