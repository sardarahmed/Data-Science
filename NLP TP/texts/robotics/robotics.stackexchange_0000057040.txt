Q:

rosserial w/ Arduino Leonardo

I'm trying to use the rosserial_arduino package with an Arduino Leonardo but I keep getting the error:

[ERROR] Unable to sync with device; possible link problem or link software version mismatch such as hydro rosserial_python with groovy Arduino

whenever I try to run the serial_node.py from the rosserial package...
Can anybody please helpe me?!
Thanks in advance ;)

So, what about the version mismatch in the error message? What code is on the arduino and what are you running on the ROS machine? The actual workspace might be relevant (i.e. one built from source, one from system)

I'm using the rosserial version pulled directly from the repository at rosserial @ GitHub and I'm using the Hydro distribution for ROS. About the Arduino code, I'm compiling the source code against the generated compiled ros_lib libraries generated by the command:

rosrun rosserial_arduino serial_node.py ~/sketchbook/libraries

A:

I use some 32U4-based PCBs for test fixtures, prototypes, etc. Here's an example project which builds and downloads an example rosserial firmware to a Leonardo board:
https://github.com/mikepurvis/rosserial_leonardo_example
Note that this bypasses the Arduino IDE, assuming that you will use a text editor and catkin_make it from the command line. I also have a more generalized version of this example which I haven't got clearance to release yetâ€”if that's of interest to anyone, let me know and I can move things along with it.
