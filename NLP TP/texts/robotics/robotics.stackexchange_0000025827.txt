Q:

Audio and Speech in Gazebo

I am looking to better understand the audio capabilities (if any) in Gazebo. From the Wishlist, it sounds like Gazebo does not currently have the ability to hear any input from the world and respond to it (a la speech recognition). Is this correct? Additionally, does Gazebo allow the simulated robot to play sounds, or do any form of speech synthesis?

Speech synthesis/sounds for what audience? E.g are you referring to speech/sounds that another simulated robot can hear? Or are you referring to sounds that a human at a computer somewhere can hear (that's generated by a robot in gazebo)?

That would be great, indeed.

A:

There is an OpenAL branch in Gazebo that implements this feature. It will be distributed in gazebo-1.10.0
