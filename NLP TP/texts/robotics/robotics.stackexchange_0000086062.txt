Q:

Gmapping and Navigation Stack

Can Gmapping alongside with Nav Stack be used for navigating the robot while avoiding obstacles?
If so, is there any source code that can make life easier?
thanks

A:

Yes, you can do this -- Gmapping basically replaces AMCL (you should not run both at the same time, it will seriously mess with your TF). As for "source code" -- it's really a series of launch file changes (remove the amcl node, add gmapping), which will depend entirely on the robot you are using.
