Q:

Multi-threading

Hi all,
I'm running Ubuntu on a 12-core machine. I was wondering whether there's any sort of automatic multi-threading support built into ROS. For instance, if I'm running two packages at the same time, will they be executed on different threads? If it's not automatic, is there a parameter I can set to enable it?
Thanks

A:

Each node or nodelet executes on a separate thread, and hence can run on a separate core. There are also internal ROS threads for handling incoming messages or service requests. A large ROS system with many nodes can easily use 12 cores effectively.
Note that nodes and nodelets belong to packages, but some packages provide C++ libraries or Python packages, which are only multi-threaded if programmed appropriately.

Note that each node is actually a separate process (except in the case of nodelets), which is good for parallelism.
