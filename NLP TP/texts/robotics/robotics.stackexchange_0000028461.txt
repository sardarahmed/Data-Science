Q:

textures in an imported mesh?

There is a simple way to add the textures to a mesh? I have imported few models form 3dwarehouse, when I export them to .dae, I get the mesh that I can correctly use in Gazebo , but of course without the textures. It is any easy way to "attach" the textures to my models? I use Gazebo 7.

Those are good answers. There's some information in this tutorial about textures too.

Thanks for the answer!These links show how attach a texture to a 3d mesh, but I have another problem (And I think this can be solve easily, or at all). If I have a model (.dae) and two textures (for example in a tree, I have e texture for the leaves and another for the branches/trunk). It is not possible to set it rigth in Gazebo , if the tree 3D mesh is imported as one file, rigth?

@Mansan you may be able to accomplish some of that using Ogre scripts (there's a small example of a texture being applied 4 times to different sides of a cube in the link @sloretz shared). That's the only thing I could think of (no idea if possible).
