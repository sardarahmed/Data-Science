Q:

Compiling error on microstrain_3dmgx2_imu package

Hi all,
I'm using electric, with Ubuntu 11.10.
I've recently downloaded the stack imu_drivers (version 1.3.1) and I've done:
 $ rosdep install microstrain_3dmgx2_imu

 All required rosdeps installed successfully

 $ rosmake microstrain_3dmgx2_imu

and I get the followig error:
...
/home/andreu/rosSw-extra/imu_drivers/microstrain_3dmgx2_imu/imu_node.cc: In member function ‘void ImuNode::getData(sensor_msgs::Imu&)’:
/home/andreu/rosSw-extra/imu_drivers/microstrain_3dmgx2_imu/imu_node.cc:450:6: error: ‘Matrix3x3’ is not a member of ‘tf’
/home/andreu/rosSw-extra/imu_drivers/microstrain_3dmgx2_imu/imu_node.cc:453:5: error: ‘Matrix3x3’ is not a member of ‘tf’
...
Has anyone compiled successfully this package under electric+Ubuntu11.10 ?
Thanks !
Andreu

A:

Why not install the imu_drivers from debs? sudo apt-get install ros-electric-imu-drivers
I suspect that newer versions of the imu drivers use the Fuerte tf API; the last version of the imu drivers that was released into electric is 1.2.4

Yes; you can infer the package name by replacing underscores in the package name with dashes, and prepending ros--. You can also search for deb packages with the package manager, such as 'apt-cache search imu-drivers' or 'apt-cache search ros-electric'

THanks ! Installing the deb pkg works fine. But, from the ros stack name, how do you infer the deb package name ? Is there a common rule for ros that changes from "aa_bb" ros-stack name to "ros-electric-aa-bb" deb-pkg name ? THanks again !
