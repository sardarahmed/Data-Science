Q:

Does bebop_autonomy also support the new Parrot Bebop 2?

I'm thinking about getting one of these and would like to know this.
Has anyone tried it yet?
Or does anyone know if the SDK changed in comparison to the Bebop 1 and if yes, are there any major changes that would delay support?
If not, how long does it usually take to support something like this?
The package and Github don't mention anything about it yet.
For reference: http://www.parrot.com/products/bebop2/

A:

The current version of bebop_autonomy (v 0.3) does support both Bebop 1 and 2 (everything works). This version is based on SDK v 3.6. The latest version of the SDK (v 3.7.5) does not support the video stream of Bebop 2 (per its documentation), but I guess this is going to be resolved soon. Whenever Parrot releases a new SDK that supports both Bebop versions (again), I will update bebop_autonomy to build against the latest SDK.
