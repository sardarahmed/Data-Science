Q:

Combined msgs into custom msgs

Hello,
I'm trying to combine 3 different msgs into a single one. I'd like to create a msg only with the fields required for my application and after that publish this msg into a topic. Anyone knows how can I do that?
Thanks
J.L.

I'd like to put some fields used in Imu msgs and GPS msgs in one message, like, mySensorsMsg. Did you understand? Maybe your first link will help me! Thanks!
