Q:

(Solved) How can i solved: Deprecated syntax, please prepend 'hardware_interface/'?

Hello everyone.
I am trying to display my model robot in gazebo and get this warning:
Deprecated syntax, please prepend 'hardware_interface/' to 'PositionJointInterface' within the  tag in joint 'joint_base'.
I know it's not important but I want to solve it.
This is my code in the xacro file of the transmission block:
<xacro:macro name="transmission_block" params="joint_name">
  <transmission name="tran1">
    <type>transmission_interface/SimpleTransmission</type>
    <joint name="${joint_name}">
      <hardwareInterface>PositionJointInterface</hardwareInterface>
    </joint>
    <actuator name="motor1">          
      <mechanicalReduction>1</mechanicalReduction>
    </actuator>
  </transmission>

</xacro:macro>

Hi, I have the same warning, but when I append "hardware_interfase/" I receive this:
No matching hardware interface found for 'hardware_interfase/EffortJointInterface' while loading interfaces for pitch_joint

A:

As you said, it is just a warning and doesn't break anything. To stop the message, simply follow the warning message to get:
<hardwareInterface>hardware_interface/PositionJointInterface</hardwareInterface>

I have a related issue. My transmission is set up as

 
    transmission_interface/SimpleTransmission
    
      EffortJointInterface
    
    
      EffortJointInterface
      1

And this is the error I get Could not find resource 'waist' in 'hardware_interface::EffortJointInterface'.. I can't figure out what's causing that despite looking everywhere.
