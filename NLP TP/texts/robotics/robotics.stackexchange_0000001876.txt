Q:

Depth map with Raspberry Pi

Is it possible to get two images from the Raspberry Pi camera mounted on a remote controlled bot and have them sent to a computer through Wi-Fi and process the images in the computer to generate a depth map?
All this is to be done in a very short time so that the robot can be helped with its locomotion without making it completely autonomous.

A:

Yes, it is possible. This is a form of stereo vision. You will need an accurate model of how the robot moved between frames. Then you can use stereo vision techniques to calculate the disparity.
