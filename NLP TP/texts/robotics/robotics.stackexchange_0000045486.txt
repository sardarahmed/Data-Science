A:

Yes. Models (robots included) are all able to be moved.
Manipulation plugins and actors in SDF-land and controllers in urdf-land.
You should take a look at the gazebo wiki in general. Every week it is getting more complete.
Assuming that your 3D hand has joints, there is a tutorial on the wiki that shows how to do joint animation. There is also the option of pose animation as well.
Hope this helps.
