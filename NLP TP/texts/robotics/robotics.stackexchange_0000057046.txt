A:

The hector_geotiff package provides a node for saving RoboCup Rescue compliant GeoTiff files. This is separate package from hector_mapping to facilitate separation and re-use. It could for example also be used together with gmapping (or any other source of grid maps). See also this paper for a high level overview and the geotiff_mapper.launch launch file for an example launch setup. This is also used in the hector_mapping tutorial.launch.
