Q:

kforgeproject.com down

I don't know if this is really something for answers.ros.org, but kforgeproject.com is down for at least 2 months now. Is the project discontinued?

Did you mean kforge.ros.org? Is kforgeproject.com a ROS-related site?
Comment by joq on 2012-07-11:
I think it's the source of the software kforge.ros.org is based on.
Comment by Eric Perko on 2012-07-11:
Ah indeed it appears to be.

A:

The DNS address is up, but the web site seems to be misconfigured.
You could try contacting the webmaster about getting it fixed.

well, that was my first thought. However, there is no address of the webmaster on the error page...
