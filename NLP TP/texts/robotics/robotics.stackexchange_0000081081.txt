Q:

ERROR: can't locate node in package [gazebo_ros]

Hello~ I'm new in ROS and am learning it by the tutorials.However,there were some errors when I followed the  Tutorial: Using a URDF in Gazebo.
Everthing is normal until I ran the the command:
roslaunch rrbot_gazebo rrbot_world.launch

However, it seems I can start gazebo  by command line.

I have tried sudo apt-get install --reinstall ros-indigo-gazebo-ros,but it didn't work.
This is all the files I have in /opt/ros/indigo/lib/gazebo_ros/.Is there anything wrong?

Thanks a lot for your help!

How did you install gazebo_ros -- from source or from apt-get? What does rospack find gazebo_ros return?
Comment by Richardaria on 2017-05-31:
It returns this:
/opt/ros/indigo/share/gazebo_ros
Should I reinstall Gazebo?

You could certainly try sudo apt-get install --reinstall ros-indigo-gazebo-ros although, that wouldn't explain what went wrong in the first place. Do you have the missing executables in /opt/ros/indigo/lib/gazebo_ros/ (that's where they should get installed)?

I tried   sudo apt-get install --reinstall ros-indigo-gazebo-ros  .However,the same problem still exist.
I have attached a screenshot of all the files I got in /opt/ros/indigo/lib/ga zebo_ros/. Is there any problem?
Thanks for your help!

If that works, then there is likely something wrong with your workspace. Try deleting the build/ and devel/ directories and then re-running catkin_make

Also, as a side note, please stop posting images to show information that is fundamentally text (list files in a directory, error messages, terminal commands, etc.). Images are not searchable nor are they copy/paste-able. Please post this type of thing using the preformatted text button.

It works just as you said.Thanks a lot. It seems that I have installed gazebo twice.I'm not very familiar with the editor of this website, learning and improving. Thanks for you advice.

Is your original question resolved? Can you now run your rrobt launch file?

A:

Do you maybe have an additional copy of gazebo_ros in your workspace? Try using rosrun to manually start one of the missing nodes: (i) start roscore (ii) source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash to use just the base install (deactivates your workspace)  (iii) rosrun gazebo_ros gzserver
