Q:

Use rqt plugins as widgets in a "bigger" GUI

Is it possible to widget-like embed rqt plugins in a "bigger" GUI with robot-specfic parts? The "bigger" GUI might also be a rqt plugin..

A:

Not completely sure if I understand your question.
rqt_plugins are using the rqt_gui API to add widgets to the main window.
You could replicate this API and call the plugins with your own API instance to make them add widgets to your GUI.
But why? Rqt allows for arranging multiple plugin widgets...
