Q:

c++11 library for indigo catkin package

Hi,
I have a library (a server using std::thread and some other c++11 things like auto) which is compiled into mylib.a.
I want to use this library in my indigo catkin ros node. But apparently ROS is c++03 only for now.
Do I have to rewrite the library to c++03? Or can I use it as long as the ros node itself stays c++03 compatible?

As far as I know they are not ABI compatible.

My experience has been that basic things like the std::vector and std::string are not ABI-compatible between c++03 and c++11, so mixing code compiled by different c++ versions is a bad idea.

A:

I'm getting weird linker errors when testing to build a simple catkin package with this library and c++11 enabled in the compiler. So it won't work then. Thanks for the responses.
