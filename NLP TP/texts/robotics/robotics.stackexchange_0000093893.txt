Q:

[ROS2] What is the "rqt --force-discover" option meaning?

Hello, experts.
My environment is Ubuntu 18, ROS2 Crystal.
I installed the rqt-graph plugin to debugging.
But, I can't find out the plugin on rqt-gui.
In normal case, It should to be on "Plugins->introspection->Node Graph".
After $ rqt ---force-discover, it is working now.
Further, other plugins come out on "Plugins" tap.
What is the "rqt --force-discover" option meaning?
The description, written on the rqt usage guide, said below.
"--force-discover      force a rediscover of plugins"
Do you explain "rediscover" progress meaning?

Please remember to only ask the question once

A:

The list of available plugins is cached for one day (https://github.com/ros-visualization/qt_gui_core/blob/bccb8a2066116f105a9765146576bdedaf174263/qt_gui/src/qt_gui/plugin_manager.py#L61) to speed up repeated invocation of rqt. If plugins are added within that period they don't show up automatically since the cached information is used.
Passing --force-discover will invalidate the existing cache and ensures that the list of available is queried again (which takes a little bit of time, depending on the size of the ROS installation up to a few seconds).
