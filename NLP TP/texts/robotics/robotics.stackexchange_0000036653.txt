Q:

snapshotting rxgraph

Since I believe there must have been discussion about this topic already but haven't found sound solution/workaround so far, now I ask.
What would be better way to preserve rxgraph output than just taking screenshot image file, when the graph gets large? My concern is as follows but not limiting to them:

All nodes appear in a file?
Name of nodes legible?
Topic name along with the connection b/w nodes legible?

What I do always is not the best at all. Take a screenshot of the whole graph and magnify on image viewers (for sharing purpose I use picasaweb often). Apparently I need better solution. Thanks.

A:

You could use the -o option to have it dump to a dot file and then you can render it afterwords using your preferred dot renderer such as graphviz.
I don't know the specific timing of the writing of the dot file, I would expect it to do so immediately after receiving the graph description from the master.

I have used the dot file output before. If you save it in .svg format then you can create a .png with arbitrarily high resolution (up to a reasonable amount) so that everything is legible.
