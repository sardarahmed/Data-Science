Q:

usb_cam on ubuntu 11.10

I want to use usb_cam on ubuntu 11.10 and ROS electric.
when I use rosmake usb_cam --rosdep-install, it says:
Failed to find rosdep libswscale for package usb_cam on OS:ubuntu version:oneiric
while I check libswscale, libswscale-dev and libswscale2 were installed in my system.
any ideas to solve this error?
