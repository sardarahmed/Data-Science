Q:

hector slam and arduino help please

hi,
i install ros kinetic on raspberry pi3 and i configure kinect with hector slam and all work well.
now i want to impl√©mante arduino to make a robot with 2 wheels, i install rosserial and i don't know how can i relate hector slam with arduino to control motors.
i know that hector slam provide odometry.
can you help me please? i don't know how can i control motors with hector slam

A:

Hector_slam is used for mapping, not autonomous control. You could try taking a look at hector_exploration_planner.
Normally the way it works is a path planner will publish a set of velocities for the robot as a whole. You will need to write a node that will use the inverse kinematic equations for your particular robot to determine the individual wheel velocities required to achieve the desired motion.

thanks, i write a node arduino that publish rpm and subscribe to cmd_vel with ros serial, and i can control my robot with teleop_twist_keyboard. and also i create a package with hector slam that visualise a map.
now i want to add odometry to hector_slam for autonomous mapping .
what can i do please?

Hector_slam does not require odomtry

so what can i do please? i dont found explication on hector navigation

Ok, so you've built a map using hector_slam and now you want to autonomously drive around that map? Is that right?

nn i can build a map with hector slam but i move kinect with my hand.
now i create a robot with 2 motors and arduino (i can controle manually motors with teleop_twist_keyboard) and i want to navigate with this motor autonomously to create a map.
can you help me for this?

@Emilien I replied to you on another similar post you created.
@Icehawk101 Youve helped me before and i really appreciate your help. Could you please provide your insight on a couple things on hector navigation please?
