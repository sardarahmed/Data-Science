Q:

Problem Installing Gazebo from debian

Hi All,
Forgive me if this is a very simple beginners mistake, I am likely just missing something obvious.
After having installed ROS and been through the tutorials, my next task is to get the PR2 simulator up and running so that I can start playing with simulated robots to learn more about ROS.
I have found the Gazebo tutorial here:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/simulator_gazebo/Tutorials/StartingGazebo
But am running into a problem with the following command:
~$ rosdep install gazebo_worlds
Warning: could not identify ['gazebo_worlds'] as a package
So I tried installing teh Gazebo stack (in case it was missing) and this is what I get:
~$ sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-simulator_gazebo
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-diamondback-simulator_gazebo
I am running Ubuntu 10.10, have checked my PATH (it is set as per the ROS tutorials) and am still left scratching my head.
Your help is appreciated.

when doing apt-get install, replace all underscores with dashes, i.e. sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-simulator-gazebo.

A:

To answer my own question (for the benefit of anyone else that might run into this):
Some of the packages had not installed correctly.
I redid the installation of diamondback_desktop_full to pick up any missing packages that I had assumed were there and then used synaptic package manager to install the Gazebo packages I was after.
All commands now work :-)

Remember to be careful about under scores versus dashes '_' vs '-'  In debian packages they are different than the ROS name.  (switch to dashes)
