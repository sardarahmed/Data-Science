Q:

Installing turtlebot software on beagleboard

Hello I am trying to install turtlebot software on beagleboard so that i can use beagleboard rather then Laptop in turtlebot, its just a try to implement FASTSLAM1.0, I installed ubuntu and ROS on beagleboard from source, Is there any way to install Turtlebot from source.
The particular error is:

W: Failed to fetch http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu/dists/natty/Release  Unable to find >>expected entry 'main/binary-armel/Packages' in Release file (Wrong sources.list entry or >>malformed file)

E: Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.

Is it good practise to use beagleboard on turtlebot instead of a high power and high processing laptop for implementing FASTSLAM1.0?

A:

#Installing ROS Diamondback turtlebot-robot variant on BeagleBoard xM running Ubuntu 11.04 from Source
This is a work in progress and is only meant to supplement the existing TurtleBot tutorials.
Install Ubuntu packages on BeagleBoard xM
sudo apt-get install build-essential python-yaml cmake subversion wget python-setuptools mercurial
Install rosinstall
sudo easy_install -U rosinstall
Install ROS diamondback variant turtlebot-robot:
rosinstall ~/ros "http://packages.ros.org/cgi-bin/gen_rosinstall.py?rosdistro=diamondback&variant=turtlebot-robot&overlay=no"
Set up your environment.
echo "source ~/ros/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
Use rosmake to build the various ROS and TurtleBot packages:
I am still working on the best way the make all the necessary packages.
You may want to install the following Ubuntu packages in advance:
sudo apt-get install python-serial libglut3-dev libcppunit-dev graphviz libxext-dev python-sip-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev unzip libxml2-dev python-wxgtk2.8 libqhull-dev libhdf5-serial-dev joystick libusb-1.0-0-dev flex autoconf libusb-dev automake bluez bison python-bluez libgtk2.0-dev libbluetooth-dev
Missing packages from Ubuntu natty arm repositories:
The openni-dev, ps-engine (I'm sure that there are others) packages are not currently available from Ubuntu natty arm repositories. Without these packages the Kinect does not work but you can drive the TurtleBot around using the keyboard or joystick.
