A:

Indeed the installation tutorial for MoveIt! Indigo is outdated. Thank you for catching that.
ros-indigo-moveit-full was recently removed for all ROS Indigo/Jade/Kinetic. From the next release of Indigo, which is planned soon, you'll be able to install ros-indigo-moveit that includes moveit_kinematics.
If you're really in hurry so that you can't wait for another few days, you can already install them from Shadow Repository.

UPDATE: Opened a PR to update the installation tutorial.

UPDATE 20170105 MoveIt! maintainers realized that removing ros-indigo-moveit-full broke existing usecases. So it's released back again and will become available on shadow repo soon and on official public repo at the next public sync (the one that was like this announcement).

Currently I can't run sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-moveit nor sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-moveit-full. I tested it on multiple mashines.
Is this still a problem with the official public repo or is it something on my side?

Looking at the package status on buildfarm, moveit seems released without issues. moveit_full will become available on the next public release (watch this thread or similar).

@F4bich, I have the same problem. sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-moveit is not being located.

@F4bich @bhavyadoshi26 I've opened a ticket for discussing the issue more. Please consider providing more info there.
