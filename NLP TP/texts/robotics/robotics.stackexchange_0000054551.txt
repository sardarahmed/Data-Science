Q:

dynamic_reconfigure exception when used with groups

When running
rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure

And selecting my node, I get the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/groovy/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rqt_reconfigure/node_selector_widget.py", line 250, in _selection_changed_slot
    self._selection_selected(index_current, rosnode_name_selected)
  File "/opt/ros/groovy/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rqt_reconfigure/node_selector_widget.py", line 200, in _selection_selected
    item_widget = item_child.get_dynreconf_widget()

  File "/opt/ros/groovy/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rqt_reconfigure/param_groups.py", line 153, in __init__
    self._create_node_widgets(config)
  File "/opt/ros/groovy/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rqt_reconfigure/param_groups.py", line 199, in _create_node_widgets
    widget = eval(_GROUP_TYPES[group['type']])(self.updater, group)
  File "/opt/ros/groovy/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rqt_reconfigure/param_groups.py", line 248, in __init__
    super(BoxGroup, self).__init__(updater, config)
TypeError: __init__() takes exactly 4 arguments (3 given)

And indeed checking the python scripts, BoxGroup does call the super constructor with one argument too few. My config file looks something like this:
PACKAGE="my_package"
from dynamic_reconfigure.parameter_generator_catkin import *

gen = ParameterGenerator()

debug = gen.add_group("Debugging Utilities Left Image Based")
debug.add("dbgShowFeatures",                        bool_t,     0, "Show all detected features",            True) # online
debug.add("dbgShowNMSFilteredFeatures",             bool_t,     0, "Show stable (non maximum suppressed)",  True) # online
debug.add("dbgShowBest3kFeatures",                  bool_t,     0, "Show best 3000 features",               True) # online

exit(gen.generate(PACKAGE, "dynamic_reconfigure_node", "Foo"))

How can I fix this problem? I'm on ROS Groovy, 32 Bit Ubuntu 12.04

A:

UPDATE Grouping was added back in late 2014.

Grouping in rqt_reconfigure is not yet implemented and a ticket is already opened.

Thanks Isaac, that is unfortunate, but good to know.
