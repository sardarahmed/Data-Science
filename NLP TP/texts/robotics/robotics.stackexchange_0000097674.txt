Q:

Is it possible to change the logger without building ROS packages (ROS2)

Is it possible to change the logger, spdlog to log4cxx, without having to rebuild individual ros packages?

A:

Unfortunately you'll need to rebuild rcl. rcl picks the logger to use at compile time, which by default is rcl_logging_spdlog.
Add rcl_logging_log4cxx and rcl to your workspace, then choose the logging implementation by setting the environment variable RCL_LOGGING_IMPLEMENTATION.
export RCL_LOGGING_IMPLEMENTATION=rcl_logging_log4cxx
colcon build --cmake-clean-cache --packages-select rcl_logging_log4cxx rcl
