Q:

How to read tactile sensor data from gazebo?

I am working on a small project where I have to develop a custom control plugin and test it on gazebo simulation. In my Gazebo robot model I am using sr_tactile-sensors, Now I need to use that sensor output in my custom control plugin, can anyone suggest me how to do that ? I am quite new to qazebo. I am writing my control plugin in python. Would be really helpful if you can point me in the direction where I can find details about the same, I have been trying to google it myself. Thanks in advance.

If you check the sr_tactile_sensors wiki page, it shows what topics that package publishes. Is that what you're asking or are you asking how to subscribe to those topics?

yea exactly, I am asking how to subscribe them

You should go through the beginner tutorials and see if this helps. If it doesn't, then please update your question with a copy and paste of your code and any errors that may arise, along with what you don't understand.

Thank you for the tutorial. Although I have seen it before, I have not understood how to write the similar listener for sr_tactile_sensors, so as far as I understand i should import sensor_msgs package and then the specific sr_tactile_sensors package aswell and then use those pre-defined commands to access the sensor data ? or should I write a specific  code for it ? I have not startd writing the code for this particular part as I am still confused and did not know where to start this. Thank you in advance.

A:

There are a set of tutorials on the sr_tactile_sensors wiki page that may help you. For example, there's one that shows how to subscribe to the /sr_tactile/touch/ff topic. It's in C++ so I made a Python version of it (that's been combined with the subscriber tutorial:
#!/usr/bin/env python

import rospy
from std_msgs.msg import Float64

def callback(msg):
    # log the message data to the terminal
    rospy.loginfo("The value is %d", msg.data)

def listener():
    # start the node
    rospy.init_node("listener")
    # subscribe to the '/sr_tactile/touch/ff' topic
    tactile_sub = rospy.Subscriber("/sr_tactile/touch/ff", Float64, callback)
    # keep python from exiting until this node is stopped
    rospy.spin()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    listener()
