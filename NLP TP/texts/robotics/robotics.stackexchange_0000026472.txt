Q:

Gazebo model of a car with Ackermann steering

Hi,
I'm looking for a gazebo model of a car, more exactly a car with Ackermann steering. I know that there is a utility_cart model, but I'm looking for something which has more details (particularly around the front axis).
Thanks,
Alex

A:

The drc_vehicle model in the drcsim repository has Ackermann steering implemented in the DRCVehiclePlugin with PID controllers. I would be happier if the steering model used a mechanical linkage, but it works ok. There's some tutorials on driving it here.
