Q:

Rosmake openni_camera on fuerte fails

I'm trying to make the openni_camera-fuerte-devel package, but it fails. Here is the output:

How can I fix this problem? Unfortunately, I do not have sudo privileges to install the package.

Alright, so I found a computer on which I had root access, so no need to answer my question.

A:

It needs to be in a folder named openni_camera not openni_camera-fuerte-devel. The package name is determined by the folder name.  Thus it cannot find openni_camera.
