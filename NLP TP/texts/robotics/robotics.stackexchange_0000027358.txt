Q:

Is it possible to use variables in sdf file?

I am in such a situation that I want to create the same type of robots in gazebo sharing one sdf file. The only differences are robots' name. So can I use a string array robot_name[index], for example, to replace the model name tags in sdf in my code using option 2 as this tutorial suggests. Or do you have any better solutions?

I found the answer recently. I could use Ruby. Read these links:
