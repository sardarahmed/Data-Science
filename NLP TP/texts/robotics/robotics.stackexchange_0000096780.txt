Q:

[ROS2] Failed to load entry point 'launch'

Hi,
I wanted to start my launch file from command line with following command
ros2 launch <pkg_name> <file>

now i got this error:
Failed to load entry point 'launch': cannot import name 'get_typed_value' from 'launch.frontend.type_utils' (/home/lwnmil2/develop_ws/install/launch/lib/python3.8/site-packages/launch/frontend/type_utils.py)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/foxy/bin/ros2", line 11, in <module>
    load_entry_point('ros2cli==0.9.7', 'console_scripts', 'ros2')()
  File "/opt/ros/foxy/lib/python3.8/site-packages/ros2cli/cli.py", line 39, in main
    add_subparsers_on_demand(
  File "/opt/ros/foxy/lib/python3.8/site-packages/ros2cli/command/__init__.py", line 236, in add_subparsers_on_demand
    extension = command_extensions[name]
KeyError: 'launch'

When I open the help of the ros2 command the same error message is shown and there is no entry for the ros2 command:
ros2 -h

    Failed to load entry point 'launch': cannot import name 'get_typed_value' from 'launch.frontend.type_utils' (/home/lwnmil2/develop_ws/install/launch/lib/python3.8/site-packages/launch/frontend/type_utils.py)
usage: ros2 [-h] Call `ros2 <command> -h` for more detailed usage. ...

Seeing the same issue, I don't have a package called launch though
it was working previously in my environment before but then stopped and i'm not sure what changed. test is also not being found. I've tried initializing my workspace and packages from scratch but still have the same issue

A:

I had a package called launch in my develop workspace so ROS had a name conflict
I removed it and now it works
