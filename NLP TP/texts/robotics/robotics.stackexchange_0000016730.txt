Q:

Transformation matrix between a 2D and a 3D coordinate system

I have 2 sensors : one has 2D coordinate system and the other has a 3D coordinate system (not same origin). 
Knowing the positions of some corresponding target points (used as fixed reference) in both coordinate systems,

How can I get the transformation matrix T (Rotation, translation and scaling) that would map the 3D point P3D to a 2D point P2D?  So that : P2D = T * P3D.

A:

You need two things.

A transformation from 3D device coordinate to 2d device coordinate.
$$p_{C}=T*p_{L}$$
Projective matrix
$$u_{C}=P*p_{C}$$
u is 2D location and p is 3D location.

To find 1 you need to do a 3D device to 2d device calibration. The method depends on your sensor configuration. Projective matrix can be found from your camera model.
