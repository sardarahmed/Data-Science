Q:

turtlebot3 : Traffic Sign Detection Problem

Hi,
I'm following the steps of Autonomous Driving and I've a problem with Traffic Sign Detection, when i launch this command:
roslaunch turtlebot3_autorace_detect detect_sign.launch mission:=SELECT_MISSION
(and i got it with all missions, intersection for example)
I got this error :
----------------------------------------
 roslaunch turtlebot3_autorace_detect detect_sign.launch mission:=intersection

A:

You probably installed cv2 via pip, which does not contain any non-free modules.
This topic is discussed there:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37039224/attributeerror-module-object-has-no-attribute-xfeatures2d-python-opencv-2
People propose the use of:

Uninstall:

pip3 uninstall opencv-contrib-python
pip3 uninstall opencv-python

And then install:

pip3 install opencv-contrib-python
pip3 install opencv-python
