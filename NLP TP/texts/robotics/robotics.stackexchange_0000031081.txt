Q:

unable to find install package

I have been attempting to install diamondback.
I enter "sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-desktop-full"
and get
"unable to locate package ros-diamondback-desktop-full"
I am completely new to linux, so any help would be greatly appreciated

A:

After adding the ROS repositories to your apt sources and adding the WillowGarage keys (steps 1.2 and 1.3 of the Ubuntu installation guide), make sure you also run sudo apt-get update (beginning of step 1.4).
sudo apt-get update will instruct apt to refresh it's list of available software to take into account the fact that you just added new repositories.
After this, you should be able to run sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-desktop-full with no problems.
