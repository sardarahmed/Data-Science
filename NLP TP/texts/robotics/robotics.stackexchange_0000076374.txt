Make sure that you have installed "catkin_pkg", it is up to date and on the PYTHONPATH.

A:

I have solved the problem by
1- uninstall ROS
2- i uninstalled anconda3
3- I typed sudo nano .bashrc to clear anaconda as my main python  so i cleared every path related to ROS and anconda3
4- i installed ROS again
when i do catkin_make again i works

oh, sorry for coming too late to help. so, you didn't have to uninstall ROS nor anaconda, just remove anaconda from the path. Enjoy ROS now with bit clearer situation.

How do I clear the path or change my main python.
