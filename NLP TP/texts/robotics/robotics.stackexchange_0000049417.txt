Q:

PyQtGraphDataPlot and MatDataPlot fail to load

hallo,
as soon as I launch rqt_plot using
rqt_plot "topic name"

or
rosrun rqt_plot rqt_plot "topic name"

I get the following errors
rqt_plot.plot: importing PyQtGraphDataPlot
rqt_plot.plot: import of PyQtGraphDataPlot failed
rqt_plot.plot: importing MatDataPlot
rqt_plot.plot: import of MatDataPlot failed

The plotting tools start but I miss the interface buttons.
Moreover both the x and y scale don't change according to data.
I am using Fedora 18 and groovy.
I don't know where to start for debugging because I have never used python.
Thanks for your help.

Can you describe the command you used to run rqt_plot? You can add it to your your original question. Also what version of rqt_common_plugins you're using? You can get the version by $ dpkg -p ros-groovy-rqt-common-plugins on Ubuntu but not sure about Fedora..

I don't know how to retrieve the version. Sorry but It wasn't me who installed ros on this machine and I don't have dpkg on mi Fedora distribution. Do you know any other way? BTW in the package.xml of rqt_plot it says 0.2.10.

Actually, I'm seeing PyQtGraphDataPlot import failure on 1 of my machines too (Quantal 64b, Groovy, rqt_plot 0.2.14). Changing the loading order by modifying plot.py still yields the same failure, which indicates order doesn't matter. I'll ask the author.

A:

The messages you saw are not errors, but merely debug messages.
They show that you are missing packages for two of the three available ploting backends:

MatPlotLib

PyQtGraph

If they are available pre-packaged for your distribution you can simply install them. If not, at least for PyQtGraph it should be enough the download the source code and put it into your Python path.
Since these two are missing, the least comfortable backend has to be used: QwtDataPlot.
This one does not feature auto-scaling and other nice features, which the other two backends have. So if you want this, I suggest installing PyQtGraph.
