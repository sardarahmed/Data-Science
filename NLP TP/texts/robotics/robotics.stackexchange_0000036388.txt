Q:

remote gui for ros applications

Hi
I was wondering if there is something like a remote GUI applications can use? Something like a server on a desktop pc where clients can connect to and request to display a window with buttons and so on so the user can interact with the application without having to forward X?
regards jgdo

A:

If you have ROS installed on the other machine, you can use the graphical tools (rviz, rxgraph, etc) across your network: http://ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/MultipleMachines
