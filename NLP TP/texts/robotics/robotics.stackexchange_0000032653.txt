Q:

NITE Ubuntu 10.04

Is there any way to install NITE on Ubuntu 10.04? In ROS the page seems to be empty. The only download that I could find was on <openni.org>, and it was for Ubuntu 10.10.
Update: What commands do I use to run the NITE package? I want to use the "Prime Sense User Tracker Viewer" that it shows on the page.

A:

The package is named nite-dev -> sudo apt-get install nite-dev
Its source is listed as a ROS source, so you will have to have ubuntu setup for a package based installation. (You don't need to install from packages though.)
