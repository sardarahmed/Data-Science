Q:

How to get the time on bag file?

Hello,
I am trying to graph robot's distance from a particular point over time. I have a bag file, and wondering if I can get the duration in the bag file. For instance, if I play a x.bag file, I have the following information:
[PAUSED]   Bag Time: 1346096057.781698   Duration: 1.680327 / 19.253778
Is there a way to get that duration in a code?

A:

From the command line, use rosbag info.
There is also a code API for both C++ and Python.
