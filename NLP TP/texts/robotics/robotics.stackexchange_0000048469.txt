Q:

NXT for ROS Fuerte?

Hello,
Is it possible to use the NXT Package (http://www.ros.org/wiki/Robots/NXT) for the Lego Robot under Ros Fuerte? If not, how complicated is it to port it to Fuerte? What has to be done?
BR
Mario

A:

There's a stack for Electric here: http://www.ros.org/wiki/nxt
and a newer package here, which might be built for fuerte: http://www.ros.org/news/2012/03/new-repository-for-bind-nxt-with-ros-nxt-lejos-pkg.html
