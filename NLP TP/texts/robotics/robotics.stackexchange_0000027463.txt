Q:

To visualize collisional region

Is there a way to visualize collision (box, cylinder etc.) defined in SDF? If I'm not mistaken, we still need to give Gazebo visual and collision information separately (as found in another thread). So I'm debugging the collisional region by iterating the following steps many times, which is very cumbersome to me.

Edit sdf
Run Gazebo
Run a robot to try hitting the defined but transparent collision region. If it fails to hit, go back to step 1.

User's operation environment: Gazebo 2.2, ROS Indigo on Ubuntu Trusty
Since I'm using ROS, I can use RViz if there's a feature for this. Also for development purpose, upgrading Gazebo can be an option if only higher version software has a functionality, but the users will run the resulted files on Gazebo 2.2 (or any version that is compatible with ROS Indigo without tweak).

There should be an option on the top menu bar to View -> Show Collisions, does that appear for you?

@chapulina that does it. If you repost it as an answer I'll mark it as an answer. Thanks!

Glad it worked. I was wondering if it wasn't there for Gazebo 2.2 ;)

A:

There should be an option on the top menu bar to View -> Show Collisions.
To show collisions for a single model, right-click the model and choose View -> Show collision.
