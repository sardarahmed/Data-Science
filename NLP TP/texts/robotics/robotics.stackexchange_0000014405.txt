Q:

Unscented Kalman Filter VS Extended Kalman Filter on stability

The Extended Kalman filter is more or less a mathematical "hack" that allows you to apply these techniques to mildly nonlinear systems.
The problem with Extended Kalman Filter is if I initialize the filter with poor conditions (i.e., the initial state), it will quickly diverge. If propagation and/or measurement updates happen at too great a timestep, it will quickly diverge. 
I my view, EKF is not good for control engineering, due to the risk of diverging.
So my question is if Unscented Kalman Filter(UKF) is a better choise for me if I want to be sure that my controller is stable?
Or should i use the static original Kalman-Bucy Filter? I'm working with feedback systems. 

A:

You mentioned that EKF wasn't very robust for your application. This means that the continuous time model is considerably non-linear. In this setting, the UKF is better than the EKF and handles the non-linearity better. 
The original static Kalman-Bucy filter does not seem like a promising choice since it targets continuous time linear systems. So, between them, I would still lean towards UKF. 
You might want to look at indirect feedback Kalman filters. Section 2 of the following reference describes a non-linear continuous time application similar to what you would encounter in robotic arm movement problems.
