Q:

Problem launching moveit_setup_assistant in groovy

I have installed moveit on groovy (Ubuntu 12.04) and I want to follow their tutorials. The first step is to launch the moveit_setup_assistant and I failed in the this very first step. When I run this command (suggested by moveit Wiki)
roslaunch moveit_setup_assistant setup_assistant.launch

I receive this error:
[moveit_setup_assistant] is not a package or launch file name

Why this happens and how should I tackle this problem? It might be worth mentioning that while typing the command, tab complition works properly and completes both parts.

To be clear, you used the instructions provided at http://moveit.ros.org/wiki/index.php/Groovy/Installation ?

A:

Did you source devel/setup.bash in the terminal where you issued your command?
