Q:

openni2 load oni file in Indigo

I am not able to load a oni file (OpenNI record file) with openni2 in Indigo. In Hydro I was able to load it simply with:
roslaunch openni2_launch openni2.launch device_id:=/path/to/your/file.oni

but in Indigo openni2 still tries to open the real device.
Any suggestions?

A:

I was able to solve the issue, by changing these lines on openni2_camera (lines 682):
 // check if device_id is a oni file
   else if( device_id.size() - device_id.rfind(".oni") == 4 ) {
         return device_id;
    }
