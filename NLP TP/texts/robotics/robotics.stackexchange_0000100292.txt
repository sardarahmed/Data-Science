A:

Hi,
I guess that you are using some old version or publishing to a wrong topic, your velocity commands for DiffBot. Did you follow the exact manual from here?
If you are using your custom command for publishing velocities, please check that the topic name is "/cmd_vel".
P.S. I will check the code one more time and have no idea where this value could come from. I am using "master"-branch.
EDIT:
I see that you are using foxy. We didn't backport the "master" functionality to Foxy, so if possible please use newest "Galactic" or "Rolling" version.
