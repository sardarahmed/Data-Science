Q:

RVIZ start specific config file

Hi all.
I am just wondering if is it possible to configure RViz such that when I start it, it will start automatically with a specific config file.
In advance thank you.

A:

well, I found out that saving the configuration as a default.rviz, next time I open it, it will automatically load the configuration :)

That's only valid when you're using the same machine (+ same user account) since the config last time is saved into ~/.rviz. For more robustness, use @Tones's suggestion or create a .launch.

What if I have changed user and want to edit the default config? Is there a way to do that?
