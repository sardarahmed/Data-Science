Hi,
The Turtlebot dashboard displays battery info by parsing the contents of two files...

/proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/info

On my laptop, the contents of that file are... (note values may vary)

design capacity:         4400 mAh
last full capacity:      4370 mAh

design capacity warning: 215 mAh

/proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/state

If either of these files do not exist, or your battery reports charge in a different way, you will run into issues (until this is fixed). You should check out this answer and see if it applies to you:
