Q:

Kobuki Not Moving on Navigation - move_base issue

Hi All,
My set up is Kobuki with s/w on Raspberry Pi with RPLIDAR A2 and that feeding back to a laptop. I'm trying to get the amcl_demo to work:
 roslaunch turtlebot_navigation amcl_demo.launch map_file:=/home/mark/KitchenMap.map.yaml --screen

The amcl seems to start without issue and reports:
[ INFO] [1489096786.597987673]: Got new plan

Eventually giving up with:
[ WARN] [1489096805.398058019]: Rotate recovery behavior started.

Which is when I would expect at lease something to happen. But the robot just stays still.
On the Pi side I see messages like:
[ WARN] [1489097005.894847319]: Velocity Smoother : using robot velocity feedback end commands instead of last command: 0.0349276, 0, -0.3, [navigation_velocity_smoother]

So something is not quite night. The only thing roswtf reports is:
Found 1 error(s).

ERROR The following nodes should be connected but aren't:
 * /move_base->/move_base (/move_base/global_costmap/footprint)
 * /move_base->/move_base (/move_base/local_costmap/footprint)

Which I don't think is much of an issue.
My rosgraph looks like this:

Any ideas what I've got missing or why this is happening?
Many Thanks
Mark

I found this to be a topic remapping issue. Once remapped all was well.
