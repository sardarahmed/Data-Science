Q:

How to change the co-ordinates of the velodyne point cloud data?

 Hi,
I have three velodynes and I launch all the three using group. I get the point cloud but all of them have the same fixed frame as 'velodyne' and when I visualize it in rviz, all the point clouds have the same origin.
I tried using tf package
<node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="HDL_1_base_link" args="5 0 0 0 0 0 /velodyne /HDL_1/velodyne_points 100"/> 

<node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="HDL_2_base_link" args="-5 0 0 0 0 0 /velodyne /HDL_2/velodyne_points 100"/>

but ony the axis change but not the point clouds.
Can please tell me what I doing wrong and suggest a solution?
Thanks in advance

A:

Set the frame_id parameter of the velodyne_driver to be different for each device.
