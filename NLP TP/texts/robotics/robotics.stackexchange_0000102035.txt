Q:

No laser scan received (and thus no pose updates have been published) for 18.974000 seconds. Verify that data is being published on the /scan topic

Hi all,
i already searched this question on all over answers.ros.org, but i didnt found answer on the issue i have. I built a custom 4 wheel bot and i added a navigation stack(map, move_base, amcl and other param yaml files) on it. if  i run the launch file, i get this error,
[ WARN] [1656224367.752167333, 18.974000000]: No laser scan received (and thus no pose updates have been published) for 18.974000 seconds.  Verify that data is being published on the /scan topic.
so, the issue i have is even if i see the map in rviz, there are no particle filters i can see detected by laser.Which describes the error i mentioned above. i clearly understand that my bot doesnt localize at first, leads to cant set a navigate and set a goal to my bot on the map.
I have been trying to solve this issue since last 3 days. Would be glad to have some guidance. Thanks in advance.
Regards.

You'd better provide the result when executing roswtf, and the tf tree in rqt. It is easier for others to debug

Hi, after many consideration and references, i finally got cleared that issue. Fault is on me. I did the mistake on topic name. Its working now. After that i wanted to scan the map(turtlebot3 house) with my bot, but it ended up like this. Also if i run the launch file, the bot behaves like this. Idk why the bot behaves like. Thanks in advance.
