Q:

No input with rosclean purge?

I'd like to implement a scheduled process to periodically run rosclean purge when my logs get too big, but even though it's a command line tool, it seems to be hard-coded to require a user to answer a "yn" prompt. Most command line programs have a "--noinput" or "--assume-yes" option to allow the tool to be used in an automated process. How do you do this with rosclean?

A:

why not ask rosclean itself?
rosclean purge -h directly points you to the -y flag

Ah, thanks. I had checked rosclean -h but not rosclean purge -h.
