Q:

UWSim install problem

I cannot get to install UWSim. I'm running it on Precise (12.04) I thought it might have something to do with the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH but since it seems correct I do not know what's up.
Here's the deal:

roswtf rosdep install UWSim
results in
Loaded plugin tf.tfwtf
Unable to load roslaunch file [rosdep]: Invalid roslaunch XML syntax: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'rosdep'

A:

It would seem that making use of roslocate and merge could be the answer to this quest. Still I didn't quite understand what happened and why it doesn't remember source setup.sh as I added it to .bashrc...
(New Problem, it just doesn't run the program. It goes all segm fault (core dumped))

Hi, check this thread, you probably need to disable shaders: http://answers.ros.org/question/31871/segmentation-fault-on-running-uwsim/

This worked! Thanks Mario
