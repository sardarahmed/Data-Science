Q:

Is rxplot time-synchronized?

I'm monitoring a couple of message fields which come from different topics located in different machines. The question is if rxplot considers those messages having an stamp to paint the data.
If not, I wonder if there is any node to synchronize data from different topics without implement a new node using a Time Synchronizer
(http://ros.org/wiki/message_filters?distro=fuerte#Time_Synchronizer)
They both are desirable features if don't exist yet.

A:

For its x-axis, rxplot uses the header.stamp from each message.
Synchronizing those time stamps between machines requires synchronizing the system times, which you should do anyway when running ROS.
