Q:

How does Dijkstra's algorithms work inside navfn?

Hi,
I have gone through this and  this as well .
Can someone explain how the global path planner works in details?
EDIT:
According to your suggestion, I have visited NavfnROS and navfn. In navfn_ros.cpp, line number 197 , we have makePlan () method defined which calls calcNavFnDijkstra(true) line 285.  This calcNavFnDijkstra(true) is defined here, line number 290. It uses
propNavFnDijkstra(std::max(nx*ny/20,nx+ny),atStart);
00302
00303       // path
00304       int len = calcPath(nx*ny/2);
END
I want to remove only Dijkstra's algorithm; I don't want to change
the costmap generation, cell updation, obstacle avoidance
I know what is a potential field, but how it is used here; I have no idea. How does gradient line 989 help us in making the global plan?
I am using ROS fuerte.

Hello Dear
I also want to remove only Dijkstra's algorithm, pleas can you tell me how you did it or what helped you to understand the code ?
Thank you

A:

I suggest you have a look at the source code and then ask more specific questions based on what you discover. There are fortunately many people on ROS Answers who are willing to help others, but very few have the time to write a comprehensive answer to a extremely broad questions like yours.
You're much more likely to get answers to a question like "I have looked into package X's code and do not quite understand what is done in function Y, can someone help me?" than to one like "Please explain the internal workings of package X in detail" (such as your current question above).

@Martin thanks. But, currently I have to use that one.
