Q:

audio_play on turtlebot: messages being sent, but no audio output

Hello,
I'm trying to get audio streaming back from my turtlebot and was delighted to find the audio_common package which provides audio_play and audio_capture.  Sadly, it doesn't seem to be working.
I'm following the tutorial found here: http://www.ros.org/wiki/audio_common/Tutorials/Streaming%20audio
Setup

On my turtlebot, I installed sound_common with "apt-get install ros-electric-sound-drivers"
My microphone and speakers are configured correctly, I'm able to record and play back sounds.
The command to test my audio setup works.  It echos sounds from the microphone.

gst-launch-0.10 alsasrc ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! alsasink

I launched both audio_capture and audio_play as per the tutorial

$ roslaunch audio_capture capture.launch
$ roslaunch audio_play play.launch

Problem and Troubleshooting

No sound output.
Both scripts launched without error.
I've verified that the nodes are connected using rxgraph
"rostopic echo audio" streams audio messages.
I can see the microphone input level bouncing, but the output level is doing nothing.
I've used sound_play to verify that I can play sounds and my volume settings are correct.

From what I can tell, everything should be working.  But I still get no output.  Any ideas on how to troubleshoot this?
Thanks,
-Brian

Have you tried the example in the turtlebot_sounds package?

hmm... thanks for the suggestion, I'll look at that.  any suggestions for troubleshooting codec issues?

Your problem is likely that audo_play cannot process the audio you have chosen due to a codec issue.

Yes, it works correctly and plays the sounds.

Have you been able to solve this problem? I am having the same kind of issues at the moment using audio_play. However, in the beginning I have sound playback, but it stops after a little while.
