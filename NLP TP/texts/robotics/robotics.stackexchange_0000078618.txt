Q:

MotorControlMsgs/Stiffness baxter

I tried viewing the stiffness parameter for the baxter robot, by executing:
rostopic echo /robot/limb/right/stiffness

but this just gives me an error:
ERROR: Cannot load message class for [MotorControlMsgs/Stiffness]. Are your messages built?

I tried searching for this message package, but only thing I'm getting is http://wiki.ros.org/control_msgs which doesn't contain stiffness parameters.
Anyone ever had similar problems or knows how to find MotorControlMsgs?
Thank you

A:

Have you setup your Baxter ROS workspace correctly and sourced the setup.bash after catkin_make-ing it?

Edit: from reading How to read /robot/limb/left/command_joint_position? and Collision Detection over at brr-users -- which seeing your posts there you also found -- it would appear that topics carrying messages from the MotorControlMsgs package are not meant to be used by end-users. The MotorControlMsgs package is therefore not available.
