It is solved the problem was with the laser scanner. I am converting 3d points cloud to laserscanner and I forget to remap the topic but now it is working well. Thanks

Can you answer your own question detailling what you did and mark it has correct ? Since questions related to transformation errors are (very) recurent that could help future people encountering this kind if issue to find your solution more easily.

A:

I was using the navigation package for turtlebot. The problem is the package launches all the lasserscanner and the cameras as subscribes automatically. But for me I was using my own laserscanner topic that I got from merging three projected 3D point clouds and it has different name of the standard /scan topic. I just remapped my scan topic to /scan and it worked.
