Q:

Update OpenCV version in ROS

Hello,
I checked my OpenCV version discovering that is 2.4.8.
I want to update it to 2.4.13 (at least 2.4.9) but I don't want to stop to use it in ROS Indigo too.
Since OpenCV is not a system dependencies anymore for Indigo, can I simply remove the old version of OpenCV and install a new one without "break" ROS Indigo?
Anyone knows if other actions are required?

A:

You can locally upgrade any package. But you will potentially have to rebuild all packages built against that package if the ABI has changed. Otherwise it will be fine.

Related: #q289264. I've also described how to update a system dependency and then rebuild packages that depend on it.
