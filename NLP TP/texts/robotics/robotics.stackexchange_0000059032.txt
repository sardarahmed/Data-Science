Q:

Unable to locate package, no valid OpenPGP data

I am installing on Ubuntu trying to get through the steps and have tried to install on 2 different machines. When I try to install the certs using wget ( h t t p) //packages.ros.org/ros.key -o | sudo apt-key add - I get
no valid OpenPGP data found
When I try to install ros with sudo  apt-get-install-ros-base i get:
E: Unable to locate ros-hydro-ros-base
I think everything else is configured. Anyone point me in the right direction here.

A:

It sounds like you're having trouble adding the key for the ROS repositories. You may want to try downloading and adding the key in separate steps:
wget http://packages.ros.org/ros.key
sudo apt-key add ros.key

Then you should be able to install ROS by running:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-ros-base
