Q:

How to predict the behavior of Autonomous Navigator of ROS?

Hi,

I am specifically interested in predicting the next move of autonomous navigator of ROS.

What should be the packages, I need to look at. I have gone
through this page ?

I f I want to modify the behavior of autonomous navigator of ROS; in which direction I should
proceed.

Many thanks for any kind of help.

what do you mean by "predicting the next move of autonomous navigator" ?
Comment by RB on 2015-01-22:
By "Predicting the next move"; I want to say how the trajectories have been chosen+constructed+updated? and  how these trajectories can be modified?

A:

for planning and navigation, ROS uses a node called move_base. Roughly, it divides the planning problem in two parts, the first creates a complete path from the start to the goal and is called global planner and another part creates local trajectories so the robot can follow the global path, and is called local planner.
In the way this node is implemented, it allow you to use different local and global planners. By default, the global planner is called navfn, which implements Dijkstra's algorithm.
For more info:
move_base
global_planner
navfn

Thanks for the answer.What other dependencies (in terms of packages), I need to check to add my own strategies for trajectory selection in navfn?

for more details, you can check here Writing A Global Path Planner As Plugin in ROS. If my response answered your question, pleas mark it as correct.

I am using ROS fuerte. Will this tutorial page help me as well?
By the way ..thanks again Procópio

I̶ ̶a̶m̶ ̶n̶o̶t̶ ̶s̶u̶r̶e̶ ̶a̶b̶o̶u̶t̶ ̶F̶u̶e̶r̶t̶e̶,̶ but I strongly suggest that you update your ROS distro. Currently we are at ROS Indigo, which is 3 versions away from Fuerte (which already reached its End of Life). You are welcome.

That tutorial looks alright for Fuerte.
