Q:

win_ros 'rosversion' not recognized

I'm trying to use win_ros and have installed the SDK as outlined here:
http://wiki.ros.org/win_ros/hydro/Msvc%20SDK
Problem is that after calling the batch file, when I try to launch roscore, I get this error:
`rosversion' is not recognized as an internal or external command 

and it errors out. I've tried both groovy and hydro versions, and I get the same error. Anyone know what's going on?

I had a errant space in my PATH environment variable; all is well now.
