Q:

Turtlebot simulation crashes when launched

I have installed the software like it is said in the page.
my system info is:

ubuntu 12.04
ros hydro
gazebo 1.9

However when i try to run it:
roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_empty_world.launch
gazebo crashes when he should spawn the bot. The log message i get when this happens is:
Dbg Plugin model name: mobile_base
[ INFO] [1406225474.476679853, 0.410000000]: Will publish tf. [mobile_base]
[ INFO] [1406225474.485497179, 0.410000000]: GazeboRosKobuki plugin ready to go! [mobile_base]
[ INFO] [1406225474.496429589, 0.430000000]: Physics dynamic reconfigure ready.
[spawn_turtlebot_model-4] process has finished cleanly

I don't know why it is happening, other urdf models like shadow hand and arm are working pretty nice.
-------------     EDIT     -------------
when i check the log files i get this information:
