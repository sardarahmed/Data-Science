Q:

Changing Parameters of Local Planner, ROS Navigation

The tutorial says:
http://wiki.ros.org/base_local_planner
"There are a large number of ROS Parameters that can be set to customize the behavior of the base_local_planner::TrajectoryPlannerROS wrapper. These parameters are grouped into several categories: robot configuration, goal tolerance, forward simulation, trajectory scoring, oscillation prevention, and global plan."
Where can I set/change these parameters?

A:

Have you looked at base_local_planner_params.yaml in turtlebot_navigation/param?
This yaml sets some parameters for TrajectoryPlannerROS. Please check it out! I think that this yaml is useful for you.
In case of eband_planner_params.yaml, contents of yaml is following.

EBandPlannerROS:

#TRAJECTORY CONTROL
 differential_drive: true
 max_acceleration: 0.5

# velocity limits
 max_vel_lin: 0.6
 max_vel_th: 0.8
 min_vel_lin: 0.1
 min_vel_th: 0.0
 min_in_place_vel_th: 0.0
 in_place_trans_vel: 0.0

# goal tolerance
 xy_goal_tolerance: 0.2
 yaw_goal_tolerance: 0.2

# angular velocity PID
 k_prop_; 0.75

#eband parameters

You will need to check more detailed of Parameter by yourself.
