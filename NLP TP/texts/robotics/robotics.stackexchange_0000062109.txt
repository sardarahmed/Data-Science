A:

I've added the dependency definitions to the rosdep rules, so you should be able to properly use rodep for the Debian source install.  Note that as of 10/2014, libconsole-bridge-dev hasn't made it yet to wheezy, only jessie, so it needs to be installed from source if using wheezy.
I've made installation instructions for a RaspberryPi which uses a version of wheezy, so these instructions should work on any version of Debian to install libconsole-bridge-dev from source.
