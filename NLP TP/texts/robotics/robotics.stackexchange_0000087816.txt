Q:

MoveIt! Setup links are red

Hi, i created a robot model with xacro and added properties with MoveIt!.
While configuring my robot in the MoveIt! Setup some links were in a light red.
Does anyone see a problem with this rails (they are connected with the plate)

A:

Problem solved by myself.
I did some weird things with the  tag in my xacro files.
In my files i defined this bright red color and called it mycolor. Then I associated it to all rails.
I hope i can help if someone get this problem.
