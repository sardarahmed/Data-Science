Q:

getTopics equivalent for services (C++)

I am using "getTopics" in ros/master.h to get a list of possible topics and their types.
There doesn't appear to be any equivalent for getting a list of services and types because services don't register their types with roscore. In the Python rosservice API, rosservice list uses rosgraph to send/recv a probe request over a raw TCP socket to get an individual service type.
Is there a built-in way of doing this with the C++ API? Do I need to resort to Boost.Python?
