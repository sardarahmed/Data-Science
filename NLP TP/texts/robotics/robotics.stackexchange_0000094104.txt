Q:

Adaptive robot gripper options

Hello everyone,
I'm currently working on a project picking bottles of different sizes from a shelf. For this purpose, I need an adaptive robot gripper. However, besides Robotiq, I can't find many gripper manufacturers.
Currently, I use the Robotiq Hand-E with custom fingers, but I need to modify the bottles for this work.
What I need:

Gripper for grasping round and cubic objects (bottles)
The bottle diameter is usually 50-100mm
Ideally electric
controlled via Modbus or I/O
Payload up to 2-2.5kg

What I have found so far:

Robotiq 2F-140 adaptive gripper - best solution, very pricey
Festo Fin-Ray Effect Fingers + electric parallel gripper - relatively cheap, but no electric parallel grippers from Festo

Are there any other options on the market? And is really everyone using pneumatic grippers? I can't see that happening in an office/bar setting.
Thanks,
Alex

You may want to post this on a different forum. ROS Answers may not see the best type of audience for this.

It looks like that. However, I already found a gripper that suits my needs, I will answer my own question shortly.

A:

After a bit of internet research I found a few additional options:

ON-Robot RG2 and RG6
SAKE Robotics Gripper
Adaptive Fin-Ray-like gripper from Aliexpress (search "adaptive gripper")

In the end, I decided for the SAKE Robotics gripper, since it seems to fit my application very well and the pricing is lower than the ON-Robot and Robotiq solutions. Moreover, the SAKE gripper comes with ROS drivers and simulation models.
I couldn't find suitable electric long-stroke parallel grippers, so I discarded the fin-ray finger option.
