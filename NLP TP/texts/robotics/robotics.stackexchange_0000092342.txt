Q:

How do I fix model_publisher problem when running localization module on autoware with lgsvl?

When running localization module on autoware, I run into a error stating that:
File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rospkg/rospack.py", line 203, in get_path
raise ResourceNotFound(name, ros_paths=self._ros_paths)
ResourceNotFound: model_publisher
Has anybody encountered this?
Running Ubuntu 16.04 Kinetic

A:

The model_publisher failed to load mesh.
So, please check the urdf and vehicle model .dae path.
