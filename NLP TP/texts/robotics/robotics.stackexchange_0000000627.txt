Q:

Formatting an SD card for Panda Board ES

I have a Panda Board ES. I am not able to get it to boot. I sent it back to SVTronics to get it checked and they said that the board is OK; I am the one who is not able to configure it properly.
After doing a little research and following all the directions on the Panda Board and Ubuntu website, I am still not able to get the board to boot. I think the problem is how I am formatting the SD card. I am using disk utility for Mac to format the SD card to "MSDOS(FAT)" partition.
I would like to know how to format an "SD Card" on a Macintosh to install Ubuntu on it for Panda Board ES.

A:

It's possible that your problem is not the filesystem format (although you should probably using Linux EXT2/EXT3/EXT4 instead of MS-DOS/FAT).  Is the bootloader installed properly? 
Here are some posts on putting an Ubuntu bootloader on an SD card:

More broadly, have you looked at this wiki, dedicated to putting Ubuntu on Panda boards?
