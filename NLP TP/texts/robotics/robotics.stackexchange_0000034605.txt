Q:

rviz segmentation fault at launch

Hi all,
I've been working with ROS for about 1.5 year now. I've just upgraded from Diamondback to Electric and everything seemed to be working fine, even rviz was still working. Today rviz started having a segmentation fault at launch.
I've tried to look for similar errors on the web and tried a few solutions, but haven't got it to work yet.
Output of rviz launch (sorry, but couldn't get it as a bullet points...):
freek@freek:~$ rosrun rviz rviz -l 
[ INFO] [1317359486.500866894]: rviz revision number 1.6.4 
[ INFO] [1317359486.500952896]: ogre_tools revision number 1.6.2

[ INFO] [1317359487.161710770]: RTT Preferred Mode is PBuffer. Segmentation fault (core dumped)

As you can see I've got the core file (memory dump) as well, but can't upload it here. I've tried setting the RTT mode to either Copy or FBO but this doesn't solve the issue. I've also got the .Ogre file if anyone is interested.
I'm running Ubuntu 10.10 and have the latest nvidia (Quadro FX880M) drivers installed:
freek@freek:~$ glxinfo |grep version
server glx version string: 1.4
client glx version string: 1.4
GLX version: 1.4
OpenGL version string: 3.3.0 NVIDIA 280.13
OpenGL shading language version string: 3.30 NVIDIA via Cg compiler
Any help is welcome :)

A:

I just had the same issue.  I fixed it by editing the .rviz/display_config file that rviz was using by default.  I basically just deleted most of it, and then rviz launched sucessfully.
