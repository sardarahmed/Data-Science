Q:

Supported Android API levels in rosjava

Has there been any decision made on what API levels will be supported in rosjava?
The reason I ask is that I noticed the Android libraries and tutorials set
minSdkVersion to 9.

A:

It should work on Android Level 8.  The Level 9 is due to the fact that the original implementation used a class that required level 9.  This has since been fixed.

We'll have to figure out some other ways to package those sensor examples as those are constantly evolving with the API levels -- you can use the actual communication parts w/o level 9.

The OrientationPublisher in the Android library is using TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR which is level 9.
