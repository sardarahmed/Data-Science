Q:

weird behavior of rviz ros-fuerte

Hi all!
This question is heavily related to this one.
After tons of magic I've been finally able to read depth information from my ASUS kinect.
So, I have to open 1 terminal, print
killall XnSensorServer

in other terminal I start the camera
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch

then when I open rviz in one more terminal I am able to view depth image from the camera. But, here comes the weird stuff: if I move the camera window in rviz I get an error in roslaunch terminal:
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'openni_wrapper::OpenNIException'
  what():  virtual void openni_wrapper::OpenNIDevice::startDepthStream() @ /tmp/buildd/ros-fuerte-openni-camera-1.8.0/debian/ros-fuerte-openni-camera/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/openni_camera/src/openni_device.cpp @ 257 : starting depth stream failed. Reason: Xiron OS got an event timeout!
[camera_nodelet_manager-2] process has died [pid 20183, exit code -6, cmd /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/nodelet_core/nodelet/bin/nodelet manager __name:=camera_nodelet_manager __log:=/home/igor/.ros/log/68736576-b16d-11e1-882b-d0df9aa0a99d/camera_nodelet_manager-2.log].
log file: /home/igor/.ros/log/68736576-b16d-11e1-882b-d0df9aa0a99d/camera_nodelet_manager-2*.log

The same if I try to choose the color_image topic from the camera in rviz.
Maybe this would help to localize the bug that definitely is somewhere there.

A:

On the last update of ros-fuerte I don't experience this bug anymore.

I'm still experiencing this behaviour using the current version of ROS Fuerte.
