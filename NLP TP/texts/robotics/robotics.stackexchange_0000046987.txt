Q:

About executable files

I'm the new one to ROS.. I have written two cpp file named talker.cpp and listener.cpp in src and i add two lines seeing below in CMakeLists.txt file
rosbuild_add_executable(talker src/talker.cpp)
rosbuild_add_executable(listener src/listener.cpp)

now when i give a command $make
it displays
make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.

Would you please explain me clearly the steps which we need to execute cpp files  in ROS environment please explain it me in steps

Please read the support guidelines before posting. Always tag your posts and provide enough information for us to reproduce the issue. Which exact steps did you follow? Which ROS and Ubuntu versions are you using?

A:

To run make you need a file called makefile. This tutorial tells you steps of how to create a package, including all necessary files:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage
Else you can use this as a Makefile:
include $(shell rospack find mk)/cmake.mk

This are instructions for ROS fuerte.
EDIT:
I am serious: Do the tutorial linked above. Your source files need to go into the src folder, you need a Makefile, and only when you have that Makefile will you get executables in the bin folder. The tutorial explains all that.
