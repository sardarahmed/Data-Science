Q:

Turn a point cloud into an image with Python

Hi, everyone,
Recently, I tried to run through the pcl_ros tutorial to convert a point cloud from a Kinect to an image.  My hope is to be able to do the exact same thing in Python, not C++, and then work with the image using the OpenCV Python interface.
here's the tutorial link:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/pcl_ros/Tutorials/CloudToImage
I hit a small snag, though.  It seems like the tutorial is referencing a Ros Topic from openni_camera called /camera/depth/points2, but I can't seem to find this topic in list of topics published by openni_camera.
Rather, I found:  /camera/depth/points, but this doesn't seem to generate an image when I make this change in the tutorial.
Will getting the image from /camera/depth/points2 be necessary to fulfill my overall goal?
Also, are there any other ways to easily convert a Point Cloud from the Kinect to an image in Python?
Many Thanks in advance for everyone's words of wisdom!

A:

There are currently no PCL-python bindings, so there is no single function to convert a point cloud into an image. You can however subscribe to /camera/depth/image, which is already an image and has 32-bit float valued pixels (values are in meters). It can be converted easily into a cvMat using cv_bridge (see this post for further details).
