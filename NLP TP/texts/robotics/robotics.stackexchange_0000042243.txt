Q:

Error when installing ROS for Nao robot

Does anyone manage to install the ros for the nao robot?
I am experiencing problems with the installation process. I am installing using the NAO sdk 1.12.3 (geode).
For the environment setup (on the website)
export GEODE_CXX=$CTC_DIR/cross/geode/bin/i586-linux-g++
export GEODE_CC=$CTC_DIR/cross/geode/bin/i586-linux-gcc

to
export GEODE_CXX=$CTC_DIR/cross/bin/i686-pc-linux-gnu-g++
export GEODE_CC=$CTC_DIR/cross/bin/i686-pc-linux-gnu-gcc

the compilation errors:
  -- QI_SDK_DIR: /home/anshar/nao/ros/electric/ros/core/roslib/build/sdk

What version of ROS are you trying to compile? What command caused that error message?
