Q:

kinect installation with ROS Kinetic Ubuntu 16.04

I installed openNi, NITE and PrimeSense for Kinect Sensor.
When I enter roslaunch openni_launch openni_launch
it is not funding the package.
[openni_launch] is neither a launch file in package [openni_launch] nor is [openni_launch] a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

I am a beginner. Guide me in this regard.
Thanks
PS: I also followed #q207642. but didn't succeed

I was watching the things on Rviz using
rosrun rviz rviz
I can see my images (rgb + depth). I want to see depth cloud but there is an error in my global status
Global status  error: Fixed Frame [map] does not exist.
Can you help me how to fix it now.
