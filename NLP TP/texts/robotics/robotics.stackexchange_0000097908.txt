Q:

Doubt in ROS-1 communication design

Hi,
While going through ROS-1 wiki pages, at several places I read that the message between a publisher and subscriber does not route via Master. Rather the message travels directly from Publisher to Subscriber. But in the following Wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern), under heading TOPOLOGIES, it is mentioned that in a broker-based pub-sub system, the messages are routed via broker (i.e. master). So, I request someone who is aware of the latest ROS-1 communication design to help in clarifying this doubt please. Thanks.

ROS 1 does not use broker-based pub-sub, so that would seem to answer your question (ie: the master is not directly involved in message exchange, as you've already read in multiple other places).

(i.e. master)

the ROS Master != a broker.

But in the following Wikipedia page, [..]

did you intend to include a link?

@gvdhoorn : Yes, sorry for forgetting to include the link. Here it is: (also updating in question): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern   (in Topologies section)

@gvdhoorn : Thanks a lot for your prompt response. But please do let me know in case you wish to comment anything after going through the Wikipedia link mentioned in above comment, and also in question (heading Topologies)

No, my answer would be the same.
It's true that in a broker based pub-sub system, the broker can be involved in message exchange.
But ROS 1 does not implement such a pub-sub system, so there is no broker, and consequently, no message passing through/via the master.
