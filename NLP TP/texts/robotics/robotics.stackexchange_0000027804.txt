Q:

When trying to contribute a model I get "abort: no username supplied (see "hg help config")"

when I use the
hg commit
command it gives me that error... How do I set a username?

A:

You can either specify a user for the commit:
hg commit -u <your username>

Or set the default user in your .hgrc file so it is used for every commit. Open the file:
gedit ~/.hgrc

And add this, note that the email is actually in angled brackets <>
[ui]
username = <your username> <<your email>>
