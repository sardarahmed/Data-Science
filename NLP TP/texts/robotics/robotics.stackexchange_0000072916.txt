Q:

Model can't be fixed the orientation

Hello, ROS community!
I was learning the tutorial about the placing models in some orders and I wanted to implement it in my project. I took some models from 3D google repository and corrected them by following this tutorial.
My problem is the model (white_shelf2) can't be rotated on 90 degrees. I tried differently to fix the numbers of orientation (yaw exactly) in the world file (below it attached), but I cant still understand why the number were not published in Gazebo.

This is screenshots:

In GUI, I placed the model in right position for getting the pose coordinates. Because, the "save" function doesn't work there, so I fixed the coordinates in my world file.

Thank you in advance!

A:

The problem was decided in Gazebo answers. The link is here.
In case, I duplicate my question in Gazebo and ROS answers, Do I destroy the community rules?
