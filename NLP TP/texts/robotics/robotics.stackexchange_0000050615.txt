Q:

How to use Pionner 3AT + Sensor Kinect to capture point clouds

Hi,
I'm using Pionner 3AT + Sensor Kinect to capture point clouds. I'm use the p2os (teleop_keyboard) to controll robotic and rgbdslam_freiburg to capture the point clouds, I don't have problems for to use these processes separately, the problem is when I use the two together. What must I do to rgbdslam package receive the commands to capture the point cloud (ex: "enter" key)? I have the same doubt with joystick.

A:

I assume your problem is controlling the Pioneer remotely and using rgbdslam at the same time. You could try using rgbdslam in headless mode and use the frame service call. As for controlling the Pioneer with a joystick remotely, you can try a multiple machine setup with a desktop PC running the joystick node.
