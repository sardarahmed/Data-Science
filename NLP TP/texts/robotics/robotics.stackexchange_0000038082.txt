Q:

Ubuntu Maverick install of ros-electric-pr2-desktop

I'm trying to install electric pr2 desktop on ubuntu maverick (10.10) following the instructions at http://www.ros.org/wiki/Robots/PR2/electric, which tells me to install the package ros-electric-pr2-desktop, only apt tells me that package doesn't exist. Why not?
I believe I have apt sources setup ok, using 'deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu maverick main' and can see plenty of of other ros-electric packages, just not the desktop one, maverick is missing.
This is similar to question ubuntu-install-of-electric-pr2-desktop, except that question and answer is for Oneric.

A:

pr2-desktop is not available on Maverick as some of the required packages do not build on that platform.  As Maverick is due to be EOL in a month, it is unlikely this will be fixed.  You will need to update to Natty or Oneiric if you wish to use the full suite, or install pr2 stacks individually.
