Q:

How do I set the inital pose of a robot in gazebo?

Let's say I've created my own world file that has:

This normally spawns the robot at x=0, y=0.
How could I spawn it somewhere else, say x=1, y=1?
I know I could spawn the robot and then move it by calling the service: set_model_state, but I've found doing this with the pr2 doesn't work very well with other objects in the world.
pr2_no_controllers has an arg called 'optenv ROBOT_INITIAL_POSE.'  How do I get at this from my world file?

If you came to this thread trying to set an initial joint configuration of the robot, check this thread too: https://answers.ros.org/question/248178/can-i-set-initial-joint-positions-in-gazebomoveit-via-configuration/

A:

you can set the environment variable in commandline, e.g.:
ROBOT_INITIAL_POSE="-y 2" roslaunch pr2_gazebo pr2_empty_world.launch^C
