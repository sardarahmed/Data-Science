Q:

[Solved] Is clearing_rotation_allowed parameter actually working?

Hello all,
I'm playing with different combinations of recovery behaviors. In some cases, make the robot spin to recover is not an option, so the clearing_rotation_allowed parameters is really helpful. But it doesn't seem to prevent the robot to make in place rotations, when I keep all other recovery-related parameters with default values.
Anyone else show this? Or am I doing something wrong?

Btw, I created an issue (#38)

A:

It's a misspelling in the code. Until the fix is released, rename clearing_rotation_allowed to clearing_roatation_allowed should work.

This is now fixed, just in case anyone else is wondering.
