Q:

Navigation stack

Hi everyone, I am trying the ROS navigation stack for the first time, and I am trying to navigate my mobile robot to a given position. Right now was trying to this using an empty map and a robot that does not have any sensors. is that possible? I've been able to move it by publishing to the cmd_vel topic, so I know that everything from the urdf to the launch files I'm using are currently okay. I was wondering I could I quickly generate an empty map, since it seems to me that's exactly what I'm missing. Any thoughts?
Thanks,
Hugo

You can send velocities command to the cmd_vel topic but without any sensors, you can not doing autonomous navigation with your robot according me.

A:

Yes, its possible to move the robot using cmd_vel topic without sensors.
did you do the teleop of turtlesim tutorial?

You can create a gazebo world and try to navigate the robot in that.

Thanks! However, my problem is slightly different (btw, yes I have made the turtlebot tutorials). What I am looking for is to be able to send a goal to my robot a have it navigate there I keep getting the this  "The robot's start position is off the global costmap. Planning will always fail" cont.

(cont) I have followed the tuturials about it, about to have your map, and costmaps (.http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup), but I still get this warning. Obviously, nothing happens
Thanks again!
