Q:

Transform Quaternion

Hi!
Is there a package witch transforms the quaternion coordinates automatically in an other system? (Axis-Angle, Kardan, Euler)
Thanks.

A:

The tf::Quaternion class is (currently) built on top of the Bullet quaternion class - here's an overview.
You have all the methods available in btQuaternion. You can also create a btMatrix3x3 from the btQuaternion and use any of the class methods.
After a quick scan, I'm seeing

getAngle()
getAxis()
getEulerYPR(..)
getEulerZYX(..)

EDIT: as per narcispr's comment:
Let's say q is your quaternion. This is what I usually do (there might be a more elegant way, but I haven't found it)
tf::Matrix3x3 m(q);
double roll, pitch, yaw;
m.getRPY(roll, pitch, yaw);

I was also looking for some way to transform from quaternion to euler in C++. Can you post a code snippet please?
