Q:

How to select the Pilz Motion Planner?

Hello,
i use MoveIt with ROS Melodic and Ubuntu 18.04.
At a first stage i install MoveIt with binary. But if i got it right, the Pilz Planner isn't a part of this installation.
So i build MoveIt from source without problems in another workspace (does this matter?).
But how can i select this planner? If i change the pipeline in my move_group.launch, i got an error:

MoveGroup running was unable to load pilz_industrial_motion_planner::CommandPlanner

i downloaded the pilz_industrial_motion_planner_planning_pipeline.launch.xml into my launch directory. But i don't know what i have to do in addition to get thinks work.
Thanks for your help!

A:

There is an apt package that contains the pilz motion planner. Install it with the following command:
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-pilz-industrial-motion-planner
