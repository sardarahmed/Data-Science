Q:

Cannot visualize markers in rviz!

I use openni_kinect and openni_tracker to track with kinect. Then, when a user is detected I can see the /tf in Rviz and it works.
However, when I try to use markers (eg. hone_markers, pointing_markers, ...) I see nothing in rviz. Topics are ok I think, because if I look rxgraph everything seems ok (rviz subscribed to topic /hone_markers, for example).
What should I do in order to visualize the markers in rviz?
Thanks in advance

A:

You could use the rostopic command to debug this. "rostopic echo /topicname" will print the topic data on screen. If this doesn't output anything, openni is not sending.
