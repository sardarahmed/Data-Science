Q:

how to check all parameters of running nodes?

I'm playing with ROS and my Robotino with the robotino stacks.
I launch robotino_node i.e. launch/robotino_node.launch and edit the following line to suit my system:
"param name="hostname" value="192.168.5.5"
changed to
"param name="hostname" value="192.168.1.12"
however, after launch this node i.e. robotino_node... it showed several parameters including "hostname" but I'm dont know how to check its value if it's already set
according to RobotinoNode.cpp, this value is fixed to "192.168.5.5", I don't know if the robotino_node.launch file can re-set this value??
