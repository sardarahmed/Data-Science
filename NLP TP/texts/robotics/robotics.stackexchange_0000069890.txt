Q:

catkin_create_package TypeError

Hello,
I'm trying to create a simple catkin package, but I'm getting a strange error that I could not find an answer on the forum or google. This is what I get:
ariel@ariel-GT70:~/catkin_ws/src$ catkin_create_pkg test roscpp
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/bin/catkin_create_pkg", line 68, in <module>
    main()
  File "/usr/local/bin/catkin_create_pkg", line 61, in main
    newfiles={})
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/catkin_pkg/package_templates.py", line 209, in create_package_files
    _safe_write_files(newfiles, target_path)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/catkin_pkg/package_templates.py", line 185, in _safe_write_files
    fhand.write(content)
TypeError: 'str' does not support the buffer interface

Any ideas?.
Thanks for the answer.

Please post the platform you are using.

I'm working on ubuntu 14.04 (64 bits) with ros indigo.

A:

Looks like you have this installed in /usr/local, perhaps via pip. Do you also have a version installed in /usr via apt-get install?
If so, remove the pip version and use the Debian package.

I've never used pip. To be sure I removed and purge ros* and re-installed (ros-indigo-desktop-full) it and I still have the same issue.

You mean it's still running out of /usr/local?
Comment by Ariel on 2015-10-08:
Yes, in /usr/local. This is what I have:
ls /usr/local/bin/
catkin_create_pkg      catkin_make_isolated    catkin_topological_order
catkin_find            catkin_package_version  easy_install
catkin_init_workspace  catkin_prepare_release  easy_install-3.4
catkin_make            catkin_test_results

The Debian packages do not install to /usr/local, so you have some other version there, which you need to delete from both /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages.

I believe I should NOT do rm catkin*, right? What would be the best (and safest) way to remove everything from /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages?
Comment by Ariel on 2015-10-12:
I did rm catkin* in /usr/local/bin and the issue was solved. Thanks for the help.

If you did not use pip, rm was probably the only solution. Please click on the check mark if it answered your question.
