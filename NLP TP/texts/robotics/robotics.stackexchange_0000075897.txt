Q:

Unable to resolve dependencies while ROS Install on Mac

Hi,
I am trying to install ROS Indigo on Mac OS X El Capitan and am following this tutorial. However, along the tutorial I am getting suck at the step 2.1.2 wherein I need to run the following command:
$ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro indigo -y

Upon doing so, I get the following error:
$ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro=indigo -y
executing command [sudo -H pip install -U urlgrabber]
Password:
Collecting urlgrabber
  Using cached urlgrabber-3.9.1.tar.gz
    Complete output from command python setup.py egg_info:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
      File "/private/tmp/pip-build-iJQJmX/urlgrabber/setup.py", line 3, in <module>
        import urlgrabber as _urlgrabber
      File "urlgrabber/__init__.py", line 54, in <module>
        from grabber import urlgrab, urlopen, urlread
      File "urlgrabber/grabber.py", line 427, in <module>
        import pycurl
    ImportError: No module named pycurl
    
    ----------------------------------------
Command "python setup.py egg_info" failed with error code 1 in /private/tmp/pip-build-iJQJmX/urlgrabber/
ERROR: the following rosdeps failed to install
  pip: command [sudo -H pip install -U urlgrabber] failed

I tried looking for help, but am not able to get through. Does anyone have a clue why?
Thanks :)

You may wanna use this script instead: https://github.com/mikepurvis/ros-install-osx Has been working great for many many people.

I tried Mike Purvis's solution and it works!  Thanks for the tip spmaniato! It takes a long time though. Just a tip for all those who might need help in the future. Packages like pyqt, sip may throw ImportError during compilation. A simple brew unlink <package that throws ImportError> && brew link <same package> works like magic.
