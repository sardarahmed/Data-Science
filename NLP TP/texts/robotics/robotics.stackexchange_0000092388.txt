Q:

Unable to locate package ros-melodic-ros-base on Ubuntu Mate 18.04

I'm using Ubuntu Mate 18.04 on a old machine and I get this "unable to locate package ros-melodic-ros-base" error. I tried using the desktop and desktop-full version too, and they all have the same error. I don't if it has anything to do with it, but I'm using the 32-bit version of the OS. Other then that I don't what could be causing this error, do you guys have any suggestions?

A:

I'm using the 32-bit version of the OS

That would explain it: as you can see in REP-3: Target Platforms - Platforms by Distribution - Melodic Morenia (May 2018 - May 2023), only amd64 (for x86 architectures) of Melodic is supported with packages on the ROS buildfarm.

I see that. I choose the 32-bit OS because its running on a very old machine, with only 2Gb of RAM. But I thing I don't have a choice and must install a 64-bit OS. Thanks for the help!!
