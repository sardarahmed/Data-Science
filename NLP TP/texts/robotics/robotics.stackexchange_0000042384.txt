Q:

How to change the height of the Kinect mounted in turtlebot simulator

Hi,
(ROS - Electric; Ubuntu 11.10)
I am using Gazebo to simulate turtlebot.
How to change the height of the kinect mounted in turtlebot simulator. I need to increase the height of the kinect mount point in the turtlebot simulator so as to view the table tops of my environment. I am checking the turtlebot_description package which has the turtlebot.urdf.xacro file which loads all the meshes of the robot for the display. I have following questions
a) How to modify the urdf files to increase the height?
b) Does this change by itself change the height of the tf frame of the kinect so that i get the cloud from different height?
Any pointers/suggestions are appreciated!!!

A:

You could just change the "turtlebot_calib_cam_z" parameter in the turtlebot_calibration.xacro file of turtlebot_description. If you installed from .debs you'll risk losing your changes on an update though, so the recommended way is to copy the parts you need to your own package and change them there.
The changes in your URDF will directly affect also the tf tree (because it is created based on the URDF model), so it should directly work.
