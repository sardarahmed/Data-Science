Q:

Joint Controller plugin not creating topic in ignition gazebo

I've made a simple robot with 3 joints and I've applied the joint state publisher, pose publisher and joint controller plugins.
The joint state publisher and pose publisher plugins create their topics and I can interface them with ros_ign_bridge without issues. However, the joint controller plugin isn't creating a topic for the joint I specified.
Here is the SDF:

Here is the ignition GUI showing all topics:

As shown in the last figure, there is no joint control topic for the 'joint_shoulder2base' joint.
Can some one help me with this issue? Thanks :)

A:

The topics you see in that GUI are all topics being published by plugins or the core itself. Topics that are subscribed to are not listed there. You can look at the debug output on the console to find out what topic the joint controller has subscribed to.
