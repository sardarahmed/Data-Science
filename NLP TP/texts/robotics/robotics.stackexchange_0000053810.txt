Q:

Cartesian position node

Hi everyone,
I am using tf and an ik solver which offers two services: get_ik and get_fk (that's supposed to be generic).
Is there a node that can subscribe to tf, use get_fk and publish on a "cartesian pose" topic? And another for the inverse calculation (ie subscribe to cartesian pose, do get_ik, and publish to tf). I could create one, but this seems like a standard procedure.
Thanks

A:

The standard for FK would be do use a URDF for the kinematics description, publish joint angles, and then run the robot_state_publisher, which will publish all FK transformations via tf.

Thanks for the input. However I thought the robot_state_publisher was publishing joint angles to the tf, which then handles the FK (you can access the FK by calling rosrun tf tf_echo /base_joint /end_effector).

It's the other way around. robot_state_publisher receives joint angles and produces tf. FK handling is done in the robot_state_publisher.
