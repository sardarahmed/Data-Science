Q:

Changing dynamic_reconfigure parameters using rosbridge

I'm developing a node that includes some dynamically-reconfigurable parameters.  Eventually, I will write a JavaScript GUI that uses roslibjs and rosbridge to interface with this node and the rest of my robot.  I understand that dynamic_reconfigure uses ROS services to change the parameters during runtime.
Are there any examples of using roslibjs (or anything that talks to rosbridge) to change dynamically reconfigurable parameters?  I would be grateful to know if this is even possible, because if it isn't, I will have to design my node differently.

A:

I've investigated this issue on my own.  I couldn't find any existing examples of doing this, however I found that it is indeed possible.  The dynamic_reconfigure package uses a service called dynamic_reconfigure/Reconfigure.srv.  Since roslibjs can execute services, it can indeed interface with dynamic_reconfigure.
I've taken the time to write a thorough tutorial on how this is done within the roslibjs wiki.  It can be found here.
It would be nice to have a dynamic_reconfigure API within roslibjs instead of using raw service calls, so I created an issue found here if somebody wishes to implement this functionality.
