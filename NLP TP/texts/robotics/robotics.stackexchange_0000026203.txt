Q:

Confusion with common::Time::SecToNano()

As the description of the function says it converts seconds to nanoseconds, but the actual code doing the opposite. So, instead of multiplying seconds with 1e9, it multiplying it with 1e-9.
Similar applies to MilToNano() and MicToNano().
What I am missing?
