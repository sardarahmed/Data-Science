Q:

Specifying 2D nav goal in rviz for more than one robot?

I have a user interface were I use the "2D Nav Goal" in rviz to specify goal positions for a robot. Now I need to start two rviz and specify the foal for different robots. Hoq can I do that? The goal is published on "/move_base_simple/goal" and I cannot find any way to specify a namespace for that topic.

A:

Enable the 'tool properties' panel, there you can change the topic name. Or, start rviz and remap the topic name.

I tried "rqt -s rqt_rviz/RViz --args move_base_simple:=uav/0" but that did not work. Do you have a command line that works?

Changing in the tools property panel worked. Thanks.
