Q:

Error while building octomap_server

FUERTE on ubuntu 12.04 and using rosbuild
I am encountering this error while compiling the octomap pkg
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:23 (find_package):
By not providing "Findnodelet.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "nodelet", but
CMake did not find one.
Could not find a package configuration file provided by "nodelet" with any
of the following names:

  nodeletConfig.cmake
  nodelet-config.cmake

Add the installation prefix of "nodelet" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
"nodelet_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
"nodelet" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
been installed.

-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

thank you, installing the debian package solve the issue

A:

Where are you building octomap_server from (which source repository, which version)? And why not simply install the debian package "ros-fuerte-octomap-mapping"?
