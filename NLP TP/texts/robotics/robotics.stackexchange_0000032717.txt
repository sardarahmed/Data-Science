Q:

slam example totally follow the navigation tutorials

Hi,
Is ros doc tutorials able to provide a basic full online slam example totally follow the navigation tutorials?
Why I want to ask this because I couldn't find any slam package which totally follow the navigation tutorials and with laser range finder.I feel not easy to get information around everywhere on ros docs.
What I need are:
1.totally follow navigation tutorials
it means the package has these packages : tf,odmo,base,laser...(not combined together)
2.laser range finder(hokuyo node)
3.simple robot cad model on gazebo
4.rviz to show real laser data
5.using rviz to show the map and set goal
6.dynamic gmapping (not using static map)
If it is possible,thank you very much!!
gratitude~

It does simulate the whole pr2 including hokuyo, tf, odom, etc. I've given the link in my post, you can follow the tutorials there.
