Q:

2021 Metrics missing?

New metrics had been posted annually until 2020. I don't see 2021 update on http://wiki.ros.org/Metrics nor on discourse.ros.org. Am I missing it?

A:

We haven't released a metrics report for 2021. I got bogged down trying to automate report generation and with the pivot from ROSCon to ROS World. Hopefully, I will have some time to create the report in a few weeks. Is there a specific metric you are looking for?

@kscottz Thanks, the annual report is generally helpful (as an industry professional who chooses platform for product for the next few years). That said, this time what I wanted to see was the user demographic per ROS distro, which I now can see in https://metrics.ros.org/packages_rosdistro.html
