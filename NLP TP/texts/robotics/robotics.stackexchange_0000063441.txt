Q:

Error installing Laser scan tools for ROS

I am trying to install Laser scan tools from  git clone https://github.com/ccny-ros-pkg/scan_tools.git, on Hydro.  Every time I try to run Catkin_make, I get an error:
[ 41%] Performing configure step for 'csm_src'
-- Create a file named 'local_config/local-brent-Dell-DM051.cmake' if you want to add options.
gsl home:

FATAL_ERROR,FindGSL.cmake: gsl-config not found. Please set it manually. GSL_CONFIG=GSL_CONFIG-NOTFOUND
CMake Error at sm/CMakeLists.txt:30 (MESSAGE):

-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
make[2]: *** [scan_tools/laser_scan_matcher/csm/stamp/csm_src-configure] Error 1
make[1]: *** [scan_tools/laser_scan_matcher/CMakeFiles/csm_src.dir/all] Error 2

Linking CXX executable /home/brent/catkin_ws/devel/lib/ncd_parser/ncd_parser

I am not sure what I am doing wrong.
Thanks for your help.

A:

This is the typical error that you get from CMake when it can't find a package.
In this particular case, the package it can't find is GSL.
You can try installing GSL with sudo apt-get install libgsl0-dev.
More generally, you can install all of the dependencies for your workspace with rosdep:
rosdep install --from-paths src -i
