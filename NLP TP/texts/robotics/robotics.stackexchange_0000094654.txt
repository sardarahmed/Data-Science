A:

Normally, when trying to build ROS packages from source (which includes ROS 1 and ROS 2), you'd follow a certain workflow, one of the steps of which would be the make sure all package dependencies are present.
An example workflow is described in #q252478 (ignore the specific versions of Ubuntu and ROS: it's a generic workflow).
The important step that takes care of dependencies is the rosdep invocation.
It would appear however that rmf_traffic does not state the dependency on fcl anywhere in its package.xml. Without that information, rosdep would not be aware of the dependency and cannot help you.
In this particular case, you'd have to investigate the CMakeLists.txt of each package, identify the used packages/libraries (ie: see which find_package(..) lines there are) and manually install the corresponding Ubuntu/Debian packages.
In addition: it would be nice if you could report this on the issue tracker and it would be even nicer if, after you've identified all dependencies, you could update the package manifests with this information and then submit a Pull Request to osrf/rmf_core that would fix this for everyone.
Refer to the catkin documentation » How to do common tasks » Package format 2 (recommended) / Overview / Resolving dependencies section in the Catkin documentation for information on which particular sections would need to be added to the manifests.

Looking at the issue tracker of the package can also give you hints. For example it looks like this issue has been reported and has a solution listed: https://github.com/osrf/rmf_core/issues/70#issuecomment-580602947
