Q:

Moveit with multiple rviz

I'm using moveit trying to robot arm, For some purpose,  I need to connect two rviz to the same master.
When I operate in one rviz window, two rviz simulation robot will move.
Is there anyway I can only let the rviz window I operate move, the another rviz will not move.

A:

rviz is not a simulator but a visulizer, which means that you're viewing the same robot. As such they are expected to show the same movements.
If you want independent behavior you will need to launch two versions of the robot arm and connect one rviz to each.
