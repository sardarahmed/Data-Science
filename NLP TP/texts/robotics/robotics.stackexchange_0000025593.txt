Q:

Generate Elcipse Project Files for Gazebo - Indexing causes GC to Crash Eclipse

Has anyone else had any luck with this?
I have gotten it working by just importing the code as an "Existing Makefile Project" in CDT, but things aren't strongly linked together.

I can confirm the problem for Ubuntu 12.10, Eclipse 3.8 (see my comment above).
Luckily everything works fine with latest release - Eclipse 4.2 (Juno).
