Q:

Locate CATKIN_PACKAGE_SHARE_DESTINATION in devel space

I have a package that needs some binary resources at run-time.
In CMakeLists.txt, I install:
install(
        DIRECTORY resources/
        DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_SHARE_DESTINATION}/resources )

I would find them in/opt/ros/..../share/pkg/resources.
That works fine when installing the package.
However, how would I locate these resources during development?
They are not installed in the devel/share location.

A:

Depending on your programming language there is API to get the path of your package which is the directory containing the package.xml file: see https://wiki.ros.org/Packages#Client_Library_Support
Python:
import rospkg
rospack = rospkg.RosPack()
rospack.get_path('your_package_name')

C++:
#include <ros/package.h>
std::string path = ros::package::getPath("your_package_name");

And in your case the relative path of resources is the same so you should be easily able to construct the path you want which works for both cases - the devel / src as well as the install space.
