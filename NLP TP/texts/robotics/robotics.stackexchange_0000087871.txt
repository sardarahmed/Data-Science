Q:

[ros2cli] How can I get a list of lifecycle nodes from packages?

As far as I know there is no ros2cli command which lists lifecycle nodes from ROS2 packages installed. Do you plan to add something like that? Is there some workaround to get lifecycle nodes on a system without need to start the nodes?

A:

There is no such command at the moment. Also that kind of information is not available anywhere. A package doesn't declare anywhere what nodes it installs and if they are using a life cycle. I don't think there is any plan to require packages to "register" their nodes anywhere.

Are there example lifecycle nodes already?
