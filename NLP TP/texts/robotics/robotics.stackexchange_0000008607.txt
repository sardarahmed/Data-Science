Q:

Open source implementations for GPS+IMU sensor fusion?

Are there any Open source implementations of GPS+IMU sensor fusion (loosely coupled; i.e. using GPS module output and 9 degree of freedom IMU sensors)? -- kalman filtering based or otherwise.
I did find some open source implementations of IMU sensor fusion that merge accel/gyro/magneto to provide the raw-pitch-yaw, but haven't found anything that includes GPS data to provide filtered location and speed info.

A:

Yes. The px4 software for the pixhawk autopilot has an extended kalman filter that uses an accelerometer, a gyroscope, gps, and mag.
A paper describing the a smaller ekf which only estimates attitude can be found on archive.org and code for the full ekf can be found on github with further information on archive.org.

A:

ROS has a package called robot_localization that can be used to fuse IMU and GPS data. This package implements Extended and Unscented Kalman filter algorithms.
The package can be found here.
