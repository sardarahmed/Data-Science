Q:

Ubuntu 12.04 on beaglebone Â¿hard float or soft float?

Hi, I'm planning on getting the ROS installed to a beaglebone. I'm looking for information about hard vs soft float. They are incompatible at the ABI level, and you are not supposed to mix them. I understand that I'm gonna have to build everything from source, so is it ok to go the hard float way? Or is there a chance I get a call to a soft float library and everything breaks?

A:

If you have hard float support in the hardware. Doing a soft float computation will just go slower.
