Q:

Is increasing gyro , accelerometer sensor range is good or bad ? how does it affect the accuracy

I've been using mpu6050 IMU unit ( gyro + accelerometer  ) 
I found that I can set acc range to +/- 2g or 4g till 16 g 
and same for gyro +/- 250 deg/sec , 500 deg/sec and so 
I know that they are low cost and full noise , so which settings to the range are best to ensure higher accuracy ? 

A:

The smaller the range, the more sensitive the device will be. So, in that sense, a smaller range is better. However, the downside of a smaller range is that movement of the robot will be more likely to exceed the range of the sensor.
You should select the smallest range which you're sure will never be exceeded by normal operation of your robot.
Or, the smallest range within which you want the robot to be under control. I.E. the range might be exceeded during a crash, but at that point control is pretty irrelevant.
