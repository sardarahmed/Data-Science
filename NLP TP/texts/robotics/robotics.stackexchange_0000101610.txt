Q:

Can I prevent roslaunch from changing the terminal screen title?

This question was technically asked before back in 2014, but the answer was this was not possible at the time. I can't find any indication that this has changed, but has it been exposed for use? or can it be exposed - or is there a way I can get around it?
Would be super useful to be able to name the tabs based on what they are running rather than the current override is doing.

Technically, the answer given by @tfoote in #q199845 is incorrect.
I've posted an additional answer there to point to your post here to avoid duplicating answers.
(and also technically, your post is now a duplicate, but it's a bit of a complex situation)

Fair enough, and much appreciated for the answer!
Happy to have this removed or whatever is required to keep things tidy - in future, should I have followed up with a question within that original question?

We can keep it open. As I wrote, I decided to answer your question instead of the one from 2014. With the links between the two we've sufficiently addressed discoverability I believe.
re: future questions: 'age' is certainly a good metric to determine when to post a new question. Especially when you find one that's already been answered: the old(er) one basically captures the "state of things" at the time it was asked (and answered).

should I have followed up with a question within that original question?

your new post is a follow-up. Just as sites like Stack Overflow, ROS Answers works best with a 1-to-1 ratio of questions and answers, so posting follow-up questions in already answered posts isn't a good idea (visibility is really low, and you can only use comments, as answers are not for additional questions).

A:

Yes, this was changed, in 2013 already actually. From the CHANGELOG.rst:

add option to disable terminal title setting

the option referred to would be --disable-title:
$ roslaunch --help
...
  --disable-title       Disable setting of terminal title
...

This was added by ros/ros_comm#288.
