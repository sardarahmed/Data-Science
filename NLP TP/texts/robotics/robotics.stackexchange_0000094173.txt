Q:

catkin_make error: ImportError: No module named 'error'

So, i am a beginner in ROS i have this error every time i do a catkin_make
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "/opt/ros/kinetic/share/genpy/cmake/../../../lib/genpy/genmsg_py.py", line 44, in <module>
    import genpy.generator
  File "/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/genpy/__init__.py", line 34, in <module>
    from . message import Message, SerializationError, DeserializationError, MessageException, struct_I
  File "/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/genpy/message.py", line 44, in <module>
    import yaml
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/yaml/__init__.py", line 2, in <module>
    from error import *
ImportError: No module named 'error'

and after a lot of googling i figured that the problem is because of the PYTHONPATH.
so to check my PYTHONPATH is did
echo $PYTHONPATH

and i got
/home/username/catkin_ws/devel/lib/python3/dist-packages:/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages

i think the reason behind the problem is the "/python3/dist-package"
how do i change it ?
i tried adding the path manually in ~/.bashrc
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages

but still every time i doecho $PYTHONPATH i get
/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages:/home/username/catkin_ws/devel/lib/python3/dist-packages:/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages:/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages:/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages

how do i solve this ?
Please HELP !

A:

So i was able to solve my error by deleting the content inside the BUILD folder and then do catkin_make. So the problem is solved for now and also there was a folder named name python3 in ~/catkin_ws/devel/lib/python3 which reappeared every time i do catkin_make no matter how many times i deleted the folder manually. This time i deleted and it never reappeared. I even removed the manually added PYTHONPATH in my ~/.bashrc so now the echo $PYTHONPATH is /home/username/catkin_ws/devel/lib/python2.7/dist-packages:/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages which I believe is the correct PYTHONPATH. Thanks @gvdhoorn & @Abhishekpg111 for your suggestions.
