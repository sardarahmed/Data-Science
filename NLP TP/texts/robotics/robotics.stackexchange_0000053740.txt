Q:

Problem with tf/Tutorials/Adding a frame (Python)

In section 6 of "tf/Tutorials/Adding a frame (Python)", line to change says:
(trans,rot) = self.tf.lookupTransform("/turtle2", "/carrot1", rospy.Time(0))
I believe it should be:
(trans,rot) = listener.lookupTransform("/turtle2", "/carrot1", rospy.Time(0))
Thanks,
Tim

A:

I guess my real question is how do I correct the tutorials so no one has to waste the time I already wasted?

To answer that: You can just edit the wiki - although just today it's on read-only as it's being moved to another server.
