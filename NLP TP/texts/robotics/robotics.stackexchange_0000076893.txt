Q:

pointCloud2 to pcl::pointcloud conversion

I am using velodyne VLP16. The information I am getting from it is "unordered" pointCloud2. I am having a trouble to translate it to pcl::pointcloud. According to the code provided online [here] (https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/blob/master/velodyne_pointcloud/src/conversions/colors.cc). I can simply get the x,y, and z value of the point from pointCloud2 by using a pcl function without giving the function any information regarding the sensor I am using(layer no. etc). Why is this the case?

A:

I have figured it out thanks to joq's comment. In the /velodyne/velodyne_pointcloud/include/velodyne_pointcloud there is a header file point_types.h. If you are writing a subscribe for velodyne_point you will need to include this header file so pcl_converter is able to interpret the topic and convert is to pcl::pointcloud.  The callback function of the subscriber will do the conversion on the fly as it receives velodyne_point.
