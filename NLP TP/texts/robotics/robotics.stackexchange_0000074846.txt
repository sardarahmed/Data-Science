Q:

how to save the satus of ROS?

I want to shutdown the robot, and restart the robot ,I want to let the robot remember the status before he shutdown?
Any friends can help me?
If I can not save the status, I must move the robot to the start point by hand.

A:

This is impossible, simply because it is not clearly defined, what the status is or what the encompasses. This could be a massive amount of different things, settings, data, etc.
