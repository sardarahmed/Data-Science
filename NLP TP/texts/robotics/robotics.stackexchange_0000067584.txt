Q:

Using msgs from the same package

Hi,
I'm trying to use msgs from the current package.
So usually it's like this, when I'm using a different package:
#include package_name/msg_name
pub_ = nh_.advertise<project_name::msg_name>("topic", 1);

But I'm trying to use the msg I created in the same project package
Let's say my package name is first_package and msg is first_msg, but doing so:
#include first_package/first_msg
pub_ = nh_.advertise<first_project::first_msg>("topic", 1);

Doesnt seem to work. Well why should I import something that is already in my package. What is the correct syntax here?

It is always a good idea to include verbatim any error messages or warnings that you receive. Just stating that it doesn't work is making it really difficult for us to help you.

Also: for almost all msg pkgs, the package_name is used as the namespace for the messages, so in your example package_name and project_name should probably be identical?

I know, it's not a big help, but it may be worthwhile to move your message definition to a separate package (see ros best practices).
Also, try simply copying the tutorial (see tutorials understanding topics) and analysing the differences, helps me usually.

A:

Hi,
Is your #include in the following form with the triangular braces and *.h?
#include <first_package/first_msg.h>

Are you getting an error in the compiling process? If so, what type of error?
Another issue might be the generate/add messages components of your CMakeLists.txt
