Q:

AMCL and other sensor data

I am interested in using AMCL with other sensor data if possible. Does anybody know what kind of other sensor data can be used with AMCL for self-localization other than LIDAR and odometer?

A:

You can use a camera that provides depth info, like the MS Kinect. Lots of info on this if you do a search on the tutorials

Thanks for your answer. How about other sensors such as IMU or GPS? Can we directly input these sensor data to AMCL? or Do we need to do some kind of transformation?

for imu and gps you have to fuse those two to form the odom then you can give that odom to amcl
