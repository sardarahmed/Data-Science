Q:

Where to find rospy functions documentations

Currently going through the ROS tutorials, but I can't seem to find where rospy functions are documented (Not in the roswiki at least). Take for instance this PubSub Tutorial, where should I go to find out what rospy.Publisher does, what are its arguments, and what output does it give?
