Q:

How to manually add messages to tf::MessageFilter?

Hi,
Is it possible to manually add messages to a tf::MessageFilter queue instead of connecting the filter's input to a subscriber? The add(...) methods provided in the API only seem to work with other filters as argument.
Thanks,
-Robert-

I don't see the use case. BTW, why don't you create a publisher and subscribe to it, so instead of add(...) you only have to publish. It'd have the same effect, wouldn't it?

It would, but publisher & subscriber would be in the same node and I don't really need those specific messages anywhere else so I wanted to avoid creating unnecessary topics.

A:

The add method works for messages API docs

Ah, thank you. I tried to directly add the message instead of a pointer - should have checked the API more carefully ...
