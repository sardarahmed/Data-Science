Q:

Forward Kinematics for articulated manipulator not giving right answer

I calculated the forward kinematics for an articulated manipulator robot in ROS, but I am not getting the right answer. Here is the diagram for the robot configuration I used-
When Q1,Q2,and Q3 are zero this calculation is supposed to give the dx,dy and dz as 2,0,1 if I consider all the link lengths as 1.But after I substitute these values of Q1=0,Q2=0, and Q3=0 I get dx,dy, and dz as 2,0,0. I double checked the DH parameters and calculations in Matlab, but the values are still 2,0,0. I am not sure why I am not getting the right answer. Maybe I am getting the right answer, but I don't understand it.
My Matlab calculation after substituting Q1, Q2,and Q3 as 0,0,0-
>> a1

a1 =

     1     0     0     0
     0     0    -1     0
     0     1     0     0
     0     0     0     1

>> a2

a2 =

     1     0     0     1
     0     1     0     0
     0     0     1     0
     0     0     0     1

>> a3

a3 =

     1     0     0     1
     0     1     0     0
     0     0     1     0
     0     0     0     1

>> t06=a1*a2*a3

t03 =

     1     0     0     2
     0     0    -1     0
     0     1     0     0
     0     0     0     1

In my inverse kinematics code when I enter the coordinates of end effector as 2,0,1, I get correct Q values i.e 0,0,0 or 0,0,2Pi.
Where am I going wrong?

A:

You have drawing that shows some vertical distance $d_1$ between your first and second frames:

but on your table you don't have any values for $d_1$:

You didn't show how you built up your matrices, so I can't tell you how/where exactly you went wrong, but I strongly suspect you've dropped your $d_1$ distance. This is what's setting your elevation, so it makes sense to me that you're getting $z=0$ when $d_1=0$.
