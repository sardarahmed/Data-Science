Q:

"Unable to locate package ros-diamondback/electric-nxtall"

My name is Noah and I am a novice programmer looking to use ROS with the NXT Lego robotics kits. I succeeded in installing the generic ROS and am partway through the beginner tutorials even. However, I recently tried to install the ROS NXT release and received the error message in the title. The first thing I realized was that there doesn't seem to be an NXT package for Fuerte, although I don't know if that is an issue for sure. However, I have tried the main ROS server as well as each of the mirrors and cannot locate any of the NXT packages even though looking through the mirrors manually I can even see the packages that I am looking for. Any help would be greatly appreciated. :)
EDIT: Also using a Virtual Machine (VirtualBox) running Ubuntu Precise 12.04 LTS and ROS Fuerte. The command I tried running was:
sudo apt-get install ros-electric-nxtall (also tried for diamondback)
Which returned the following:
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-electric-nxtall
I think what I'm going to try to do is just removing this VM and reinstalling with something like Ubuntu 10.04 and getting ROS Electric, which as far as I can tell will definitely work. I just wanted to avoid doing so as my internet connection is relatively slow and I'd like to avoid wasting the several hours I spent setting ROS up. Oh well though; I guess that's the life of a programmer.

Please post the exact command you ran, along with the exact error message you got.

A:

Debs pre-Fuerte are not available on 12.04. Installing 10.04 like you mentioned will certainly do the trick.
