Q:

Can we call a hidden service?

Hello everyone, I saw that ROS2 use some hidden services.
These services can be displayed with the command

ros2 service --include-hidden-services list -t

When I tried to call one of these services with his type, cli returns me this message : The passed service type is invalid with the type given by the previous command
So, I was wondering if it is possible to call one of theses services ?
Thanks

A:

Hello!
Sorry for the late reply. So, I tried the same thing and it looks like you can't call the service cancel service directly. I am not quite sure of the reasoning behind this but to you can simply cancel the send goal by Ctrl +C the initial request. So exposing that service to be called doesn't really gain the user much.
However,
to get the same functionality in code you simply need to call the function below.
