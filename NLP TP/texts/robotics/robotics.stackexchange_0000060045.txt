Q:

How to republish latest joystick input

Currently the joy node sends a joystick value on update only.  For example if I push the joystick all the way forward I get a single max value of 1.  This value is published only once. A new value is only sent when the joystick moves.  What I would prefer is for the last joy value to keep being published, thus if I push the joystick to its max limit the value of 1 will continue to be published.  Is there something I can add to my joy launch file that will repeat the last received joy message?

Did you try the autorepeat?

Actually,I am a ROS beginner and I just don't know how to do that.Could you give me some further information?Thanks.

A:

You can add
~autorepeat_rate = x

where x is the rate in Hz that the messages will be sent.  This will constantly publish 0 is there is no value.

For those like me that are struggling, this is a parameter of pkg joy, add it as written here: joy wiki. Thanks Tony!

How can I add to my program? Where can I add in my program? How can I control ~autorepeat_rate = x ??

It is in the parameters of your joy node
