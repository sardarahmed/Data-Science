Q:

Catkin_make problem with xacro when installing gazebo

I encountered a problem of xacro when I am trying to install gazebo. which is
CMake Error at /opt/ros/groovy/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:72 (find_package):
CMake Error at /opt/ros/groovy/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:72 (find_package):
Could not find a configuration file for package xacro.
Set xacro_DIR to the directory containing a CMake configuration file for
xacro.  The file will have one of the following names:
xacroConfig.cmake
xacro-config.cmake

I tried to install xacro via ros wiki using  "git clone -b". And it was successfully installed. However the problem still exists. And I have no idea what to do now.
If I try to reinstall the xacro, it will show :
fatal: destination path 'xacro' already exists and is not an empty directory.

A:

In Groovy Xacro hasn't been catkinized yet. So a catkinized package can't depend on it. You could try downloading and compile the catkinized source version (branch: hydro-devel) from GitHub: https://github.com/ros/xacro/tree/hydro-devel
Btw, for using Gazebo I recommend you switch to Hydro.
