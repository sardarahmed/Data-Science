Q:

what are the units in joint_limits.yaml?

Hello!
In joint_limits.yaml, there are two kinds of limits which are max_velocity and max_acceleration.
I wonder what are the units of those limits?
max_velocity : m/s or rpm ?
max_acceleration : m/s2 or rpm/s?
I will be grateful if  any of you could help!
Thank you!
Gu Tianqi!

A:

(I'm assuming this is joint_limits.yaml found in the config sub dir of MoveIt configuration packages)
Just as everything else in ROS (or more precisely: just as everything in ROS should), the joint_limits.yaml file follows the rules described in REP-103: Standard Units of Measure and Coordinate Conventions.
For angles, that would be radians, for lengths, metres.
So:

revolute joints:

position: radians
velocity: radians/sec
acceleration: radians/sec^2
jerk: radians/sec^3

prismatic (or linear) joints:

position: metres
velocity: metres/sec
acceleration: metres/sec^2
jerk: metres/sec^3
