Q:

ROS and Gazebo Integration

Hi,
I am trying to perform a simulation on my laptop. The detailed explanation of my goal is here. I wanted to know which of the two ROS integration ways explained in the tutorials would be better for my purpose ?
I have already installed ROS and then Gazebo. Just need to integrate them.
Thanks,

A:

Hello,
You should create a Gazebo plugin that is ROS enabled: http://gazebosim.org/wiki/Tutorials/1.4/ros_enabled_model_plugin
The above example is for a model plugin, but you can also make a World Plugin.

@nkoenig : In my world model, I have all the models in the .world file and don't have separate models directory. I used the GUI to create my world so the codes were edited in the same .world file. Now if I want to write plugins for .world file, will it be possible ? Also I want to make the robot move from one point to other. Can I do that just by using Gazebo or Do I need to take help from ROS ?
I can post the code of my ".world" file if you want.
Thanks in advance.

You can put plugins in a .world file. You'll need to use ROS to programmatically move a robot.
