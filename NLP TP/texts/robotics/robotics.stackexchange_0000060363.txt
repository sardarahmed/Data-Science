Q:

install system depencies of a ros hydro installation

Hello,
maybe someone can help me with my little problem regarding ROS.
Let's say we have a valid ros hydro installation from source in a none root / system directory (for e.g. installed to a mounted /home partition).
Now i want to use a freshly installed system (means root / partition) without any ros system depencies installed. The guide for installing ros from source only mentions how to install the depencies with rosdep which uses the list of packages in the src directory.
How can i resolve / install all the system-depencies the ros-installation have?
With best regards,
Torsten

A:

You should be able to do this in the same way you would from the folder with sources, i.e.
rosdep install --from-paths /path/to/hydro/install -i --rosdistro hydro
