Q:

Importing a costmap layer from a pgm

I've got a costmap that uses a static, obstacle, inflation, and another custom layer that I wrote. Is there an easy way to load an additional layer drawn on a PGM grayscale image? If not, I could probably manage to analyze the image with python or C++ and add values to a new costmap layer from there. Thanks!

A:

This is actually what the map_server is for. See the documentation for more details.
It takes a  grayscale image (.pgm should work), where whiter pixels are free and darker pixels are occupied.
Remember to also configure the respective yaml file correctly, as described in the documentation.
This map can then be loaded in another static map layer, as described here.
