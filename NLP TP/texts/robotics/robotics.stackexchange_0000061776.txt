Q:

installing polar_scan_matcher wrapper

Hi,
I'm trying to get this package in order to use it or port it to the newest ROS version:
http://wiki.ros.org/polar_scan_matcher
However, I could only find this, which seems to be basically only the scan matching function without the wrapper, which could save me a lot of time:

Do you know where I can find the wrapper?
The github archive points to a library that only seems to be using CSM by Andrea Censi to do the scan matching and not polar scan matching.

A:

If you install Scan_tools you could use the Polar Scan Matching directly. Check the wiki and enter to the git files for clearer install instructions. You'll find everything from the previous link.
Best!

Note that scan_tools is recently released into Indigo and Jade so that you don't need to source build it.
