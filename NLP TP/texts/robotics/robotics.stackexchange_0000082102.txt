Q:

Problems RVIZ no fixed frame

Hi everybody,
i'm working on RVIZ but can't set a fixed frame. There is no selection option in the dropdown.
i get the error message: No tf data. Actual error: Fixed Frame [base] does not exist.
roswtf command return this error:
ERROR The following nodes should be connected but aren't:

/rviz_1501573816403560019->/rosout (/rosout)
/base_to_world->/rviz_1501573816403560019 (/tf_static)
/robot_ref_publisher->/rviz_1501573816403560019 (/tf)
/ref_base_to_world->/rviz_1501573816403560019 (/tf_static)
/robot_state_publisher->/rviz_1501573816403560019 (/tf)

Please see if you can help. Thanks!

What dropdown are you referring to? We'll need more information (such as screen shots, tf tree, etc.) to go off of.

I refer to dropdown fixed frame for set the global options. I have add screen shots of rviz and tf tree. (build with command rgt_tf_tree).
i hope someone can help me!

It would be helpful for the site (and its users!) if you copy and paste the terminal output (first screenshot) here and used the formatting button to make it readable.

A:

The error from roswtf isn't always a problem. I believe that it could be just that it's taking longer than the timeout limit of roswtf to connect.
As for the fixed frame issue in rviz, you're looking in the wrong dropdown to set the fixed frame. Go to Global options then set the Fixed Frame option from there.

Many thanks for your response!
I can't set a Fixed Frame at global options because the dropdown is empty.
Is the tf tree correct?
Do i need to connect Rviz / tf ?

It was a network configuration error!
