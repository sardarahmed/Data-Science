Q:

robot_upstart perminantly change ownership

Hi,
I am using robot_upstart to launch my code. My code needs to access several ports that are owned by root (dev/USB0, dev/USB1, dev/ACM0, etc...). I changed the owner of these files to the same user that I used to run the robot_upstart intall script by running sudo chown ubuntu /[file name]
Now I've restarted the computer which has changed the ownership back to root. I started researching how to change the ownership permanently but some people were saying that this is bad practice. Is this so? If so how should I fix this? If not how to I change the owner permanently?
Thanks in advance!

A:

Note the section in the docs that tell you that robot_upstart does not run under your own user:

The roslaunch which executes does not have its userâ€™s group memberships.

Adding your user to dialout does not work.
See robot_upstart: could not open port /dev/ttyUSB0 for a related question (almost a duplicate, really).

That does not make sense.The script uses setuidgid and sets to the user specified, which is in the diarlout group. When I do the same thing in my case and look at the processes run in htop the process  user is correct. So how can the process run as the specified ser but not have the permissions user
