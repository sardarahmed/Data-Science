Q:

Vrep_ros_bridge installation problem

Hello:
I'm trying to install the vrep_ros_bridge package without success. I'm working under Ubuntu 12.04 and ROS Hydro distribution.
I followed the installation tutorials, but when i execute catkin_make in my workspace this error appears:
    Building CXX object vrep_ros_bridge-indigo-devel/vrep_ros_plugin/src/CMakeFiles/v_repExtRosBridge.dir/v_repExtRosBridge.cpp.o

Any idea about this problem? My ROS Hydro packages are updated to last version. Thank you in advance!

A:

I am able to solve the installation problem. It is not a problem with VREP_ROS_BRIDGE, is a problem with pluginlib libraries.
Modifying /opr/ros/hydro/include/pluginlib/class_loader.h, including "#define  TIXML_USE_STL" just before #include "tinyxml.h" solves the problem.
