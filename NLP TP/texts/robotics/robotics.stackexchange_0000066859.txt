Q:

Permission Denied

I am on Ubuntu 10.04 and I have ROS Electric installed.
I am following these instructions and I am on Step 3 (Generating the URDF): http://wiki.ros.org/nxt_lxf2urdf/Tutorials/Creating%20a%20simple%20robot%20model%20using%20lxf2urdf.py#Renaming_and_Positioning_Links
When I input the command rosrun nxt_lxf2urdf lxf2urdf.py robot.lxf robot.ldr >robot.urdf I get:
[rospack] WARNING: cannot create rospack cache directory: Permission denied
[rospack] WARNING: cannot create rospack cache directory: Permission denied
[rospack] Unable to create temporary cache file /root/.ros/.rospack_cache.cSxwgs: Permission denied

What to do? I am fairly new to Ubuntu and ROS.

The error seems to suggest you once ran things as the root user ("[..] file /root/.ros/.."). Can you think of a reason why that would be the case? Your normal user does not have access to that directory, but a typical ROS installation wouldn't need a dir in /root/ either.

Well whenever I do anything in the terminal I always input this command: sudo -i

Nevermind I got it. I input the command sudo -s and it worked. Thanks

Why do you use sudo? A normal ROS installation shouldn't need it?
If you need it to access (serial) devices, please see Rosrun as super user.

I have the same issue. I believe the problem is due to having a different partition for /home during installation of ubuntu.
sudo gives the right permissions to make any file edits. There should be a work around, but I have not yet figured it out. Any ideas?

Your own user should be able to access its own files. If not, that is a system configuration issue, and should be fixed. That would seem to be something not related to ROS, so I would suggest asking it over at Ask Ubuntu or a similar forum.

You can try rosdep fix-permissions as a workaround, it worked for me
