Q:

image_proc/crop_decimate initialization problems

Hi all
I am having a lot of problems with crop_decimate nodelet. I am using a auto starting launch script which launches camera1394 -> debayer -> crop_decimate nodelets.
It seems that 80% of the times, the crop_decimate nodelet will not launch properly, however if I launch it after a delay, the problem disappears. By not launching properly I mean that the crop_decimate nodelet exists, but it never publishes any images.
Has anybody else seen this problem? My current hacky solution of delayed launching of the crop_decimate nodelet is not very elegant, and I would rather not do it.

A:

What version of image_pipeline are you using? (On the command line, do rosversion image_pipeline)
Prior to 1.6.4, all of the image processing nodelets had race conditions on startup that could cause your problem. So make sure you're using image_pipeline 1.6.4.
