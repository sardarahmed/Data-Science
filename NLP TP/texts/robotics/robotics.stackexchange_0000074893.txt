Q:

explanation of use_map_topic in amcl?

In AMCL page, for use_map_topic it says "When set to true, AMCL will subscribe to the map topic rather than making a service call to receive its map." but i dont get it. can someone explain it?
I created map with gmapping and saved it. After when i try to localize the robot in the static map  how should i set this parameter?

A:

If you created a map in advance, you also need the map_server to publish the map. I think in this case it doesn't really matter whether you use the map-topic or the map-service, as map_server provides both. So you can leave the parameter to false here. But other map providers like mappers might provide only the topic or the service.
