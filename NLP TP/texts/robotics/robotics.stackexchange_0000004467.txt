Q:

Need to clear some concepts: AHRS - Attitude - Yaw,Pitch and Roll - MARG sensors -INS

it's been while since I started reading about INS, orientation and so for quadrotors . 
I faced the following terms : AHRS - Attitude - Yaw,Pitch and Roll - MARG sensors
I know for example how to calculate Yaw,Pitch and Roll , but does it related to Attitude ? 
What's Attitude  any way and how it get calculated ?
AHRS "Attitude and heading reference system" does it formed from Yaw,Pitch and Roll ? 
MARG(Magnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity) ? how it's related to other terms ? 
What about INS ( Inertial Navigation Systems ) ? 
My questions here are about these concepts, and there meaning , how they cooperate with each other , how they got calculated and which sensors suits for what ?

A:

When talking about vehicles (such as aircraft), attitude is just a fancy word for "orientation": the combination of yaw, pitch, and roll.  These would be easy to calculate if the plane was just standing still; you'd use a compass to get the yaw, and a plumb bob to measure the pitch and roll.  However, the acceleration or deceleration of the aircraft would severely alter these measurements.  

Gyroscopes measure angular velocity but can't measure position, velocity, or acceleration.  (Fortunately, they aren't affected by it either.)
Accelerometers can measure the force on an object (either real forces like gravity or perceived forces like centrifugal force).  This measurement is often integrated to estimate velocity, or double-integrated to estimate position (both of which become increasingly inaccurate with time).
Magnetometers measure the magnitude and direction of magnetic fields.

Regarding the other terms: IMUs produce some subset of MARG data (some have more sensors than others).  MARG data is used by an AHRS system to compute attitude (roll, pitch, yaw).  MARG data (optionally combined with other sensor data) is used by an INS system to compute both attitude and position.
