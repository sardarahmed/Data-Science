Q:

GPS data from smartphone

Hello,
I want to add GPS data to my project in order to improve robot localization estimate.
I've read that some people did this successfully using an external GPS device.
However, I would like to do this by pulling the GPS data from a smartphone.
A few questions:

Does someone have already done this? I did some research but I couldn't find it.

How could I pull the GPS data from the smartphone?

Does the smartphone output the GPS data in the same format as a regular GPS device?

Thanks!

A:

If you are using an Android device, you might try the android_sensors_driver (Google play link). This has worked relatively well for me in the past.

My intention was to use a Windows phone, but in case I don't manage to do it I will end up using an Android device. This package you mentioned seems really good, I will take a look. Thanks!

ROS support for Windows phone is non-existent (afaik). You might be able to get one of the c# implementations to work on it, but it is probably going to take some effort.
