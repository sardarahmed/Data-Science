Q:

ROS offline installation

Hello Everyone,
I am trying to figure out a way to download ROS offline installer, so that I don't need to download it again and again for installing on different machines. So I am looking for such a way to download once and be able to install offline on different machines.
Does anyone know how would I do that? ( I cant find the offline installer downloadable anywhere on the web :| )
Any help will be appreciated.
Thanks!!

A:

I know you posted this on ros-users, but I'll chime in again that when we do not want to download, like Nicola Fioraio mentioned, we install on one computer and then find and copy the archives from /var/cache/apt/archives.
This saves some time, since we can transfer over gigabit/flashdrive and then put the packages on a new computer. Then we just run the sudo apt-get install with all/most of the packages already present.
You might also want to look into setting up your own local ros mirror.  Downloading at 50 MB/s makes things nice. :D
