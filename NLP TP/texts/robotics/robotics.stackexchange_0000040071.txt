Q:

booleans not shown in 'rostopic echo -p /topic'

My issue was that a boolean field (bool) in my custom message was displayed when using 'rostopic echo /topic_name' but not when using 'rostopic echo -p /topic_name'.
I want to use the -p option to get a more concise output with 'rostopic echo -p /topic > file.txt'  for use with Matlab. (The time it takes for Matlab to parse file.txt is significant, which is why I want the -p option)
