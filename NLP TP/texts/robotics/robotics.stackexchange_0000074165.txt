Q:

How to move TurtleBot in gazebo 7

Hello,
I am trying to simulate at TurtleBot in Gazebo 7 (with Kinetic Kame), however I am having sending a velocity to the simulated robot. I was able to fix the xacro files to properly create a URDF that Kinetic Kame liked, and  I am also able to receive the Kinect data. However, I am unable to send velocity commands from the nodelet to Gazebo.
Looking into the Gazebo 7 documentation, I noticed that I am expected to use ros_control controllers to received data in Gazebo. However, I could not find where in the URDF the existing Indigo implementation of the controllers was. I tried looking in the Koubki configuration file, but all I saw was link and joint information.
Are controllers used in Indigo? If so, where can I find them to modify them? Am I approaching this wrong? If so, how should I fix this?

Hi, I'm trying to resolve this myself but noticed that they are working on it on the issue :) "Will turtlebot be released & supported on Kinetic? #219".
