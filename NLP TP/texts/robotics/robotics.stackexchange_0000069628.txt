Q:

Get an odom from scan

Hi everyone,
I look for a package that can compute an odometry based on laser (for a robot without odometry, of course)
I have tested the odometry generated with hectorslam and it missed the Twist parameter within the odometry.
Did I miss something ?

A:

Check out laser_scan_matcher. If all you want is odometry, hector slam is probably overkill.

Is the calculation of odometry from laser scan data what people typically call "visual odometry"?  I always thought they were talking about calculating odometry from a video camera feed.  But this makes way way more sense.

Visual odometry does indeed refer to using camera data to calculate egomotion. I don't know if there's a good general term for using laser data for the same purpose.

Visual odometry is the new fashion :-) .No seriously, I prefer using a good laser for the moment.
Laser_scan_matcher seems to do the job I need if I dont use hectorslam for the same purpose.

By the way, I will make a new thread about how I struggle to set up hectorslam and navstack on my robot (the one without odom)
Comment by Dan Lazewatsky on 2015-09-15:
Good luck. I've also had trouble getting hector slam working reliably on a robot with no odom.

And you succeed ?
Comment by Dan Lazewatsky on 2015-09-16:
Not really.
Comment by TomSon on 2015-09-21:
My bad, it's seems that laser_scan_matcher dont provide an odometry, that's not what I'm looking for.
Sorry I was too enthousiast. Do you have another solution ?
