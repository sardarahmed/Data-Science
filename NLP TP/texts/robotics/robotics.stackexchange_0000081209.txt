Q:

create a nodelet launch file

I have managed to build a nodelet (tegra_stereo) and it is detected when I run "rospack plugins --attrib=plugin nodelet"
 image_view /home/ashwath/catkin_ws/src/image_pipeline/image_view/nodelet_plugins.xml
 image_proc /home/ashwath/catkin_ws/src/image_pipeline/image_proc/nodelet_plugins.xml
 image_rotate /home/ashwath/catkin_ws/src/image_pipeline/image_rotate/nodelet_plugins.xml
 image_publisher /home/ashwath/catkin_ws/src/image_pipeline/image_publisher/nodelet_plugins.xml
 stereo_image_proc /home/ashwath/catkin_ws/src/image_pipeline/stereo_image_proc/nodelet_plugins.xml
 depth_image_proc /home/ashwath/catkin_ws/src/image_pipeline/depth_image_proc/nodelet_plugins.xml
 tegra_stereo /home/ashwath/catkin_ws/src/tegra_stereo/nodelet_plugins.xml
 pointgrey_camera_driver/home/ashwath/catkin_ws/src/pointgrey_camera_driver/pointgrey_camera_driver/nodelet_plugins.xml

I want to run the nodelet. I couldn't find any helpful tutorial to do that. How do I start the nodelet? Or how to call the nodelet on another ros program?
Update 2
I could launch the nodelet using the following launch file.
<launch>
<node pkg="nodelet" type="nodelet" name="standalone_nodelet"  args="manager"/>
<node pkg="nodelet" type="nodelet" name="tegra" args="load tegra_stereo/tegra_stereo_proc 
standalone_nodelet" output="screen">
 </node>          
</launch>

This is what I get on rqt_graph

standalone_nodelet doesn't connect to tegra_stereo
This is on my rostopic list
/clock
/kitti_stereo/left/camera_info 
/kitti_stereo/left/image_rect
/kitti_stereo/right/camera_info
/kitti_stereo/right/image_rect

/tf
The nodelet subscribes to the following topics but it does not work for me. There are no messages on the /stereo topics.
Any insights on doing this?
Thanks!

What does rostopic info /kitti_stereo/left/image_rect and rostopic info /kitti_stereo/right/image_rect show?  Also what does rosnode info on the rosbag node show?
Comment by ashwath1993 on 2017-06-09:
Subscirbers : None for both left and right.
Node [/play_1497032227332749755]
rosnode info for the bag shows the default rosbag services and the publications of the rosbag. Connection is with /rosout only

@lucasw, i added the update to the quesiton.

A:

http://wiki.ros.org/nodelet/Tutorials/Running%20a%20nodelet has a copy of this example nodelet launch file https://github.com/ros/common_tutorials/blob/indigo-devel/nodelet_tutorial_math/plus.launch

Yes, I have tried this. It launches the nodelet. I am not able to communicate with it. The nodelet subscribes to 2 image topics. When I play the rosbag with the 2 image topics, I can see the topics on rostopic list, but no output from the nodelet as no connection forms between the bag and nodelet
Comment by lucasw on 2017-06-09:
Do you have a nodelet manager running?
<node pkg="nodelet" type="nodelet" name="standalone_nodelet"  args="manager"/>

Comment by ashwath1993 on 2017-06-09:
I did that. It connects the nodes now. But one of the nodes dies. "[standalone_nodelet-2] process has died [pid 27763, exit code -6, cmd /opt/ros/kinetic/lib/nodelet/nodelet manager __name:=standalone_nodelet" I don't understand the error
Comment by lucasw on 2017-06-12:
You could make a new question that is focused on the tegra_stereo nodelet (and has that in the title so people familiar with it can see it).  Other than that you would have to debug the nodelet yourself http://answers.ros.org/question/35171/how-to-debug-nodelet-manager-crashes/

Also check the tegra_stereo github page for alternate branches or more up to date versions to try out.
