Q:

Can I use "GZSDF" to convert an URDF file into a SDF file?

Can I use "GZSDF" to convert an URDF file into a SDF file???
-I have my urdf(01-myfirstyo.urdf) in the next path:
/home/john/ros/01-myfirstyo.urdf

I tried several methods to convert an urdf file into a sdf file (with gzdf in ROS FUERTE) and they didnt work:

FIRST TRY:
john@john-K53SD:/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/simulator_gazebo/gazebo$ source setup.bash
john@john-K53SD:/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/simulator_gazebo/gazebo$ ./gazebo/bin/gzsdf print /home/john/ros/01-myfirstyo.urdf
Warning [parser.cc:348] Gazebo SDF has no gazebo element
Error [parser.cc:263] parse as old deprecated model file failed.
Error: SDF parsing the xml failed
SECOND TRY:
john@john-K53SD:/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/simulator_gazebo/gazebo$ source setup.bash
john@john-K53SD:/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/simulator_gazebo/gazebo$ ./gazebo/bin/gzsdf convert /home/john/ros/01-myfirstyo.urdf
Error: Unknown option[convert]
This tool provides information about SDF files.
gzsdf  [file]
Commands:
describe   Print the SDF format.

check      Check the SDF format for the given file.

print      Prints SDF, useful for debugging parser and as a conversion tool.

Please tell me what am i doing wrong???

Hi,
I had a similar error in fuerte. After I had installed the groovy I have completed the conversion without error by command:
gzsdf print *.urdf

Was you conversion in fact correct? In my case it only properly converted visual properties.

Conversion was correct after I had deleted all xacro properties like "${M_PI/2}"
