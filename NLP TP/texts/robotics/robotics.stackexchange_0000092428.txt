A:

To check the status of gmapping in ROS Melodic, see #q303253 (the procedure, not necessarily the answer itself of course).
For building it yourself from sources, see #q300480.

I agree with the answer by @gvdhoorn
As I've just stumbled upon this: gmapping has been released into melodic two days ago. So it should be available with the next sync...

@mgruhler: I've just updated #q300480. Not all of gmapping has been released, but it most likely will be (ref the referenced issue).

@gvdhoorn: you are correct. I missed that the link to the rosdistro PR from ros-perception/slam_gmapping is actually pointing to the PR for ros-perception/openslam_gmapping.
