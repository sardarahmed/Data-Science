Q:

Do we need to publish image topic for "Gazebo camera sensor"?

Hi!
I'm following this tutorial and another similar solution to add an camera for my simulation. Basically what I did is adding one "Gazebo camera" block in my robot urdf.
However I could find the image topic using "rostopic" after I upload my "robot_description". So does it mean that "robot state publisher" will NOT publish the image topic automatically?
If yes, could I publish the image topic with, e.g. image transport?
Thanks!

A:

robot_state_publisher only publishes kinematic information (joint frames), not sensor information. If you are using the gazebo_ros_prosilica plugin, then that plugin should be publishing the camera topics.
