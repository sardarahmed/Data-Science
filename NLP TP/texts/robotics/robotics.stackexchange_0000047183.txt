Q:

Gazebo SDF model loading in Groovy

I have a correct Gazebo 1.2 model, slightly modified from the Gazebo tutorial. If that model with it's manifest.xml is in ~/.gazebo/models, then Gazebo of ROS can see and load this model.
Now I would like to load this model with the spawn_model script of ROS gazebo package.
I have tried this command:
rosrun gazebo spawn_model -gazebo -file /home/ronald/catkin_ws/src/gazebo_heightmap/Media/models/robot1/model.sdf -model myrobot

and tried with this launch file
<launch>
<param name="robot_model" textfile="$(find gazebo_heightmap)/Media/models/robot1/model.sdf" />
<node name="spawn_robot1" pkg="gazebo" type="spawn_model" args="-gazebo -param robot_model -model myrobot" respawn="false" output="screen" />
</launch>

In both cases, Gazebo node gives error messages
Error [parser.cc:675] XML Element[origin], child of element[model] not defined in SDF. Ignoring.[model]
Error [parser.cc:666] Error reading element <model>
Error [parser.cc:366] Unable to read element <gazebo>
Error:   Could not find the 'robot' element in the xml file
     at line 61 in /tmp/buildd/ros-groovy-urdfdom-0.2.6-1precise-20121225-1343/urdf_parser/src/model.cpp
Error [parser_urdf.cc:1659] Unable to call parseURDF on robot model
Warning [parser.cc:374] Gazebo SDF has no <gazebo> element in file[urdf string]
Error [parser.cc:318] parse as old urdf model file failed.
Error [World.cc:1190] Unable to read sdf string

To me it seems that the model description files must be different to load it with spawn_model, but how?
Update:
The model does not contain  element, as suggested.
The model also loads if it is included in a world description file. Just the spawn_model does not work.

Starting since Sep 2012, all gazebo related questions should be asked on new gazebo specific QA community. Thank you for your cooperation!
See also this thread.

I keep, however, the thread open since the discussion has already been going on.

But Gazebo can load this model easily, it seems just the spawn_model node that can't load the model. Isn't this node part of ROS?

Personally I agree with you. But the developers of Gazebo want all Qs to move to the new QA site. Please see the link I cited.

A:

It appears that the problem is not with your launch code but with your description file in the sdf format. The first line of the error messages says that you have used an element called , however there are no origins defined in sdf, and gazebo defines  instead.
I didn't see any origin in the tutorial page you referenced however, were you to post the sdf file, that may help.
cheers

Link to the model file was included in the first post also : http://pastebin.com/Q0nLVDLa
There is no  tag used anywhere.

well what version of gazebo is installed?
Comment by r0nald on 2013-01-13:
It is Gazebo-1.2.5 that come with Groovy.

You're also mixing ' and " this could also lead to problems perhaps? I see the tutorial mixes them also but I think it caused problems in my simulation.
