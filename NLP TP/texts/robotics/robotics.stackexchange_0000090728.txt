Q:

E: unable to locate package ros-kinetic-desktop-full on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

I have followed the instructions at http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu word by word and

sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-desktop-full

has failed on my Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with the error message in the subject of my query above.
Anyone know what could be the problem?

the keyserver succeeded and yes, I can ping sites on web so connected, and non of -desktop or -ros-base succeeded either, giving the same "not found" message

What is the output of:

uname -a
cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list
lsb_release -a
sudo apt update
apt-cache search ros-kinetic-ros-base
