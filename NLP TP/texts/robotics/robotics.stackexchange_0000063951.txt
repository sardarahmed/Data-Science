Of course, this is not normal. Have you followed all the steps carefully? When does the failure occur? Is it during catkin_make command? In case, the other previous steps have ended correctly?
Comment by Tal on 2014-11-11:
during catkin_make. i do all the steps. all other command ended correctly.

A:

just delete all the rosjava folder and just do it again from begin, and it work.
maybe the git was updated?
maybe i install more sdk? then it work?
I am not really sure. but now it working.

It happen me again when i just delete some file from devel folder.
Make sure you close all app in the computer. this compilation is hard job, and if it stop at the middle, you probable
get this errors messages.
then just delete build and devel folder in ~/rosjava folder, then catkin_make.
good luck!
