Q:

Option in World file to make camera follow model

Is there a way to edit the world file to have the camera follow the model?  I am rerunning the same simulation right now and trying to save time instead of right-clicking my model and selecting "Follow"

A:

To summarize, in case the tutorial changes...
You add the following to your .world file, which would track target_model from 3 meters behind it:
<gui fullscreen='0'>
     <camera name="user_camera">
        <track_visual>
          <name>target_model</name>
          <static>true</static>
          <use_model_frame>true</use_model_frame>
          <xyz>-3 0 0</xyz>
          <inherit_yaw>true</inherit_yaw>
        </track_visual>
    </camera>
</gui>
