Q:

Alternative approach to gmapping and hector-mapping?

Hi there,
i'm new to this forum and hope to ask my question the right way.
I started to work with ROS. To get used to it i tested some SLAM algorithm to get a occupancy grid map.
The first one was gmapping(http:// wiki.ros.org/ gmapping), the second one was
hector_mapping(http:// wiki.ros.org/ hector_slam), both worked fine for me.
Now im searching for some other algorithm for comparsion and wanted to ask if you can commend some others.
They should be easy to use like gmapping and hector_mapping.
Im using laserdata and odometry but its not neccessary that the algorithm using both.
Thanks for your help.
Sascha
