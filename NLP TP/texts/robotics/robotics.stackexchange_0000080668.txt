Q:

unable to locate package ros-hydro-rviz

Hey all,
I'm a bleeding raw beginner with ROS so please tread gently. I am trying to install the package ros-hydro-rviz using this command sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-rviz  but am getting the message that it cannot be located.
My OS is Ubuntu Xenial.

A:

You cannot install Hydro packages on a ROS Kinetic install.
Try ros-kinetic-rviz.
But depending on how you installed ROS that package will have already been installed for you (as part of the ros-kinetic-desktop or ros-kinetic-desktop-full).
See REP 3 - Target Platforms and REP 142 - ROS Indigo and Newer Metapackages for reference.

Thanks, it looks like it is already installed.
Onto resolving the next problem: Cannot connect to ROS Master....
