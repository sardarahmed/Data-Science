Q:

E: unable to locate package ros-indigo-desktop-full

I have followed the ROS site's instructions on installing ROS indigo on Trusty Ubuntu through virtualbox, but I get this error. I know indigo is now released, which was the previous problem for a couple of questions

Did you add the ROS repository to your list of repos

More specifically, can you paste the result of cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list' command?

@130s   Not sure if this question is still active but worth a shot. I tried installing jade on my 14.04 and it is not allowing me to setup my sources. Whenever I try the command to setup it up as the tutorial says my terminal simply breaks a new line and does nothing.

And cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list does the same... breaks a line and does nothing, forcing me to Crtl + C

@preto please open a new question. Comment sections is not supposed to ask a new one (and you won't get as much attention).

A:

That is weird if you followed the instructions. Did you do all of those steps?
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu trusty main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-desktop-full

Thanks, I'm newer to Linux so reading the instructions I wasn't sure what the commands for each step were. So writing them out as commands really helped. It's installing for me now.
