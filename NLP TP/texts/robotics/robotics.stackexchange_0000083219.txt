Q:

Turtlebot moving circles with map

Hi guys ,
I try to move my turtlebot with a map. I finished my example where i give a point to my bot. After he got the point he moves to the point but he drive in circles. When i start the script two times he moves correctly most of the time.
Can somebody help me?
I use Ros Kinetic with Gazebo 7.0. First of all i start gazebo:
roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch
after this i load the map:
roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo amcl_demo.launch
After this i use a script to move to a point or a bunch of points with my robot. Sometimes the robot drives in the direction of the point but he circles around while he moves. He rotates around 360 degree drives a bit further then he stop and rotates again. Most of the time i need to restart the script and he drives straight to the point without any circles.
I used  this script as a foundation for my purpose:

Please edit your question to provide more information. A video of the behavior would be preferable, as well as a full description of how to reproduce your problem. See http://wiki.ros.org/Support for guidelines on asking questions.

A:

This sounds like a common behavior if the robot gets close to the goal, but is just outside it's tolerance. So it drives in a small circle to try to get closer to the goal position than it's current pose.
There's a guide for tuning the navigation stack here with links to several other resources: http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/Navigation%20Tuning%20Guide
You probably want to slightly increase the tolerance for the goals so that the robot doesn't continue to hunt once it gets there.
