Q:

using multiple phidgets imus

I am new to ROS and am trying to use multiple Phidgets IMU's simultaneously. One IMU works great but it seems like modifications would need to be made in order to read from multiple IMUs simultaneously. What is the best way to approach this?

A:

Try launching your nodes (or entire launch file) under a different namespace. That allows you to start multiple instances without needing to make any modifications to the nodes or their launch files.
