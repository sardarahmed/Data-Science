Q:

Where should I install navigation package, in kinetic/share folder or catkin/src

can anyone tell me about the difference between
git clone http(package repository)
and
apt-get install ros-kinetic-package

A:

The first gets you a copy of a set of source files, the second a set of binary artefacts that include everything needed to actually use the package.
