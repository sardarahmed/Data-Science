Q:

rosdep initialization error

I have installed Ubuntu 12.10 a day back. And I'm trying to install ROS. I have installed ros-groovy-destop-full. When I try to initialise rosdep, I get error.

sudo rosdep init

ERROR: cannot download default sources list from:
...
Website may be down.

But when I copy the address and paste into web browser, the links works. I am running behind proxy (with username/password), so it may be problem of proxy. But I have put proxy details in /etc/apt/apt.conf and apt-get is working fine behind proxy. How do I resolve this issue?

As of today, it seems to work with proxies just fine. The key hint is that you need to use
sudo -E rosdep init
to propagate the environmental variables.

@cmansley : I get the same error even with the ' sudo -E rosdep init ' Just did a clean install of ROS Indigo, but still can't rosdep init. Same error: ERROR: cannot download default sources list from: ... Website may be down. Any other ideas?

I still get this error in 2016 (ubuntu 14.04.2 + ROS indigo). Has anyone been able to find a definitive a solution for this? Proxies didn't solved the problem for me, I still get this error when I try any "rosdep init", "sudo rosdep init" or "sudo -E rosdep init".

A:

Have you tried to configure a system wide proxy in /etc/environment? Add something similar to this to /etc/environment
http_proxy=http://[user:password@]proxy_server:port/
https_proxy=https://[user:password@]proxy_server:port/

I guess rosdep init directly downloads the file from the link and does not use apt to get the file. So your proxy config for apt will not be used...

I opened a ticket https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rosdep/issues/271 to add support for being behind a proxy.

Can 'rosdep init / update'  be done without connecting to net?
Comment by tfoote on 2014-05-22:
They both need network resources so no they can not be done offline.

For example, if my rasp has:

Username: pi
Password: raspberry
Proxy_server: 192.168.1.100
Port: 808

I will add:
http_proxy=http://pi:raspberry@192.169.1.100:808/
https_proxy=https://pi:raspberry@192.169.1.100:808/

Is it correct format?

Yes. It reads ok.
