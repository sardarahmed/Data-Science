Q:

Loop over $ rostopic pub ..... on NAO

Hello
I would  like to have loop over the following command
rostopic pub /joint_angles nao_msgs/JointAnglesWithSpeed -- '[ 1, now, Head]' '[HeadYaw,HeadPitch]' '[1,-1]'  1.0  0
It means I would like NAO continuously with certain frequency can moves its head.
I will appreciate if you help me
