Q:

Possible error in 'Quaternions' tutorial

Hi, I tried transforming roll, pitch, yaw angles to a quaternion in python following this tutorial (http://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Tutorials/Quaternions). In subtopic 3 "Think in RPY then convert to quaternion" the import statement is from tf_conversions.transformations import quaternion_from_euler. When trying to run my node python said that it can't find the module tf_conversions.transformations. I tried many things and finally looked into the source code of the package. Turns out that the import has to be from tf.transformations import quaternion_from_euler, because the quaternion_from_euler function is located in this file: https://github.com/ros/geometry/blob/noetic-devel/tf/src/tf/transformations.py.
I am not sure how to correct the tutorial page but maybe this help somebody to change it or at least get the import right. I was struggling with this for 2 straight hours thinking the tutorial was right...

Please correct it! I think you just need to click the Login button then make an account.

I know you are completely true.
From next time follow these links for documentation for the enhancement document.
http://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/tf/html/python/
http://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/
Over here you can get a list of all packages that are launched with particular distribution and their functions.
