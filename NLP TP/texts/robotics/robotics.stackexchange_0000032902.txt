Q:

modular_cloud_matcher compilation error

Hi
Trying to get extrinsics between a kinect camera and a robot, I've compiled libpointmatcher and libnao and finally compiling Automatic Calibration of Extrinsic Parameters from here 
However modular_cloud_matcher is complaining about a missing member in ICPSequence class in the Core.cpp of pointmatcher library.

/home/cogx/code/ros/ros mapping/modular_cloud_matcher/src/modular_cloud_matcher_bag.cpp:351:27: error: ‘struct MetricSpaceAligner::ICPSequence’ has no member named ‘hasKeyFrame’

I guess this is due to a change in the API.
How should one proceed? Thanks.

A:

This is now fixed by Stephane Magnenat, git pull to get the changes in libpointmatcher library.
