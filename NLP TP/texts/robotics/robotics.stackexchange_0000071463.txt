Q:

How can I move a dynamixel AX-12A motor with a python script?

I want to move two dynamixel ax-12a motors, one as pan and the other as tilt.
Writing the comands in the shell works fine e.g.
rostopic pub -1 /pan_controller/command std_msgs/Float64 -- 1.5
Now I want to move them by writing a python srcipt but I don't know which command I need to use.
Thanks for your help!

A:

Just publish on /pan_controller/command messages of type std_msgs/Float64. Here's how to.
Line 7 would look like:
pub = rospy.Publisher('/pan_controller/command', Float64, queue_size=10)

and 13 like:
pub.publish(1.5)
