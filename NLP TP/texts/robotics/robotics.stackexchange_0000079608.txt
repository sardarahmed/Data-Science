A:

The ROS install instructions specifically state that only Ubuntu 15.10 and 16.04 are supported; you cannot install ROS through apt on 16.10.
I recommend that you switch to Ubuntu 16.04 (it's their long-term stable release anyway) or install from source.

Indeed:

ROS Kinetic ONLY supports [..] Xenial (Ubuntu 16.04) [..] with debian packages

I tried installing from source , but its showing error .
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved

to system dependencies:
rosconsole: No definition of [rosunit] for OS version [yakkety]
?

If you have no real need to run 16.10, I strongly advise you install 16.04 and use the provided binaries. It will save you a lot of effort and (potential) frustration.
If you must build from source, you'll have to override the OS detection. See http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/EnvironmentVariables.
