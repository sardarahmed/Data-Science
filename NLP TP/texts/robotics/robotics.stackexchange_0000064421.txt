Q:

How to change/remap ros node name in launch file?

Hi,
I would like to rename a node from a launch file which includes other launch file.
Is it possible?? If yes then how is it done.
Here is a launch file I am using. The included launch file names the node as turtlebot_teleop_keyboard. I want to rename the node launched in the included launch file. The following launch file does not rename the node.
<launch>
     <include file="$(find turtlebot_teleop)/launch/keyboard_teleop.launch"/>
     <remap from="turtlebot_teleop_keyboard" to="teleop"/>
</launch>

A:

According to the docs (http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML/remap) remap affects all subsequent nodes.
Therefore you might want to try:
<launch>
   <remap from="turtlebot_teleop_keyboard" to="teleop"/>
   <include file="$(find turtlebot_teleop)/launch/keyboard_teleop.launch"/>
</launch>

Update:
I have tried it with a simple example and having the remap tag before the node tag is the correct way:
<launch>
    <remap from="chatter" to="foobar"/>
    <node pkg="rospy_tutorials" type="talker" name="talker"/>
</launch>

Are you sure your teleop node actually has that topic? It looks the launch file you are using might already perform some kind of remapping internally: https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot_apps/blob/9ab88c750754aab1c5b26ad68a03f5e1041207fd/turtlebot_teleop/launch/keyboard_teleop.launch
Update 2: this only describes how to remap a topic. Remapping a node name is not possible using roslaunch. If you have control over the launch file you can use an argument to allow passing in a different name for the node name.

It still does not work. I am using hydro on Ubuntu 12.04. The output of rosnode list is
/rosout
/turtlebot_teleop_keyboard

Comment by arp on 2014-12-15:
I commented the remapping so file looks like:
<launch>
  <node pkg="turtlebot_teleop" type="turtlebot_teleop_key" name="turltebot_teleop_keyboard"/>
</launch>

I includeed this launch file and tried your answer and it does not rename the node. Does that mean I can't rename nodes?

Just to clarify. I am trying to rename a node after launching not the topics.
Comment by Dirk Thomas on 2014-12-15:
What do you mean when you say "rename a node after launching"?
Comment by arp on 2014-12-17:
In the example where you remap the topic from chatter to foobar, the node is of type talker and it's name is "talker".  Can I change the node-name "talker" to "speaker"??
