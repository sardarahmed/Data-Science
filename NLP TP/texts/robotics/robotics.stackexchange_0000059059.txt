Q:

ogre build fails with freetype.h error, OS X 10.8, Hydro

While trying to install Hydro on OS X 10.8, with XCode 5.0.2, installing ogre through brew install ogre fails with an freetype.h not found error.
/tmp/ogre-ZCKQ/ogre_src_v1-7-4/OgreMain/src/OgreFont.cpp:44:10: fatal error: 'freetype.h' file not found
#include FT_FREETYPE_H
         ^
/usr/local/include/freetype/config/ftheader.h:173:24: note: expanded from macro 'FT_FREETYPE_H'
#define FT_FREETYPE_H  <freetype.h>

I have the following symbolic links in my machine for freetype.
ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/freetype/2.5.3_1/include/freetype2 /opt/x11/include/freetype2
ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/freetype/2.5.3_1/include/freetype2 /usr/local/include/freetype

The complete error stream is gisted here : https://gist.github.com/karthikkovalam/11376100
I am not sure if I have all the symbolic links properly set. Kindly help me with this issue.

I think this is related:

Basically if you use the symbolic link to get one of the Python package's to install, then ogre will not work.

Hi! I am trying to install ROS Hydro on my MAC 10.8.5. Can you please outline the steps which you carried out to install ogre? I have been stuck here for a while and can't seem to find a way out.
Thanks.
