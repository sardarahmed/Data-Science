Q:

Clarification on sensor_msgs/Laserscan.msg

I am wanting to extract features from laser data I have acquired using ROS from Pepper in the form of a sensor_msgs/Laserscan.msg.
However I am struggling to understand certain parts of the message.
Firstly, which might be obvious, am I right to assume that I should disregard data which are in not within the range specified by range_min and range_max, in this case, 0.1000000015 and 1.5 metres, respectively?
Also, I am wanting to plot this data, so that I can get a visualization the field of view of the laser (possible wrong terminology). Ie where the laser beams managed to reached in relation to the actual robot.

Yes, that's the convention.

There is a plugin to view sensor_msgs/LaserScan in Rviz.
