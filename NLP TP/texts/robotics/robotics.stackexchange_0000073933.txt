Q:

Logging of ROS_ERROR_STREAM messages?

How do I log ROS_ERROR_STREAM messages into a log file??
Normally i would just do a >> log.txt but, i only want to store the ROS_ERROR_STREAM, and nothing else..

A:

The ros logging macros (rosconsole) use log4cxx and are compatible with log4j configuration files.
It's probably possible to write a configuration file that does what you want, but the documentation is pretty thin: http://logging.apache.org/log4cxx/usage.html
