Q:

ros.properties is missing

Mmmh, I become crazy ! I followed the wiki of rosjava but when I do rosmake I get the message
/home/.../my_demo/build.xml:21: ros.properties is missing.  Please type 'rosmake' first

What I have to do?

Have you rosmaked rosjava (separately)? I think there needs to be some bootstrapping first.

A:

ROSJava generates the file ros.properties. To generate it is necessary to execute the command rosmake but in the case of rosjava, it is necessary to udpate the file makefile with the following line:
include $(shell rospack find rosjava_bootstrap)/rosjava.mk

I've done this, and followed the webpage instructions exactly (started over multiple times as well). ros.properties is there, yet I still get this error.
