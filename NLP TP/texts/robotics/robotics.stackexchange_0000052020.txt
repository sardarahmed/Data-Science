A:

genmsg contains only the abstract message generation functionality.
message_generation depends on genmsg and the specific generators for languages ROS supports out-of-the-box: gencpp, genlisp and genpy. It is similiar to the former langs / langs-dev packages.
As a message package you always want to depend on message_generation.
Update: I have filled https://github.com/ros/catkin_tutorials/issues/8 to make sure the outdated tutorial gets updated.

It is not updated in the tutorial yet.
[WritingPublisherSubscriber tutorial] still has genmsg instead of message_generation.
Furthermore in [CreatingMsgAndSrv tutorial] in the point 4, there is an error.
# In your catkin workspace
$ cd ../..   <=== SHOULD BE REMOVED.
$ catkin_make
