Q:

Rviz broken, no transform from child frame to parent frame

Hello.
I have just found that my rviz is broken. With several messages no transform from [child_frame] to [parent_frame]. Sorry, I cannot post screenshots.
Any idea to fix this?
Ar.
Note: I have done the test with rrbot, the gazebo test package and my own robot model.

A:

I was in fact missing the following package:
ros-hydro-robot-state-publisher
I do not understand how it has disappeared.
