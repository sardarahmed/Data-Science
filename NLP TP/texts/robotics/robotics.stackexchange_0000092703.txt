Q:

Using RTABmap_ros with external GPS?

Is there support to use an external GPS with RTABmap_ros? I have seen previous answers saying this was not supported, but you could possibly use robot_localization to get around it (https://answers.ros.org/question/225694/interfacing-rtabmap-and-robot_localization/). However, according to (http://introlab.github.io/rtabmap/) version 0.14 of RTABmap Tango has GPS support. Has this feature been added to the ROS version yet?

Hi,
Yes it is now available on ROS. It is mainly used for more robust graph optimization and loop closure detection. See this post: https://github.com/introlab/rtabmap/wiki/Robust-Graph-Optimization#multi-session
The input gps topic to rtabmap node is called /rtabmap/gps/fix, which is a sensor_msgs::NavSatFix type.
Note that rtabmap >=0.18.1 is required. Right now, only binaries in ROS melodic have the option (kinetic will be also updated soon), otherwise rtabmap should be built from source.
cheers,
Mathieu

Hi. Checking noetic documentation I can't find references to any GPS topic. Was it deprecated? Thanks in advance.
