Q:

Common callback function

Hi.
I've a c++ thread that is checking every x seconds if some robots are active. For that, every robot publishes a topic (/robot1/status). So if the robot is publishing, I know that it is alive.
For that reason, my thread subscribes to all these "status" topics. Is it possible to have a common callback for all the topics or I need one function to every one topic?
Thanks.

A:

Yes, that is possible. Also have a look at this answer if you want your callback to have a custom parameter, to know which topic (/robot) is the source.

Edit:
You could use only one topic and let every robot send messages with a unique id to it.

Thanks. I'll try with std::bind instead of boost::bind.
