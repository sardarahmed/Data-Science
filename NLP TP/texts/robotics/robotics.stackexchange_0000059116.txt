Q:

Bad orocos_kdl version with robot_state_publisher

Seeing this on a Hydro install:
process[robot_state_publisher-7]: started with pid [17121]
/opt/ros/hydro/lib/robot_state_publisher/state_publisher: error while loading shared libraries: liborocos-kdl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
No handlers could be found for logger "roslaunch"
[robot_state_publisher-7] process has died [pid 17121, exit code 127, cmd /opt/ros/hydro/lib/robot_state_publisher/state_publisher __name:=robot_state_publisher __log:=/tmp/8ca25758-d179-11e3-85e3-0001c0118a71/robot_state_publisher-7.log].
log file: /tmp/8ca25758-d179-11e3-85e3-0001c0118a71/robot_state_publisher-7*.log

Both ros-hydro-orocos-kdl and ros-hydro-robot-state-publisher claim to be up-to-date, so I'm not quite sure what's going on.
$ ls -1 /opt/ros/hydro/lib/liboroco*
/opt/ros/hydro/lib/liborocos-bfl.so
/opt/ros/hydro/lib/liborocos-kdl.so
/opt/ros/hydro/lib/liborocos-kdl.so.1.2
/opt/ros/hydro/lib/liborocos-kdl.so.1.2.1
$ sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-robot-state-publisher

ros-hydro-robot-state-publisher is already the newest version.

Thoughts what's going on here?

A:

This is the same error that is described in robot_state_publisher issue #11. You might want to check the versions youÂ´re using with the commands stated there. I remember encountering this problem a few months ago, too. But updating packages has since fixed it for me.
