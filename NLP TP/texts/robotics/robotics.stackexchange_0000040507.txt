Q:

How can I have `rosdep install -a` run even when it fails to resolve all packages?

I've been attempting a gentoo install, and this would be highly useful as ros/fuerte/swig-wx is not available there.

Hey did it work for you?  I'm meaning to try installing groovy on a gentoo machine, but I'm concerned I might get stuck on something I can't solve..

A:

I know it is old, but it is still not answered...
You can pass the robust option -r to the argument, that should do the trick
rosdep install -ar
