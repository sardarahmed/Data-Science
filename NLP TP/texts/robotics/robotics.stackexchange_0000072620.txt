Q:

What should pwd be replaced with?

In the page
http://wiki.ros.org/image_transport/Tutorials/PublishingImages
$ ln -s `pwd`/image_common/image_transport/tutorial/ ./src/image_transport_tutorial

command appears. Here 'pwd' should be replaced with something else. What could it be?
Thanks

A:

I don't think you need to replace pwd in the command you referred to. On Ubuntu (and other Linux I assume), surrounded by buckquote "`" symbol, the output of command is filled in.
So if you follow the tutorial line-by-line, you should be at ~/image_transport_ws/, which pwd command will return and that's what the tutorial you linked to expects.
