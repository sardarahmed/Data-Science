Q:

Gazebo camera plugin rendering meshes in wrong order

Trying to load a URDF model in Gazebo, and everything looks good in the Gazebo window. The model includes a Kinect , and when I look at the camera output, it renders the (.STL) meshes in the wrong order. See images here.
I've tried Gazebo 4 and 5, and both the libgazebo_ros_openni_kinect.so and libgazebo_ros_camera.so plugins. Is this expected behavior?

A:

Looks like it was a virtual machine (VMWare Player) issue. I ran the same code on an Ubuntu computer and everything rendered properly.
