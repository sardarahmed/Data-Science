Q:

ROS2 Communication between 32 bit and 64 bit systems

Hi,
I am using ros2 foxy and my setup consists on 32 bit debian-10 docker running demo_node_cpp talker node and 64 bit Ubuntu 20.04 docker (osrf/ros:foxy-desktop) running demo_node_cpp listener node. Both the docker running with --net=host flag, so they can see each other through network.
I can't see any communication between each other as there is no logging on the terminal on listener side. Also there are no results  to ros2 node list . But when both docker are 64 bit they are communicating with each other.
Is my observation is correct ? or Is there something wrong ?
Thanks

A:

It looks like i made a made a mistake by adding a --net=host flag while running the docker.  After following this tutorial things looks fine.
