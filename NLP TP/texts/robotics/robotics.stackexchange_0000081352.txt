Please also post the launch file (and format it with the 0101 button) and tell us which OS and version of ROS you have.

@Yogi_4: I don't see an answer to your problem here, but you have closed the question. If you've solved it by yourself, please post an answer telling us what you did and accept that. If you haven't solved it, then I don't think you should close it as answered.

A:

@ufr3c_tjc I have deleted the package and created the same again.I have re-written the same launch file and it worked.
