Q:

How can I use software BRIDE in ROS FUERTE?

I was trying to use BRIDE in ROS FUERTE as sain in the page  http://wiki.ros.org/bride/Tutorials/Creating-nodes-with-BRIDE-and-cplusplus but i cannot create a workspace in catkin because the command catkin_init_workspace generates this error:
catkin_init_workspace: command not found

Then I tried to create the workspace with rosbuild as said in
http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment
but I had another problem when i use the command:
rosws init ~/fuerte_workspace /opt/ros/fuerte

an error is displayed:
ImportError: No module named vcs_abstraction

and when i tried to install rosinstall: sudo apt-get install python-rosinstall
Another error is displayed:
Errors where encountered while processing:
python-catkin-pkg
python-rospkg
python-rosdistro
python-rosdep
python-rosinstall

Yes, you should use rosbuild in ROS Fuerte. Maybe you can reference the Ros answer:

I followed the link but it doesnt works for me

A:

Fuerte does not have catkin, that is why the catkin_init_workspace command does not work.
You will either have to update to a newer version of ROS like Hydro or Indigo or you will have to get a rosbuild version of BRIDE if it is available. I'm not sure if there are tutorials for using BRIDE with rosbuild, perhaps someone else can answer that.
I would recommend you update your ROS version though because Fuerte has been unsupported for quite some time now. I would recommend using Indigo, as it will be supported for another 4+ years.
