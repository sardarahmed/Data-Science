Q:

Asus XTion Pro Live on embedded Linux using OpenNI2?

Hi,
I'm going to use Asus XTion Pro Live (0601) on my robot running ROS Indigo on a NVidia Jetson TK1, but I have problems receiving data from the sensor.
I installed openni2_launch and run it, the sensor is correctly recognized, but no data messages (both RGB and 3D) are generated. I tried it on both USB 2.0 and USB3.0 ports, on the first it is not detected, on the second it is detected, but it does not send data.
Any idea?

A:

I usually find it worthwhile to compile OpenNI2 myself. For some reason I seem to be experiencing problems using the precompiled versions. It could be worth a shot at least..
Also it is worth a shot to try the samples of OpenNI2. In case you don't have a graphical interface, I believe SimpleRead doesn't open a window and just outputs some data from the camera. Then you know at least that it is connected and functional.
ps. I am running OpenNI2 with the Xtion on an Odroid U2 so I am pretty sure it should work on the Jetson TK1.

If you have trouble with the precompiled OpenNI2 binaries, PLEASE  let me know. If you're having trouble, someone else probably is as well, and I can't fix things if I don't know that they're broken.

Just to clarify, these are the OpenNI2 libraries, not the openni2 package from ROS. In addition, it was a long time ago, but I believe I had the same problem as @Myzhar, it just wouldn't find the Xtion.

I tune and build a significant number of the dependencies for the ARM builds by hand, including OpenNI and OpenNI2.
Comment by Myzhar on 2014-10-23:
I tried only the version of OpenNI2 coming from the repository together with openni2_lauch.
Now I would like to remove this OpenNI2 version and to compile it by myself, but I do not know two things:

how to remove the package and its dependencies
how to for ROS to use my OpenNI2
Any reference?

I think that before recompiling I will try the precompiled version of OpenNI2 from http://structure.io/openni.
My problem remains the same... see (1) and (2) from my last comment ;-)

@ahendrix I downloaded OpenNI2 source code from git and compiled it following this guide:
http://jetsonhacks.com/2014/08/28/occipital-structure-sensor/
I tried "SimpleRead" example, but I cannot find the sensor.
So I tried running "rqt" and I can see RGB and Depth, but not the msg pointcloud2

@ahendrix, next time I run into this issue I will post something to let you know
