Q:

Can I enforce rgbdslam to save ply in binary?

Saving ASCII ply is painfully slow, can I save it in binary mode?
Thanks!

A:

No. But you can find find the code for ply writing in src/graph_mgr_io.cpp in the method

void
GraphManager::pointCloud2MeshFile(QString
filename, pointcloud_type full_cloud)

If you know how to implement saving binary ply files, you can do it there. If you do so, I'd be interested in a patch.
