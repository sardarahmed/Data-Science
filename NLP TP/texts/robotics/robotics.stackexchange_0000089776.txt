Q:

[SOLVED] Arduino ethernet communication with ROS

Hi !
I'm looking from a package to communicate btw arduino and ROS kinetic (on jetson) with an arduino ethernet module.
I need to send msg / srv from arduino to the jetson.

Update:
I found a file ArduinoTcpHardware.h in the rosserial github. Anyone know how to use it ?

A:

So finally I found a solution.
I use this example from the rosserial github.
To run the ros node use roslaunch rosserial_server socket.launch.
For IPAddress ip(192, 168, 0, 177); choose an IP for the arduino.
For IPAddress server(192,168,0,11); use your ip.
