Q:

initializing roscore, unkown host

Hey,
OS: Fedora 14
ROS: Fuerte
Error, while initializing roscore:

Unable to contact my own server at [http://scitos:50689/]. This usually
means that the network is not
configured properly.
A common cause is that the machine
cannot ping itself.  Please check for
errors by running:
ping scitos
For more tips, please see
http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/NetworkSetup

ping scitos delivers

unkown host scitos

ping localhost works fine, ping 127.0.0.1 likewise
Solutions according to ros-wiki is to set

ROS_HOSTNAME=localhost
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311

this has not worked
ping $ROS_HOSTNAME does fine,
while ping $ROS_MASTER_URI returns

unknown host http://localhost:11311

Any ideas why this does not work? Maybe some issue concerning my network connection(using wireless for internet, still there are two ethernet accesses, which are currently not used)?
thx :-)

A:

It's clear that you can't ping the ROS_MASTER_URI. Pinging the host in the ROS_MASTER_URI is the correct way.
Could you run a roscore after setting ROS_HOSTNAME?
The other way is checking your /etc/hosts.
There should probably be a line like:
127.0.0.1   localhost

If you add
127.0.0.1   scitos

after that, you should be able to do ping scitos.
