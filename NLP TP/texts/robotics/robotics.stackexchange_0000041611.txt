Q:

Is "odom" frame in this wiki mean a world coordinate?

Hello, I'm studying navigation stack.
I usually refer to navigation stack's wiki and now I'm reading this page (http://www.ros.org/wiki/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup/Odom).
In this page, there is some coordinate frame which is called "odom".
I guess that this frame is equal to a world coordinate("/map" frame in rvis).
Is my guess correct?
Thanks in advance.
