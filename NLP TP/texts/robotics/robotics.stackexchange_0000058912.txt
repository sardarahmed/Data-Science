I am thinking, can I run rviz for 3 robot in one laptop? Is it possible? I haven't test it yet..
Is there anyone that have try it?

A:

Yes rviz can display 3 robots simultaneously as long as you make sure they don't share the same link names and have network connectivity. Note: rviz is only a visualization tool.
