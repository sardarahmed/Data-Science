Q:

RC Transmitter for DIY

A couple of years ago I bought a WLToys V222 quadcopter.

I would like to know if there is a way to use the transmitter to control some DIY projects?
Does anyone know how I could do that?

A:

I opened up the quadcopter and Identified the chips it uses

Mini54 microcontroller
MPU-6050 Motion Tracking Device
BK2423 2.4 GHz Transceiver

Based on this, I found the NRF24L01 which appeared to be compatible which I purchased on eBay for a whopping $0.67US
After a bit of time and part in hand I hooked it up to an Arduino and I was able to control a servo using my inexpensive wireless controller.

SUCCESS!!
