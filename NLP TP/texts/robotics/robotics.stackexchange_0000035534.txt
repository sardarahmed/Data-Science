Q:

rviz configuration file format

On the rviz wiki, one of the command line arguments is listed as :
-d, --display-config <arg>

Load configuration file <arg> at startup.

What is the format for rviz configuration files, to feed rviz at the command line?

A:

The easiest way to edit rviz configurations is through rviz itself:

Open rviz and set up whatever displays and layout you like.
Go to File->Save Config and choose a descriptive file name.

Later, you can restore your configuration by running rviz with -d, or with File->Open Config. rviz also maintains a list of File->Recent Configs for you. Saving your config is useful when you have a specific desired layout for an application or demo.
For day-to-day use, rviz stores your current config in $HOME/.rviz/display_config, so you can close and re-open rviz without losing your displays and layout.
In general there's no need to edit .vcg files by hand, but they are in a simple INI format. Save one out and open it in your favorite text editor to see the details.
