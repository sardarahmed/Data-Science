Q:

setup.bash setup.sh setup.zsh

I want to find out the differences between 3 files created when using the command 'rosws init ~/fuerte-ws /opt/ros/fuerte' : setup.bash setup.sh setup.zsh. In the rosbuild tutorial, it tells me to source setup.sh. But in catkin tutorial, we source setup.bash. So do these three files serve the same function? Why no one uses setup.zsh? What is it?
Thank you very much.

A:

They are for different shells in linux
bash is default shell in ubuntu. Depending on which shell you are using you can source respective setup.
you can check which shell you are using in by using echo $SHELL
