Q:

Is it possible to set parameters like inertial, collisions in launch not in urdf?

Hi,
I'm working on a robot. I didn't set parameters inertial and collisions in my URDF. Is it possible to set these params in launch file? How? I know that I can change the URDF file, but it is nessesary?
I need the launch to spawn the URDF model and Gazebo world.
Thanks for all answers. :)

A:

No, not directly.
You could however probably use the YAML support in xacro to generate a urdf with values taken from a YAML file and use that.

Edit:

No, not directly.

I have to nuance this a bit: it is possible to pass arguments to xacro when it converts your xacro to a urdf. However, afaik you cannot give it entire blocks, so I'm not sure that would scale very well for the things that you want to parameterise. I feel I would still recommend looking into the YAML support.
