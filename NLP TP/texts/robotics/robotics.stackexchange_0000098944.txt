Hello,

Yes, it is possible to filter the cloud point, what you can do you just subscribe to the point cloud topic and you can process the point cloud according to your requirement. I found this link it may be helpful to you.

filter for depth image

The realsense_camera driver is also providing filters for depth stream. They are disparity, spatial, temporal, hole_filling, and decimation. You can get details information in the below two links.
