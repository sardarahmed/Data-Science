Q:

Verifying OS Name

I've just installed ROS Indigo on a new Raspberry Pi model 2. According to the ROS Indigo installation instructions, you must do lsb_release -a and ensure that it matches the following:
DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu
DISTRIB_RELEASE=14.04
DISTRIB_CODENAME=trusty
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 14.04"

I've installed the Ubuntu 14.04 ARM release, following the instructions linked from the ROS Indigo installation tutorial.
However, the distro identity contained in /etc/lsb-release on my Pi 2 does not match the one in the tutorial precisely. Instead, mine says:
Distributor ID: Ubuntu
Description:    Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS
Release:    14.04
Codename:   trusty

As you can see, there are some minor differences. Will this matter? Should I edit /etc/lsb-release so that the file matches the identity text in the Indigo installation tutorial exactly? I was hesitant to do this without being certain, in case changes to the file might interfere with some other part of the OS. Thanks.

A:

Do not edit /etc/lsb-release. It is an OS file and may be reverted without notice during an upgrade.

Trainman! I have followed your blog for some time now. It's awesome to get a response from you. Thanks!
Ok, I'll leave the file alone. But does that mean those minor differences are unimportant?

probably... I haven't set up an ARM board in a while, but I get similar results on my x86 desktop. Note that the output of lsb_release -a and the contents of /etc/lsb-release are related but not the same.

Oh ok, I didn't realize they were different. I'd just assumed calling lsb_release -a was equivalent to performing cat /etc/lsb-release.
