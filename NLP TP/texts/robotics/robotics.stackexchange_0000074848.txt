Q:

Interpreting /scan topic values using Hokuyo wrapper

Hi,
I am using Hokuyo UST 10LX Lidar. I have downloaded the wrapper and I am able to get scan data on /scan topic. But the values from lidar does not match with the actual distance between the obstacle and the lidar. Can I know how to map data coming out from wrapper on /scan topic to real distance ?
Thanks in advance.

A:

Supply voltage was less than the voltage range mentioned in the data sheet. Once I increased the voltage, I could get the correct distance.
