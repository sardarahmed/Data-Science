Q:

Unsubscribing uisng shutdown()

I have a vector of subscribers and each subscriber has same callback function. When  i try to clear the vector , code hangs indefinitely. So is there a way to unsubscribe or a way to deallocate the alloted memory.. beside the method mentioned above. I have also tried uisng ros::Subscriber::shutdown to unsubscribe an element of vector and still my code hangs...

A:

My intuition says that this should work in principle. Can you come up with a minimal example to test? I am using unsubscribe in my code and it doesn't hang there. If it does, it's consider it a bug.
