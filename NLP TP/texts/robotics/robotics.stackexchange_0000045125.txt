Q:

ROS packpages scheduled date for Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal)

Is there any scheduled date for realeasing the packpages for the new Ubuntu version?
Compiling from source can be painful with some stacks/nodes such as rviz.

I have came across the following repository while searching into other questions:
http://packages.ros.org/ros-shadow-fixed
It has many packpages for quantal but I am not sure what means to use this repo and not the official one

I have installed ros-groovy using that repository but it does not have the ros-groovy-visualization stack nor the ros-groovy-slam-gmapping stack which I need.

Groovy is still in development, not yet released. Those stacks are probably not available yet. Or, they may disappear while rebuilding.

A:

ROS Groovy Galapagos will support Ubuntu Quantal. Its currently-scheduled release date is 2012-11-15.
Fuerte will not officially support Quantal.
