Q:

Can't find laser_scan_matcher parameters

Kinetic
Ubuntu 16.04
Goal
I'm trying to launch a Laser_Scan_Matcher node (from scan_tools package) that takes in sensor_msgs/PointCloud2 messages and outputs geometry_msgs/PoseStamped.
The package is correctly installed. demo.launch works.
In the node.cpp file I see
if(use_cloud_input=True)

but can't find
set.Param("use_cloud_input", True/False) 

anywhere in any file in any folder inside the laser_scan_matcher package!
How do I launch this node specifying cloud input?

A:

The true / false value for the use_cloud_input_ param is initialized on line 148 in laser_scan_matcher.cpp (Indigo branch) with the following code:
if (!nh_private_.getParam ("use_cloud_input", use_cloud_input_))
use_cloud_input_= false;

So in your launch file you just need to specify the parameter to true. Also, by default laser_scan_matcher looks for the pointcloud on the "cloud" topic (verify this), so you'll also want to remap to whatever your pointcloud topic is. An example launch file might look something like this:
<launch>
<node pkg="laser_scan_matcher" type="laser_scan_matcher_node" name="matcher_node">
<remap from="cloud" to="pointcloud_topic" />
<param name="use_cloud_input" value="true"/>
</node>
</launch>

Hope this helps!
