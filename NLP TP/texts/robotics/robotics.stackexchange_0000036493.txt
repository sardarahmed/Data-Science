A:

Hi,
I just tested it. Its working fine.
Just check if both talker and listener are connected through the same topic "/chatter"
You can use below command to do that.
rxgraph 

The graph should look exactly like below. If both are not connected then it means you are publishing and advertising in different topics.

Hope this helps,
Karthik
