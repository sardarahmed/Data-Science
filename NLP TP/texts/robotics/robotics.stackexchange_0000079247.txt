Q:

Change Planner in MoveIt Python

Hey guys, i want to change the default motion planner from OMPL in MoveIt to "PRMkConfigDefault".
But how can i change for example the planner for planning my group: group = MoveGroupCommander("manipulator") in Python? Thanks for your answers! Im running ROS Indigo on Ubuntu 14.04.

A:

You can use the MoveGroupCommander.set_planner_id() function for this. Have a look at the API documentation
An example:
group = moveit_commander.MoveGroupCommander("manipulator")
group.set_planner_id("PRMkConfigDefault")

Good luck!
