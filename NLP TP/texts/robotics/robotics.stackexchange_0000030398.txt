Q:

PR2 stacks (and actions) under Diamondback

I was trying to get ahead of my colleagues and port my OpenPRS/PR2 library under Diamondback, but it looks like the PR2 stacks and actions have not yet been released under Diamondback. Can somebody confirm?
I did the Desktop-Full Install: (Recommended)
sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-desktop-full

and include such as  pr2_common_action_msgs/TuckArmsAction.h are nowhere to be found.

A:

Please follow the PR2-specific instructions for installing Diamondback:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/Robots/PR2/diamondback
Installation page for specific robots are linked off the ROS installation page:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Installation
(5 robots and counting).
If you're really curious as to what a particular variant contains, you should look at REP 108 for the common entry point descriptions.   If you're really, really curious, you can look at the rosinstall file for that variant:
