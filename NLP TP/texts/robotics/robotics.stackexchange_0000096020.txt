Q:

Get subscriber and publisher from ros2 topic info

When I run ros2 topic info <topic_name>, it only gives me the type, publisher count and subscriber count, but not the publishing node and subscribing nodes.  How can I also get that information, similar ot how rostopic info <topic_name> works?

You can get it with the -v flag: ros2 topic info -v <topic_name>.
