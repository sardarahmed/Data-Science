Q:

base_local_planer : max_rotational_vel limit exceed

I'm currently trying to set up the navigation stack for a hexapod bot.
I already reached to sent simple goals and reach them, even if the behavior can be improved, but the base_local_planer actually doesn't take care of my max_rotational_vel limit, which I set to 0.2.
Having a look on the /cmd_vel topic , the planer seems to ignore my limit and sent with the default value 1.0 rad/sec.
Whereas the max_vel_x limit works fine.
Does anyone had the same problem ? Is there maybe a bug or did I do something wrong ?

Hi again, I figured out what the problem was.
Having a look at the source code , I found out that the parameter isn't called like listed in the doc, but has a different name :
max_vel_theta
