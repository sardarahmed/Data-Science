Q:

How to link OpenNI and NITE as external libraries

I'd like to link OpenNI and NITE to my own package as external libraries.
How can I do it?
I'm using ROS groovy with Ubuntu 12.04.
In order to rosmake my package which uses OpenNI and NITE,
I installed ros-groovy-openni-*.
Next, I compiled and linked it with rosmake and rosmake was successed.
However, when running my package I have a error with
xn::Context::InitFromXmlFile(const XnChar *strFileName, EnumerationErrors *pErrors=NULL) method.
The error is "This operation is invalid".
Surprisingly, the error didn't appear with ROS electric, Ubuntu 10.04, and ros-electric-openni-kinect.
I think that it is a problem of the version of OpenNI and NITE.
So I'm trying to use OpenNI and NITE as external libraries instead of ros packages.
How can I link OpenNI and NITE to my package as external libraries?
Isn't it recommended ?
Any other people who have the same problem with ros-openni-* ?
Thanks in advance.

A:

After installing ros-groovy-openni*, you should first uninstall NITE 1.5.2, then install NITE 1.5.2.
As I said here, it seems that uninstalling NITE first is needed... Otherwise some various problems appear.
Let me know,
Bests,
