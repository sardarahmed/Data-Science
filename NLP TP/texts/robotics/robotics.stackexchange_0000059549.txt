A quick google search turns up: http://wiki.ros.org/rqt_service_caller . Does this do what you want?

Sorry i meant using rqt_graph, visualizing it as a box binding two nodes, the service client and server. I don't think rqt_service_caller is what I need.

I don't think the list of clients for a service is available for introspection at all.
