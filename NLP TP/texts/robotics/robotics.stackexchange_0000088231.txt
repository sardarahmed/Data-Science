Q:

What does this do: roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_remote.launch

The name and the documentation implies somehow that it would launch a turtlebot3 "remotely" i.e. when running this  launch file on another computer (not the robot itself.)  But I just cant understand how that can be and reading the .launch file didn't help me.

Hi :)
turtlebot3_remote.launch file includes robot_model and launch robot_state_publisher node.
  <node pkg="robot_state_publisher" type="robot_state_publisher" name="robot_state_publisher">
    <param name="publish_frequency" type="double" value="50.0" />
    <param name="tf_prefix" value="$(arg multi_robot_name)"/>
  </node>

So, this makes to show state of your robot by tf. If you want more detail information, please visit below links.
