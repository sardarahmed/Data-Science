Q:

where do I get a gazebo diff drive plugin?

So I was previously using the erratic diff drive plugin here:
http://ua-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/arrg/ua_controllers/erratic_gazebo_plugins
but it looks like it moved. bummer.
So I see that there seems to be code that does something similar in gazebo_plugins/src/gazebo_ros_diffdrive.cpp
however, it doesn't get built as a .so for some reason, instead it's a binary in /bin that doesn't seem to do anything.  Any idea how to get a basic diff drive robot running in gazebo?

Jeff,
You can still get the plug-in from ua-ros-pkg repository, it moved here:
http://ua-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/stacks/erratic_robot/trunk/erratic_gazebo_plugins/
The whole erratic_robot stack is now available for download from your Ubuntu package manager (if you use Ubuntu that is).

that is misleading, I've ticketed it (https://code.ros.org/trac/ros-pkg/ticket/4967).  Thanks.

I am not exactly sure why it's implemented as a node and not a proper gazebo plugin that you add to your urdf file, that's what our implementation in ua-ros-pkg is. As far as I remember we had some trouble deleting and respawning robot on the fly in simulation, so we implemented diffdrive as a proper gazebo plugin. I think they both should work equally well for you.

Is the binary in gazebo_plugins the recommended way of implementing diff drive in a new robot?  I had previously used the ua-ros-pkg one because it was the first thing I found...

Diffdrive plugin that comes with gazebo_plugins package is written as a standalone ROS node, you have to launch it the way you launch any other regular ROS node, e.g. add this to your launch file:

Thanks! This will get me running again. Still, I wonder what's up with the diffdrive binary in gazebo_plungins...
