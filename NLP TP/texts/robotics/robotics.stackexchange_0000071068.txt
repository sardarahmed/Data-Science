Q:

ROS Installation hangs building rosbag recorder.cpp.o

I tried already a couple of times and it always hangs building the rosbag recorder.cpp.o object with no error message. I've been waiting for hours but the installation process does not contiune. The last message is:
[ 40% ] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/rosbag.dir/src/recorder.cpp.o
Has anyone a clue, why is this happening?

What sort of computer are you using?

A:

I'm using a Raspberry Pi and yes, it was only taking too long. I actually have already the Raspberry overclocked but it was anyway too slow. It took over one and a half day to install ros. I just needed to be more pacient... I apologize for this useless question... Thank anyway ahendrix!
