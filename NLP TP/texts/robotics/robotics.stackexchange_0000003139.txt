Q:

Denavit-Hartenberg convention

There are two different conventions that can determine DH parameters.   What is the difference between Craig's [1, Sec 3.4] convention and the Spong [2, Sec. 3.2] convention?
I know that both methods must have the same response.

[2]: Spong, Mark W., Seth Hutchinson, and Mathukumalli Vidyasagar. Robot modeling and control. Wiley, 2006.

A:

Craig uses the modified DH parameters, while Spong uses the classic DH parameters. 
The difference between them are the locations of the coordinates system attachment to the links: in the modified DH, the coordinates of frame $O_{i}$ is put on axis $i$, while in the classic DH convention the coordinates of frame $O_{i}$ is put on axis $i+1$.
Update (2014.10.26)
Reading Craig's book again, I noted that the modified DH matrix is also different because of the order of the applied transformations. I edited the Wikipedia link with the different DH matrix.

A:

You should read this paper: "Lipkin 2005: A Note on Denavit-Hartenberg Notation in Robotics".  It explains the 3 main DH parameter conventions and how they differ.
