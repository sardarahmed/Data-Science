Q:

Installing ros-indigo-desktop-full on ArchLinux: pyqt4-10-common and pyqt4-common are in conflict (pyqt-common). Remove pyqt4-common?

I can't overcome the above problem. If I start to remove packages to install pyqt4-10, too much other apps would need to be removed (some of them I really need). Does anyone have a solution for this? Manual installation on an other machine didn't really help, the dependency problem strikes me there too.
Cheers
Paul

A:

The pyqt4-10 package was made because of this problem: https://github.com/ros-visualization/python_qt_binding/issues/13
Until this is resolved, we need to keep this old version of the pyqt packages (or well, until this breaks other stuff). Normally, you don't need to remove other packages, and if pacman complains when you want to downgrade pyqt packages, you can always remove the official pyqt packages  (-Rdd) and install the 4.10 ones.
For problems related to the packages themselves, you should post comments on the AUR rather than here. You'll have more chance of getting quick answers.
UPDATE: a patch by @pallegro now makes it possible to use the official pyqt4 package. This has not been merged upstream yet, but in the meantime the patch is applied in the appropriate PKGBUILD.
UPDATE 2: this is now officially solved.
