A:

Hi dnth,
There are official Aldebaran's NAO meshes available on "vrabaud' github account : the repo is named "nao_meshes"
You'll need to download an installer located in the binaries folder.
If you don't have the expected results you can follow the install section located here : "keulYSMB" github account, repository "xml_urdf_parser".
Finally if you want you can join the SIG_ROS_Aldebaran google group where you can follow/participate to the development of ros nodes for nao. There are thread about the URDF_generator.
Hope this will help.
