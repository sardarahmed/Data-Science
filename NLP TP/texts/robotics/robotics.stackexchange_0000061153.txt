A:

I have run into this too. I opened this bug ticket on Github.
Unfortunately AFAIK there is no proper solution yet. You might confirm this bug on the Github tracker thread to increase visibility of that issue.
The current workaround for me is that I still use an older version of the ros-indigo-rqt-gui-cpp package without the breaking change.
rqt tags/0.2.13 works
rqt tags/0.2.14 crashes

I chose to just launch it as a separate node that works even though it opens a new window. But now I can pass in a custom rviz config file.

You mean you use the rviz standalone application (not via rqt)?
