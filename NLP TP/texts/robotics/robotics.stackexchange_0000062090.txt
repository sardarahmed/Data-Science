Q:

Error in catkin_ws

Hello Everyone!!
Tutorial:
http://wiki.ros.org/nao/Installation/remote
When use:
cd ~/catkin_ws/
wstool set humanoid_msgs --git https://github.com/ahornung/humanoid_msgs

Get this error:
ERROR in config: Command requires a target workspace.

I created the catkin_ws according to http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace
A lot of thanks!!

Did you make sure that the command source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash is executed every time you open a new terminal?
You should add source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash to the file ~/.bashrc

Do you know what the folder I have to keep "humanoid_msgs"
Is in ~/catkin_ws/src?

Continue the same problem:
~/catkin_ws/src$ wstool set humanoid_msgs --git https://github.com/ahornung/humanoid_msgs
ERROR in config: Command requires a target workspace.

A:

ERROR in config: Command requires a target workspace.

In addition to the comment of @Martin Peris: afaik the cwd needs to be the directory containing the .rosinstall file. Alternatively, you need to provide the -t WORKSPACE or --target-workspace=WORKSPACE argument to point wstool to the proper directory.
For your particular situation (with the cwd being ~/catking_ws), this would be:
wstool set --target-workspace=src humanoid_msgs --git https://github.com/ahornung/humanoid_msgs

Edit:

Ah, so your source space hasn't been initialised by wstool. First do:
wstool init ~/catking_ws/src

then the wstool set .. should succeed.

Used:
 wstool set ~/catkin_ws/src humanoid_msgs --git https://github.com/ahornung/humanoid_msgs
 Error: Too many arguments.
 wstool set [localname] [SCM-URI]?  [--(svn|hg|git|bzr)] [--version=VERSION]]

Your commandline doesn't make sense: you're missing the --target-workspace argument.
Comment by vncntmh on 2014-08-26:
So, How is?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2014-08-26:
Does the example command line from my initial answer not work for you?
Comment by vncntmh on 2014-08-26:
Get this error:
ERROR in config: /home/vincent/src has no workspace configuration file '.rosinstall'

Same problem.

You're also missing the -t option. Also: make sure that ~/catkin_ws/src already contains a .rosinstall file, or it won't work.
