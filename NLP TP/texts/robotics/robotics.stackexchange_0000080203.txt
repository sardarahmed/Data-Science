Q:

Problem with sourcing setup.bash

Hi, I have some packages installed with apt, and some from from source in catkin_ws. The problem Im having is that the source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash file and the ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash file conflicts. As soon as I source catkin I can not find some packages In opt/ros, and as soon as I source opt/ros I can not find any of my catkin nodes. I have been struggling with this for a while now and Im wondering if it is a way of resolving this conflict?

how do u try to find packages? are you using roscd? if you don't have opt/ros sourced the roscd command would not be even recognized ?? In other words I don't think you have your ros environment not sourced

or setup an alias setup="source devel/setup.sh" in your .bashrc or whatever shell you have there

A:

I think your problem is u r sourcing the workspace locally in terminals and when you open a new one it is not sourced and you need to source again, to avoid it try to source your work space using .bashrc
