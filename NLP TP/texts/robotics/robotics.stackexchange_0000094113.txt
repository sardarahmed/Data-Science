Q:

How to run python script from launch file

I have a launch file, with following:
 <!-- Launch Gazebo -->   
 <include file="$(find turtlebot_gazebo)/launch/turtlebot_world.launch"> </include>
 <!-- Launch AMCL -->  
 <include file="$(find my_package)/launch/my_amcl.launch">    </include>
 <!-- Launch Move base -->  
 <!-- Launch Rviz -->  

Inside this launch file I want to also run a python script navigate.py located in my_package/scripts.
I have try <include file="$(find my_package)/scripts/navigate.py">  </include>
but it doesn't works. Is there a way to do that?

this is not the same. I tried that, but didn't work.
SO I've tried
  <node pkg="my_package" name="navigate.py" type="navigate.py" output="screen"> 
  </node>

but it didn't work

Did you make your script executable? navigate.py has to be an executable script. See the example python node for details
