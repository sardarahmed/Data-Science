What's the contents of /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list?
Comment by qnan1983 on 2012-10-11:
this is the content in ros-latest.list :deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu lucid main
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-10-11:
Did you try a sudo apt-get update before the apt-get install command?
Comment by qnan1983 on 2012-10-11:
I followed the install instruction on ros wiki,no doubt the process was right
Comment by thebyohazard on 2012-10-11:
Very similar question to this thread

A:

I had a similar issue which boiled down to one uninstallable package.
This package was uninstallable because multiverse sources.list (was commented out).
(with that said, I did make the change, installed ROS and apparently did a subsequent update because the line is no longer commented out).
