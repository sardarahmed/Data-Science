Please give more information, otherwise it's really hard to help. 1) On which computer are you running tf_monitor? That one on the turtlebot? 2) How is your turtlebot started up? What does rosnode list show?

could we get a rostopic list? Maybe a bag file of recorded odometry? Is this an actual turtlebot (silly question, but a lot of robots use turtlebot code to run although they aren't turtlebots)?

A:

I've sovled it. I've chagned the name of the turtlebot-laptop  in the workstation to turtlebot, the same the on on the robot has an now i get the tf in the workstation.
