Q:

Is there a guide to cross-compiling ROS for ARM (BBB)?

The eROS project appears to be graveyarded and I'm looking for a place to start.
My Requirements:

Build ROS Packages in amd64 machine with cross compiler
"Deploy" binaries on target - Beaglebone black - which already has ROS installed on it
Run ROS nodes on the target

I can build the ROS packages on the BBB itself but that workflow gets out of hand for distributed systems - a cluster of 10-20 BBBs that may all run an instance of the built ROS package..
Thanks!

A:

Did you consider meta-ros or beagle-ros? Additional relevant links are:

Hey thanks for pointing me in this direction! I've got it working now thanks to the pages you've given me. beagle-ros environment setup + meta-ros enabled me to bitbake user-defined recipes for ROS packages that I was able to deploy and successfully run on BBB. Thanks!
