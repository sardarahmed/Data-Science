Q:

Getting error message for rospack depends geometry_msgs

Hi,
i haven't been using ros for a while.
Today i tried to compile some ros nodes i create last month.
However i was getting an error message...
I figured out that it has to do something with my geometry_msgs package.
As i tried to look at the dependencies with
rospack depends geometry_msgs 

i got the same error message i got for the make command:
[rospack] woah! expanding the dependency tree made it blow up.
There must be a circular dependency somewhere.
[rospack] circular dependency

i'm using diamondback-desktop-full.
I update/reinstalled it. However this didn't make anything better.
Any ideas what i'm messing up?
cheers

A:

Do you have two packages that depend on one another anywhere in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH? If you have any two packages that depend on one another, you could cause this circular dependency. In case you're curious, the output of rospack depends geometry_msgs on your system should look like this:
rosbuild
roslang
cpp_common
roscpp_traits
rostime
roscpp_serialization
rospack
roslib
xmlrpcpp
rosconsole
std_msgs
rosgraph_msgs
roscpp
rospy
rosclean
rosgraph
rosparam
rosmaster
rosout
roslaunch
rosunit
rostest
topic_tools
rosbag
rosbagmigration

mmmh.. thanks for you answer. One package in my own rospackages folder was causing problem... still don't know what exactly the problem was, since i coudl not see any circual dependencies. anyway it's working ;)
