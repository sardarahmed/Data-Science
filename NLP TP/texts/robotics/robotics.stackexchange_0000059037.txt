Q:

which sensor better to use for slam?

Hi guys
I saw some clips in internet for slam,they used laser range finder or kinect or mono_camera or stereo camera ...
which sensor is better to use for mapping I'm researcher in rescue robot indoor ...
I can't use just the laser scanner because of the environment has half wall(half down or half up and if I use just the laser scanner i can't understand that robot can pass under wall or not ...)
any suggestion about my problem?
Thanks
Hamid

A:

LIDAR sensors are so far the most reliable (if expensive) sensor for performing SLAM with mobile robots. Camera-based/Visual SLAM works well in some scenarios but tends to be (much) more brittle generally. You can use a 3D SLAM approach like ethzasl_icp_mapper with a rotating LIDAR or you can combine a (internal) 2D approach like hector_mapping with a rgb-d sensor and IMU data to perform 3D mapping. That's what we do in this video and as can be seen, the robot operates autonomously in the Rescue Arena for 20 minutes without running into obstacles like half height roll/pitch ramps.

how your robot will find out if the space under the wall is higher than its height so it can pass through it?
Comment by Stefan Kohlbrecher on 2014-04-28:
You can create a octomap from RGB-D data and generate a occupancy grid map based on it that contains only cells of a certain height range. If you select the height range to be that of your robot´s geometry (performing some special treatment for the floor), you´ll get a map that shows where your robot can go (which can be used directly in planning algorithms based on occupancy grids).
