Q:

Publication on Step Completion?

We've written a custom Gazebo (6.5.1) plugin so that we can single-step through time.  That is, we start gazebo -u paused and then proceed through time step-by-step.  A step is taken each time our plugin receives an external message to take a step.
Currently, we wait to receive a WorldStats publication from gazebo to consider a step completed.  However, it appears these messages may be sent at regular time intervals, regardless of the step having completed.
Does Gazebo published a message that's more suitable to knowing that the step has been completed?

A:

There is a command line program that you could use:
 gz world -s
In your plugin you can compare the iterations value to see if a step has occurred.

Thanks.  We were able to simplify our situation by either not caring about the WorldStats message and carrying on as usual, or have some guarantees by having the plugin deal with iterations value.
