Q:

How to build moveit configuration package for fanuc R-2000iC/210F

Hi,
I have some developments that I want to test on the following Fanuc robot  R-2000iC/210F. I have found that fanuc experimental lists a support package fanuc_r2000ic_support. This package contains configuration data, 3D models and launch files for Fanuc R-2000iC manipulators. Can I use moveit setup assistant,  loading the urdf from ~/catkin_ws/src/fanuc_experimental/fanuc_r2000ic_support/urdf/r2000ic210f.xacro, and following the steps on MSA wizard to generate moveit configuration pacakge for the /210F model?
thanks,
Zahid

thanks @gvdhoorn, MSA did not generate moveit_planning_execution.launch file. Also, needed to confirm the following settings were correct: virtual_joint:, child link: base_link, parent frame name: world, joint type: fixed. planning group: arm, kinematic chain: base_link to link_6. planning_group: hand, joints: joint6-flange, link_6-tool0. End effector: group name: hand, parent link: link_6, parent group: arm, ROS_control: FollowJointsTrajectory, thanks
