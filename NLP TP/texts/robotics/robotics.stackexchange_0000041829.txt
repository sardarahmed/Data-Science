Q:

pr2 (gazebo simulator) gripper not strong enough

Hi,
I am using ros-diamondback and gazebo for pr2_simulator.
My problem is that if I do
roslaunch pr2_tabletop_manipulation_launch pr2_tabletop_manipulation.launch
rosrun pr2_pick_and_place_demos pick_and_place_demo.py
the gripper is not strong enough to hold on to the graspable object, and it drops the object before it finshes the task.
When I was using Fuerte before, I didn't have this problem.
Can someone teach me how to fix this?
