Q:

is that possible to write nested msg in one file?

hi, as the below example:
Child.msg:

float32 x
float32 y

Parent.msg:

Child[2] child

is that possible to use only one .msg file to implement?
thanks

I don't know the definitive answer if its possible, but I've never seen such a thing done and would be exceptionally unusual. Its best not. But you could consult the idl generators if its even feasibly possible, but I doubt that it is.

well, thanks for the comment, it is indeed some kind of "idle curiosity", but somehow i just dont want to create too many msg files only use once, as exampled, if the Child.msg is only used by Parent.msg, it looks a little bit of wasting of managing/orginazing files...anyway, thanks for the comfirmation (negative comfirmation is also quit help for me)

A:

No you cannot have more than one message per msg file. The filename is the name of the message and everything inside of the file is the contents of the message.
This sounds a bit like an XY problem. I would suggest that you consider asking a new question with more context if this is something beyond an idle curiosity about the design.
For reference the format is defined here: http://wiki.ros.org/msg

thanks for the explaination, as commented above, it is indeed some kind of "idle curiosity", and this confirmation though is not happy to know but quite clear, i dont need to do more investigations.
