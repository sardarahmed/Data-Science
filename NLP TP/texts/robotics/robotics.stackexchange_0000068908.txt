Your IMU message appears to have 0 time stamps. That won't work. Fix that, and if your issue isn't resolved, please post a new question.

A:

I do believe that situation may cause trouble, so I've added an issue to the tracker and will update this answer when the fix is complete. While I can generate a made-up bag file with the right GPS coordinates to test this situation, if you happen to have one that you can share, I'd like to use it.
