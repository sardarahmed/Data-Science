Q:

Build error with android_core

I am trying to install rosjava and android_core for an Android project that must get data from ROS and send service calls. The rosjava_core installation worked (eventually, there were other problems there that appear to have been resolved), but the android_core build has errors.
So far, I have installed rosjava_core, following the instructions here, and built it with the instructions here. Next, I successfully installed android_core with these instructions and moved on to building rosjava_core with the instructions found here.
However, the command ./gradlew debug fails with this output:
:android_acm_serial:deployLibs UP-TO-DATE
:android_acm_serial:updateProject
Updated local.properties
Updated file /homes/dzirbel/my_workspace/android_core/android_acm_serial/proguard-project.txt
:android_gingerbread_mr1:deployLibs UP-TO-DATE
:android_gingerbread_mr1:updateProject
Error: The project either has no target set or the target is invalid.
Please provide a --target to the 'android update' command.
:android_gingerbread_mr1:debug
Buildfile: build.xml does not exist!
Build failed

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':android_gingerbread_mr1:debug'.
> Command 'ant' finished with (non-zero) exit value 1.

* Try:
Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace. Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.

BUILD FAILED

Total time: 2.355 secs

(I can post the extended output from --info if it's necessary, but I can't discern any additional info from that.)
I've run through the installation several times with a couple different changes, but nothing seems to work. A number of google searches have also yielded no help, and I can't find anyone with a similar error. Am I doing something incorrectly or am I missing some package? I would appreciate any suggestions.
Thanks

A:

I found the solution to this problem, very similar to the one in this thread. I simply changed android_tutorial_camera from that thread to android_gingerbread_mr1 and ran ./gradlew debug again, and it seemed to get past that part. I also had to add every other directory in the android_core folder, but then it built successfully.
Hope this helps someone.
