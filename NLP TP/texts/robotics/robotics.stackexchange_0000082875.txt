Q:

turtlebot_rviz_launchers without running turtlebot

Hello,
I try to simulate a turtlebot, because the batteries for my turtlebot were not delivered and I'm waiting for them now.
Running a Gazebo world works fine with the following line: roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch
However, when I try to run Rviz with the following line: roslaunch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_robot.launch
It gives me an error that says: [view_robot.launch] is neither a launch file in package [turtlebot_rviz_launchers] nor is [turtlebot_rviz_launchers] a launch file name
What is the reason for this? Do I have to install the packages in some way or do I need a running turtlebot in order to run Rviz?

This question comes up quite often. A quick Google search will give you numerous results:

https://answers.ros.org/question/65003/roscd-no-such-packagestack-beginner_tutorials/
https://answers.ros.org/question/65950/roscd-returns-roscd-no-such-packagestack-package_name/
https://answers.ros.org/question/239650/roscd-not-woring/

to name the first few results. The way that I search for solutions to problems is by adding site:answers.ros.org to my query (for Google at least) so my query looks like this:
<error> site:answers.ros.org

(where <error> is the error that you're encountering) and I can usually find a solution on the first page of the results.
