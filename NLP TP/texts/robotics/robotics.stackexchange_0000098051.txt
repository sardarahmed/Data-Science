Q:

ROS Melodic with Rpi Cam

Hello everyone,
I am trying to learn Autonomous Cars… I am totally new to these things I am trying to do my self driving rc car(1/10 scale). Like Donkeycar.
But i want to realize it with ROS.
I got rpi camera V2. I searched internet and just find that i can use rpi camera with ros kinetic. Are there any way to rpi camera with Jetson Nano on ROS. Cause as i can learned i can only install ros melodic to jetson nano.
Now i am using:
Jetson Nano
JetPack 4.4
ROS Melodic
My questions are:

Can i use ros kinetic with jetson nano
Can i use rpi cam with ros melodic
There is a node for rpi camera like i said (in ros Kinetic) can i use this node in ros melodic

For me it’s urgent. I would be grateful for any help.
Can you help me.
Thanks.

A:

For answer who may search for it:

You can only use ROS melodic with
Jetson Nano. Maybe you can use another destribution but with
docker.(idk how exactly)
If you are searching rpi
cam V2 ready to use package you can
check -> dusty-nv's github
page
You can't cause some packages may
not compatible with every version.
