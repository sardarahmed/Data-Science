Q:

nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid topic doesn't exist

Hi, I have set up a simple subsriber like the one in this tutorial and am trying to use it to get data from the nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid topic.  As the doc specifies, this data is in the form of an Int8 [] so the only difference between the tutorial and my code is I replaced "String" with "Int8MultiArray"
I am running what I think is a fairly standard hector_mapping setup, and then I try and launch my subscriber node.  The node launches fine and sits there forever, never receiving any messages.  When I try rostopic list the topic is not there, despite the fact that the documentation for hector_mapping says that it publishes to this nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid topic.
It seems like I'm missing something to tell hector_mapping to publish, except that using rosrun map_server map_saver works perfectly, so clearly the data is there.  What am I doing wrong?

A:

nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid  is not a topic, is a message type. the topic in the tutorial you point out is "/robot0/odom"
when you launch the packages in ros do in another console "rostopic list " ..... find the topic you like then do "rostopic info + <topic_name>" that will show you what kind of message the subscriber needs. then follow the tutorial and you should get your sub callback going.
