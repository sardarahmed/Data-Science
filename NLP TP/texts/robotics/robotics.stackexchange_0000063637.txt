Q:

cv_bridge converter tutorial not compiling

Dear Ros Users,
following the tutorial described at http://wiki.ros.org/cv_bridge/Tutorials/UsingCvBridgeToConvertBetweenROSImagesAndOpenCVImages
I'm experimenting problem on compiling:
In function ImageConverter::ImageConverter()': converter_demo.cpp:(.text._ZN14ImageConverterC2Ev[_ZN14ImageConverterC5Ev]+0x62): undefined reference to image_transport::ImageTransport::ImageTransport(ros::NodeHandle const&)'
In the package.xml file, I declared the followind dependencies:
buildtool_depend: catkin, roscpp, rospy, std_msgs, image_transport, cv_bridge
run_depend: roscpp, rospy, std_msgs, image_transport, cv_bridge
Thank you!

A:

buildtool_depend must only be catkin. The others mentioned there have to be build_depend
E.g.:
  <buildtool_depend>catkin</buildtool_depend>

  <build_depend>roscpp</build_depend>
  <build_depend>rospy</build_depend>
  <build_depend>std_msgs</build_depend>
  <build_depend>image_transport</build_depend>
  <build_depend>cv_bridge</build_depend>
  
  <run_depend>roscpp</run_depend>
  <run_depend>rospy</run_depend>
  <run_depend>std_msgs</run_depend>
  <run_depend>image_transport</run_depend>
  <run_depend>cv_pridge</run_depend>

Further, you have to find_package them in your CMakeLists.txt (in case you not yet have):
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS roscpp rospy std_msgs image_transport cv_bridge)

I "missed" the find package :)
Now it works, thank you!
