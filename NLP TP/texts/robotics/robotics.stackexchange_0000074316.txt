A:

You just have to set your Environment Variables correctly in your case the ROS_MASTER_URI where you specify where your PC can find the Master documented here.
So you just have to open a new Terminal Window and enter export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://mia:11311/ (mia: my ip address). In your case enter the ip address of the raspberrypi instead of mia.
Than starting RVIZ with rosrun rviz rviz. (you also can check with rostopic list if your topics are available now).
--- Update --
Corresponding to your comment you have also set your ROS_IP. Sorry i forgot to tell you that.
So just find out your IP-Address with
hostname -I

and export it with
export ROS_IP=192.168.xxx.xxx

So you have to do both. Setup the ROS_MASTER_URI and the ROS_IP.
Please donâ€™t forget to set the ROS_IP at your PC and the RaspberryPi.
