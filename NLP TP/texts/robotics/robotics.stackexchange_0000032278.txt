Q:

Simple Service and Client Tutorial Problem

I am going through the tutorial with ROS, and its been fairly smooth so far.  However, I just got to the section on creating a simple service and client in c++, and regardless of what I do, I keep running into errors when making add_two_ints_client.cpp and add_two_ints_server.cpp.  They both call on a header file called AddTwoInts.h, however the tutorial never went over what that was.  To compensate for that, I went and grabbed the TwoInts.h header file from the roscpp_tutorials package.  At first I put it under beginners_tutorials like the example suggested, but I received a message stating beginner_tutorials was not declared in this scope.  I did, however, get the code to accept TwoInts.h by just throwing it in src with the rest of the code and just calling
#include "TwoInts.h"

With that out of the way, I now receive an additional error down the line when I go to use TwoInts.  I go to call
ros::ServiceClient client = n.serviceClient<TwoInts>("add_two_ints");

but the compiler says it doesn't know what TwoInts is.  I then tried beginner_tutorials::TwoInts, then TwoInts::TwoInts, and even roscpp::TwoInts, but each time, it could not make.
My code looks almost identical to the sample code (aside from it being in a different location).  I keep going back to past tutorials hoping to find something that mentions TwoInts.h, but if its there, I can't find it.
Has anyone run into this?  How am I supposed to solve this?

A:

At the top of the tutorial, in section 1.1, it says to make sure to build on two completed tutorials:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage
http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingMsgAndSrv#Creating_a_srv
I suspect that using those will resolve your issue.
