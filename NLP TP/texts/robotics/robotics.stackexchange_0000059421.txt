Q:

Where can I change the size and form of the Robot at the SBPL Lattice Planner?
I would like that the Robot looks more like a car, and not so circle-formed.

A:

You can set the robot footprint as described here in the navigation stack robot setup tutorial. If you look at the actual code in sbpl_lattice_planner.cpp, you´ll see that the footprint provided by the costmap is used there (lines 117 and 139).

Yes, I found that, but I don't really understand that. How could I change the code so that the robot would be rectangle?
Comment by Stefan Kohlbrecher on 2014-05-16:
to have a rectangular robot that is 30x20cm you´d use
footprint: [[-0.15, 0.1], [0.15, 0.1], [0.15, -0.1], [-0.15, -0.1]]
(Haven´t tried that myself, but the idea should be clear)
