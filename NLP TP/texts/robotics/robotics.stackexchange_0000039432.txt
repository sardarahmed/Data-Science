Q:

ppl_detection package and training data

Do you know if you have to train ppl_detection package or should work at it's best out of the box. Because I get very poor results. Almost every object is human.
Thank you.

A:

Its labelling everything as a person for me as well (see the image).
But I have a solution, don't use ppl_detection, use openni_tracker with the latest openni and nite libraries instead. It can automatically find people, is orders of magnitude more accurate than ppl_detection and tracks skeleton data too. This is a good tutorial on how to set it up.
