Q:

How can we install Husky Simulator in melodic ditro?

While I was going through link:
http://wiki.ros.org/husky_gazebo/Tutorials/Simulating%20Husky
In the command:
$ sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-husky-simulator

I replaced <distro> with melodic
But I am getting following error:
E: Unable to locate package ros-melodic-husky-package

A:

If you visit http://wiki.ros.org/husky_gazebo you'll see that this package is currently only released on Indigo and Kinetic (notice the blue boxes at the top of the wiki page). This is why you cannot install from apt-get.
You can certainly try to build this package from source, but you are not guaranteed that it will work.
To give some confidence that it might work, I just tried to compile husky package on ROS Melodic, and was able to compile with almost no issues (although I haven't tested it extensively). A few notes:

I was able to install many dependencies from apt-get.
The only packages I had to build from source in order to launch the husky_playpen.launch file were:

LMS1xx
husky
interactive_marker_twist_server
robot_localization
twist_mux

The only issue I had compiling was with LMS1xx as described here. Following the instructions on this ros-overlay bug report I was able to switch all logXXXX calls to CONSOLE_BRIDGE_logXXXX using a couple of sed commands.

Thank you for the clarification.
Instead of melodic I am working with Kinetic now.
