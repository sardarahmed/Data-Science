Q:

DRC Vehicle controller does not respond or responds very slowly in DRCSim 2.3

Hello everyone,
I have upgraded to DRCSim 2.3 and since then I can't seem to control the DRC vehicle, aka the polaris ranger.
I used to operate the vehicle by:
rostopic pub /drc_vehicle/gas_pedal/cmd std_msgs/Float64 "{data X.X}"
When the vehicle is in motion, and after applying "data 0.0" the vehicle doesn't seem to stop.
In addition, the steering process takes a lot of time to turn.
Any ideas how to improve?
Oded

I have created an issue on the drcsim issue tracker and assigned it to myself. https://bitbucket.org/osrf/drcsim/issue/176
