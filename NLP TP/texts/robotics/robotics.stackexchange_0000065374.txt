Q:

rosbridge example, no output

Installed rosbridge_suite for indigo distro. Testing link text in rosbridge tutorials by changing the following for my robot:
28. topic: '/Pioneer3AT/rqt/cmd_vel

I run the following:
roslaunch pioneer3at power_pioneer.launch

To launch the robot.
Then run the following:
roslaunch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket.launch

To create websocket. That connects fine. I start the HTML page in Chrome. The slider loads, the topic /Pioneer3AT/rqt/cmd_vel does not publish. Do I need to edit more of the HTML in order to run with my robot? Thanks.

A:

Be sure to change the IP/URL in line 22 to your computer (or localhost most likely).
