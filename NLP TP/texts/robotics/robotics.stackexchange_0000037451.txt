Q:

Which Robot for ROS?

Hi,
which of the supported robots would you recommend for using with ROS (educational purposes)? Turtlebot seems to lead the way but are there any real alternatives? Anything that comes close to Turtlebot (and is in the same/similar price range)?

A:

I would say that the Turtlebot is the most well-supported platform on these forums, just out of experience. That is not to say that other robots aren't well-supported, but there are lots of tutorials and help for Turtlebot users. I'm not sure of any other robots really in that price range.

Additionally, I will add that the TurtleBot  has a growing community with over 450 official TurtleBots sold and about 100 more homemade robots (even Bilibot is using the TurtleBot stacks as a basis). Many professors have already started creating curriculum around the TurtleBot that you could use.
