Q:

ar_pose no longer downloadable...new url?

Hi all,
I'm trying to clone the following git repository:
http://robotics.ccny.cuny.edu/git/ccny-ros-pkg/ccny_vision.git
But the cloning is failing.  Furthermore, when I try to access anything related tot he robotics.ccny.cuny.edu base url, I'm redirected through wayback machine (with no valid snapshots in June).  It seems like this repository is dead.  Does anyone know where the new one might be located, if there's one at all?  Is there any other way to get this package?
