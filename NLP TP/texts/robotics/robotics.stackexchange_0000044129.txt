Q:

topics that create a loop

Hi ,
I have two nodes both of which publish    different custom defined messages. Node A publishes message A , and Node B publishes message B.
Can node A subscribe to message B while node B subscribes to message A.
I am getting error a fatal error saying that the  No such file or directory for the custom defined message.
When i disable node B's subscribing the message A, node can successfully publish the message B.
Any help is appreciated.

A:

It is possible to make topics go in a loop as described. It isn't possible to declare circular dependencies between packages.
It sounds like you have a typo or have forgotten to include a package dependency somewhere.
