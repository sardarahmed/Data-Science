Q:

Can't install ros-hydro-rosjava

I'm trying to run the rosjava install as shown on the ros wiki. When I run this line...
> sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-catkin ros-hydro-ros ros-hydro-rosjava python-wstool

I can't get ros-hydro-rosjava to install. The site states....
If the metapackage ros-hydro-rosjava is not yet in the public repository, install rosjava-build-tools, rosjava-bootstrap, rosjava-messages, rosjava-core, rosjava-extras and zeroconf-jmdns-suite yourself manually. 

I've gotten rosjava-bootstram and rosjava-build-tool working through this line
> sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-rosjava-build-tools ros-hydro-rosjava-bootstrap

But I still need the others... where can I find these and get them installed?
I've tried running the source installation, but it doesn't work when I try to access the git repository. It claims my wstool gets an error.

A:

ros-hydro-rosjava package is not still in the deb public server, so you can

If you are not in a hurry, wait a
bit until it arrives; you can check
here:
http://www.ros.org/debbuild/hydro.html
retry apt-get install ros-hydro-rosjava when the red squares
disappear.

If you cannot wait, add shadow-fix server to your package sources. In      /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list, replace
deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu precise main
by
deb http://packages.ros.org/ros-shadow-fixed/ubuntu precise main
then apt-get update and retry apt-get install ros-hydro-rosjava

Btw, what error you get when installing from sources?
