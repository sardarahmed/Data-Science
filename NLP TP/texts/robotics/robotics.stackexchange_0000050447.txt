Q:

Getting image_color from camera1394

Hi everyone!
I'm trying to get the image from my Fire-i400 1394 camera. In order to do that, I am using the following comands:
$ rosrun camera1394 camera1394_node
$ ROS_NAMESPACE=camera rosrun image_proc image_proc
$ rosrun image_view image_view image:=camera/image_rect_color
and this should give me the images, with color. But I'm getting the following message:
Color topic '/camera/image_color' requested, but raw image data from topic '/camera/image_raw' is grayscale
then, the images come up, but they are on grayscale.
Does anybody know why it is happening? What am I doing wrong?
Thanks in advance!

What parameters did you set for the camera driver?

Actually, I really don't know. I just plugged the camera, downloaded the packages, and, then, I calibrated it. How can I see these parameters? Thanks for your quick answer!

See default params on that node's wiki page if you didn't set any.

A:

You should take a look at the driver tutorials.
They explain how to run the driver, configure color parameters, and access the parameters using dynamic_reconfigure.

Thank you joq! Actually, I just had to use $ rosrun camera1394 camera1394_node _guid:=(my_cam_guid) _video_mode:=640x480_rgb8
