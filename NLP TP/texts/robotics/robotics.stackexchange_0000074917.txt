Q:

Dynamixel Controller Manager showing "waiting for dependencies"

I am following this tutorial:
http://wiki.ros.org/dynamixel_controllers/Tutorials/Creatingmetacontroller
When I run the command

roslaunch my_dynamixel_tutorial start_meta_controller.launch

Controller Manager shows following:

[WallTime: 1467285671.993447] [f_arm_controller] not all dependencies started, still waiting for ['joint4_controller', 'joint3_controller', 'joint5_controller']...

The tutorial page doesn't talk about any dependencies. How can I fix this?
I am using ROS indigo in Ubuntu 14.04

Hello, good afternoon.
Â¿Did you solve the problem?
Thank you very much.
Yours faithfully.

A:

In your  start_meta_controller.launch  change the port from  'dxl_USB0' to 'pan_tilt_port'.
I guess there is a mistake in the tutorial itself.
