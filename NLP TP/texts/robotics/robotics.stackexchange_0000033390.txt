Q:

boxturtle tutorials installation error

I've installed boxturtle on ubuntu 10.04 and I'm receiving the following error when attempting to install the tutorials:
"ERROR: Failed to install tree 'ros_tutorials' using command:
svn co  https://code.ros.org/svn/ros/stacks/ros_tutorials/branches/boxturtle /home/user/ros-tutorials/ros-tuturials
Perhaps there is another installation in the way, or there are permissions issues."
Is there a workaround for this or is there a permission I'm missing?  My current permissions for this folder are: drwxr-xr-x

Please note, boxturtle is really old. The current release is Diamondback, and Eturtle is just around the corner.

A:

Does the folder already exist? I.e. is it "in the way"?
Then try removing it first. If the permissions are for the parent, it should work.
