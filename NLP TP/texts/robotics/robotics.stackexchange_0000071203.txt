Q:

question about parsing urdf file

I followed the urdf /Tutorials/ Create your own urdf file: http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/Tutorials/Create%20your%20own%20urdf%20file, and run check_urdf my_robot.urdf, but the answer is:
Error:   Error document empty.
         
at line 72 in /build/buildd/urdfdom-0.2.10+dfsg/urdf_parser/src/model.cpp

ERROR: Model Parsing the xml failed

and I can't find the file of build/buildd/urdfdom-0.2.10+dfsg/urdf_parser/src/model.cpp, I don't know how to solve it, anyone could help me ?

Can you try with full path to URDF?
Comment by xuao on 2016-01-07:
Do you mean running  check_urdf  /home/xu/catkin_ws/src/Learning_tutorials/urdf/my_robot.urdf directly to parse my file? I have tried that way ,but still failed.

Are you sure that your path is OK? Can you check your file location respecting lower/upper case letters?

I'm sure that my path is correct. But when I run another urfd file"01-myfirst.urdf", which is in the same package with "my_robot.urdf", it succeeded.
xu@xu-ThinkPad-SL410:~/catkin_ws/src/urdf_tutorial/urdf$ check_urdf 01-myfirst.urdf
robot name is: myfirst
