Q:

tabletop_object_perception for electric

Sorry for the repeat, but I want to ask a more general question related to this post: "Problem installing tabletop_object_perception package".
Which tag or branch of tabletop_object_perception works with electric? Alternatively, which tag/branch is supposed to work with electric?
Thanks,
Sean

A:

Everything in tabletop_object_perception has been moved to pr2_object_manipulation/perception for Electric.  Debs can be gotten by apt-getting ros-electric-pr2-object-manipulation .
For svn, Electric trunk is here:
https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/stacks/pr2_object_manipulation/branches/0.5-branch/perception
and exactly what's in Electric debs right now is here:
https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/stacks/pr2_object_manipulation/tags/electric/
