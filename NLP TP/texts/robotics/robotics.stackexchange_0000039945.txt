Q:

Using calibration stack for non PR2 robot

Hello,
I would like to calibrate two arm system with sensor head.
Based on PR2 and maxwell calibration stacks i made configs for my system and successfully run the capture_data. But i am unable to get estimation working.
When i run calibration_estimation it crash because of NaN during calculations.
Here is output from estimation node : estimation_output.txt

A:

I have found answer myself. The problem was caused by baseline_rgbd param in my system.yaml. When this parameter is set to any value, calibration node assume that depth informations is available.
