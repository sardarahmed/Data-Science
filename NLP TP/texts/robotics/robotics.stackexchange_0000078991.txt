Q:

Starting OVER.About to sacrifice a good laptop to my cause....Need Incantations... I mean "Advice"!

Have been on this road for about a month, and have hit some roadblocks, So here is my next thought, I have a laptop-Dell Inspiron  N5110 I5 2430,8Gb ram, that is about to go to a dual boot world. What installations should I be looking at for a smooth start into ROS/Moveit. It is my daily coder but, this project has grown enough to risk what I have. Can't quite give up the win10 install yet..

wiped the laptop and installed ubuntu 16.04 /ros kinetic/ moveit  all in just a few hours, completely different experience, compared with the last month.... Already further ahead then I was yesterday... Thanks for the information and assistance.

Good to hear.
re: experience: yes, as I told you in one of your previous questions, you basically selected one of the tough(est) deployments and started learning ROS together with your deployment.

A:

Note that it is really hard to advice users on these matters. Much depends on your specific use of packages, OS and (robot) hw. But, as of 2017-02-16:

I think the (Ubuntu Trusty; ROS Indigo) combination (both amd64) still has the largest set of packages build by the buildfarm. Trusty and ROS Indigo are supported till May 2019 (wiki/Distributions).

If you would be ok with a little more building from sources (as also for Indigo you'll occasionaly run into packages that don't have a binary distributed), then Kinetic on Ubuntu Xenial would be a good choice. Supported till May 2021 (again: wiki/Distributions).

In general: the community is moving to Xenial/Kinetic, so all development will be moving there as well. Trusty/Indigo is an LTS release, so should remain supported, but developers may decide to put their packages in maintenance mode on that distribution. New features would go into Kinetic in those cases.
Note that I obviously cannot determine beforehand whether any Linux distribution will work properly with your hardware. You should search around a bit for user experiences with your particular hw / laptop.
