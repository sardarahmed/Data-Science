Q:

Do I have to use the CAN protocol that the motor controller uses in order to communicate with it?

I have a question about using the CAN bus to control motor controllers. Do I have to use the CAN protocol that the motor controller uses, e.g. CANopen CiA DS 301 CiA profile 402, in order to communicate with it? Or I can just use any CAN API library, letâ€™s say SocketCan, to communicate with the motor controller? 

A:

CANopen is a application level protocol and socketcan is at the transport level. 
You can send Canopen messages using socketcan without any problems.
You can compose canopen messages by hand but it will be a lot easier if you use a library
