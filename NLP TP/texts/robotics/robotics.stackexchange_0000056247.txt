Q:

Installing pyqwt on Mavericks

I've noticed several threads where people have claimed to have built ROS on OSX Mavericks, I'm currently unable to install pyqwt via homebrew, basically hitting this same error that has been reported but not solved: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/25224
I've tried reinstalling both qt and sip to no avail.
Any helpful hints?

Are you using default Python?

Yes, using default Python.

A:

The current release version of PyQt (4.10.3) has some issues with libc++/clang build settings necessary for Mavericks. Basically PyQt incorrectly parses the QMake build settings that were used to build Qt, resulting in incorrect build flags being generated for PyQt interoperable projects. There is a fix proposed for homebrew here: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/pull/25225 and for PyQt here: http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/pipermail/pyqt/2013-December/033537.html
brew install https://raw.github.com/jensenb/homebrew/76e8bf65dccdeeb785ca2f296ac2458460ba2fde/Library/Formula/pyqt.rb
