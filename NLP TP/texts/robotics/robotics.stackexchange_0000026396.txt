Q:

Gazebo 1.8 & DRCSim 2.6 doesn't see new DRC World models

After updating to the newest Gazebo & DRCSim I am encountering issues downloading the proper models from the models database for the DRC Worlds.
I have deleted the .gazebo/models directory. I have also tried updating the GAZEBO_MASTER_URI to point to the models_latest which allows me to download some, but not all, of the newest models. (e.g. It still can not find mud_box)
I'm not sure if this is something strange since I am behind a proxy server, but when I look at the URL with my browser everything looks okay. Is there somewhere that the contents of the online models database is cached? Is there some other error that I'm encountering? Is this a bug?
