Q:

What are the prerequisites for learning ROS?

It is helpful in robotics to first learn about "Linux kernel development" or "device driver development in Linux" before I start learning ROS? I know C and JAVA! In brief, I want to know any prerequisites which are essential to understand ROS better.

A:

It sounds like you're excited to learn ROS. The best way to learn ROS well is to dive in and learn any necessary bits along the way. Once you finish going through EVERYTHING in the ROS tutorials you can tinker with a project like turtlebot.
Last but not least there is http://answers.ros.org/ for any ROS related questions you may have.
Enjoy!
EDIT
I took the route I suggested and it took me a while to learn some VERY helpful things so I want to point those out as well.

Electric, Fuerte, Groovy, Hydro, Indigo, Jade, Kinetic are all different versions of ROS from oldest (Electric) to newest (Kinetic). I personally use Hydro/Indigo because they have the most/best support in communities.
catkin is a type of ROS friendly workspace. You can build ROS in a workspace (required by some devices/distros) or you can simply do a desktop or full install of ROS.
You can learn to build URDF models from the tutorials. You can use URDF models as robots in Gazebo (mentioned by @NBCKLY). Use this to debug your robot as you can see where it thinks it is and what it thinks it is doing. You can also try throwing parts on, like a laser scanner, to see if that will help your invention.
