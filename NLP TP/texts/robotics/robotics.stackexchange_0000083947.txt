Q:

Print message from launch file

I am wondering if there is any way to print message from launch file. For example, I am calling a node from launch file and I do not want the user to terminate this process. Hence I simply want to print following:
Please keep this running in a separate tab.

Any workaround to achieve it? Thank you very much. Please note that I am using Python 2.7 in ROS Indigo on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS PC.

A:

rostopic echo:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<launch>
  <arg name="msg" default="Please keep this running in a separate tab." />
  <node name="pub_text" pkg="rostopic" type="rostopic"
     args="pub /msg std_msgs/String '$(arg msg)'"
     output="screen" />
  <node name="print_text" pkg="rostopic" type="rostopic"
     args="echo /msg" output="screen" />

yields:
data: Please keep this running in a separate tab.

Though maybe the data: is undesirable
Adding a -p to the echo yields:
%time,field.data
1510939080429253101,Please keep this running in a separate tab.
