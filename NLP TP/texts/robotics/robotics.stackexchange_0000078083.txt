Q:

use custom ompl instead of ros own ompl

Hey there
I would like to develop some path planning algorithms along with ompl, however, it is not easy to use the ros build-in ompl. I would like to build the ompl from source in case of easy revision. I have another package that use ompl (which is : ompl_move_base) , how should I write in CMakeList.txt file so as to use the ompl in /usr/local instead of the one in /ros/indigo/ ?
Many many thanks!

A:

Perhaps the instructions on the Building Common MoveIt! Dependencies from Source in Catkin - Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) page of the MoveIt documentation site could help.
