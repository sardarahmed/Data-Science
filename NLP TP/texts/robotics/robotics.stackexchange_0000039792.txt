Q:

Autocalibration of any pose - openni_tracker

Is it possible to edit the openni_tracker.cpp program to enable auto calibration without requiring the user to present a certain pose? Typically the program requires the user to be in a PSI pose.
NeedPoseForCalibration() returns TRUE in my case. If we can make it return FALSE, then we can auto-calibrate it. How do we set it to FALSE?
IS there some other work-around to enable automatic calibration as soon as a user enters the field of view of the kinect camera, i.e., as soon as the User is detected?

A:

Around 2012 the package openni_tracker indeed needed the user to do the PSI pose.
The latest version (and since quite a long time actually) does the calibration automatically.
