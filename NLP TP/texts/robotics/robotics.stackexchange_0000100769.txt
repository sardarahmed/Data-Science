Q:

set_workspace moveit not working

Hi friends,
I am working with MoveIt and Panda from Franka Emika. I am trying to set the workspace for the robot in Moveit to limit Joints Movement to avoid crashs. But it not seems to have any effekt to the robot.
Function is available for move_group in PythonAPI:
https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/blob/master/moveit_commander/src/moveit_commander/move_group.py
My script looks like the following:
group = moveit_commander.MoveGroupCommander("panda_arm")

## [minX, minY, minZ, maxX, maxY, maxZ]
ws = [0.2, -0.3, 0.3, 0.7, 0.3, 0.7]
group.set_workspace(ws) 

The script will fail due to an error if ws isn't well formed (e.g. ws with 7 entries) which tells me that I am doing the function-call correct ..
If there are other ways to limit joint movements (in Space), I appreciate any idea or hints.
Thanks a lot!

Hello Qualityland,
Have a look at this answer, #q273485 in short you cannot add revolutionary joints.
Instead, you can add a collision object to the region you want to avoid. you can have a look at moveit collision object adding or you can follow this answer #q209030.
