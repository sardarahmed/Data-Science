Q:

catkin_package() include dir 'include' does not exist

I am trying to install viso2_ros package from here, when I encounter the following error while I catkin_make
    CMake Error at /opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/cmake/catkin_package.cmake:296 (message):
    catkin_package() include dir 'include' does not exist relative to
    '/home/tonystark/vision_odometry/src/dlut_smartrob/dlut_motor_hokuyo'
    Call Stack (most recent call first):
    /opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/cmake/catkin_package.cmake:98 (_catkin_package)
   dlut_smartrob/dlut_motor_hokuyo/CMakeLists.txt:50 (catkin_package)

  -- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
  See also "/home/tonystark/vision_odometry/build/CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log". 
  See also "/home/tonystark/vision_odometry/build/CMakeFiles/CMakeError.log".

Can you please tell me how I can solve this? Thanks in advance.
If the way am installing is wrong, can you please point me towards the correct direction?

Hi!
I don't see a viso2 related error here, but a include error in your dlut_smartrob package. Check the CMakeLists.txt of your package to see if you are including a non existing directory.

fatal error: pcl/point_cloud.h: No such file or directory
I got this error while compiling/installing. Any ideas if you had the same?

Remove the word include from this line, and check if you have PCL libraries (libpcl-1.7-all) installed.
