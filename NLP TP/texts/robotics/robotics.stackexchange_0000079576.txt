A:

Indeed there is a ros package for simulating nao in gazebo that is available on indigo
Unfortunately it has not been release into jade or kinetic yet.  The Gazebo plugins have been updated to use the new Gazebo API but the resulting simulation is unstable. You can track the progress of the release in kinetic on this Github issue
