Q:

RGBDSLAM error: math_groups/se3quat.h: No such file or directory

Hi guys,
I am still having a problem with running RGBDSLAM on ubuntu 12.04 and fuerte.
I know what my problem is but I cannot resolve it. heres what I did.
I initially downloaded g2o into my workspace /home/samme/fuerte_workspace/trunk/. using the command svn co:  https://svn.openslam.org/data/svn/g2o/trunk. However I was getting some errors.
I then removed this file into the rubbish bin and followed the instructions given by this link: http://answers.ros.org/question/50585/rgbdslam-error-in-fuerte-and-electric/. I re-downloaded the g2o into home (/home/samme/trunk) by running this command:
svn co  https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/vslam/trunk/
However, when I rosmake, I get this error :
/home/samme/fuerte_workspace/rgbdslam_freiburg/rgbdslam/src/edge.h:22:72: fatal error: /home/samme/fuerte_workspace/trunk/g2o/math_groups/se3quat.h: No such file or directory
The problem is that there is a conflict from my previous svn download. It is still trying to access that file (/home/samme/fuerte_workspace/trunk/g2o/) although I removed it to the rubbish bin.
Any ideas of how to resolve this conflict?
Thanks and best regards,
Khalid

It was a really long time so I do not remember the details. However I remember that there was a problem with g2o therefore I uninstalled the ROS g2o package and installing a general g2o. However I do not think this is a good solution and I am sure others have solved this problem in another way.

A:

I realized I had previously played with the #include in some of the files. I restored it to the default settings. Now I am receiving a different error:
opt/ros/fuerte/include/g2o/core/hyper_graph.h:59:22: error: redefinition of ‘class g2o::HyperGraph’
/home/samme/trunk/g2o/include/g2o/core/hyper_graph.h:46:9: error: previous definition of ‘class g2o::HyperGraph’
It seems that there is a conflict between the g2o that I installed and the one in  ros-fuerte. Does anyone know how to uninstall the g2o that is already included in ROS?
Thanks,
Khalid

Try uninstalling libg2o, if you have it installed, from the ubuntu software center. Remember to use rosmake --pre-clean rgbdslam so that you don't have files from the previous make interfering.
