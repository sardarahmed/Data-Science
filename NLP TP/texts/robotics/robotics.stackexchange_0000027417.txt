Q:

accuracy of contact sensor?

Hi every body :)
why when I put a link of a model on the ground, its contact sensor indicates that the link don't touch the ground ?
like this graph shows, 1 if link touches the ground, -1 else
the link doesn't move and stay in place. Normally the data of the sensor should be always 1 !
Is this a bug ? If not this means that the if link is not heavy it doesn't touch 100% the ground.I tried to make the link heavier (100 Kg), same problem.

EDIT
Here is the source code :
controller.cc
controller.hh
world.world
CMakeLists.h (change the extension to .txt)
cmd.h (if you want to plot with gnuplot)
the model is in this video. the box is fixed to the ground

A:

I resolved the problem by changing the update rate.
First I didn't precise it. By default the frequency is 1000 times per second. So I modified it to 100 and then to 30. And it worked. Still don't understand why it loses accuracy with big frequency...
So, I want to know what is the recommended frequency ?
thanks in advance
