Q:

how to generate a trajectory data from PCL

Hey all.
I wonder if you know how to generate a trajectory like this

We read data from PCL to detect a flat surface and then generate a trajectory. Assuming we know the flat surface and its coordiante. I wonder if you could give me some suggestions, or a link to begin with?
Thank you.

A:

Take a look at Godel (that's where the image is from, is it not?): ros-industrial-consortium/godel.
In particular the godel_process_path_generation and path_planning_plugins.

I know Godel and I'm sure that's the origin. My question is more like how does this code work, like a tutorial  or example of relevant trajectory generation.

It would really help me and I think many others. I know it uses open voronoi but I would really appreciate if I can have access to an example or anything.

This i going to sound a bit harsh, but Godel is the example. Perhaps you could ask the developers over at ros-industrial-consortium/godel whether they have a more stand-alone example for you.
re: openvoronoi: know that that was only used in the previous version. The current version ..

.. does not use that anymore.

Thank you for your reply. May I know what they use right now?
