Q:

How to let robot_pose_ekf recieve IMU data from gazebo

Hi all,
I'm using robot_pose_ekf with gazebo simulator.
Now, I've encountered with a problem that the /robot_pose_ekf only takes in /odom while the IMU data is not transferred.
To be more detailed, /gazebo published IMU data as topic: /mobile_base/sensors/imu_data [sensor_msgs/Imu]. However, /robot_pose_ekf didn't subscribe this topic, instead it listen to /imu_data which has no publisher! I feel it so strange and cannot understand it at all.
Can anyone tell me how to let /robot_pose_ekf subscribe the right topic from /gazebo? FYI, in the launch file of /robot_pose_ekf I tuned "odom_used" "imu_used" to "true" and "vo_used" to "false".
Any hints are welcome.
Thank you in advance.

A:

did you try to remap  /mobile_base/sensors/imu_data  -> /robot_pose_ekf ?

It works! Thank you so much!
But to be more precise, the command to be added in robot_pose_ekf.launch should be:
<remap from=”imu_data” to=”mobile_base/sensors/imu_data”/>

:)
