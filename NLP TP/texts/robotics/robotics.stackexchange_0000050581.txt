Q:

Launch File Highlighting in Eclipse

I am wondering if anyone knows how to get eclipse to see .launch files as if they where XML and perform syntax highlighting based off the xml style?

A:

Try:

install a XML editor plugin (search e.g. "Eclipse XML Editors and Tools")

configure File Associations (Window -> Preferences -> Gerneral -> Editors -> File Associations):
Add "*.launch" and select the internal xml editor

Alternatively open the context menu on a file and choose Open with -> XML editor. I found eclipse to remember that in some way..

You can see the .launch file but you cannot debug it in eclipse. At least, I could not find any solution. I am not sure though.
