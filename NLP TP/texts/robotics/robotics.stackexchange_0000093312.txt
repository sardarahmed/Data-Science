Q:

print the number of received messages

Hi all!
Every time a node receives a message, i want to increment and print the total number of messages that ha been received so far, starting with 0 every time the node starts! Any tips?

A:

Something like will do the job.
void callback(msg::type & msg)
{
  static int counter = 0;
  counter++;
  std::cout << counter << std::endl;
}

int main()
{
  ros::init(argc, argv, "node_name");

  ros::Subscriber sub = n.subscribe("your_sub_topic", 1, callback);

  ros::spin();

}
