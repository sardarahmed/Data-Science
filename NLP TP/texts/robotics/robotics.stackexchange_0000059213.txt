Q:

Navigation stack on an Atom CPU: possible?

Hello,
We're working on getting the Navigation stack up-and-running on our robot. We're making headway, but we have a question about the horsepower needed to run the nav stack. We're working under the assumption that this computer will do the trick. The DE2i-150 has an Atom N2600 at 1.6 GHz and 2GB of DDR3 RAM. Is this a reasonable assumption?
Thanks in advance,
Rick Armstrong

A:

It appears the Atom N2600 is roughly comparable to the Atom D525 originally used with the netbooks sold with the Turtlebot (eeePC 1215n). It thus should be possible to run the navigation stack on the machine you mentioned.

Thanks, Stefan.

I would definitely look at the turtlebot nav configuration -- they turned down certain update rates to make things work smoothly on the Atom (you can't update quite as fast as a PR2, from which the defaults exist but with the proper update rates, you should be able to run navigation on the Atom).
