Q:

Car-like robot navigation

Hi, I am building a MIT-Racecar, a so called "Car-like robot". I found a lot of features in current ROS navigation stack did not work on Car-like-robot. I am wondering if there is any existing navigation ROS software for car-like-robot.

What features?

I'm guessing planning, as the default local planners do not work with Ackermann steering. You'll probably want to take a look at teb_local_planner.
I do +1 @jayess' question though: @AutoCar: simply stating that things "did not work" is not enough.

mostly in planning, since car-like-robot can't rotate in place.

A:

Hi, you can try teb_local_planner.
Yes, car-like-robot can't rotate in place, so you can set the parameter min_turning_radius of this planner as you need, and there's a detailed tutorial for Planning for car-like robots. link text
Hope it will help.
