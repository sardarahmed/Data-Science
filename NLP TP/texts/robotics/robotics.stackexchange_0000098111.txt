Q:

How to use ament_lint to validate ROS2 package

In ROS1 it was very useful to run catkin_lint -W2 to validate the CMake and package.xml. Is there a feature in ament_lint to get this desired behavior? I have tried ament_xmllint but it doesn't provide errors or warnings regarding missing depends in the package.xml. If this feature does exist it will save a lot of time developing ROS2 packages.

A:

The best entry point to understand how to use ament_lint I recommend starting here: http://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/How-To-Guides/Ament-CMake-Documentation.html?highlight=lint#linting
The common linters are documented here: https://github.com/ament/ament_lint/blob/rolling/ament_lint_common/doc/index.rst
Including a link to ament_lint_auto which is recommended to simplify enabling multiple linters:
