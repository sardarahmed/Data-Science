Q:

Source Installation after a Debian Installation

Hi,
I am referring to the Turtlebot installation process on http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot/Tutorials/indigo/Turtlebot%20Installation
I did a Debian installation for the Turtlebot but realized that I should have done a Source installation instead. If I were to do a source installation now, will it create any errors during the overwrite process?
Thanks!

Just curious: can you tell us why you feel you "should have done a Source installation instead"?
Comment by Rayner on 2016-12-30:
Source installation allows me to access and edit the codes whereas for a debian installation, it isn't so straightforward to access the codes right? (Do correct me if I am wrong, I'm pretty new to ROS).
Thanks!

You can create a Catkin workspace in which you place just the packages you want the sources for / edit. Those will overlay the binary packages, so if something isn't present in your workspace, the binary will be used. No need to redo your installation.
