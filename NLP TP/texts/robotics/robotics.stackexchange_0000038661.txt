Q:

Querying topic types in C++

I there a way in C++ to query if a topic exists and if so what message type it uses?
I am trying to write a generic visualization tool and would like to subscribe to a topic using a callback matching the topic's type.
Alternatively a method that accepts all messages but allows me to learn their type in the callback would also work.

The xmlrpc api should be able to do that. (getPublishedTopics)
