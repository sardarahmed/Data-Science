Q:

Adding Comments in a msg format file

I am a bit confused because at all the sample codes that I have seen on ROS wiki, I have seen that the comments are displayed above the code:
#Standard metadata for higher-level flow data types
#sequence ID: consecutively increasing ID 
uint32 seq
#Frame this data is associated with
string frame_id

Can I place comments infront of the code like:
 uint32 seq        #sequence ID: consecutively increasing ID  #Standard metadata 
 string frame_id   #Frame this data is associated with

Also if you are fine with both, which one is considered a good programming practice

A:

I use the second variant but the disadvantage of that is that TAB is not treated as space properly so I have to untabify my files before saving them otherwise rosdoc_lite (or maybe doxygen) does not handle the file properly.

I am exactly doing the same thing right now. I am untabbing all the comments in my files and adding spaces because tab is 8 characters and space is only 1 character
