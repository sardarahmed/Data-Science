Q:

The final step in kalman filter to correct/update the covariance matrix

I see that, in the correction step of Kalman filter, there is an equation to update the covariance matrix. I have been using it in the form:

P = (I - KH)P'

Here P is the covariance matrix, K is the Kalman Gain and H is the observation model. The I is the identity matrix. However, I also see a different equation in some literature:

P = P' - KSKT

where 

S = HPHT + Q

where Q is the noise matrix for the observation model. Are these two equations same? If so, how to prove it?

A:

The Kalman Gain is defined as the following:
$K = PH^T (HPH^T + Q)^-1$
From your question, we need to prove:
$P - KSK^T = (I - KH)P$
primes omitted for simplicity
Canceling P, and substitute S with the provided definition:
$K (HPH^T + Q)K^T = KHP$
Substitute the first K on the left hand side with the definition of the Kalman gain provided:
$PH^T (HPH^T + Q)^-1 (HPH^T + Q)K^T = KHP$
S and it's inverse reduces to identity, we are left with:
$PH^TK^T = KHP$
From the transpose property of matrices $(ABC)^T = C^T B^T A^T$ we can rearrange LHS with $P$ as $A$, $H^T$ as $B$, and $K^T$ as $C$:
$(KHP^T)^T = KHP$
Since covariance matrix is symmetric, and KHP must be symmetric (this can be inferred from $P' = P - KHP$) therefore:
$KHP = KHP$
