Q:

File has unexpected size

An error occurred when I installed ros，Here's what I do：
$ sudo sh -c '. /etc/lsb-release && echo "deb http://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/ros/ubuntu/ $DISTRIB_CODENAME main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'

$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-key 421C365BD9FF1F717815A3895523BAEEB01FA116

$ sudo apt update

Then report an error. May I ask who knows the reason？Is it the ros mirror source that is wrong？

Edit: Thank you for your reply.
I tried to update the ros mirror source on May 28, May 29, and May 30. And i have tried using the following three mirror sources:

packages.ros.org
mirrors.ustc.edu.cn
mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn

But it's all the same mistake.I even installed a new ubuntu system to try.
I used the system: ubuntu18.04
It's hard to believe that all three mirror sources are having problems at the same time,So are there any other possible causes?

As it is, this does not appear to be a ROS related problem. If you cannot solve it, I would suggest to post on a forum such as Ask Ubuntu.

The problem is not the ROS mirrors.
The repository at 220.112.193.195/files/1116000006474FFE/mirrors.cqu.edu.cn/ubuntu is the problem.
Perhaps a grep 'mirrors.cqu.edu.cn' -r /etc/apt could help.

The problem does not appear to be the ROS mirror (ie: USTC), but the package repository which is located at:

Get:3 http://220.112.193.195/files/1116000006474FFE/mirrors.cqu.edu.cn/ubuntu bionic/main amd64 Packages [481 kB]

Err:3 http://220.112.193.195/files/1116000006474FFE/mirrors.cqu.edu.cn/ubuntu bionic/main amd64 Packages

Notice how the error message mentions 220.112.193.195/files/1116000006474FFE/mirrors.cqu.edu.cn/ubuntu, which is not the USTC ROS mirror.
I'm not sure what 220.112.193.195/files/1116000006474FFE is exactly, you should probably know. Is that the mirror you use for Ubuntu Bionic itself?
If this problem persists (ie: even after retrying a few times, for instance tomorrow), you should contact the administrator of the Ubuntu mirror and ask them.

Thank you for your help.
I went to check the website of “220.112.193.195/files/1116000006474FFE/mirrors.cqu.edu.cn/ubuntu”
“220.112.193.195” this IP is not a mirror IP，Then I looked up the location of the IP, which was very close to my company, and I thought it might be a problem with the company network, maybe some wrong domain name mapping or something.
Finally I switched to my phone's Internet connection, and I've solved the problem。
Your advice is very helpful. Thank you very much。
