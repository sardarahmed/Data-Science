Q:

Binary Packages for ROS Hydro on ARMHF

I have ROS Hydro running on Ubuntu 12.04 (for armhf) on a Pandaboard ES.  I'm having trouble running some of my nodes on this board because packages are missing.  I have tried to install these packages individually using apt-get but I get an "unable to locate package" error.
Are the following binary packages available for armhf?  How can I see what is available and what isn't?
moveit_commander
rviz
robot_model

A:

The ARM buildfarm status for Hydro is at: http://packages.namniart.com/repos/status/hydro.html
I haven't tried to build moveit on ARM. If it builds from source easily, I can add it to the build farm and see how it does.
rviz doesn't build on ARM. The OpenGL support and the support libraries aren't there, and I wouldn't expect it to be fast enough even if I could get it to build. The error I'm seeing on the farm is:
-- checking for module 'OGRE'
--   found OGRE, version 1.7.4
-- OGRE_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/OGRE-1.7.4
CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:91 (MESSAGE):

  CMakeLists.txt:31 (find_package)

robot_model isn't building on ARM because it depends on collada_urdf, which fails to build with the following error:

Thanks for the excellent response!  Looks like I need to find an Intel-based board for my application.
Comment by ahendrix on 2014-03-05:
MoveIt and collada_urdf are potentially fixable. If you can verify that they work and/or provide patch files, I can incorporate them into the build process for the ARM build farm.

This question suggests that rviz can be built on ARM, but I haven't tested it myself or gotten feedback that it runs well enough to be useful: http://answers.ros.org/question/52098/unable-to-compile-rviz-on-ubuntu-armhf/
