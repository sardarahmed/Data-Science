Q:

query on joint_state_publisher

how to add values for joints for visualizing the motion of a robothead in rviz without using gui.this is the launch file
<launch> <arg name="model"/> 
<arg name="gui" default="False"/> 
<param name="robot_description" command="$(find xacro)/xacro.py $(arg model)"/> 
<param name="use_gui" value="$(arg gui)"/> 
<node name="joint_state_publisher" pkg="joint_state_publisher" type="joint_state_publisher" ></node> 
<node name="robot_state_publisher" pkg="robot_state_publisher" type="state_publisher"/> <node name="rviz" pkg="rviz" type="rviz" args="-d $(find urdf_tutorial)/urdf.vcg"/> 
</launch>

thanks.

A:

First of all, your launch file is not valid XML (around &gt;<="" node="">). Second, you can improve readability by indenting every line by four spaces (this will display your launch file as a code block; you can also edit your question to that effect).
Now to answer your question: If I understand you correctly, you want to write some code that moves the robot head in RViz, instead of using the joint_state_publisher GUI. That's actually very easy; all you have to do is write a node that publishes JointState messages. This tutorial will show you how.

Thank you Martin, I am new to ROS. Will edit accordingly,i dont know why (around ><="" node="">) keeps appearing again and again when i post the question.Actual xml file is (>) anyway thank you.I will try the tutorial,but i have to use a long set of values(rpy,xyz) to enter for the motion of the head. can i use http://www.ros.org/wiki/motion_planning_rviz_plugin/Tutorials/DisplayingRobotTrajectoriesInRviz ?
