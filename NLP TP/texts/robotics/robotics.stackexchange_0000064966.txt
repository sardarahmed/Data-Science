Q:

trouble installing ros on Ubuntu

I'm trying to get ros set up on my Linux Machine and I've been following this tutorial
http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu
When I get to step 1.4 Under install where I install ROS and I go with the Desktop-Full Install which is recommended I get the following error after entering the command: sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-desktop-full
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 ros-indigo-desktop-full : Depends: ros-indigo-simulators but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

Either way I can't install it and I'm not sure why. How do I fix this?

@tfoote FYI

@aadkinz It looks like apt-get is in a bad state, you can try sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade to resolve the issue, but that's really a shot in the dark.

I also tried sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade and that didn't help

I'm using a Toshiba Satellite S55B266
and ahendrix. I believe I do I'm not quite sure

To debug this issue. Please try to install the dependencies which are erroring. At some level there's a conflict, unfortunately apt won't tell you the error from below. So you'll need to recursively try each of the dependencies until you find the one which gives a useful error.

I just put Linux on my computer for ROS does that mean that I do
apt-cache search ros-indigo

and manually install each package in that list until I find the error?
Comment by tfoote on 2015-01-06:
No, follow the errors when you ask to install. desktop-full is erroring on simulators, so try installing simulators. If something underneath errors. Try installing each one that errors, and dig down that way.

Ok I did that and that did the trick.
Thanks!

What was the problem?
Comment by aadkinz on 2015-01-06:
I'm not sure exactly. All I did was sudo apt-get install and each time I was get the error that I got for the simulator package until I got to the dependency libsdformat1 after I did sudo apt-get install libsdformat1 all the other dependencies starting working correctly.
Comment by tfoote on 2015-01-06:
If you still have the output of your install of libsdformat1 I expect you'll see that it uninstalled a conflicting package when it installed that. It would be great to know what that package was for others to reference in the future.

I never closed my terminal, but I don't see it there anymore. Is it saved to any kind of log I can pull up? Sorry if I seem like I don't know what I'm talking about, but I'm new to Linux. and it's quite a bit too. I'm not sure it would all fit here.
Comment by tfoote on 2015-01-06:
To add more information you can edit your question.  You might be able to find something in the logs. LIke /var/log/dpkg.log   You can also enable a longer scroll history on your terminal to get keep more history. That's very useful in cases like this.

A:

I had a similar problem of unmet dependencies. Install aptitude and run this command
sudo aptitude install ros-indigo-desktop-full

When everything is done, do check apt state by running
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-desktop-full

It should return the following
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
ros-indigo-desktop-full is already the newest version.
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 9 not upgraded.

I faced this problem twice on different machines and this solved it both times. I feel apt is not well equipped to handle dependencies and aptitude does it better.
