Q:

Couldn't find executable named rgbdslam

I was following rgbdslam tutorial. I'm using ros groovy and ubuntu 12.04. I have installed rgbdslam using the given steps in http://www.ros.org/wiki/rgbdslam. When I run 'rosrun rgbdslam rgbdslam' it gives the following error. Can somebody help?
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named rgbdslam below /home/test/ros_workspace/rgbdslam_freiburg/rgbdslam
[rosrun] Found the following, but they're either not files,
[rosrun] or not executable:
[rosrun]   /home/test/ros_workspace/rgbdslam_freiburg/rgbdslam

A:

Did you do rosmake rgbdslam_freiburg? And if so, what was the output?

Hello,, Thank you for your response. Yes I did the step that you have mentioned above. It didn't give any error that time. I reinstalled ubuntu and everything is working fine now. Thank you very much.
