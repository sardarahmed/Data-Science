Q:

google cartographer

can we use google cartographer without installing ros, like only using c++ or python?
I have tried looking for c++ but did not get how to use, but in some website it is shown we can see it without ros

A:

Yes, Google cartographer is released as a standalone library. See their homepage https://google-cartographer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Cartographer is a standalone C++ library. To get started quickly, use our ROS integration.

The releases are on GitHub here.
The ROS bindings are the quickest way to get started. But you don't need them. If you're not familiar with how to download and use the package that they're making available. It may be easier for you to get started with the ROS packages.
