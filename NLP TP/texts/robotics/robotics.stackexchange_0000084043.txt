Q:

Error encountered when running 'hokuyo_node' after installing it in ROS Kinetic from: "how-to-install-hokuyo_nodeurg_node-on-kinetic" question

i install hokuyo_node in kinetic from this link https://answers.ros.org/question/243232/how-to-install-hokuyo_nodeurg_node-on-kinetic/
but when i try to run the node : rosrun hokuyo_node hokuyo_node
i get this error :slight_smile:
[ERROR] [1511453614.949279898]: Exception thrown while opening Hokuyo.
Failed to open port: /dev/ttyACM0. No such file or directory (errno = 2). The requested port does not exist. Is the hokuyo connected? Was the port name misspelled? (in hokuyo::laser::open) You may find further details at http://www.ros.org/wiki/hokuyo_node/Troubleshooting
and when i try this : ls /dev/ttyACM*
or this : ls -l /dev/ttyUSB0
i get No such file or directory

A:

Your sensor does not appear to be pluggedin, or the port is not configured currectly. See the troubleshooting guide: http://wiki.ros.org/hokuyo_node/Troubleshooting and if you don't see anything there please edit your question with the debugging outputs of all those commands.
Also search for releated questions on this site. I find a bunch of similar questions
