Q:

ekf_localization compute heading from gps motion?

My magnetometer is not working so great here, so I'm thinking about estimating mobile robot heading from changes in GPS location (as I think is used in car satnavs to get the heading).     My question is, how to integrate this with the ekf_localization system?    Should I write my own node which takes NMEA in and writes out headings, and fuse them into ekf_localization,   or is ekf_localization or some other existing library node already set up to do this ?

A:

ekf_localization_node does not handle this. You're not the first person to want that kind of functionality in a node, so if there are no others, you might consider writing one and releasing it. Note, however, that some GPS devices provide heading based on differentiated positions, and their ROS drivers would likely fill out those fields in the messages they produce.
