Q:

how to get catkin package recognized by rosrun

I created a catkin workspace folder ~/catkin-ws, and downloaded usb_cam (http://wiki.ros.org/usb_cam) source into ~/catkin-ws/src. I called catkin_make and ~/catkin-ws/devel/lib/usb_cam/usb_cam_node is created.
But when I type rosrun usb[TAB Key],  nothing happened.
I think this is because usb_cam not registered to ros system yet, since there is no usb_cam in /opt/ros/hydro/lib(I am using hydro). so I tried this:
sudo cp -r ~/catkin-ws/devel/lib/* /opt/ros/hydro/lib/
still not working. how to get a catkin complied package recognized by rosrun?
by the way, running "~/catkin-ws/devel/lib/usb_cam/usb_cam_node" directly does work. is that the correct way?

There are some articles about usb_cam in ROS Q&A.
For example, check it out (http://answers.ros.org/question/42906/issue-with-usb_cam-cant-open-camera/) .

Thanks, Ken. It works, you are great. I know cp and run node directly without rosrun can hardly be a good answer, but I just cannot find the correct one after reading tutorials and ppt courses by myself.

A:

Did you try this command source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash after compiling the package? I always execute the command to make PC recognize the package. sudo cp -r ~/catkin_ws/devel/lib/* /opt/ros/hydro/lib/  is bad. I think that this behaivior isn't described on wiki.ros.
