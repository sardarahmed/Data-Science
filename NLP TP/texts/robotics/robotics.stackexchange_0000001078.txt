Q:

How do I measure the distance that a cord (string) has moved?

For a pet project, I am trying to fly a kite using my computer.  I need to measure how far a cord extends from a device.  I also need to somehow read out the results on my computer. So I need to connect this to my pc, preferably using something standard like USB.
Since the budget is very small, it would be best if I could get it out of old home appliances or build it myself.
What technology do I need to make this measurement?

A:

Sure, here are a couple of choices for you:

For high end, you can look at a 200 counts per revolution rotary encoder like this one:
$30 Sparkfun 200 Counts Per Revolution Rotary Encoder

You'll need a microcontroller like an Arduino to count the rotations, there's some sample code to play with.

$5 Adafruit 24 Counts Per Revolution Rotary Encoder

Cheaper, not quite as much community support in comments.

For a little more fun, you can combine the rotary encoder with a gearmotor so you could control the kite string with one piece of equipment.
