Q:

Is it possible to simulate robots using magnetic wheels driving on a ferrous surface?

Hi all, I'm looking to use Gazebo to simulate a robot using magnetic wheels to drive vertically on ferrous material.
Can anyone please give me some advice if this is possible to do within Gazebo and if so where I should start? I haven't had much luck and I'm pretty new to ROS and Gazebo.
Thanks,

A:

I think you'll have to write a gazebo plugin, which will calculate and apply magnetic forces to wheels on every time step update.
Here are some links to start with:
