Q:

bug report rosserial arduino

I cannot file a bugreport because I cannot get into Trac, so here it is:
The latest release of rosserial for arduino (downloaded it 30 december) is not capable of subscribing to std_msgs/uint16 or std_msgs/uint8.
I wrote a program to test it. subscribe to and publish the same value. This will not work for uint16, but std_msgs::int16 was okay. The code will compile correctly but on the Arduino it gets misinterpreted (some value is read, which changes also!).
I suspect that the definition of UInt16.h in the std_msgs-directory in Arduino is not okay because it has changed . It used to have definition:
  union {
    signed char real;
    unsigned char base;
  } u_data;

and now not anymore.
But that does not hold because publishing uints with the new version is not a problem!
