What do you mean exactly with 'whitelist member'?

I want to make a document for my works.
But when I access to PackageDocumentation page, it says like below.
Hi there. In an effort to combat spam, we require that users be added to a whitelist to gain edit permissions. To gain edit permissions for yourself, please comment on this GitHub ticket

The text you quote asks you to comment on roswiki/issues/139, but you opened a new issue. I think @tfoote didn't realise you want to be added to the wiki usergroup.
You can either comment on issues/139 or add some reference to issues/139 in the issue you opened.
