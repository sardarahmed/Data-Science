Q:

Why are ROS commands not recognised when I open a new terminal?

I know I'm a complete noob and it will be something stupid, but I've been going through the tutorials trying to get ROS installed and set up and I've got to ROS\Tutorials\UnderstandingNodes where one of the steps says run the roscore command (which runs until you stop it right?) and run something else in a new terminal while it's running. Everytime I open a new terminal it won't recognise any ROS commands.
rosnode: command not found
roscd: command not found
etc...
I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 and I think I've tried to install both ROS Groovy and Hydro. Not going to lie, I have absolutely zero idea what I'm doing here...
Cheers.

A:

It sounds like setup.bash hasn't been sourced in the new terminal window. When you open a new window try executing this command:
source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash

I personally include that in my .bashrc file, which will do that automatically every time you open a new terminal, however some people don't like that approach.

Perfect, Thank you so much! I think I'll go and add it to my .bashrc file to save me from forgetting every time.
