Q:

How can I create a robot like the EZ-B using a regular Arduino?

I am interested in building a robot like the EZ-B, sold by ez-robot.com. It comes with an SDK for Visual Studio and has direct scripting in runtime through a USB, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, IRC or HTTPS connection.
If I get a regular Arduino board, will I be able to control it remotely in the same way? From what I've read, an Arduino needs to hold the instructions in its own memory, but I would rather have the brain in the computer, feeding signals back and forth to the microcontroller.
Also, is Arduino alone, a step down as the website niceley puts it?

A:

Unfortunately, I have no experience with ez-b, but I have looked over the site a little bit. I do, however, have lots of Arduino experience. The program is, indeed, stored on the board's local memory. However, it is very possible to write a program that can interact with your computer. With my Arduino, I often write programs that communicate with my computer over USB. To communicate over Wifi will require additional hardware. There is a Wifi "shield" that can be attached to your Arduino, but this runs at around $60.
