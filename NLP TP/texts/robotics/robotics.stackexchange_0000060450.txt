do ros suport mpi? Can High-performance computing integrated into ros?

A:

ROS doesn't natively support using MPI for message-passing between nodes. It uses sockets for inter-process communication, and shared pointers for intra-process communication. These are generally fast enough for most users.
Judging by the wiki page, the MPI stack was probably experimental, and it looks like it wasn't fully integrated with ROS. There's no in-depth documentation, no tutorials, and it isn't released.

Thank you for your reply. Would you mean that there is no need to integrate mpi into ros?  Then, how can we accelerate our programs when it contains  large amounts of calculation? Distributed computing, cloud computing, can it work with ros?

ROS nodes are simply C++ or Python programs; you can do anything you would in a normal C++ program, including using libraries outside of ROS.
