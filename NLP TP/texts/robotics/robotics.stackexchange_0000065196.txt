Q:

robot simulator for indigo

Hello,
I am trying to test out the Basic Nav2D Widget from nav2djs and will need a to use the pr2_simulator to run the demo. I understand that the p2r_simulator have yet to be ported over to indigo. Is there any other simulator currently available on indigo which I could use?
Thanks
