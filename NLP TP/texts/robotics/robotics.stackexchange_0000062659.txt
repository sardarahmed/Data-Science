Q:

Where to put mobile platform inverse kinematics

Hello,
I am putting a place a mobile robot with mecanum wheels. For my robot to be driven I would like to be able to specify a desired velocity to the platform (a twist) and have the robot decide itself about the velocity of the wheels (joint velocity) that lead to this desired twist: this is what I call the mobile platform's IK. This IK is not so complex to compute but I am afraid I do not understand where to perform the computation in ROS. So what is the best practise to implement this mobile IK? And where should I put the code?
I had a look at the husky packages but could not find anything relevant. I am pretty sure many robot simulations do have the same need and implement this, no?
Anyone having a better understanding than me? Any example code?
Thanks,
Antoine.

A:

For most robots that include a mobile base, a robot (or mobile base) specific driver package is created, which includes functionality like you describe. The husky packages are examples of this.
For a more generic, plugin, type approach you might take a look at the recently announced diff_drive_controller for ros_control.
