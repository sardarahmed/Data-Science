Q:

Kinect 2? or keep Kinect 1

I'm working in project using Kinect1 in ROS to extract the depth information.
My question is If you have any experience with the two version 1 and 2 and If you feel really the difference ?

A:

So far there does not seem to exist a driver for v2 of Kinect. According to other posts, people using v2 are doing so "mapping" a Windows-installed Kinect2.
