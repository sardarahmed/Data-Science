Q:

How can I read bluetooth data with ROS Noetic?

I am working with a KUKA KR5 arc HW-2 manipulator in Gazebo, I created the URDF model and all the necessary drivers to be able to move it, what I would like to know is if it is possible to use an Xbox Series S controller to be able to move its joints. I understand that the new Xbox controls communicate via bluetooth but I really don't know how to obtain the data sent by their different buttons and triggers with ROS. Is there a package for that or a rospy or roscpp function that can be used to read what is being sent through a bluetooth channel?
If someone has managed to do something similar to what I'm looking for, I'd really appreciate it if you could guide me, it's for the development of a school project, it doesn't matter if a wired Xbox controller, PlayStation controller or any other bluetooth controller was used.

A:

ROS categorizes such devices as joysticks. If you configure linux properly, the OS sees the bluetooth-controller as a serial port which sends a stream of characters.
