Q:

Installing Turtlebot3 software for the first time on remote pc

I am up to the point of starting up the software on the remote pc. I am following the tb3 wiki. I gave this command:
pitosalas@pitothink:~$ roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_model.launch

I am getting this error message:
[turtlebot3_model.launch] is neither a launch file in package [turtlebot3_bringup] nor is [turtlebot3_bringup] a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

I am not sure what directory I should be in when issueing the above command
Also where can I find the log file?

Thanks!
Pito

A:

You can run that command from anywhere. The problem is that ROS can't find the package turtlebot_bringup. You need to make sure that you

install the package using apt-get or from source.
if you downloaded it from the source, put it in the src directory of your catkin workspace
go to the root of your catkin workspace and run either catkin_make or catkin build (which ever is recommended)
run source devel/setup.bash (again, from the root of your catkin workspace)

Now, you should be able to run that command.
