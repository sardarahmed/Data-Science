Q:

Params for joy_teleop package?

Hi,
I am a beginner  to ros and I am trying to publish messages to cmd_vel with the joy_teleop package. The problem is this: in the code it says this:
 Generic joystick teleoperation node.
Will not start without configuration, has to be stored in 'teleop' parameter.
See config/joy_teleop.yaml for an example.

Problem is I can't figure out what params I need to give it and I can't discern what I need to pull from the yaml file. Could someone please supply me with a example rosrun line to start this node with a xbox 360 controller?
Thanks,
Luketheduke

A:

Some googling brought me to teleop_tools/issues/10, where the author points to reem_robot/reem_bringup/launch/joystick_teleop.launch for an example launch file. That file refers to reem_robot/reem_bringup/config/joy_teleop.yaml, which should give you some clue as to how to configure things for your particular joystick.
Note that the author of joy_teleop adds the following in teleop_tools/issues/10:

joy_teleop is subscribing to the /joy topic to provide high level functionalities. Unless you have a driver for your joystick it won't do any good.

Edit: also, I think the teleop_twist_joy is better suited for what you want to do. joy_teleop is a higher level package.

Ok thanks I am now using teleop_twist_joy but would you happen to know why my node requires the values for linear and turning to be extremely high(around 30)?
Thanks,
Luketheduke
edit:
I figured out the problem is in my node. teleop_twist_joy is working fine for me.

I don't really know. Have you verified that the interface you have to your hardware is correctly transforming / converting input? Just thinking out loud, but Twists use radians for the rotational parts, have you converted those properly?
