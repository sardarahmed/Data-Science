Is the version of gps_common that you have installed locally the same as the version of gps_common which was installed on whatever device was used to collect the bagged data?

I don't have an idea about the version of gps_common used to collect the data. Assuming the two versions are different, is there a solution to overcome this problem like using another tool to do the conversion or creating my own node.

There's some info here on fixing md5sums in bag files. You could also upload a piece of the bag file so others can test.

A:

Thank you stevejp for your answer. I managed to solve the problem by getting an old version of the package and add the fix_translator node because it was not included in the first releases. Also I think for others who might encounter the same problem and who don't want to waste their time in adding fix_translator node manually maybe a small change in the .xml file will solve the issue just change this line   <version>0.1.7</version> and put the right version used in your bag file.
