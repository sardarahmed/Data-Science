Q:

cmake failed catkin_pkg

Hi,
I'm going through the ROS tutorials and am stuck at creating a workspace (http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace).
When I try and run catkin_make, I keep getting the following
ImportError: "from catkin_pkg.package import parse_package" failed: No module named catkin_pkg.package
Make sure that you have installed "catkin_pkg", it is up to date and on the PYTHONPATH.
CMake Error at /opt/ros/hydro/share/catkin/cmake/safe_execute_process.cmake:11 (message):

CMakeLists.txt:52 (find_package)

-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
Invoking "cmake" failed

However, catkin_pkg is installed AND on my PYTHON PATH
echo $PYTHONPATH 
/opt/ros/hydro/lib/python2.7/dist-packages:/usr/share/pyshared/catkin_pkg

Also, EXTREMELY SORRY that I fail at pasting dialog from the terminal on here.

A:

resolved using
pip install catkin_pkg

I'm using EPD, and the package was installed on a different Python

You should only install packages from PIP when you are on a platform which does not use Debian packages. Otherwise install the package "python-catkin-pkg".

this does not solve the issue, catkin_pkg is already installed with pip in my case and i still get the above error.

Have you installed anaconda? If yes, maybe you should commet the anaconda path in .bashrc
