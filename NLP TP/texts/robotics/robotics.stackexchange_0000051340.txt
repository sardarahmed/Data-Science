Q:

Navigation_stack actionlib goal coordinates

Dear all
I have a navigation_stack implemented and working. And, I would like to send the goal coordinates in the code through a topic using actionlib. I dont want to send the goal coordinates through  rviz.
Does any one may have a chunk of code I can use or a site where I can read how to do this. I have been reading actionlib tutorials but I need a more specific implementation.
Thanks

A:

The tutorial SendingSimpleGoals explains exactly what you want to do. (Also check out the other navigation tutorials, they are quite good).

The robot is working properly with the navigation_stack. I now want to move further. I can send the robot to some coordinates based on the tutorial you suggested (Using actionlib). However, I want to use actionlib to pass 2D Pose estimate and 2D Nav goal. Do you know how to do that?

Yes, it's all explained in the tutorial I linked to.
