Q:

Can't install ros-lunar on Ubuntu 16.10

I'm trying to install ros-lunar on Ubuntu 16.10 (I already tried to install it also on 17.10 with no success)
i always get this error:
sudo apt-get install ros-lunar-desktop
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 ros-lunar-desktop : Depends: ros-lunar-common-tutorials but it is not going to be installed
                     Depends: ros-lunar-geometry-tutorials but it is not going to be installed
                     Depends: ros-lunar-robot but it is not going to be installed
                     Depends: ros-lunar-ros-tutorials but it is not going to be installed
                     Depends: ros-lunar-visualization-tutorials but it is not going to be installed
                     Depends: ros-lunar-viz but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

I already tried to setup my sources.list as explained in the ros-lunar installation guide.
I had the same issue on Ubuntu 17.10.
When I try to run sudo apt-get update, I get errors like these ones:
E: Failed to fetch http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/yakkety/main/binary-amd64/Packages  404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.91.26 80]

How can I install ros-lunar?
Can you help me, please?

Just an observation, but Lunar is not supported on 17.10, see REP-3.
And note also that 16.10 is EOL: notice.

Please show us the contents of /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list on your machine?

I had the same problem on Ubuntu 17.04.
Anyway, I'm using UBUNTU 16.10, not Ubuntu 17.10.
This is the output on my machine 16.10.
cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list 
deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu yakkety main

See  Ubuntu 16.10 Update problem for why your apt-get update isn't working. Ubuntu Yakkety is end-of-life (ie: not supported any more by Canonical). This could be why the ROS pkgs aren't installing (as required pkgs can't be found).

I'm not saying you're running 17.10 now, just trying to provide an explanation for why you can't install Lunar on 17.10, which you stated you were trying before.

So i need to downgrade to 16.04 in order to run ROS Lunar?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-03-13:
The only supported (by Canonical) Ubuntu release that supports ROS Lunar would be 16.04 (or Xenial), yes. If you require a newer version of Ubuntu (because of hw support fi), then installing 18.04 and ROS Melodic would perhaps be an option.

A:

An alternative would be to update your apt sources to point to old-releases.ubuntu.com. That would allow you to download the latest version of all Yakkety packages, which might make the latest version of ROS Lunar on Yakkety installable (provided that is the problem).
No guarantees though.
And you would be running an OS that does not get any (security) updates any more, neither any ROS updates. That might not be a good idea.
But note that I wrote: "this could be why the ROS pkgs aren't installing". I can't be sure it is the cause.

As you suggested, I made my apt to point to old-releases and now I'm successfully installing ros-lunar-desktop-full with apt-get.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-03-13:
As long as you're aware you're now running an unsupported OS -- and will not receive any ROS updates either any more.

Yes, I'm on a virtual machine, I just need Lunar since I have to compile a ROS Node with catkin_make, then I will delete it. I usually use Indigo con Ubuntu 14.04. Unfortunately, I need to compile the node to make it work on Lunar.
