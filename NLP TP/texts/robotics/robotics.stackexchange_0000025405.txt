Hi,
Does anybody knows when if there will be a binary version of Gazebo with the self collision bug fixed for ROS users?
Or some tips how to install gazebo from source under ROS.
Thanks,

A:

The solution to your problem is to remove all versions of Gazebo and ROS, and start with a fresh install using the binary versions of Gazebo and ROS only.
It seems that your system has many different versions installed which are cause conflicts.
