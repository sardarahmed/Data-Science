Q:

How to plot position(x y z) and velocity of fixed frames(end-effector) in rqt?

hi . i need answer to complete my Master's thesis. i want plot position and  velocity of end effector that have fixed joint  using rqt.
How to plot position(x y z) and velocity of fixed frames(end-effector) in rqt ??
can you write a very very very simple examlpe for that ??  like two link and one joint arm . and plot position(x y z) of second link in rqt ??

Please stop editing your question just to put it back on the first page.

You don't show that you tried to do it yourself, you don't even care about writing correctly. Why should someone else do your work?

i tried . but i just need examlpe for that . i cant find any sample , like two link and one joint arm . and plot position(x y z) of second link in rqt

You were told how to do it several times: get a tf client, use it to get your translation, publish your values on separate float-topics.

A:

A fixed joint has no element in the /joint_states/position array, as it cannot change from 0.0 (it's fixed, after all).
You could probably use the pose of your EEF as tracked by TF. Something like rosrun tf tf_echo CHAIN_START CHAIN_END (where CHAIN_START could be base_link and CHAIN_END the frame that represents your EEF) should give you the transform.

Edit:

how can i plot velocity of fixed joint ??

There is no entry in any of the arrays in a JointState message for fixed joints. Again: they are fixed. No velocity, acceleration or effort for these joints.
Note: I'm describing the typical situation (such as with joint_state_publisher with gui:=true). Whether all drivers do the same thing I cannot say, but it wouldn't make sense to me to publish joint values for something like a fixed joint.

how can i plot pose for my fixed joint(joint_U26_1) like rqt_plot /turtle1/pose/x:y ??
what is a turtle1 ??
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-01-22:
Joints don't have poses, only links have poses (every link becomes a TF frame). Plotting TF frames is slightly involved. See #q58793 for some hints.

Some other options:

tf_trajectory
hector_trajectory_server

Comment by zakizadeh on 2017-01-22:
how use this command ??
rxplot /tf/transforms[0]/transform/translation/x
thats not working .
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-01-22:
rxplot is now rqt_plot.
Comment by zakizadeh on 2017-01-22:
rqt_plot /tf/transforms[0]/transform/translation/x  not working .
can i use this page??  what can i do ?
Comment by zakizadeh on 2017-01-23:
what about  this one??
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-01-23:
That page still works with JointState messages, which do not typically include fixed joints. You'll have to plot TF frames, not JointState msgs. The pkgs I linked in my earlier comment could help you with that.

can you write a very simple sample for that ?? i want plot pose ( x and  y and  z ) of link
Comment by zakizadeh on 2017-01-23:
in  #q58793 wrote i shoud  use pose topic parsed from the node tf . how can i do that? i cant found any sample .
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-01-24:
Other than tf_trajectory and hector_trajectory_server, I don't know of any existing pkgs/nodes that can do what you want, but in a nutshell:

create a TF listener for the TF frame you want to plot
convert the TF to a geometry_msgs/Pose and publish that
plot

Comment by zakizadeh on 2017-01-24:
im sorry . can i plot in RViz or rqt_plot ?? which one ??
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-01-25:
TF frames you can show in RViz (using either the TF Display or one of the pkgs I linked above). If you create the TF -> geometry_msgs/Pose converter, you can use RQT to plot the individual members of the Pose msg.

i need practical example .
