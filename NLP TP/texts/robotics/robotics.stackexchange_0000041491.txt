Q:

perception_pcl missing libraries

Hi,
When trying to run launch files using the perception_pcl libraries for Fuerte, ROS returns errors  saying that the Segmentation and Feature libraries do not exist in pcl_ros. They were commented out of the CMakeLists.txt file in pcl_ros, but uncommenting and then rebuilding does not work. The library files are still missing. Does anyone know where to get the libraries?
Thank You.

A:

The problem has been fixed. To get the new perception_pcl files, I ran sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-perception-pcl, and the Segmentation and Feature libraries were added as updates.
