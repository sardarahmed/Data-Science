Q:

Tool frame massive in RViz

In the robot view in RViz there is a blue sphere you can click to manually move the robot around, the tool frame. It is absolutely huge for me, about the size of my entire robot. Is there I can scale it down either in the urdf or RViz?

A:

LOL. In RViz, do you have a "Displays" panel open? (If not, click Panels-->Displays).
Then click on Motion Planning --> Planning Request --> adjust the Interactice Marker Size.
