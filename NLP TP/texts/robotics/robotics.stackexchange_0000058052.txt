Q:

How do I revert to the previous navigation release?

Hello,
I am running ROS Hydro, and on 3/16/14 I upgraded several packages at Ubuntu's urging. One of those upgraded my navigation to release 1.11.6
Since then, the application I'm developing has worked much worse than it used to. I would really like to revert to the previous release of navigation, but I'm having trouble finding out how.
I have gone to https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/releases and downloaded the zip file from the previous release into my Hydro_workspace folder, but I can't figure out how to properly build it.
I've also tried Synaptic Package Manager. It shows the package but the option to force the previous version is grayed out.
Using apt-cache showpkg ros-hydro-navigation, it looks like only the most recent release is available.
Is there any good way to get the previous version to install in my /opt/ros/hydro folder like it was before? I am still fighting with getting the zip I downloaded to do anything useful, and I will be the first to admit that makefiles, etc, are very much not my forte.
Thanks in advance.

A:

Assuming you have a Hydro workspace located in ~/hydrows, all you should have to do is compile the release you want in the workspace, and then the ROS should automatically use that version instead of the version in /opt/ros/hydro/.
cd ~/hydrows/src
wget https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/archive/1.11.5.tar.gz
tar xvf 1.11.5.tar.gz
cd ~/hydrows
catkin_make
rm ~/hydrows/src/1.11.5.tar.gz

If the compilation succeeds you can test that ROS finds this version by typing roscd navigation and you should be taken to ~/hydrows/src/navigation-1.11.5/navigation.  If compilation fails, you could try rosdep update and rosdep install navigation to ensure you have the proper dependencies.

Wow, that was detailed, thanks! I will have to try it. So "hydrows" is a catkin style workspace?

yes exactly... you mentioned you were using hydro, so I just assumed you already had a catkin workspace setup, although it may be in a different location.

Thanks; my issue is project is in a rosbuild-style workspace, and it includes a navfn object. So when I source the setup.bash of the rosbuild workspace to compile my project, how do I get it to include the navfn object as defined in the new catkin workspace? Or does my project need to be in catkin?
