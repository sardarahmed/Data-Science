Q:

/odom stops sending tf data

I am having problems with my own robot driver because after some time it stops sending odometry data. I checked the tf_monitor and I can see how the net_delay is slowly increasing until I can see the following error:
RESULTS: for /base_link to /map
Chain is: /base_link -> /odom -> /map
Net delay     avg = 6.87636: max = 7.88385

Frames:
Frame: /base_link published by /auriga_robot_base Average Delay: -1.96377 Max Delay: 0
Frame: /odom published by /slam_gmapping Average Delay: -2.00705 Max Delay: 0

terminate called after throwing an instance of 'tf::ConnectivityException'
  what():  Could not find a common time /map and /base_link.

And the net_delay between /base_link and /odom is:
RESULTS: for /base_link to /odom
Chain is: /base_link -> /odom
Net delay     avg = 185.881: max = 186.893

Node: /slam_gmapping 20.0204 Hz, Average Delay: -0.0422399 Max Delay: 0

I have been also checking my robot's node and the only suspicious thing i saw was:
[DEBUG] Socket 15 closed with (ERR|HUP|NVAL) events 24: Broken pipe

Any clue?

Hi Eric. Only rviz is running in a separate PC. I tested the net delay between /base_link and /odom and it is also increasing slowly but it doesn't send any exception.

Is this all running on the same computer? Do you get the same net delay behavior when checking between /base_link and /odom?

A:

I answer myself. I fixed just updating the odometry information slowier. It was a hardware requirement.
