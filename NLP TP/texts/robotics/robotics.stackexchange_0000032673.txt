Q:

Stageros crashes frequently on launch

I'm having a recurring problem with stageros crashing immediately on launching any of the launch files in navigation_stage.
I use diamondback, and the nav stack downloaded from the ROS repositories. Occasionally on launching the files in navigation_stage, stageros crashes with the following log:
http://pastebin.com/VFHuxJMp
Once this happens, roslaunch doesn't quit by itself, I have to do a kill -9. Also, subsequent launches of these files leads to stageros crash.
I generally resolve this problem by rebooting by system. This works nearly always.
Any better ideas or suggestions?

Can you try launching stageros in gdb (directions: http://www.ros.org/wiki/roslaunch/Tutorials/Roslaunch%20Nodes%20in%20Valgrind%20or%20GDB) and output the backtrace when it crashes? Use the bt command after the crash, get all of the output and then update your question with it (or a link to it).

Nothing except that "stageros has died with log file ~/.ros/logs/<somelog.log>"

That log doesn't seem to contain anything unusual. Is there any error output in the terminal you start the launchfile from?
