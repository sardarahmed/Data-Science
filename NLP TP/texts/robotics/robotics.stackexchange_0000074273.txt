Q:

Is there any update in wviz (rviz for web)?

When you visit the website of wviz, one can see that the documentation is really outdated. What really bothers me it is that it doesn't support a bunch of things: Map, Grid Cells, Path, Pose, Pose Array, Marker Array, Camera. I want to know if it already supports those features.
Or else, I was wondering if there's either another visualization tool for web (not gazebo simulator, that's not exactly a visualization tool). Or simply if there's another github repository where people continued the development of wviz which seems in the documentation the last supported version was fuerte and there's no github repository.
What do you recommend?

something a bit more documented? I think you mean mainly ros3djs, and it looks not bad. It's the first time I see it. I'll try to test it out.

Looks interesting. But do the demos on the web page work for you? In firefox 46.0.1 on ubuntu 14.04 I only see the grid and one set of coordinate frame axes.

I haven't tried yet. But can you tell me which of the github repositories you downloaded? I'm almost certain it is ros3djs but I want to be sure. Also because there is no proper documentation.

No download at all, just tried their online demos
