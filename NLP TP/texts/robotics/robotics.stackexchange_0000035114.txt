Q:

How to run Execute Left Trajectory and Execute Right Trajectory services?

I followed tutorials Warehouse Viewer
I run these command successfully,and it also show 2 pr2 on 2 rviz window.
  roslaunch pr2_test_arm_navigation planning_components_visualizer.launch
  roscd move_arm_warehouse;
  ./scripts/create_launch_files.py pr2_test
  roslaunch pr2_test_arm_navigation planning_scene_warehouse_viewer_pr2_test.launch 

But when I click accept button,it shows ROS Arm Navigation Warehouse Viewer logo,but couldn't get in.

I also find that webpage says
  Warning: Do not check "Use Robot Data" while the Execute Left Trajectory and Execute Right Trajectory services are not being advertised. Make sure they are running by invoking rosservice. Otherwise, the viewer will hang on startup while waiting for these (or any other) services. 

How to run Execute Left Trajectory and Execute Right Trajectory services?
Thank you~

A:

I managed (after several trials) to get the warehouse running on the PR2. You can check a previous answer here.
There you will find a more detailed PDF tutorial. If you still have problems I can try to put the right configuration files somewhere.
