Q:

ROS python control for drcsim2.5

I've been following the python tutorial to the letter:
http://gazebosim.org/wiki/Tutorials/drcsim/2.5/Atlas_control_over_ROS_topics_with_python
But when I try to test it, it goes
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "traj_yaml.py", line 4, in <module>
    from atlas_msgs.msg import AtlasCommand
ImportError: No module named atlas_msgs.msg

What can I do to solve this?

Have you sourced the drcsim setup.sh file? That is necessary in order to use the tutorial.

Yes I have, as I've said, I've followed the tutorial to the letter, that includes sourcing the drc.

There should be a manifest.xml in your tutorial_atlas_control folder. Can you paste a copy of it? Also, can you try roscd atlas_msgs?

A:

Issue has been resolved. Several dependencies were missing because I unpacked directly from the source for a specific version.
