Q:

roswtf says rosinstall missing

I started to go through the ROS tutorials and I reached roswtf. Now it says that it cant find the rosinstall python module, but it is installed. Not sure if I ever going to need rosinstall, but right now this warning just bothers me. Is it possible to know why roswtf says there is a problem? Or can I suppress the warning?
I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 with ROS Hydro.
viki@ubuntu:~/catkin_ws/devel$ roswtf

viki@ubuntu:~/catkin_ws/devel$ dpkg --get-selections | grep rosinstall
python-rosinstall               install

viki@ubuntu:~$ which rosinstall 
/usr/local/bin/rosinstall

I even tried apt-get reinstall and purge remove and install, but no avail.
I installed rosinstall_shellcompletion with pip, maybe that caused some nasty stuff under the roof.

A:

You can fix this by running sudo apt-get install python-rosinstall But unless you need rosinstall, it shouldn't be a problem.

Sorry I didnt made it more visible, but at the end of the code you can see that "dpkg --get-selections | grep rosinstall" returned with python-rosinstall installed.
And apt-get install returns that "python-rosinstall is already the newest version."

Just to be sure I did a "sudo apt-get install --reinstall python-rosinstall" but the problem still stands.
I even tried
sudo apt-get remove --purge python-rosinstall
sudo apt-get clean
sudo apt-get install python-rosinstall
But roswtf still thinks its missing.

Oops, missed that. If you run "which rosinstall" does it actually exist?
Comment by NLZ on 2014-04-08:
It says
/usr/local/bin/rosinstall

It sounds like you have rosinstall installed through pip; try running sudo pip uninstall rosinstall REPREATEDLY until it tells you that rosinstall is not installed.

I installed rosinstall_shellcompletion with pip, but pip uninstalling both (after apt-get remove) and reinstalling rosinstall with apt-get did not changed the error.

That's weird. If you installed rosinstall correctly (using apt-get), it should be in /usr/bin, not /usr/local/bin.
