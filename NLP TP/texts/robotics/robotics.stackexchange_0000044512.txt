Q:

Updating to PCL 1.7 in ROS Fuerte

I've been working to install the latest version of PCL 1.7 in ROS so I can run the correspondence tutorial here
I've tried installing the latest version 1.6 using,
apt-get install ros-fuerte-perception-pcl-fuerte-unstable
Although, this is just an update to PCL 1.6 which doesn't have the necessary header file board.h along with a few others.
I saw a similar post at this forum posting.  But it looks as though the svn link has expired for pcl-trunk that was references,
svn co http://svn.pointclouds.org/ros/trunk/perception_pcl_fuerte_unstable/
Any ideas on how to do this would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks!

C pcl/tags
svn: Directory 'pcl/trunk' is missing
svn: Directory 'pcl/trunk' is missing
Please Help me thanx
Comment by MichaelKorn on 2013-08-02:
this is a git repository, not svn, but you can find the right command on that wiki page: git clone https://github.com/ros-perception/perception_pcl.git -b fuerte-unstable-devel fuerte-unstable-devel
Comment by Areeb on 2013-08-03:
its giving this error now..   "/pcl_trunk" does not appear to contain CMakeLists.txt". I have checked it manually and yes its not present.. I am building pcl17 btw... Thanx and the full path is like this " "/home/areeb/fuerte-unstable-devel/pcl17/build/pcl_trunk""
Comment by MichaelKorn on 2013-08-04:
I just tested the script, it works fine. You should completely delete the folder fuerte-unstable-devel. Then try it again. First "git clone https://github.com/ros-perception/perception_pcl.git -b fuerte-unstable-devel fuerte-unstable-devel", then "rosmake pcl17".

Thanks. I have successfully configured it. Now i am trying to run a tutorial of main_ground_base_people_detection but ended with error "The type 'pcl17::visualization::PointCloudColorHandler' must implement the inherited pure virtual method 'pcl17::visualization::PointCloudColorHandler::getColor' "

Comment by MichaelKorn on 2013-09-25:
did you change the folder name?
Comment by ctguell on 2013-09-25:
@MichaelKorn thanks that was one problem, but now that i was able to rosmake , when i run a tutorial it says that my version is stil 1.5 , do you why this happens?
Comment by MichaelKorn on 2013-09-25:
pcl17 has its own Namespace. You should have both versions.
Comment by ctguell on 2013-09-25:
@MichaelKorn thanks i though that two but im unable to make it work, im trying to do this tutorial
http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/ground_based_rgbd_people_detection.php
and when i write the CMakeLists.txt i put the following line
find_package(PCL 1.7 REQUIRED)
and when i run it says that it only finds the 1.5 version , of you understand why? or should i change something of the CMakeLists.txt?
Comment by MichaelKorn on 2013-09-25:
checkout with SVN http://fsstud.is.uni-due.de/svn/ros/is/kinfu/ r264. Not newer! You will find  in manifest.xml.
Comment by ctguell on 2013-09-25:
@MichaelKorn cant manage to get to the 264 , it sends me directly to the 276??
Comment by MichaelKorn on 2013-09-25:
do it local: svn checkout http://fsstud.is.uni-due.de/svn/ros/is/kinfu/ -r264
Comment by ctguell on 2013-09-26:
@MichaelKorn Im a little confused, in the kinfu i have the manifest and a CMakeLists.txt, but for my tutorial i only have the CMake so i dont know what to do with the  in manifest.xml.  I have to add it to the main_ground_based_people_detection.cpp??
Comment by ZsurzsaLaszlo on 2013-10-11:
@MichaelKorn this link that you provided with the kinfu, this is a simplified version of the kinfu_app? I'm working on my own version of refactored kinfu_app that would enable me to usi it wit a pmd Camboard nano / miniTOF Camera ...
Comment by MichaelKorn on 2013-10-12:
this is a ros wrapper for  kinfu, it is derived from kinfu_app. Essentially the GUI elements are replaced by ROS messages.
Comment by ZsurzsaLaszlo on 2013-10-13:
Ok. Is it possbile to tweak it to use it not only with Kinect?
Comment by MichaelKorn on 2013-10-13:
yes, it is possible, but you have to adapt KinFu. At least the right focal length muss be considered.
Comment by ZsurzsaLaszlo on 2013-10-13:
Could you specify a bit more in detail? I've started a new thread : http://answers.ros.org/question/90431/kinfu-with-pmd-camboard-nano/ I'm really trying to fix this problem.
Comment by ZsurzsaLaszlo on 2013-10-13:
I now that I have to map the outputs of the PMD camera, and also that there is a ROS package for this. "focal length" - is this a parameter of kinfu?
Comment by ctguell on 2013-10-14:
@MichaelKorn my cmkaelist is as follows.--cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8 FATAL_ERROR)
project(ground_based_rgbd_people_detector)
find_package(PCL 1.7 REQUIRED)
include_directories(${PCL_INCLUDE_DIRS})
link_directories(${PCL_LIBRARY_DIRS})
add_definitions(${PCL_DEFINITIONS})
add_executable (ground_based_rgbd_people_detector MACOSX_BUNDLE src/main_ground_based_people_detection.cpp)
target_link_libraries (ground_based_rgbd_people_detector ${PCL_LIBRARIES})
how do i change the find package(pcl 1.7) to direct it to pcl17 so it works? thanks because now it says i only have pcl 1.5
Comment by MichaelKorn on 2013-10-14:
You don't need spacial changes in your CMakeLists.txt! You only need pcl17 in your manifest.xml. And use also the new namespace (pcl17::)
Comment by ctguell on 2013-10-14:
@MichaelKorn
i created a new package depending on pcl17

ihave the three in my manifest and still cant manage to create the exe or make the program work.  The cmake is standard due to it was created when the pkg was created and it does no create the exe. any ideas
Comment by MichaelKorn on 2013-10-14:
you still need add_executable(...).  Do you get a error message?
Comment by ctguell on 2013-10-14:
Yes i have the add_exe but still. I have the following error,note: 'boost::system::system_category()' is defined in DSO /usr/lib/libboost_system.so.1.46.1 so try adding it to the linker command line
/usr/lib/libboost_system.so.1.46.1: but ive been unable to solve it
Comment by MichaelKorn on 2013-10-14:
Did you link it? Add after add_executable(..): target_link_libraries(YOUR_PROGRAM boost_system .....)
