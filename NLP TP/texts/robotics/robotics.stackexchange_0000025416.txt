Q:

Way to avoid gazebo calling gettimeofday so much?

After having performance problems I ran sysprof along side gazebo and noticed that > 40% of the cpu resources being used up were for calls to sys_clock_gettime() via gettimeofday() via gazebo::common::Time::GetWallTime()
This seems unusual. Is this an indication that I've something mis-configured? Is there a way to mitigate this?

A:

Should have googled first. It looks like it's a known and fixed problem in the yet unreleased Gazebo 1.3
