Q:

connection to R-30ib

Hi,
I haven't been able to get through to Fanuc about this concern I have and I am wondering how a machine running ROS is typically connected to an industrial robot controller? I have an R-30ib with me and there are connections to a RS-323C port and a PCMCIA connection port as well. I'm not sure which adapter I should buy to initiate communication between my laptop and the controller. Initially I was looking for an ethernet connection but I couldn't find one on the panel, if anyone has ever had experience with using ROS on industrial robot arms could give me some advice it would be greatly appreciated.
Regards,
Devin

A:

General comment: the ROS-Industrial 'branch' of ROS is where we focus on using ROS with industrial robots. You might want to get in touch with us on the ROS-Industrial mailing list.

The fanuc_driver page lists the requirements on both the software and the hardware of your controller: you must have ethernet support, as well as options R632 (KAREL) and R648 (User Socket Messaging). Afaik, all R-30iB controllers come with ethernet networking installed, I'm not sure where the port(s) is (are) located inside the controller itself though.
As for the other options: please make sure you have them (they are not installed by default), otherwise the fanuc_driver package will not be compatible.

Edit: according to the R-30iB Controller Maintenance Manual (B-83195EN/03), Section 4.10.2.1 (Connection to Ethernet), the port is labelled CD38{A,B,C}. Pages 223 and 224 should show you where it is located.
