Unable to install pointcloud_to_laserscan ROS Indigo

I am trying to install pointcloud_to_laserscan package in ROS Indigo running in Ubuntu 14.04. When I add the source from git repo and catkin_make I get the following error.

A:

As always: what have you tried yourself, and what didn't work?
The error message is particularly clear: catkin (or actually cmake) cannot find the package tf2_sensor_msgs. Do you have that package installed?
It is always a good idea to first do a rosdep check --from-paths src --ignore-src from your /path/to/catkin_ws directory before trying to compile packages you just cloned from some vcs repository.

Also: it would seem pointcloud_to_laserscan has been released into Indigo (see the wiki page). I would recommend to install the Debians instead of building from source, unless you have a specific reason.

Just install the binary distribution? sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-pointcloud-to-laserscan?
Comment by gaussian on 2015-01-30:
I solved that problem. it requires the PointCloud2 data to be published in /cloud_in topic and that node will publish the laserscan data in /scan. after i publish the pointcloud data i get the resultant scan data full of only 'Inf' and hence no plot in rviz. Any idea @gvdhoom Thanks in advance!
