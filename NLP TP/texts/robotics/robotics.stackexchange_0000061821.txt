Q:

How to install ROS indigo in Ubuntu 14.04 trusty 64-bit?

when I tried to install ROS in a 64-bit Ubuntu, some problems occurred.

arkin@arkin-OptiPlex-790:~$ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-desktop-full

Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:

 ros-indigo-desktop-full:i386 : 

Depends: ros-indigo-desktop:i386 but it is not going to be installed

Depends: ros-indigo-perception:i386 but it is not going to be installed

Depends: ros-indigo-simulators:i386 but it is not going to be installed

E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

===============================================
What is the problem? How to solve it?
Also I tried in Synaptic. I typed "ros-indigo-desktop" in the filter and the results are:
ros-indigo-rosh-desktop: i386

ros-indigo-rosh-desktop-plugins: i386

ros-indigo-desktop-full: i386

ros-indigo-desktop: i386

why they all have an suffix "i386"? (my OS is Ubuntu-14.04-AMD64)
But if I search it in terminal, it shows that:
arkin@arkin-OptiPlex-790:~$ sudo apt-cache search ros-indigo-desktop

[sudo] password for arkin: 

ros-indigo-desktop - A metapackage to aggregate several packages.

ros-indigo-desktop-full - A metapackage to aggregate several packages.

Does the ROS have 64bits version and 32bits version respectively?
How to install a 64-bit version of ROS correctly in a AMD64 version of Ubuntu 14.04 trusty?
Thank you!

Tell us please which architecture you have typing in a console:
$uname -m

I don't know how to make the code typed in a console showed in a cell. How to make it? It makes the text very easy to read.

Copy the text after '$' and paste it in a terminal(ctrl+alt+T)

A:

This looks like your package manager tries to install the i386 version of ROS packages even though you are on a amd64 (64bit) system. IÂ´m not exactly sure what the cause is, but it appears there is some misconfiguration in your system/package management setup.

I just tried to install the ROS indigo following the tips on the ROS website http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu. But how to let the apt-get download a AMD64 version ROS? Is there ROS indigo 64bits and 32bits respectively?

I think that you should try to setup the mirrors. Try these commands:
sudo sh -c '. /etc/lsb-release && echo "deb http://mirror.umd.edu/packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $DISTRIB_CODENAME main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-desktop-full

I think that you'll be able to download and install de desktop-full version

Thank you. I tried the commands and replaced the "$DISTRIB_CODENAME" with my ubuntu versin "trusty", but it still does not work.
It shows:
$uname -m
arkin@arkin-OptiPlex-790:~$ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-desktop-full

Is there any problems with my package manager setting or system setting?
Comment by tfoote on 2014-08-18:
If synaptic is trying to install i386 you have set a setting somewhere to tell apt to install i386 instead of amd64. You'll need to find that setting and undo it. There are 32 and 64 bit versions of ROS packages.
