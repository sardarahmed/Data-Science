Q:

UR Driver Error after catkin_make (CMake Error)

I am attempting to build the Universal Robots ROS Driver on ROS Melodic Ubuntu 18.04 (VirtualBox VM), but when I try to build the workspace with catkin_make I get the error shown below.
What should I do to solve this? Thank you

A:

We see this:
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /opt/ros/melodic/share/catkin/cmake/catkin_package.cmake:102 (_catkin_package)
  myproject_gazebo/CMakeLists.txt:41 (catkin_package)

note the myproject_gazebo in the second line of the Call Stack.
It's likely you have a catkin_package(... CATKIN_DEPENDS gazebo ..) in the CMakeLists.txt of your myproject_gazebo package, but you don't have a find_package(gazebo) or added it to your find_package(Catkin .. COMPONENTS ..) call.
As-is, I don't believe this is a problem with ur_robot_driver, but with myproject_gazebo.
