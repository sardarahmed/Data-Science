Q:

cram-intermediate-tutorial can't find the package

I am following this tutorial http://cram-system.org/tutorials/intermediate/moveit
It says you can download the cram-intermediate-tutorial package from https://github.com/cram-code/cram_tutorials. I can't find that package.
Please could someone guide on where I can find this package?

A:

The tutorial code is on a different branch that hasn't been merged in yet. This tutorial is very new and is work in progress. The current pull request is here but it hasn't been reviewed yet: https://github.com/cram-code/cram_tutorials/pull/8
