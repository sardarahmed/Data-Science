Q:

Is there a simple method to send goal for frontier_exploration?

Hello,
I am using the frontier_exploration on ROS Hydro Ubuntu 12.04 and using a pioneer p3dx to explore. I can successfully send exploration goals by clicking the publish point tool and drawing a polygon point by point, but its really troublesome to click the points to make the polygon for the next goal. Is there a simple method where I can just draw a rectangle? I do not understand how to do that in Rviz. Can someone help. Thanks
Alex

can you share how to using frontier_exploration.

A:

Honestly, short of writing an RViz plugin, the 'Publish Point' tool is the easiest thing to do.  If you open the 'Tool Properties' panel, you can set the PP tool to not disable after each click, which would make it less frustrating.
