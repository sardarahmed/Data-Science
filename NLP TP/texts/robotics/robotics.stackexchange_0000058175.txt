Q:

Namespace without roslaunch

Hi
I like to run a rosnode within a namespace but without roslaunch.
I have to find a problem related to a multi-robot scenario because I use name spaces to start rosnotes for each robot.
It looks like there is a problem with one node and I like to debug the node, so I like to start the node with a debugger but within a namespace.
Is this possible?
Greetings

A:

You should be able to set the ROS_NAMESPACE environment variable to your namespace. Everything in the node should be pushed to the namespace.
