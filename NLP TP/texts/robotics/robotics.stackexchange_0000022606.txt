Q:

Confusion over configuration space, workspace and task space

I have been watching Kevin Lynch's videos on Coursera in this series on the basics of robotics. From that I gathered these are the definitions.

configuration space is the space of all configurations of the robot.

workspace is a specification of the configurations that the end-effector of the robot can reach

task space is a space in which the robot's task can be naturally expressed

Is the workspace contained in the configuration space since the end-effector is part of the robot? I understand that the configuration space is for each rigid link of the robot from this answer and the end-effector is a link.

Is it possible to have a task space that is beyond the configuration space?

A:

Two of these terms describe mathematical spaces (Configuration and Task spaces), and one (Workspace) the physical space in which the robot operates. Acknowledging they are related, but they are not the same "type of thing".
I recommend having a look at the QUT Robot academy videos by Peter Corke:

Task and Configuration Space
and Robot Workspace.

Which define configuration space as the mathematical set of all possible joint configurations. Task space the mathematical set of all possible end effector poses. And, workspace as the physical volume of all reachable end point positions".
No I don't believe it's possible to have a task space "beyond" the configuration space.
