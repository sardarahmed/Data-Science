Q:

Is there a way to use the nmea_gps_driver on electric version of ros?

In the documentation, they say i can only use this driver in fuerte version or newer, due to the dependency on sensor_msgs/TimeReference
Is it possible to chance the driver so it doenst have this depency, or to chance ros electric to have this depency?
Thanks.

A:

From a glance at the code, it certainly looks possible.
If you have time to work on it, check out the git sources and make a patch to submit. A single solution that works with both Electric and Fuerte would be ideal.
UPDATE: I've given some thought to how this could be done in Python. First make the import conditional:
try:
    from sensor_msgs.msg import TimeReference
except ImportError:
    TimeReference = None

Then, make sure TimeReference is True before doing anything with the gpstime variables:
if TimeReference:
    gpstimePub = rospy.Publisher('time_reference', TimeReference)
