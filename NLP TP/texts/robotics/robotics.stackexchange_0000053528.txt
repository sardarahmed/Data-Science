Q:

how to request a service present in different package

I am trying to call a service present in  package B (Python) from package A (c++).
When i run the code it says unable to find the header file (say packageB/service.h)
If i call a service present in Package A then its working fine.
Basically the question is how to request a service present in different package which is implemented in python.
I included the package dependencies in package.xml. Still no result..
Any idea what is wrong ??
