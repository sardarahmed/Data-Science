Q:

Has anyone used the Cyton Arm With ROS?

Has anybody used the Cyton Arm (http://www.robai.com/) with ros? I'm interested in things such as a URDF description, and anything required to get it working with OpenRAVE.
I see that the servos in it can be controlled by the ax12_controller_core ros node. (http://www.ros.org/wiki/ax12_controller_core)

I have a cyton arm and would like to use it with ROS, so I guess I have this same question.  I would prefer something as high-level as possible (eg, how to use with arm_navigation or moveit).  Thanks!

Same here, I am looking for a gazebo model/controller. Thanks!

A:

ax12_controller_core package is deprecated and will be removed as soon as ETurtle is released. I suggest you use the recently released dynamixel_motor stack instead. It's pretty much the same code cleaned up and packaged into a single stack.
