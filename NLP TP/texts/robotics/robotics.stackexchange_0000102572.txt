Q:

Node works differently with using launch file

Hi. Sorry for my mistakes. English is not my native language. I created a node, that subscribes to topic with data from sensors, then find with tf::TransformListener and tf::StampedTransform robot position, combines this data and writes it in csv file, also it prints in terminal robot position. Then I run this code with rosrun everything works as it should work, but then I run it with roslaunch it only prints position in the terminal with no data written in file. Appreciate any help.
This is how looks my launch file

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<launch>
     <node pkg="minicar_current_pose" type="minicar_current_pose_node" name="minicar_current_pose_node"  output="screen">
</node>
</launch>

A:

By default in linux, the current working directory for roslaunch is $HOME/.ros/. If you did not specify a full path when you opened the file, the file was probably created there.
