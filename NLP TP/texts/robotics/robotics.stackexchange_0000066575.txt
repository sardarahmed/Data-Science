Q:

Rviz Camera Display Snapshots possible?

HI there,
I have visualized a textured mesh in rviz based on depth and camera data. To view it from a certain camera perspective (not necessarily the one used for texturing) I am using the camera display with appropriate camera_info and image topics (the image is not interesting here since I only want the textured mesh to be displayed).
So now I can see the mesh through a virtual camera with certain intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.
What I further want, is to save the displayed image to a file. Preferably everytime the topic containing the textured mesh gets updated. I considered simply taking screenshots, but the resolution (and aspectratio/fov) would not match the specified camera parameters for the virtual camera.
So is it possible to save the image from the camera display with the specified size in the camera_info topic?

A:

I'm not aware of a way to do this automatically. You could probably write an rviz plugin to do it though. You'd need to learn how to make a plugin:
http://docs.ros.org/indigo/api/rviz_plugin_tutorials/html/display_plugin_tutorial.html
and then maybe inherit from the ImageDisplay or the CameraDisplay classes:
