Q:

Filtering spikes from range data

Hello,
Is it possible to use the filters package to remove spikes from real-time range data returned from sonar or IR sensors?  I have a small robot running ROS that uses a number of sonar and IR sensors to detect obstacles.  Every once in awhile the sensors will return a spurious value that can cause the robot to think there is an obstacle when there isn't.  I don't want to use a mean filter because this slows down the robot's response to an obstacle that really is there.  I just want to remove the spikes.
I can easily code this myself but I was wondering if the existing ROS filters can be used for the task?
Thanks!

patrick

Thanks @Peshala--I will give that a try assuming it will work over a temporal series rather than a spatial laserscan.  (Or maybe that's the way it works with the laserscan as well.)

A:

You can have a look at http://ros.org/wiki/laser_filters in addition to filters package; especially the ScanShadowsFilter
