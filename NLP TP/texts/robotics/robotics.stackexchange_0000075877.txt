Q:

launch file find with current pkg name

Hi
Is there a way to resolve the current pkg folder name related to a launch file?
My launch files uses the

$(find current_pkg)/my_file.xy

substitution to find and resolve a file in my current package.
Every time I am renaming my pkg or if have to check all the finds.
Is there a more common way such as

$(CURRENT_PKG)/my_file.xy

Greetings
Markus

Is there anything new on this?

A:

If you can set a system-wide environment variable for CURRENT_PKG (might need to put it in ~/.bashrc file), you can swap the $(find current_pkg) part with $(env CURRENT_PKG).

@Markus Bader: posting comments on an answered question from 2016 is not the most visible way to ask for updates.
I happened to notice as I'm watching this question, but without that, your comment would be almost invisible.
