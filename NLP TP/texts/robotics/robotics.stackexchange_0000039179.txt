Q:

ar_kinect crashes after throwing 'std::out_of_range'

Hi,
ar_kinect keeps throwing an instance of 'std::out_of_range' after running for a few seconds on my computer (see code below for a typical run). I'm using it to detect and track the pose of 6 different visual tags (more specifically, patterns 8,9,18,20,40, and 95). Any help would be deeply appreciated.

A:

It would appear that your "marker_data_directory" is wrong -- it most likely needs to point at the ar_pose directory (as we did not copy all that data into ar_kinect). You probably want to use a launch file to set the parameters (see the examples in the launch directory of ar_kinect).
