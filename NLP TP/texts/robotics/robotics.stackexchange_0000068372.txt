Q:

add self-defined objects into planning scene Rviz MoveIt!

Just like adding a box or a cylinder into the planning scene in Rviz, could anyone shed light on how to add self-defined objects to the planning scene so as to do collision detection and motion planning?
What I would like to add is a curved surface (a bezier surface). I can easily draw these curved surfaces using OpenGL, so is there a way to import them to the planning scene in Rviz?
I am thinking probably getting CAD models and importing CAD models is another way to solve the problem.
Any ideas would be appreciated.

A:

Importing mesh models to the planning scene is what I need :) Meshes in .stl, .dae and OGRE meshes are supported. Thanks for your attention!
