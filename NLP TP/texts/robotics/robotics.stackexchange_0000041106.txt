Q:

Forward/Inverse Dynamics Library?

Hi, I want to ask if there is a Forward/Inverse Dynamics Library for a robot model
Thanks in advance for your help!

A:

the recent openrave versions (0.7.x) have inverse dynamics which can be used as :
robot.SetDOFValues(dofvalues)
robot.SetDOFVelocities(dofvelocities)
torques = robot.ComputeInverseDynamics(dofaccelerations)

you can also split the contributions
torqueconfiguration, torquecoriolis, torquegravity = robot.ComputeInverseDynamics(dofaccelerations,None,returncomponents=True)
