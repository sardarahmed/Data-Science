Q:

Inverse Kinematics problem formulation (optimization)

Note:Q is a diagonal posituve semi-definite matrix
Why is the IK formulation like that? 
It looks like it's trying to find the optimum dq/dt that will minimize the magnitude dq/dt. How is that giving IK solution? and isn't the optimum value be dq/dt=0? 
EDIT:

A:

The formulation is typical for redundant robots, in which there are an infinite number of joint velocity vectors that could satisfy the $\dot{r}_{t}$ goal.  In the version you cite, the $Q$ matrix would allow you to weight the different joint velocities in order to create an optimal solution that matches that $Q$.  Other formulations of this approach specifically call out the null space of the manipulator Jacobian to be used for satisfying the optimization criteria.
Also, that last equation is inverted to solve for joint velocities, which makes this an approach to inverse kinematics.  With nonsquare Jacobians, pseudoinverses are used for this.
