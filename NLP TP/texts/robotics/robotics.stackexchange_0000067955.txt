Q:

Determine upload_credential_id for custom buildfarm?

I'm trying to set up a custom buildfarm for use with some private repos. My latest issue is I'm not sure what upload_credential_id should be in rosbuild_config/indigo/release-build.yaml. The docs aren't super helpful, "the ID of the credential to upload the built packages to the repository host". Which credential? How do I extract the ID?
Thanks for your help.

A:

The credential_id is defined in the master deployment common.yaml
https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/buildfarm_deployment_config/blob/master/master/common.yaml#L14
This credential will be inserted into jenkins credential storage. (You can find the credentials via the Jenkins UI by clicking on "Credentials" at the top level, then "Global Credentials" in the Credentials page. Clicking on a specific credential you can find the ID in the url. I believe the ID is just a uuid.

Thanks for the response. So to clarify, all non-plaintext values in [ros_]buildfarm_[deployment_]config should be generated via a separate Jenkins instance before ever running the deployment scripts? And then the deployment scripts should configure the Master machine to serve a Jenkins instance.

You can actually use the values in the example. They don't need to be generated. If you wanted to change them you would want to do it that way.
