Q:

enable depth regristration by default (openni_launch)

Hi there,
I'm a new ROS-User and I want to modify the openni_launch file so that it enables the depth-regristration by default. Normaly I have to use the dynamic_reconfigure gui to set that parameter.
Now the problem is that I dont know how the parameter is exactly called and with node it is. Do I have to set it for the openni_launch node or the dynamic reconfigure node? I read throught the wiki page http://www.ros.org/wiki/roslaunch/XML but that did helped me much because I still not know if I need to set the parameter to a specific node or is a general variable on the parameter server.
would be great to get some help.
regards
