Q:

Navigation is... Timid

I'm having trouble with navigation. The robot moves in little jerks, not in fluid motion... What parameters should I look at for this?
Also,
I'm getting warnings from the map update timing. How do I make these go away? It is trying to update it too quickly, and it may be the orgin of the problem. The robot is connected to a master over wifi. Here, the master runs the navigation while the robot runs the sensors and motors (not much of a processor on the robot). Could this be the start of the delay?
Thanks in advance,
-Hunter A.

A:

hello,
for mapping update timing, you can change update_frequency in global_costmap_params.yaml and local_costmap_params.yaml and you may consider lowering the publish_frequency because of computational load.
about your motion, you may decrease your acceleration parameters, and make you sure that your robot is following cmd_vel 's datas corretly, record your velocity params and record cmd_vel then plot them in rxgraph, see if given velocity datas and your velocities match
