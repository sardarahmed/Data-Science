Q:

rclpy.Subscription getting the number of connections

Is it possible to get the number of connections from a rclpy.Subscription object?
(In ROS1 we had  "subscriber.get_num_connections()")
If it is not possible, what is the alternative?

A:

self._my_pub.get_subscription_count()

This is providing the number of subscriptions for a rclpy.publisher.Publisher and not the number of publishers for a rclpy.subscription.Subscription.
