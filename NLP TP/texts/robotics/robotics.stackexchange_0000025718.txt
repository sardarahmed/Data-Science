Q:

Gazebo object rearrangements

I often need to change between different object arrangements within Gazebo (within ROS).
What is a better practice? or more stable?
Change object pose through some ROS service?
Or, is it better to create a world file for each arrangement and relaunch Gazebo?
Or, does this not matter?
Thanks

A:

It's a bit more stable to create multiple world files and relaunch Gazebo.
However, you should be able to dynamically reposition the objects without any problems.
