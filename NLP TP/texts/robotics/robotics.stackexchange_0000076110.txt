Just tested this, but the following doesn't result in a 403 error for me:

Are you behind a proxy by any chance?

yes i am behind a proxy.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2016-09-04:
Does the proxy need authentication? Can you install other pkgs (non-ROS)? What is the output of
wget http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu/pool/main/r/ros-indigo-force-torque-sensor-controller/ros-indigo-force-torque-sensor-controller_0.9.3-0trusty-20160627-235716-0700_amd64.deb

On your machine?

yes it need authentication, but i am able to install other ros packages,
and this is the outcome for your instruction,

Comment by gvdhoorn on 2016-09-04:
Well I can only think that something is making your proxy server refuse to let you download the ros-indigo-force-torque-sensor-controller package. Perhaps you can take this up with your network administrator(s)? Please do report back if/when you get this resolved.

this was just an issue with proxy.
