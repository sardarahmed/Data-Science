Q:

How to add ignition msgs to ROS?

I want to use gazebo plugins that use ignition messages in ROS project. I have installed libignition-msgs* libraries, but when I list all the types of messages in ROS with this command $ rosmsg list There is no ignition type of message.
How can I load the ignition-msgs into ROS?

A:

ROS uses its own message description; Ignition Messages is a separate format.
All ROS tools will only handle ROS messages, you'll need Ignition tools to use Ignition messages.

There is a Gazebo plugin ContainPlugin that publishes those ignition messages to the topic /contain. Does that mean my ROS node won't be able to subscribe to those topics?

Correct. You can use an Ignition node to subscribe to the message and then convert it to ROS if necessary.
