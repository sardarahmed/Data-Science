Q:

Systemd roslaunch

I've recently migrated my ROS project to Ubuntu 16.04LTS and ROS kinetic since I was having stability issues with Ubuntu 14.04LTS. Unfortunately this means I can't use robot upstart anymore to run my roslaunch file at startup (afaik).
I've made an attempt at using systemd (based on this guide) to run a bash script which runs roslaunch at startup but I'm stuck trying to get everything to work.
my systemd file: (chmod 664)

[Unit]
Description=start runslam
After=mysql.service
[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/runslam.sh
KillMode=process
[Install]
WantedBy=default.target

my bash script: (chmod +x)

#!/bin/bash
roslaunch runslam slam.launch

Just running the bash script from the terminal starts up roscore and my project runs fine but when running:

$ sudo systemctl start runslam.service
>
> $ systemctl status runslam.service

I get the following output:

● runslam.service - start runslam
Loaded: loaded
(/etc/systemd/system/runslam.service;
enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
Active: failed (Result: exit-code)
since Thu 2016-10-06 11:36:29 AEST; 7s
ago   Process: 3746
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/runslam.sh
(code=exited, status=127)  Main PID:

Oct 06 11:36:29 ausdroid-sbc-flt1 runslam.sh[3746]: /usr/local/bin/runslam.sh: line 3: roslaunch: command not found

Oct 06 11:36:29 ausdroid-sbc-flt1 systemd[1]: runslam.service: Main process exited,> code=exited, status=127/n/a

Oct 06 11:36:29 ausdroid-sbc-flt1 systemd[1]:  runslam.service: Unit entered failed  state.

Oct 06 11:36:29 ausdroid-sbc-flt1 systemd[1]: runslam.service: Failed with result 'exit-code'.

I think "roslaunch: command not found" means that the ROS environment needs to be somehow specified in the systemd file does anyone know how to do this? Thanks.

Note it may be advisable to use KillSignal=2 as roslaunch seems to respond to SIGINT instead of the default SIGTERM

A:

I have not used systemd myself for this task, but I've used the following method in a fairly similar situation to wrap roslaunch.
Change /usr/local/bin/runslam.sh to:
#!/usr/bin/env bash
bash -c "source /path/to/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash && roslaunch runslam slam.launch"

Brilliant! Thankyou Mani that did it :)
And just for the sake of completeness, since posting I made the following changes to the systemd file:

"After=network.target"

*got rid of the KillMode line
*Added "Restart=on-abort" under [Unit]

You are welcome. I am glad it worked. One thing you can do is to post your full solution online (i.e. as a Github gist) and provide a link in your question for future reference.
