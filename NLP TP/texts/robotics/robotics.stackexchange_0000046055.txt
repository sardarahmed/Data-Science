Q:

can't detect object model

Hi all, i made 3D object model with roboearth stack like in this tutorial
http://www.ros.org/wiki/roboearth/Tutorials/Record%20an%20object%20model
when i tried to detect this object using
rosrun re_kinect_object_detector re_kinect

and
rosrun re_object_detector_gui detect

it begin to read the model then received cloud points and open the detect gui
but No detection happened!
No error just receiving point clouds for a long time !!
No red mask on the object like in this picture :

@ddimarco :)

A:

Make sure that the camera is ~60 cm away from the object, from your screenshot it looks a bit too close.
To get some visual debug information, you can uncomment the "#define DEBUG_VIS" line in re_kinect_object_detector/src/recognitionmodel.h. This will show you the images from the model, the SURF features and possible matches from the model as lines.

I have uncommented the "#define DEBUG_VIS" line in re_kinect_object_detector/src/recognitionmodel.h.   and the camera now is 60 cm away from the object, but still have the same problem .

DEBUG_VIS does not really change anything, it is just there to help you find problems. Please note that we use 2D features only, so maybe the coke bottle does not provide enough features. What happens if you try it with another, more textured object?

I already have tried my own object model but no detection occurred ,so i have downloaded the object model of the coke bottle from roboearth.org but the kinect didn't detect it too ,so i think that the problem isn't with the object model and i can't find object models of products in egypt

Ok, it is hard to figure out the problem like this. Well textured objects like the one at http://api.roboearth.org/data/objects/beverage/icetea/preview.png should work very well. So all advice I can offer is to record an object model for something like that and try it again.

@ddimarco thanks alot it works ! ,, but i would ask about objects that have One color or little textured
How can i detect it ? ? and i thought that cloud points features are width and height and color
but it detected a similar object Not exactly it !!?

As I said, the software only uses 2D image features. You'll need to use another package if you require to  detect single-colored objects.
