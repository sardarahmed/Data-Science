Q:

Final Step for ROS installation failing

Running this command:
~/ros_catkin_ws/src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

Crashes with at this point:
cd /Users/Raaj/ros_catkin_ws/build_isolated/pcl_ros && /Users/Raaj/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/env.sh cmake -vd /Users/Raaj/ros_catkin_ws/src/perception_pcl/pcl_ros -DCATKIN_DEVEL_PREFIX=/Users/Raaj/ros_catkin_ws/devel_isolated/pcl_ros -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/Users/Raaj/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release 

with this :
CMake Error at /usr/local/share/pcl-1.8/PCLConfig.cmake:49 (message):
  simulation is required but glew was not found

I've already installed glew via brew install glew. How may I solve this? I am using OSX Mavericks

Please link to the instructions you are following.

A:

Ah it's ok, it seems OSX Mavericks has removed GLEW. I installed it and linked it correctly and it works

And how did you do it if it was already installed via brew ?
