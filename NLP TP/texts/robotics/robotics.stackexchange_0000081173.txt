Q:

rosrun tf2_tools not found

In the very first tutorial of tf2, we run the command rosrun tf2_tools view_frames.py. I tried this on two different systems running Ubuntu 16.04 and ROS kinetic. On both systems, I get the error [rospack] Error: package 'tf2_tools' not found. I built my workspace using catkin_make and sourced my workspace. the ros master is running and I followed all tutorials exactly. rospack find tf2_tools yields the same error, but tf2 itself can be found. Any ideas why this is failing?

A:

You probably need to install tf2_tools if rospack can't find it.
sudo apt-get install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-tf2-tools
If that's the issue we should add that as a dependency of tf2_turtle.

That worked. I was using an underscore in ros-$ROS_DISTRO-tf2-tools (tf2_tools). It should probably be a dependency indeed.

Glad that worked. I decided instead to just add it to the tutorial since the package itself doesn't need it really.
