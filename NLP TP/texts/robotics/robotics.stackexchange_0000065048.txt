Q:

a moveit pr2 tutorial terminates with a mutex_lock error

I run a moveit pr2 tutorial like so:
roslaunch pr2_moveit_tutorials move_group_interface_tutorial.launch

and it runs through different motions fine but at the end it shows an error and then just hangs. Is this an expected behaviour. What should I do to get rid of this error message and have the program finish cleanly? The error message looks like this:
move_group_interface_tutorial: /usr/include/boost/thread/pthread/recursive_mutex.hpp:110: void boost::recursive_mutex::lock(): Assertion `!pthread_mutex_lock(&m)' failed.
[move_group_interface_tutorial-7] process has died [pid 13649, exit code -6, cmd /home/andrey/misc/ros/devel/lib/pr2_moveit_tutorials/move_group_interface_tutorial __name:=move_group_interface_tutorial __log:=/home/andrey/.ros/log/dbebe4c8-97ad-11e4-ba0e-90b11c98a3ed/move_group_interface_tutorial-7.log].
log file: /home/andrey/.ros/log/dbebe4c8-97ad-11e4-ba0e-90b11c98a3ed/move_group_interface_tutorial-7*.log

moveit_pr2 and the necessary pr2 modules are compiled and installed with catkin_make from source (indigo).
I also had a look at master.log and it shows the following error (not sure if it's relevant):
[rosmaster.threadpool][ERROR] 2015-01-09 14:49:10,269: Traceback (most recent call last):

same problem for me.

A:

I'm not sure moveit_pr2 and the pr2 modules are intended to work on Indigo at the moment. Do you mind filing a bug report on the moveit_pr2 github located here https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_pr2/issues. I'm unsure if this is a MoveIt bug or a PR2 specific bug at the moment.
