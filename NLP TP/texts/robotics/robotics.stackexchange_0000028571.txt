Q:

What unit is "SetForce" on a revolute joint?

I have not been able to determine the unit used for applying force to a joint with SetForce(). I assume that its argument is Torque [Nm] but I didn't find it in the documentation and must admit that the name of the method confuses me a bit?
Is there a reason why there is no SetTorque() method on joints?
Thanks in advance

A:

From experiments, I can confirm that, for rotational joints, SetForce()'s effort argument is in Nm - at least with the ODE backend.
As to why it's SetForce() instead of SetTorque(), the devs wanted to cover both rotational and prismatic joints.

I believe that N/m is a typo for Nm, isn't it?

Yep, good catch. Corrected it.
