Q:

ESP32 micro-ROS: "Failed status on line 87: 1. Aborting."

This is my first time using micro-ROS.
I am following this tutorial with the difference that the connection that I am setting up is through UDP rather than Serial.
After having flashed the given ping_pong app into the ESP and checked that it has successfully connected to my wifi, I launch a micro-ROS agent.
However, I cannot see the new /microROS/ping and /microROS/pong topics, so with ros2 run micro_ros_setup build_firmware.sh monitor I realize that the following error occurs:
Failed status on line 87: 1. Aborting.

I tried to search online the possible cause, but didn't find anything solving the problem.
Does anyone have an idea of what is happening?

I don't know if that "line 87" refers to the file app.c of the ping_pong app. But if that is the case, I leave you here the line it would be referring to.

I see someone else had the same problem, and solved changing the IP address in the configuration.
However, if we're talking about the step ros2 run micro_ros_setup configure_firmware.sh ping_pong -t udp -i <IP_ADDRESS> -p 8888 I am already using the IP address of my machine (not the one of the ESP32).

A:

[SOLUTION]
The problem was that my firewall blocked the UDP connection between the ESP32 and the micro-ROS agent.
It was sufficient to allow such connection in the firewall rules, and everything went fine.
