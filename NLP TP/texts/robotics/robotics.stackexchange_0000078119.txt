Q:

Is it possible to run Navigation stack in tracked robot?

I want a build a multi-terrain self-navigation vehicle. I had designed a tracked(belted wheel) robot which will be suitable for my application.
Now is it possible to run ROS navigation stack in a tracked robot? if so, will that work properly with the same efficiency as differential drive wheeled robot?

I'm wondering about the same question. Any updates on your progress?

A:

Tracked platforms tend to slip when they turn, so odometry on them is usually somewhere between poor and useless.
AMCL and most other localization techniques require some variety of pose update to work well, and usually that's provided by odometry. You may want to consider providing a pose estimate from some other source such as an IMU or visual odometry.
