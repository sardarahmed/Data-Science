Q:

Implementing Lights on a robot

Hi
I'm trying to implement a light on a robot to replicate a laser pointer dot in the scene. Is there a way to do this so that a camera will be able to pick it up, and so that it moves with a robot link as if attached?
I tried implementing a spotlight but gazebo wouldn't recognise my links as being valid references for the light. Has anyone been able to do this?
cheers
Peter

A:

That feature isn't currently present. Please upvote the existing feature request in the gazebo issue tracker. If you have any thoughts about the implementation, feel free to add them there as well.
