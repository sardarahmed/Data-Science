Q:

Use Geomagic touch for controlling 7 dof robot in rvizz or gazebo

Hi,
I am new in ros and trying to implement a simulation framework to control a 7dof robot using geomagic touch device. I have studied basics of ros and simulation in gazebo and rviz. Can anyone provide me with guidelines that how should I proceed ?

A:

Before using Gazebo, you need to create a URDF model of you 7 DOF robot. You can follow through the tutorials of Gazebo and ROS.
Test your model works with Gazebo by using ros_control for the controllers.
Then you will have to map the geomagic touch device to some sort of control input for ros_control controllers.
If you are satisfied with your simulation in Gazebo, you will need to replace the simulated robot with your robot hardware. This includes creating a joint state publisher and controllers for your 7 DOF robot.
