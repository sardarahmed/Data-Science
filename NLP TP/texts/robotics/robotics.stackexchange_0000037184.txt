Q:

What does a double red circle mean in rxgraph

Sometimes nodes appear in rxgraph as a double red circle instead of a black oval (see image below). What does the double  red circle mean? The nodes seem to be working fine, ie they are sending and recieving data on topics.

A:

double red circle means that the Master reports the node exists, but rxgraph cannot talk to that node.

I just can attest my rxgraph (11.10 electric) gets out of sync alot, e.g. if I remap a node's topic and restart it, rxgraph shows a connection to both topics.

I do get other nodes in rxgraph that it says it can't connect to (in the info panel on the right) that don't get the red circle. Just noticed that the port number for node given in the rxgraph error is different to the port that rosnode info gives. Looks like rxgraph gets out of sync.
