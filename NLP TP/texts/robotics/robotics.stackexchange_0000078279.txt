Q:

"mrp2_gazebo.launch" from mrp2_gazebo package error

I'm working on mrp2_navigation/Tutorials and when i try to run the command
roslaunch mrp2_gazebo mrp2_gazebo.launch

from "Explore surrounding areas and make a map" it gives the error
Invalid roslaunch XML syntax: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: u'/opt/ros/indigo/share/mrp2_description/launch/description.launch'

because it makes a call to description.launch file from mrp2_description package but it doesn't exist.
Hope you fix this problem so people can complete the tutorial successfully.
Thanks.

A:

It seems like you skipped to install mrp2_description package.
$ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-mrp2-description

I also have such a problem and I see that ros-indigo-mrp2-description have already been installed.

It looks like that file is here - https://github.com/milvusrobotics/mrp2_common/tree/indigo-devel/mrp2_description/launch
