Q:

ros and rasperypie combination

Hello all,
I,m new to ROS and have a conceptual problem. Is it correct For a robot with Rassperpie microprocessor to use ROS for programming it? I mean the rasperipie has its own other languages.
I know ROS is language-independent to some extent. But is this combination (ros + rasperripie) a tested and well documented combo?
If yes , please guide me find it!
Thanks.

A:

ROS on Raspi works - slow but it works...
Wait for Raspi2-Hardware and Ubuntu 14.04 ARM.
If you have already an old Raspi with raspian installed and running, try to learn the Python programming language.
Notice: ROS is not a language - it is more like LEGO for robotics applications.
Happy robotics
Christian
