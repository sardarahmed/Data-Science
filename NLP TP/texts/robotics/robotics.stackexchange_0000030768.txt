Q:

Why do test images for tod_detecting contain fiducial markers?

Why do the test images in http://vault.willowgarage.com/wgdata1/vol1/tod_kinect_bags/test/
contain fiducial markers? In order that they might also be used as training images for tod_detecting?

A:

Having fiducial markers on the test images lets one recover pose from those test images. We can use these pose estimates as ground truth to compare the performance of an object & pose detector. See also http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/SolutionsInPerceptionChallenge.
