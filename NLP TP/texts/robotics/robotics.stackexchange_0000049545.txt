Q:

rosjava and pr2 tutorial

Does anyone have a decent tutorial for using rosjava and a PR2?  Even a simple tutorial would be greatly beneficial.
Anything with the PR2, actionlib, rosjava groovy would be a great help.  I can't find anything.
Thanks,
James

A:

As you've covered all the ROSJAVA documentation, you'll find that ROSJava_core development separate from the roscpp development cycles such as Groovy and Fuerte. The integration between a PR2 (or any system) and ROSJAVA is through the message interface. On thing that may restrict you is the lack of a action interface in ROSJAVA. Your solution in that case is to write a node implementing the interface in another language as a proxy.
Other than that it would be a matter of determining the interface you are after and implementing it using the publishers, subscribers,servers and clients in rosjava_core. All the message types are available in rosjava_core.
EDIT
I dont have a tutorial, but I used rosjava to publish GetMotionPlan messages to the ompl_planning node. The key to using these complex message types is creating a variable from the interface using node.getTopicMessageFactory().newFromType(TYPE) as in the example:
trajectory_msgs.JointTrajectoryPoint point1= node.getTopicMessageFactory().newFromType(JointTrajectoryPoint._TYPE);

This allows complex messages, particularly those that contain Java List<> types to be filled and then placed in the message field using one of the message interface's set commands.

Can you point to a tutorial that does this for any single interface?
