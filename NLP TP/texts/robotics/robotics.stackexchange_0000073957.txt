Q:

beginner: creating existing package

Hello,
I want to modify hector_slam. So, for a rearrangeable hector_slam I think i should create and build or install hector_slam in catkin_ws right?
I looked the tutorials and got confused so much. I created catkin_ws by following http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace tutorial. Next tutorial is http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/CreatingPackage, description is how to create a NEW ros package using catkin.
But I want to create/build or install an existing package(hector_slam) so should i follow this tutorial anyway?
Thanks,
Basak

A:

The answer that i need is "overlaying". When i was looking similar questions i found this answer http://answers.ros.org/question/37764/rosed-for-read-only-files/?answer=37768#post-id-37768
Anyway i just followed overlaying workspace tutorial. http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/workspace_overlaying.
Now i am able to modify the packages (in my case hector_slam) as i want.
