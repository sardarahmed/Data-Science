Q:

Subscribe to two image_raws with one function

Hello community,
I want to capture pictures from two webcams simultaneously and process them with opencv. I tried to get this work with two image_subscribers, that have the same callback-function. I tried that by editing the code from the cvbridge-tutorial. The result of my editing was, that i got two windows that show both the same picture, switching between the two image raws. So here is my question now:
How do I have to define my subscribers or my callback function to get the two raws seperately in one function to process them both simultaneously?
Solution:
http://wiki.ros.org/message_filters. There you can find an example cpp-code for a policy-based synchronizer function. I've used this example to get my Node working.

A:

image_transport has a special type of subscriber specifically for stereo cameras that does what you want, but I think it requires that the timestamps in the image headers be exactly synchronized which is hard to do with webcams.
Your best choice is probably an ApproximateTime synchronizer, which lets you subscribe to two topics with a callback that receives a message from each topic.

There was a very good example on the message_filters entry of the ROS WIKI. Using this example I was able to get the task accomplished. Thank you all for your help. It's good to know that there is a great community that helps everytime it is needed.
