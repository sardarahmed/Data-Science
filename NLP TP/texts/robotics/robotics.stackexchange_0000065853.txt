Q:

Orocos bfl for indigo,

Hi,
I've tried including BFL into catkin using both
--   package 'orocos-bfl' not found
CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindPkgConfig.cmake:283 (message):
  A required package was not found
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindPkgConfig.cmake:337 (_pkg_check_modules_internal)
  navigation-indigo-devel/robot_pose_ekf/CMakeLists.txt:6 (pkg_check_modules)

Any ideas?

A:

I just catkinized a package that I had been using a few years back, and I simply put bfl as a package and build dependency in my package.xml, and then I followed the directions on Using BFL in ROS with Catkin Builds and everything compiled successfully.
To really help you debug your error, we'd need to see your package.xml and CMakeLists.txt. Although based on the experience I just described, and the first line of your error, it seems that something is referring to orocos-bfl instead of bfl.

Hi there, I'm not sure where to add the lines in the second section of the link you provided .To the CMakeLists.txt who uses orocos-bfl? Or to orocos-bfl's CMakeLists.txt? Or somewhere else? Thank you.

That would be the CMakeLists.txt in your ROS package.
