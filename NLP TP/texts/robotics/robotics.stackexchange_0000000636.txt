Q:

Will turning an NXT motor by hand damage it?

I have heard a lot of claims that manually turning an NXT motor by hand can potentially damage it. I was wondering whether this was at least partially true, and whether there is any evidence to confirm or refute this idea.
I know that some projects (e.g. etch-a-sketch) use the built-in rotation sensor to measure how much the motor has turned, so I was thinking that perhaps whether the motor is idle or set on break is an important distinction, or perhaps there is even a special 'rotation sensor' mode that needs to be switched on in order to prevent damage.

A:

In general, no, it will not hurt the motor directly, BUT, the motor is geared down considerably. This means that when you turn the exterior part that you can physically touch by 1/4 turn - the motor might have actually completed 5 full rotations. The problem can happen when you turn the servo too fast, it may cause gear breakage simply due to excess speed internally.
It does not hurt the motor, but it may break a gear. Simple solution is to just not turn it fast.
If the motor is set on 'brake', it will apply opposite power to counter your turns, but you're not going to really hurt anything by over powering it, slowly! It is easier to turn if the motor is not in brake mode.
For example, in RobotC, this code releases the 'brake'
// release motors
    nSyncedMotors = synchNone;
    bFloatDuringInactiveMotorPWM = true;
    nMotorPIDSpeedCtrl[LEFT] = mtrNoReg;
    nMotorPIDSpeedCtrl[RIGHT] = mtrNoReg;
    motor[LEFT] = 0;
    motor[RIGHT] = 0;
