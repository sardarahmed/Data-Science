I have the same problem as you. Did you find any solution?

A:

The problem is in translate host name 'ubuntu' ... probaly you haven´t set ROS_IP variable

export ROS_IP=192.168.0.1 ... for example

and maybe too

export ROS_HOSTNAME=ubuntu

I need to set ros_ip in every terminal, and need to run roscore at the same time, any idea to set ros_ip so I don't need to set it in every terminal ?

set ROS_IP in .bashrc file in your home folder  ;-)
