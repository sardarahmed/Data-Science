Q:

Installing ros-melodic-ros-base deletes npm, installing npm deletes ros. How can I have both?

I inherited a system that needs both ROS and npm to be complete. I had to re-flash the embedded computer that they were running on, and so now I am reinstalling and reconfiguring everything. However, when I run sudo apt install ros-melodic-ros-base, it deletes npm during installation. When I run sudo apt install npm, it deletes all of my ros stuff during installation. The person that set it up before doesn't know why this is happening, so he is unable to help me get both packages installed.
Why is this happening? Is there a way to have both? I will gladly give more detail if necessary, just let me know.
Thanks in advance

A:

I got around the issue by installing nodejs and npm using these three commands:
sudo apt-get install curl python-software-properties
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install nodejs

Not entirely sure why sudo apt-get install npm was problematic. Hopefully that helps someone other than myself!

Thanks! This worked for me...

Thanks. The commands 2, 3 worked for me. nodejs is installed

This solution didn't work for me, as it still requires libssl1.0-dev to install nodejs-dev, which is required by npm. And libssl1.0-dev wipes out ROS

I also have problems. nodejs is ok with sudo apt install nodejs, but if I try to install the npm depencies, in particular libssl1.0-dev, it will delete ROS packages.
