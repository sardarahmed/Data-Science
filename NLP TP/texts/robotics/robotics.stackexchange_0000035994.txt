Q:

rviz with pcl::PointCloud

Is it possible to display a PCL point cloud of type pcl::PointCloud<T>, where T is a custom class, in rviz? Specifically, are there any requirements/limitations on the custom class T for it to play nice with rviz? It seems that the pcl_visualizer does provide a framework for displaying pcl::PointCloud<T> data through custom handlers. Thanks!

A:

I think I have found an answer to my question. Please check the following link for details:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/pcl_ros
Section 4 "ROS C++ Interface" on the above web-page clearly mentions how it can be achieved. I still need to try it out and will update the answer once I can successfully visualize my pcl::PointCloud<T> data in rviz.
