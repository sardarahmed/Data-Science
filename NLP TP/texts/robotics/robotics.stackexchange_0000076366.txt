Q:

Multiple robots with ROS-I / ABB driver

Hi!
I have the abb_drivers running a single ABB IRB 120 and I'm trying to get both of them online. There is a footnote in the installServer tutorial saying "For multi-robot controllers, specify the desired robot (e.g. rob1) for each task" but that doesn't make new rostopics for the different robots to communicate through. How do I make multiple robots work with this driver? I don't see a clear place where I can change the topic names in ROS so that the robots can be commanded.
I have tried renaming all the files Rob1/2 at the end and updating the inside, but it kind of blows up on me very quickly and doesn't seem like it will work on the ROS side.
Thanks!

Thanks for the response. I meant to link that here as well and forgot. I'll report back here with any files I created to help any future people.
