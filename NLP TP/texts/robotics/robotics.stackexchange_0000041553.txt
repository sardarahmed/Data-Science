A:

go to your home folder, on the top menu hit view, then select show hidden files. Click on the .bashrc file and scroll to the bottom and change the line:
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=WHATEVER YOU WANT
where WHATEVER YOU WANT is a valid location on your file system, multiple locations can be seperated by a ':' for example mine is
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/ros_workspace:/opt/ros/electric/stacks

always keep /opt/ros/electric/stacks as that's where the main install is

It's also good practice to use the rosws (http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosws) tool and rosinstall (http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosinstall) to maintain your package path, rather than doing it by hand.
