Q:

How can statistics for all active ROS Topics be obtained?

Is there a way to display statistics for all active ROS topics in a system?  By statistics I mean bandwidth usage, publishing rate, number of messages dropped, etc.  I looked at "rostopic bw" and "rostopic hz" but they only display information for one topic at a time.

Seems generally useful. If there is not already a solution, you can probably fork a copy of rostopic and modify it to handle that.

A:

Since ROS Indigo node statistics are available via:
rosparam set enable_statistics true (see http://wiki.ros.org/Topics#Topic_statistics)
A nice framework including rqt plugins is available on https://github.com/ROS-PSE/arni
