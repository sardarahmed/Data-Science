Q:

catkin structure

Hi ros community
Im planing on migrating my packages to catkin. However I have a question regarding the structure of the catkin workspace. Currently I have this setup
/quadrotor [this is my github repro]
  /controllers
    /controller_1
      -CMakeLists.txt
      -manifest.xml
      /src
    /controller_2
      -CMakeLists.txt
      -manifest.xml
      /src
  /experiments
    /user_1
       /what_evernode_1
         -CMakeLists.txt
         -manifest.xml
         /src

So i extensively used folders to structure my ros code. Is there a way i can maintain this hierarchy in catkin? Is it possible to have metapackages of metapackages? then i could easily make for every folder which only holds packages a metapackage.
Thanks a lot for your help

A:

You can have subfolders in your catkin_ws/src folder which are not valid ros packages without any problem. I think you future catkin workspace structure could be like this:
/catkin_ws
 /src
    -CmakeList.txt [symlink by catkin to toplevel cmake]
    /quadrotor [this is my github repro]
      /controllers
        /controller_1
          -CMakeLists.txt
          -package.xml
          /src
        /controller_2
          -CMakeLists.txt
          -package.xml
          /src
      /experiments
        /user_1
           /what_evernode_1
             -CMakeLists.txt
             -package.xml
             /src
  /devel
  /build
