Q:

Knowrob installation: failed to process package 'json_prolog_msgs'

The folowing error occured during installation KnowRob according to this instruction:
CMake Error at /home/al/ros_catkin_ws/devel_isolated/catkin/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:75 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "roscpp" with any
  of the following names:

    roscppConfig.cmake
    roscpp-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "roscpp" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "roscpp_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "roscpp"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  CMakeLists.txt:5 (find_package)

Instalation Indigo from sources according to this tutorial on Ubuntu 14.04 was successfull. May be somehow it's related with rosjava configuration?

A:

Just to be sure, 'roscd roscpp' does work for you? And you have sourced all setup.bash-es as needed?
I've had similar issues, though related to messages that catkin thought to be defined twice after I've installed rosjava from source into my workspace. What worked for me was to install rosjava into a separate catkin workspace, i.e. to chain two workspaces as described here. My layout was thus
~/ros/system_pkgs/src/rosjava etc <-- refers to /opt/ros/indigo/...
~/ros/custom_pkgs/src/knowrob etc <-- refers to system_pkgs workspace

Thank you! But it solves problem only particularly. After a command source ~/ros_catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash error with roscpp dissapeared. And I got new error about rosjava. I posted a new question.
