Q:

Anyway to install ROS-NXT on Trusty?

I have Ubuntu 14.04.02 Trusty installed, along with ROS INDIGO. But like others over the past years, I too can not get the ROS-NXT to install per the wiki pages. If the NXT has been dropped, please update the wiki pages.
I have the source for the package /stack from Foote source, but can't seem to get them built.

A:

The nxt package hasn't been released since ROS electric (see wiki header http://wiki.ros.org/nxt), and the wiki documentation doesn't claim indigo support. Check out https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ros-sig-nxt for latest nxt-related discussion.
