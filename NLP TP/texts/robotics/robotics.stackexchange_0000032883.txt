Q:

Specifying non-standard library path

How do I specify a non-standard library path while building a standard ROS package?
I tried:
LDFLAGS='-L/usr/local/hdf5/lib/' rosmake pcl

which did not work.
Archlinux
2.6.39-ARCH

A:

You can add a link_directories(/usr/local/hdf5/lib) entry to the package's CMakeLists.txt.
Depending on the library you look for, there might be a nice CMake way (instead of hardcoding):
CMake libraries.
I'm not aware of a nice ROS way similar to rosdep.
