Q:

rostest xml API

I am wondering whether how to provide gtest compatible executables in other languages than cpp and python.
I can see that adding a <test> node to a launch file will call the executable with at least:
'--gtest_output=xml:.../.ros/test_results/.../TEST-test-name_test.xml'
I'll guess support of this option is what an executable would minimally need to supply, for extended use maybe also --gtest_repeat, --gtest_filter
I assume the executable must then write an xml file containing junit-like xml the way gtest generates it.
Is there more to it than that?

A:

That's basically it.
The only other additions are the CMake macros for invoking the tests if you wish to run standalone unit tests (i.e. with rosunit).  The macros are mainly a matter of convenience.
