Q:

Building cob_people_perception with catkin_make

Hi y'all,
I am trying to do face detection and position measurement with the Kinect for Windows v2 sensor. I have successfully calibrated the kinect camera and I need to port cob_people_perception over to my kinect v2 but while running catkin_make, I stumbled upon the following error:
-- +++ processing catkin package: 'cob_people_tracking_filter'
-- ==> add_subdirectory(cob_people_perception/cob_people_tracking_filter)
-- Using these message generators: gencpp;genlisp;genpy
CMake Error at /opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:75 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "cob_perception_msgs" with any of the following names:

    cob_perception_msgsConfig.cmake
    cob_perception_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "cob_perception_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "cob_perception_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "cob_perception_msgs" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  cob_people_perception/cob_people_tracking_filter/CMakeLists.txt:20 (find_package)

I'm wondering what I am missing?

A:

Curiosa & curiosa.
I cloned
cob_perception_common
as in
git clone https://github.com/ipa-rmb/cob_perception_common.git,
cloned
cob_common,
cd'ed into the respective folders and did catkin_ws$ rosdep install -r --from-paths . for each folder cloned before doing catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Release"and everything was honky-dory.
I wish there was a detailed README.md file that explicitly explained the installation process. Hope this helps someone someday.
Thanks!

Instead of duplicating these instruction in the README of every package the documentation is in the ROS wiki: http://wiki.ros.org/jade/Installation/Source

Also: @lakehanne: this really points to a missing dependency declaration in the package.xml of cob_people_perception or one of its dependencies. Have you reported the issue?

Yes, I have. Thank you!
Just a question I have. I am using the code with Kinect for Windows v2 sensor. I tried  roslaunch openni2_launch openni2.launch but I kept running into

process[camera_base_link3-13]: started with pid [12958]
[ INFO] [1434731961.261143212]: No matching device found.... wa
