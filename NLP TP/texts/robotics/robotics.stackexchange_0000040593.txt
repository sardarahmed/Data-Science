Q:

moving to catkin from rosmake

I have a bunch of packages that are using the old rosmake build system and they no longer compile, so I'd like to move to catkin--is there a howto I missed somewhere? This works as a reference, but it's not very straight forward...

Are they broken because of catkin, or just ordinary bit-rot?

@joq: they compile/run in electric just fine. Should fuerte compile legacy rosbuild packages, because on my two fuerte systems that seems not to be the case. Should I file bugs?
Comment by Eric Perko on 2012-05-18:
With rosmake, it should compile legacy packages, but many packages cleaned up their export flags or were converted to rosdeps, so you may have to update your manifest.xml and CMakeLists accordingly.

A:

Some things that were deprecated in Electric were removed in Fuerte. You probably ran into something like that.
Check the Fuerte migration guide for details.
If your problems are not mentioned there, bug reports would be worthwhile.
