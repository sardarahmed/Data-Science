Q:

Implementing basic roam/avoid behaviours?

Hi,
Looking for advise on what is a reasonable approach re: initially implementing a simple roam/avoid behaviour?
I do want to get this to progress to autonomous map building and navigation. I'm not sure what the best way to build up to this.
One way I know I can achieve this is to have a node subscribing to the laser scan and issuing fwd/left/right/rev commands depending on the distances reported from the laser scan. I wanted to know if there is a more "out of the box" ROS way to achieve this?
I have the raw messages and topics available (tf, odom, cmd_vel, laser_scan) and I've used "steering" in rqt to drive the robot and have looked at the links below, not sure if they are quite what I want at the moment (I know I'll need them later)

http://wiki.ros.org/navigation
Thanks
Mark

A:

We did something similar in a robotics project some time ago. Our nodes for basic obstacle avoidance and autonomous mapping can be found at http://wiki.ros.org/nav2d. Maybe this can help.
There are 3 particularly important packages/nodes:

nav2d_operator (basic obstacle avoidance) drives in a desired direction avoiding anything in the path
nav2d_navigator (path planner) uses a map to navigate to a given goal
nav2d_karto (slam) generates a map of the environment while driving

Hi Sebastian,
Thanks for this - which node is responsible for just roaming around (Will is just issue drive fwd until the sensor detects an obstical adn then turn away?)- from looking at is it its building a map regardless?
Thanks

Thanks - I'll start off looking at nav2d_operator and see how I get on.

Hi Sebastian - where would I find this cmd.h file - getting compilation error
Thanks
Mark
fatal error: nav2d_operator/cmd.h: No such file or directory
#include <nav2d_operator/cmd.h>

This is a ROS-message header, which should be created during the build process and go into ...catkin_ws/devel/include/nav2d_operator/cmd.h
