Q:

Get used time for planning path

Hi!
Is there a python command of the moveit_commander lib to get the used (!) planning time for the last planning? Perhaps the time is also stored in the result of the "plan" command?
At the moment I have identified the following information in the results:
plan = self.move_group.plan()
# plan[0] == True if planning was successfull
# plan[1] <- trajectory

Is there an overview of the structure of the "plan" result?
Thanks in advance!

A:

I found the solution by myself after some study of the planning results array...
It is much more simple as I expected: time = plan2[2]
It contains the sum of planning time and simplification time and is stored in seconds.
