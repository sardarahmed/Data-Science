A:

I've seen this error on a lot of my student's computers -- try setting the "pixel_format" parameter to "yuyv"-- this fixed it on all computers I've seen.

Did not work for me, but that it is because my QuickCam outputs in the YUV420 format, which usb_cam does not support. So if anyone else is trying to use a Logitech QuickCam with ROS, you can get usb_cam working by implementing a YUV420 to RGB conversion (not trival) and adding a YUV420 parameter.

For my Microsoft LifeCam VX-3000 I actually had to set the pixel format BACK to "mjpeg". After that the node starts to spam "[swscaler @ 0x15a5e00] deprecated pixel format used, make sure you did set range correctly" but the output works as expected ..
