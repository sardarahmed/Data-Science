Q:

How to get the arguments or parameters of launch file in node file?

Hello, I'm using ROS melodic of Ubuntu 18.04.
I'm trying to spawn 4 different robots and get their pose every time in the Gazebo simulation.
I had gotten /odom topic of each, but also noticed /odom topic is the relative from a local frame.
So I additionally need to get each robot's initial pose to convert from the local /odom to global /odom.
However, I practically set the initial pose in launch file, not Python node file.
If I can get those arguments or parameters (actually I'm not still familiar with the launch file so I'm not sure my word is right) in the Python node file, I think I can do many things wrt pose correction.
More specifically, I want to get arguments like
<arg name="init_pose" .......>

in the Python file.
So if anyone who is familiar with the launch file is here, would you please give me some advice?
Thanks in advance :)

A:

you could use arg as described on this page to pass values to a node,roslaunch
or param to put values on the parameter server and then read them from there in the node
