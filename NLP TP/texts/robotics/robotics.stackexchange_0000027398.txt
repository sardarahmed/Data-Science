Q:

Standard Units of Measure and Coordinate Conventions in Gazebo

I just wonder what are the standard units of measure in Gazebo? Is there anything like ROS REP 103 to standardize the units?

A:

As far as I know, there's no complete documentation like the ROS REP 103.
In general, Gazebo uses SI units, for example:

length: meter (m)
mass: kilogram (Kg)
time: second (s)
angle: radian (gazebo::math::Angle::Degree() to convert to degrees)
force: Newton (N)

Coordinate frames are right-handed, with Z up, X forward and Y to the left.
Euler angles follow the roll (about X axis), pitch (about Y axis), yaw (about Z axis) order about a fixed reference frame.

So, If I have 0.1 of length, it means that it is 0.1 meters. Is that correct? Thanks a lot.

Correct! ;)
