Q:

How to change line color automatically in rxgraph?

Because when rxgraph show many lines on the screen,sometimes it's difficult to each line of goal.
If it is possible to change color automatically,it will be easy to understand.
The normal black line:

I use grep to find color,but what I found is not black:
 sam@/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/rx/rxgraph/src/rxgraph$ grep color *
 dotcode.py:            return '  %s [color="red", shape="doublecircle",      label="%s", URL="node:%s"];'%(
 dotcode.py:            return '  %s [color="orange", shape="doublecircle",      label="%s", URL="node:%s"];'%(
 二進位格式檔案 dotcode.pyc 符合
 
 sam@/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/rx/rxgraph/src/rxgraph$

Where is the setting of line of color?
Thank you~

A:

Currently there is no way to change the color of the lines in rxgraph programatically. But you could add that feature to rxgraph and patch it back to ROS.

If I want to see the source code of rxgraph,where is it? I trace 'rxgraph' only see import roslib; roslib.load_manifest('rxgraph');import rxgraph;rxgraph.rxgraph_main()
