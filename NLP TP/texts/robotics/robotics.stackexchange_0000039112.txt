Q:

xsens->covariance

Hi,
If anyone could help me, I would appreciate.
I have a xsens imu (MTi), I can get the information of the orientation, angular_velocity and accelerations with no problem, however I need the information of the several covariance matrix (it publishes all zeros).
Is there any way to get those?
Thanks.

A:

You'll have to set up a way to calculate them. I recommend recording the values in arrays and deleting your arrays every once and a while.
