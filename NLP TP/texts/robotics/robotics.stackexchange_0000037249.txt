Q:

roscore, roswtf commands not found

I have been following the instructions to install ROS diamondback in anticipation of running ROS on NXT, but neither of these commands will work.  I assume that this is probably a PATH problem, but I am not sure where the variable is or what path I should add to it.

A:

This very likely is caused by not following the installation instructions correctly. Are you sure you properly added the setup script in your .bashrc file as described here under 'environment setup'?
