Q:

How to pass a file path to rosrun?

What's the syntax for passing a filepath as a parameter to rosrun?
I'm trying to call lsd_slam_core with a custom calibration file located at lsd_slam_test/config/logitech.cfg with:
rosrun lsd_slam_core live_slam image:=/usb_cam/image_mono camera_info:=/usb_cam/camera_info calib:=lsd_slam_test/config/logitech.cfg

but this returns the error:
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'ros::InvalidNameException'
  what():  Character [.] at element [25] is not valid in Graph Resource Name [lsd_slam_test/config/logitech.cfg].  Valid characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, / and _.
Aborted (core dumped)

What am I doing wrong?

rosrun lsd_slam_core live_slam image:=/usb_cam/image_mono camera_info:=/usb_cam/camera_info _calib:=lsd_slam_test/config/logitech.cfg
