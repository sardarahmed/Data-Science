A:

I don't see anything obviously wrong with your launch file.
"Line 1, column 0" is the first character in your launch file. I see a <, which should be valid, but perhaps you have a non-printing character in the file or something?
You can try to confirm by looking at a binary dump of the file (try hexdump -C mylaunch.launch).
You can also just create a new launch file, and retype the whole thing. (Don't copy/paste. there's a decent chance you'll copy the offending character into the new file)

thanks for your answer :)
i try to confirm the binary dump, but there is no wrong things.
and i erase all the things and re-type the launch file(not copy and paste), it doesn't work too :(
there is another command like roslaunch?

Try removing things from your launch file until it works, and then slowly re-add them until you identify the problem. The most basic launch file <launch></launch> should work (and do nothing).
