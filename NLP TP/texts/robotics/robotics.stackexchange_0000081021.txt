Q:

How can I use Realsense SR300

Hi, I'm Japanese, so maybe my English is strange.
Now, I want to use Intel Realsense SR300.
I write my environment and please teach me what should I tell you about my PC because I'm beginner.
OS : Ubuntu14.04
ROS ; Indigo
Senser : RealsenseSR300
Kernel : 4.4.0-040400-generic
I write all commands I did.
$: sudo apt-get -y install libusb-1.0-0-dev git build-essential
$: git clone https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense
$: cd librealsense
$: git checkout tags/v0.9.2
$: scripts/install_glfw3.sh
$: make
$: sudo make install
$: sudo modprobe -r uvcvideo
$: sudo cp config/99-realsense-libusb.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
$: sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
$: udevadm trigger
$: ./bin/cpp-capture
Then I have an error,
RealSense error calling rs_create_context(api_version:4):
API version mismatch: librealsense.so was compiled with API version 1.12.1 but the application was compiled with 4! Make sure correct version of the library is installed (make install)
I installed "Docker" and I checked "client API version: 1.18".
What should I do??
Thank you.
Edit: Improved readability

Looks like you have two different versions of librealsense on your system. Please paste output of dpkg -l | grep realsense

Hey, do yo get any luck doing that? I'm not sure how to use the files under the example folder. Could you help me?

A:

You have two different versions f the same library installed:

The version of the package ros-indigo-librealsense

The one that you compiled from source

What you are trying to do is running cpp-capture (source version) with the binary library from ubuntu. Uninstall either version.
