Q:

Where can I find the rosfusion.py tool?

Dear ROS community,
I'm new on ROS, and I'm following the "How to cross-compile any ROS package for Android" tutorial, and everything is ok until the step that I have to add the contents of the file robot_localization.rosinstall generated to the ndk.rosinstall.
I'm trying to find the tool called rosfusion.py because when I execute the command line
./rosfusion.py -n robot_localization.rosinstall -t ndk.rosinstall

it doesn't work. This is what I get from the terminal
~/ros-android-ndk/roscpp_android$ ./rosfusion.py -n robot_localization.rosinstall -t ndk.rosinstall
bash: ./rosfusion.py: No such file or directory

Any help would be really appreciated.
Thanks in advance.

I can't find that file anywhere, so I suggest that you open an issue on the issue tracker of the roscpp_android package.
