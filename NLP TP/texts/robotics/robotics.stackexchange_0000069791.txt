A:

If you set the disable_signals parameter in rospy.init_node to True then you can manually shutdown the node with a call to rospy.signal_shutdown(reason) where reason is a String with the reason for shutdown.
For more information check out this wiki http://wiki.ros.org/rospy/Overview/Initialization%20and%20Shutdown or the rospy API http://docs.ros.org/api/rospy/html/
