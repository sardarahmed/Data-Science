Q:

Boost confilct and omnimapper on Ubuntu 12.04

Hi,
I tried to install omnimapper(https://github.com/CognitiveRobotics/omnimapper), it only compiles with boost 1.48. But ROS has many packages which need boost 1.46. For instance, If we would like to use Kinect, the ros-hydro-openni-launch shall be installed, but at the same time libboost1.48-all-dev will be automatically removed .
  They don't support ubuntu 12.04. Has anyone tried successfully using ubuntu 12.04? Thanks a lot!

A:

See: http://answers.ros.org/question/170406/ros-hydro-and-boost-148/
You'll either have to modify Omnimapper to work with an older version of boost, build ROS from source, or upgrade to a newer version of Ubuntu where the version of boost that you need is the default version.
