Q:

How is RTABMap a SLAM algorithm if it has separate mapping and localization modes?

I believe the RTABMAP has mapping and localization modes. Can they both run together? If they can't how is RTABMap said to be a SLAM algorithm?

Hi,
the mapping mode (default) in RTAB-Map is actually the SLAM mode (loop closures are detected online and graph is optimized online). The localization mode is really a localization mode (the map is not modified).
It applies for all other SLAM algorithms too. For example with GMapping/AMCL tutorials, you would say that you use gmapping for the mapping phase, then use AMCL for the localization phase. In reality, the mapping phase is doing SLAM.
Here other examples where "mapping" means SLAM:
