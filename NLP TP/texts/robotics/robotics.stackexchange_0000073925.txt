A:

According to ROS Kinetic Kame Beta has begun posted to ros-users by Jackie, May 23rd is the current target:

May 23rd, World Turtle Day, is still our official release date for ROS Kinetic and we are on track to meeting it! So mark it down into your calendar, and if you're a maintainer, plan to finish your releases before then to leave some breathing room.
