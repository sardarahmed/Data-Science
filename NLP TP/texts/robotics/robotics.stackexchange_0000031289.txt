Q:

package:// Usage

I vaguely recall being able to use package:// to access files in packages, but I can't find the documentation and it turns out to be the kind of thing that is impossible to search for.
Can you actually access files in this manner? Is there a Wiki page about how to do it?

That's what I was looking for! But alas, it's only for C++, so I made a Python version. https://code.ros.org/trac/ros-pkg/ticket/4951
