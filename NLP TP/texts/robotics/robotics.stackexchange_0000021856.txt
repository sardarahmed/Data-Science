Q:

Help on the Walking without thinking about it paper!

I was reading the paper, which you can find: https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00567668/document. I got so confused with equation (33) and (34), it seems like instead of an equal sign in eq.(33) on the left that should be a multiplication, which can be supported by the first author's thesis: https://pastel.archives-ouvertes.fr/pastel-01038025/document, eq.(2.62).
But I cannot understand what it means physically, can someone help me understand this!

A:

I think you are correct that the equals sign in equation (33) should not be there, as reinforced by the first author's thesis.
The purpose of those equations are to constrain the MPC-generated footstep positions to ensure that each foot position is within the polygon shown in the following figure relative to the stance foot. In effect, the combination of those matrices will make sure that the generated steps are feasible, as you said.
The challenging part (to me at least) is that they have to do it for all steps from the current one to the end of the MPC, so they need to include details for all of those "future" steps in addition to the current step.
Hope that helps!
Cheers,
Brandon
