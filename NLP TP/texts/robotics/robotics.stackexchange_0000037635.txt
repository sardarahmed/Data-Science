A:

Obstacle avoidance for aerial vehicles is a huge field and I don't think that there is an answer to this question.
You could use the ROS3D Contest Entry: Quadrotor Altittude and Obstacle Avoidance as a base for your code.
There are some additional resources for the AscTec Pelican that might get you in the right direction:

ROS News: Robots/UAVS
DIYDrones: Arducopter
ROS Robots: AscTec Pelican
ROS Answers: UAV Simulation Using ROS
ROS Answers: 2D/3D Slam for UAV
ASCTec Pelican Users Mailing List

You may want to make your question more specific, or else you won't get many answers.
