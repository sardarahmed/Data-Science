Q:

PID controller making use of the Message type sensor_msgs/JointState

Hi guys
I am looking for at PID controller which is capable of understand the message type sensor_msgs/JointState.
As far i can see those which are available uses a custom message type, but none which uses  the sensor_msg/JointState
.. Do any of you know one??
I've looked into some, and http://wiki.ros.org/pid  and seems to be what I am looking with the exception of the message type being not the one i want..
Somebody who are able to convert it?
