Q:

ROS Groovy joy-stcik 404 error [SOLVED]

SOLVED
Had to clean my update list on my ubunutu install, somehow it had become corrupted. Cleaning that up and attempting "sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-joystick-drivers" again worked perfectly fine

Hey
I am trying to install ROS joy for ROS Groovy
After saying yes to install the package it fails to fetch the files "Failed to fetch http:\... 404 not found error".
I am using "sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-joystick-drivers" to install.
Is their an updated wiki about how to install ROS joy on groovy that I have missed?
Thanks heaps
Henry
