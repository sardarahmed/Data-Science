Q:

Using fuerte with python 3

I have seen that several issues regarding python 3 support have been solved recently, e.g. [1]. However, I could not find any information how to actually use the new release with python 3? That means how do I get the python libraries compiled and installed in a python3-compatible pythonpath etc.?

Ok, trying michikarg's suggestion I end up in this error:
>>> import roslib
Traceback (most recent call last):

With the patch mentioned below I am now able to use roslib. However rospy and std_msgs do not work:

After playing around a bit with ROS and Python3, i basically got ROS messaging running from python2 and 3! A created a ticket and patches, so feel free to test:
https://code.ros.org/trac/ros/ticket/3949
I also had to fix genpy. You can download the lated trunk (already including my patch the fixes your problem with the _Bool import) from github:
