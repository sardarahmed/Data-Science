Q:

error when trying to install ros hydro on ubuntu 12.04

I am trying to install ROS on ubuntu 12.04 to use it with both gazebo and morse.
I first installed ROS fuerte, but the setup.* files were not created in /opt/ros/fuerte. So I removed ROS fuerte and tried to install ROS hydro. when typing sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-desktop-full an error occurred:

user@user-SATELLITE-L750:~$ sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-desktop-full
[sudo] password for user:

Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
ros-hydro-desktop-full : Depends: ros-hydro-simulators but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

How can I resolve this ?
thanks in advance

Hello,

Thank you :)
