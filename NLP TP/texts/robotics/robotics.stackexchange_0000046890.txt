Q:

Problem by building the hector_lokalization package

Hello
I tried to build the hector_localization package but could not. Im using Ubuntu 10.04 and ROS Fuerte. I got the following error.
Error: package/stack hector_pose_estimation_rtt depends on non-existent package rtt_rosnode
  
  
  CMake Error at /opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros/core/rosbuild/public.cmake:129 (message):
    
  
    Failed to invoke rospack to get compile flags for package
    'hector_pose_estimation_rtt'.  Look above for errors from rospack itself.
    Aborting.  Please fix the broken dependency!

Any help??

A:

It looks like you need to install rtt. Try:
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-rtt-*
