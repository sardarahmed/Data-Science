Q:

How do I achieve this? Grid of dowels powered by piston-like movement

I am completely new to this site and robotics, but I have experience in programming, and programming microcontrollers.  
I would like to create a grid of "pixels", where each "pixel" is a metal or wooden dowel that is programmed to push in and out, like a piston.  
I'm imagining a lot of pixels, maybe 40x40, where each could be quite small in diameter (1/4").  The Arduino would have control over the linear movement - up and down - of each pixel.
Could anyone point me in the right direction for accomplishing this?

A:

You may want to consider mastering the art of controlling an LED matrix first.   Then, replace the LED's with some sort of actuator (motor, servo, or other mechanism) at each node of the matrix that performs the up and down motion that you seek.
It sounds simple, but there are other details to consider.  Particularly, you'll probably need more power to drive the actuators than you would for LED's.  This, of course, depends on the actuators that you choose.  
There are probably more factors to consider beyond what i've mentioned (e.g. Cost, precision, sensor feedback, etc...), but the first step would best be learning how to control an LED matrix.  I may even advise to look into using shift registers rather than multiplexing.
As for achieving vertical motion of the dowels with an actuator, there are a number of ways to do it.  The easiest may be using a rack and pinion or a closed loop pulley with an actuator attached at one end.
