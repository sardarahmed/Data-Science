Q:

Create a sim environnement for CNC router

Hello, I already program on ROS but I want to create a 3D simulation of CNC rooter.
Where should I start? Is there example which could be use as base for my project?
My goal is to be able to create path planning and check collisions according to the material on the simulation
My current configuration: ROS1 ROS version :Melodic
Edit :
I use a tuturial to start:

Here is the code I made to start and generate a "floating camera":

I try to generate a simple camera that I will move. In gazebo the camera is here but it is moving and is not static.
How can I fix it?

A:

you have the camera set to "static" https://github.com/arnauddomes/floating_camera_gazebo/blob/master/src/mybot_description/urdf/mybot.xacro#L15
try removing that line. I would recommend the ConstructSim for tutorials, as well as the official gazebo onces.
