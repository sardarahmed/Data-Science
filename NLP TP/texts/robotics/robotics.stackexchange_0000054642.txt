Q:

Troubles with ROS Wiki Documentation

I try to document my Stack on the Roswiki and indexed the stack as mentioned here.
My rosinstall file for Fuerte looks like this.
I created a Wiki Page  here
and was now waiting for over an week and my Stack is still not indexed. What am I doing wrong?
Best Wishes
Johannes

no ideas what I did wrong?

A:

You are getting a lot of warnings and errors due to undeclared dependencies.  The documentation will be built only with declared dependencies.  This is probably why the stack documentation is not being generated.

Thanks for the hint. I updated all manifest.xml files so that all dependancies are correct now. Let's see if this works out.

After updating all manifest.xml files I still get errors due to dependancies. The thing I do not understand is that dependancies to basic ros packages are missing:
"package/stack bipedRobin_local_planner depends on non-existent package tf".
Where else do I have to add this dependancies too?
