Q:

Problem: roslaunch turtlebot_arm_bringup simple_arm_server.launch

Turtlebot2, Groovy, turtlebot_arm-groovy-devel package:
After roslaunching turtlebot_arm_bringup simple_arm_server.launch:
[simple_arm_server.launch] is neither a launch file in package [turtlebot_arm_bringup] nor is [turtlebot_arm_bringup] a launch file name
Can anyone tell me how to fix it? Thanks so much!

A:

Hi, @Yantian_Zha : There are arm.launch and fake-arm.launch in /turtlebot_arm_bringup/launch. There is not the simple_arm_server.launch you say. The simple_arm_server packages seem to be put on this page ( http://wiki.ros.org/simple_arm_server ). If you want to execute it, I think that you should type

roslaunch simple_arm_server arm_server.launch

You will get more useful information on http://wiki.ros.org/simple_arm_server than one onhttp://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_arm_bringup.
Please check it out!
