Q:

Hydro - groovy - indigo

When I made rosdep update, it says :
reading in sources list data from /etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d
Hit https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/raw/master/rosdep/osx-homebrew.yaml
Hit https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/raw/master/rosdep/gentoo.yaml

Ignore legacy gbpdistro "groovy"
Ignore legacy gbpdistro "hydro"
Query rosdistro index https://raw.github.com/ros/rosdistro/master/index.yaml
Add distro "groovy"
Add distro "hydro"
Add distro "indigo"
updated cache in /home/lempereur/.ros/rosdep/sources.cache

Is this in error, that it add distro "groovy", "hydro" "indigo"?
I'm using groovy (Ubuntu 12.04)

A:

No it's not an error I'm using Hydro and I get the same shell as you, don't worry.
They are not installed on your system but It's kind of knowing other distributions.
