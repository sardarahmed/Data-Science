A:

Probably the required transformation are not broadcasted or you mismatch frame names. Run
 rosrun tf view_frames

to check broadcasted frames and compare result with used Hector slam configuration. If you not solve you problem please post the view_frame result and your Hector slam configuration.
UPDATE
Sorry, I was not clear: the output from
rosrun tf view_frames

is the generated pdf file that contains the TF tree. You should post this file!
About Hector Slam configuration: the file you posted IS NOT the Hector Slam configuration: you have to post the parameters passed to hector slam node when you run it!
UPDATE for amsoufari
The LaserScan message contains an header which include the reference frame for scan data. In your bag file the LaserScan messages published with /robot0/laser_0 topic use robot0_laser_0 as frame and you are not broadcasting this frame. Try to change laser_link robot0_laser_0 in last tf in your launch file, it should work!
