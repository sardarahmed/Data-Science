A:

You can only have one roscore active (and configured) at a time. In case of the turtlebot the roscore should always run on the turtlebot itself to keep latencies and actual network usage low.
If you wanted to use a roscore on your workstation to work, while the turtlebot isn't running, you have to change your ROS_MASTER_URI to the name or IP of your workstation.
Dont forget to source the .bashrc again after the change, or restart your open consoles.
