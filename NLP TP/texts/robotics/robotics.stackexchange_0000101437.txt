Q:

Communicating With Two Machines With ROS2

I'm trying to start up communication between two machines running ROS2 Galactic using the examples:
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker

and
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener

Both machines are on the same
network,
Both machines have
multicasting enabled
Both machines
can ping each other
Both machines
have the same netmask
I have also
tried running the examples on
different networks with no success
Both machines have "export
ROS_DOMAIN_ID=30" in their .bashrc

When running the two example nodes on the same machine everything works fine.
Please tell if you need any more info.
Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks a lot for the answer! I tried out the different RMWs but nothing seemed to work. Those things didn't fix it for me.
Instead the problem was solved by: 1. Switching to a different network. (I was on a network with extra security layers that might have messed with the communication). 2. The firewall on my two machines were blocking the communication. - As a quick fix you can disable firewall by using the following command:
sudo ufw disable

You can check the status of your firewall do typing:
sudo ufw status

It is not recommended to have your firewall disabled at all times however, so only use this as a way to test if it is the firewall that is the problem.

Hello,
Is there a way to keep the firewall on and to configure the network to allow the topics to pass ?
