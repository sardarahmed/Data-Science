Q:

Installation of wstool and rosdep from source

I'm trying to build from source.  The instructions offered tell me to install the dependencies (python-rosdep, python-wstool, etc) using apt-get install.  First of all, I am not using a system with apt-get.  Secondly, I do not have root priveleges.  Is there somewhere I can download these packages and install them in a user or group directory?

A:

The sources for the tools are at:
https://github.com/vcstools/  (You would need all of those, vcstools, rosinstall, wstool)
https://github.com/ros/rosdep

They can be installed from source using
python setup.py ... (options)

However using the pip based install is more convenient.
For installing python packages without sudo privileges, I recommend looking at the virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper projects, and then use pip as suggested in the other answer:
pip install -U rosdep
pip install -U wstool

However installing virtualenv/virtualenvwrapper nicely also requires root privileges, but those are packaged for most distributions, so maybe you can ask your admin nicely to install those if they are not already installed.

The virtualenv thing looks to be working for some things.  I've got rosdep and wstool installed.  However, I can't figure out how to initialize rosdep.  Can that be done without root?

I don't know. Open a new question for that, please.
