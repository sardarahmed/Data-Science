Or

A:

The solve for this problem is because it's must export plugins and load the model from the package
Example:
My path is libmyplugin.so and this's In ~/gazebo/my_plugin/build
Before to get this path I used:
 cmake ..;make  //in the folder /build

I used:
cd ~/gazebo/my_plugin/build  //here is libmyplugin.so
 export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=`pwd`:$GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH  //with this instruction I load libmyplugin.so and it's prepared it for load the simulation
 gazebo

In my case I insert the robot from Gazebo
A lot of Thanks!!
