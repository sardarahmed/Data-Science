Hi , i have Ubuntu 12.04 and i begin to find my empty_world.launch file in my ROS package
i found it in :
fuerte /stacks / simulator_gazebo / gazebo_worlds / launch / empty_world.launch
begin to launch gazebo using this command on the Terminal :
$ roslaunch gazebo_worlds empty_world.launch
I get back this long reply !! and i don't know what is the problem exactly !!  :

could be a graphics card related issue.
Can you take a look at this page (http://ros.org/wiki/simulator_gazebo/Troubleshooting) and fill in some more details as mentioned by the second half of the wiki here? Thanks.

I am also getting the same kind of problem.My OS is----ubuntu 10.04 LTS(32bit deb),Graphics card and graphics card driver version:---00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Mobile GME965/GLE960 Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 0c)
and rosbuild_make_distribution(1.6.16)

@muin028:
Gazebo/OGRE is very sensitive regarding graphics cards and very rarely (if at all?) works with integrated graphics controllers. For Gazebo your best bet is probably an NVIDIA graphics card - I've had a laptop with an ATI card that worked but it's more of a gamble than using NVIDA I think (at least 3 years ago when I had my ATI laptop it was).
You can also check OGRE's hardware requirements, but I think you should be good with any modern dedicated graphics card: http://www.ogre3d.org/tikiwiki/tiki-index.php?page=Hardware
Btw there's a new website for Gazebo related questions: http://answers.gazebosim.org/
