Q:

PCL and ROS Hydro Symbol Lookup Error

I have a ROS package that depends on PCL. The package compiles without problems. However, when running the code, the following error appears:

symbol lookup error: /home/andreas/baxter_ws/devel/lib/libaffordances_lib.so: undefined symbol: _ZN3pcl6search6KdTreeINS_8PointXYZEEC1Eb

I assume that this is related to the KDTree class and wrong linking(?). The CMakeLists.txt and package.xml contain what is described here, http://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Migration#PCL, at the end of the section.

A:

Did you check 'sudo apt-get install -f"   and clean and rebuild your workspace like http://answers.ros.org/question/121266/undefined-symbol/#121291
