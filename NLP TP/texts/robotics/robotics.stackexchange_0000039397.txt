Q:

LaserScan ranges values - left and rightmost scans

I'm using a for loop to print out values retrieved from a Kinect LaserScan (specifically the "ranges" array).  It returns 360 values, each with a number - most of the numbers are 11, but occasionally the numbers from 142-257 (I can't remember the exact range but it's something like that) are different.  I believe these are the laser ranges? Am I wrong?  Also, what are the numbers measure in? I normally get numbers between 0.5 and 10.  If i'm mistaken, could someone explain how to get laser ranges from a kinect laser scan (i'm trying to get the leftmost and rightmost scans)?

A:

The sensor_msgs/LaserScan message is documented at http://ros.org/doc/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/LaserScan.html which is linked from the sensor_msgs wiki page.
