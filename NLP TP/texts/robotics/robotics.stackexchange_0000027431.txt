Q:

Installing ROS Jade with Gazebo 5.0.1

While following the tutorial for installing Gazebo with ROS, I reach a point where there is no option for ROS Jade. The current text looks like:
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-gazebo-ros-pkgs ros-indigo-gazebo-ros-control
However when I try:
sudo apt-get install ros-jade-gazebo-ros-pkgs ros-jade-gazebo-ros-control
it appears that the latter package ros-jade-gazebo-ros-control isn't available. Can I / how can I proceed installing ROS J with Gazebo 5.0.1?
For slightly more information I've installed Gazebo 5.0.1, and tested to know it works. I've installed ROS Jade via ros-jade-desktop-full , and I've done some limited testing to see that it works. All this is on Ubuntu 14.04

Hy, I am exactly having the same problem and I didn't find any solution to that. Could you tel me how did you proceed? Thanks in advance

A:

gazebo-ros-control has not been released as a package for Jade at this moment. Full information about the reasons is available in the issue tracker.
You will probably need to compile it from source at this moment. I'm going to update the documentation, thanks for reporting.
