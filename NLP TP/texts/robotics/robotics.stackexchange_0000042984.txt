Q:

Ros serial protokoll white Microcontroller

Hi,
im using ros and it works fine. But now i will send data from AVR Microcontroller to ros. i dont use any arduino board so what is the protokoll to send data via serial port? for example to transmitt odometry data. something like that
odom/term/x/y/z/r
is this possible without rosserial_arduino?
thanks

A:

There is also "regular" rosserial, along with a (generic?) rosserial_client. On the other hand, an Arduino is just an AVR microcontroller on a standard breakout board.
The rosserial page also lists the general protocol, but you'll need the node running to act as a bridge between ROS and the serial connection.
