Q:

nav_msgs::Path’ has no member named ‘set_poses_size’?

I have a package that compiles successfully in diamondback. When I compile it in fuerte, it fails and indicates that "error: ‘nav_msgs::Path’ has no member named ‘set_poses_size’". What is wrong with fuerte? Thanks.

A:

This function was deprecated some time ago. You should instead use poses.resize() as poses is a std::vector. See item #10 on the migration guide
