Q:

ROS node which broadcasts periodically frames getting from python?

Hi!
Is there a ROS node which I can send with python a frame similar to the addTf() command and the node broadcasts this frame all the time? I want to create, modify and delete frames in one program run/sequenze without broadcast it periodically by myself. So the static_transform_publisher is not the right choice for me.
<node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="app_bcast" args= "0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 p_frame c_frame 100" />
Thanks in advance!

A:

From the docs here: http://wiki.ros.org/tf2_ros
There is the TransformBroadcaster class with both a C++ API and Python API which will facilitate you publishing transforms.
There's also a StaticTransformBroadcaster but if you want things to be changing the main one is likely what you want.
There's also tutorials for how to publish transforms in both C++ and Python here: http://wiki.ros.org/action/show/tf2/Tutorials?

Thanks! The tf2 staticBroadcaster works fine for me! :-)
