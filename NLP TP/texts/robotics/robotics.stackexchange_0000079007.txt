Hello,
I have the same problem did you find the solution please.
Thank you in advance.

A:

I think it has something to do with the kobuki base vs the rhoomba base. I am working with a Turtlebot2 with a kobuki base and I got the same error but when I ran roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch instead of roslaunch rbx1_bringup turtlebot_minimal_create.launch, everything worked fine.
