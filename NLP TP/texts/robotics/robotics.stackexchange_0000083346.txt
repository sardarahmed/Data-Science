Q:

CI recommendation

I'm currently looking for a CI which could integrated with bitbucket. I find a list of CIs here http://wiki.ros.org/CIs but an objective comparison is not provided. Could anyone give me some advice about the pros and cons of each CI?

A:

I don't think there are enough people around here that have enough experience in all the listed CI solutions to give an objective answer to your question. Instead, use the following algorithm
bad_solutions = set()
while True:
    selected = pick_random_CI_solution_for_bitbucket(do_not_use=bad_solutions)
    if give_quick_test(selected) == "OK":
        continue_using_it_and_be_happy_until_it_breaks()
        bad_solutions.add(selected)

Basically, just pick one, and try it. If it works, keep it, else find a different one.
