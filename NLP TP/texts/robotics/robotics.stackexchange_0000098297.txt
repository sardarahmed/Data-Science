Q:

ROS2 Foxy -> Does ros2arduino work?

Hello ROS2 Community
Currently Im starting on ROS2 development, and planning to use version Foxy.
I want to ask if ROS2 foxy works on Arduino.
The ros2arduino page on git hub says, the newest version of ros2arduino(currently: 0.2.1) is ros2 dashing.
So I wanna ask if somebody has tried it with ros2 foxy.
Thanks!

A:

I'm not sure whether this can be of use, as all depends on the hardware you're using.
Anyhows, there exists a software solution called micro-ROS aimed at bringing ROS 2 to embedded devices. It supports Arduino and, as you can see, the repo mainline is aligned with Foxy already. Hopefully this helps you!
