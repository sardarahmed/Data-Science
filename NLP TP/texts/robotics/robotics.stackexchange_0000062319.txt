Q:

Add postinstall rule for deb package creation

I'm trying to get a fork of the pr2-grant released for our ros_ethercat package as we find it very useful. In the pr2 repo, there were some post-install rules to set the sticky bit of pr2-grant.
Is there a way to do this with catkin / bloom?
Below is the debian/postinst rule
#!/bin/sh
set -e
PKG=pr2-grant
case "$1" in
 configure)
   chown root.root /usr/bin/pr2_grant
   chmod +s /usr/bin/pr2_grant
   chown root.root /usr/bin/pr2-grant
   chmod +s /usr/bin/pr2-grant
   ;;
 *)
       echo "postinst called with unknown argument \`$1'" >&2
       exit 0
   ;;   
esac
#DEBHELPER#

Thanks in advance!

A:

Bloom allows you to patch the generated Debian files at your will. So yes, you can add whatever post-install rule you would like.
The comfortable thing is that bloom will automatically reapply your patch for future releases.
