how to install libpcap-dev in ROS for windows

when compiling, I encounter the following problem, I put the error trace below, how to fix it
 CMake Error at C:/opt/ros/melodic/x64/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:83 (find_package):
   Could not find a package configuration file provided by "rslidar_msgs" with
   any of the following names:

     rslidar_msgsConfig.cmake
     rslidar_msgs-config.cmake

   Add the installation prefix of "rslidar_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
   "rslidar_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
   "rslidar_msgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
   has been installed.
 Call Stack (most recent call first):

A:

@rechuin It means you will need to git clone the rslidar_msgs' repository into your workspace, so that catkin can find and build it. Alternatively, you can check out this, where it documents the generic workflow how one to consume a ROS package.
