Q:

Is a PlanningSceneDiff without CollisionObject shapes valid?

I'm wondering how far the concept of a PlanningSceneDiff goes when it is applied.
As an explicit example: If there is some CollisionObject published to the environment server and added with id, pose, shape, etc. and now I construct a PlanningSceneDiff that contains a CollisionObject, where only id and pose(s) are set, what should happen?
Will this update the CollisionObject with the same id and the new poses + the originally added shapes or will it update the CollisionObject with the new poses and empty shapes?

A:

Or the third option would be that it may segfault.  Looking at the code if there is an existing object of a given id and another in the diff the object in the diff will overwrite the previous object.  Thus you should make sure that the diff contains a one-to-one relationship between shapes and poses.
