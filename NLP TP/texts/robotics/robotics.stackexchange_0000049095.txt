Q:

Instantiating rosjava messages faster for PointClouds

Hi!
Is there a way to generate/instantiate messages faster in rosjava (newest rev)? From my knowledge i have to use a messageFactory.
Point32 p = messageFactory.newFromType(Point32._TYPE);
The problem is that it's too slow if you have to have generate a lot of Points32 for a PointCloud message. I narrowed it down to this bottleneck.
I tested it with my older rosjava builds (December 2011) and there you instantiate messages directly and i don't have any speed problems.
EDIT1: I have seen that PointCloud2 offers an byte array which should solve the problem.
