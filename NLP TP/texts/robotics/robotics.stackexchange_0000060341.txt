Q:

marking parameter costmap_2d

Hi all,
I have a very brief question regarding the marking parameter in the observation_sources tag. To be more precise, let's suppose that I set marking: false for my laser_scan in the obstacle_layer, then my local costmap will be no longer updated with the laser readings, but what about the motion planner in move_base? Will move_base take into account those readings to plan locally or is it going to ignore them (so basically setting marking: false will be equivalent to remove the  obstacle_layer)?
Thanks and regards,
Federico

A:

Costmaps, planners, etc are all fairly decoupled, the planners don't need to know how to update a costmap, they just consume the data from a fully updated costmap. Thus, if your sensor is not marking the costmap, the readings won't be used used by the planners of move_base.
