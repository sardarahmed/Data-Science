Q:

minimum versions of system dependencies required for ROS?

I am using Ubuntu 16.04, ARM architecture. Is there a documentation / command line tool where I can find out the minimum required versions of the system dependencies for proper functioning of ROS?
PS: sudo apt-get update would take care of it during installation, however I explicitly want to know the minimum versions. Thank you in advance.

I doubt there is something that documents all dependencies (as that would depend on authors of all packages doing that), but for some of the larger dependencies: REP-003.
