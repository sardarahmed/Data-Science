I also ever met with the same problem! But I always use 'cd' now.

A:

Could you try the followings?

Launch a terminal.
Open ".bashrc". ".bashrc" is at your home directry(/home/(user-name)/.bashrc).
   eg). $gedit .bashrc
Check whether there are the following lines or not. If not, add them.
   (
    Assumption:
    1. You use ros electric. If you use other ros versions, change the part "electric".
    2. You made ros_workspace directry at your home directry and created beginner_tutorials package in the directry.
   )
export /opt/ros/electric/setup.bash
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/ros_workspace:/opt/ros/electric/stacks

*Second line is important. You need to add the directry which includes packages to environment variable.
If roscd still doesn't work well...

Go to beginner_tutorials directry.
   eg). cd ~/ros_workspace/beginner_tutorials
Type the following command.
   $rosmake
Retry "roscd".
