Q:

E: Unable to locate package ros-lunar-desktop-full

Currently trying to install ROS Lunar on a clean Raspbian Stretch as per http://wiki.ros.org/lunar/Installation/Debian with this problem. I've done sudo apt-get update and returned with

I also tried ros-lunar-desktop and got equivalent message.
What have I done wrong?

Desktop-full depends on gazebo, which probably doesn't build for ARM. You may want to try installing the desktop or robot variants instead.

Please see updated question (tried again this morning)

The 'repository .. is not signed' points to problems. Did you import the repository key?

Also: which package mirror are you using? Is it one of wiki/ROS/Installation/UbuntuMirrors? The files at http://64.91.227.57/repos look rather old and there are no files for Stretch, only Wheezy.

A:

I had the same problem. It ended up being Raspbian Stretch is 32 bit architecture as indicated by stretch/main armhf. The repositories that have ros-lunar-desktop-full are in 64 bit which is not armhf. You are able to install the bare bones version of ROS onto Stretch which allows you to communicate to and from the Pi.
To be able to get 64 bit on the Pi I installed a new image from the following: https://github.com/bamarni/pi64/blob/master/README.md then I proceeded as normal to get it to install ros-lunar-desktop. I hope this helps.

I get the same problem and I don't know how to fix it (probably will erase Stretch and install Jessie)
I am new in this field and I don't understand much tech but also I don't understand why someone will build Lunar on 64bit but the OS needed is on 32bit.
