Q:

Qt Creator - Can I Work On One Package Without Building Other Packages In Same Catkin Workspace?

Hi Everyone,
I'm having some issues using Qt Creator as an IDE for ROS:
If I have multiple packages within a catkin workspace, and I open just ONE of the packages' CMakeLists.txt file within Qt Creator, Qt Creator still sees the remaining packages in the catkin workspace. When building/running, Qt Creator will try to try to build all executables and then I have the option to run any of the executables in the catkin workspace.
Can I work on separate packages in isolation with Qt Creator?

A:

To anyone with the same question, I found that you can select what you build manually in the Projects tab of Qt Creator. So, yes, you can build only a single package. However I have not found a way to run CMake on a single package/project in isolation.
