Update your question to include your operating system, your ros distro, and what you're trying to do

A:

I don't know why you get this error, but if you install the debian package manually it probably "solves" the problem. For fuerte execute
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-octomap-mapping 

For groovy:
sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-octomap-mapping

Thanks. I do install the octomap-mapping and it doesn't show that error anymore. But, it says Rosdep cannot find all required resources to answer your query Missing resource. I try the mechanism of editing the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. But, it's not working. Any suggestions on that one?

Look, we cannot guess the solution to an error based on the fact that an error occurs.  You need to post the particular messages you get to give people a chance at understanding what happens exactly.

Okay. I'll be more specific from now on. It's just I'm new to Ubuntu and I really needed the solution at the time. It's fixed when I follow the " RGB-D SLAM for "Not-yet" ROS Users" instruction. Much thanks for your help, Felix.
