Q:

Is there any way of creating the map and also navigating the environment together i.e. continuously?

Hello All,
So in my Final Year Project, I am constructing a robot which creates a map of an unknown environment while traversing the environment using the map (so an autonomous map making robot) basically, both the tasks being implemented together and not creating the map first and then navigating using the map while avoiding obstacles. Is there a way to do both the tasks together? Please help I am really struggling...
Thank you,

Sounds like you're describing frontier exploration.

Thanks. For some reason the copy and paste of the URL didn't work out right

Doesn't it require manual instructions in terms of where to start and where to go?
