I found a solution here:
How to specify trajectory points with 6D pose?
The method is to specify a {X, Y, Z} position with Orientation vector.
Here's the code snippet:
using namespace Eigen;
Matrix3d m;
m =   AngleAxisd(0, Vector3d::UnitX())
    * AngleAxisd(-M_PI/2, Vector3d::UnitY())
    * AngleAxisd(0, Vector3d::UnitZ());
pose.linear() = m;
