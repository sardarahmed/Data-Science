Q:

Connection to industrial automation software (OPC?!)

Hello,
I´m searching for a way to connect ROS to standard industrial automation software like Freelance, WinCC/PCS7, Wonderware etc.
The obvious approach would be to use OPC (UA) but I can´t find a lot of info to this here in the wiki. I heard that there are some projects using OPC but I just don´t find any information.
Did anybody use OPC with ROS or has some info about it? Maybe there are some easier solutions?

A:

I am aware of one effort to integrate ROS and OPC UA.  This was done by Fraunhofer IPA, but as far as I know this was not open sourced.
I have looked into doing this in the past.  There are several open source OPC clients (ex: http://www.openopcua.org/ ).  Creating a bridge between ROS utilizing these clients should be relatively straight forward for specific cases.
The more general case of creating a generic ROS bridge to OPC is a little more difficult, but one that I have interest in.  Should you decide to go down this road, please let me know.
