Q:

ROS executable without Boost dependency

Is it possible to  create a ROS executable (where the executable is a target of type executable within a CMakeLists.txt which is created with catkin and the c++ files include ros/ros.h) that does not link to boost? If I have an executable program and do ldd program there occurs at least a dependency on:
libboost_system.so.1.58.0 libboost_thread.so.1.58.0
Is it possible to avoid these?

A:

No. It is possible in ROS 2, but not in ROS 1 as the dependency to boost is directly in the roscpp library: https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/search?q=boost&unscoped_q=boost
