Q:

Navigation stack state status

Hi everyone,
Just a quick question about the navigation stack, can I see the current machine state in the topic monitor ? I have seen the status of the goal but not the current state machine status.
Thanks

A:

Yes you can visualize everything in rviz, obviously if you monitor the corresponding topics in any other environment you would be able to read them. Here is the guide about how to setup rviz for the navigation stack: http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/Using%20rviz%20with%20the%20Navigation%20Stack
hope it helps

Thanks for your reply, but I would like to see just the state of the navigation ("goal reached","target accepted","moving",...)

you can see weather you reached the goal like this example
More functions could be found here

Yeah this kind of code will be helpful for my furture application but I thought that there is dedicated gui or a plugin to display the state of goals.
