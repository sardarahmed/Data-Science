Q:

No rule to make target `/usr/lib64/libQtWebKit_debug.so

catkin_make suddenly started to fail with the following error in Fedora 20:
[ 97%] make[2]: *** No rule to make target `/usr/lib64/libQtWebKit_debug.so', needed by XYZ

yum provides gives:
1:qt-devel-4.8.5-10.fc20.i686 : Development files for the Qt toolkit
Repo        : fedora
Matched from:
Filename    : /usr/lib/libQtWebKit_debug.so

1:qt-devel-4.8.5-10.fc20.x86_64 : Development files for the Qt toolkit
Repo        : fedora
Matched from:
Filename    : /usr/lib64/libQtWebKit_debug.so

So, both libraries are already installed.

A:

This is a Fedora bug in VTK packaging and was fixed: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1080781
Just update vtk-devel to the latest version.
