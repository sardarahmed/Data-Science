Q:

Ubuntu precise amd64 packages missing for ROS Fuerte

I use Ubuntu 12.04 precise for amd64 architecture.
After some modifications to my system today I had to remove ROS Fuerte and reinstall it. The main problem I face is that I find no amd64 packages of ROS when I update my package cache but only i386 instead. Looking to the repository under dists/precise/main I have seen that there are no entries regarding ros-fuerte in the Packages file under binary-amd64 directory (which is not the case for Packages file under binary-i386). Moreover, I noticed that the files have been updated yesterday.
I am curious if someone else has tried to install Fuerte on an amd64 based Precise system today, and if they have faced a similar issue. Thank you.

Same issue here. I would expect the mailing list to have more info soon and a fix to be out quickly based on past experience.
