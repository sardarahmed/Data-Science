Q:

rospack could not find the controller_interface package containing controller_interface::ControllerBase

Hi,
I'm trying to run gazebo simulator with my package and this error thrown.
[FATAL] [1386622156.026160179, 0.419000000]: Failed to create robot simulation interface loader: rospack could not find the controller_interface package containing controller_interface::ControllerBase

the simulation is successfully started, but the controllers are down, so the robot cannot be controlled.
when i try to locate the controller_interface package it exists:
omrib@ubuntu:~$ rospack find controller_interface
/opt/ros/hydro/share/controller_interface
omrib@ubuntu:~$ cd /opt/ros/hydro/share/controller_interface
omrib@ubuntu:/opt/ros/hydro/share/controller_interface$ ls
cmake  package.xml

any idea?

Hi. Same issue here. (posted on the Gazebo side: http://answers.gazebosim.org/question/5099/rospack-could-not-find-the-controller_interface/). It looks like the package is broken on the repo, since it is ... empty.

sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-ros-controllers
