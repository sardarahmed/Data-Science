Q:

show robot trajectory in rviz real-time

HI, I want to show UAV's trajectory in RVIZ in real time.
I am not sure I can use  LINE_STRPS  in visualization_msgs::Marker or PATH in nav_msgs/Path. The navigation algorithm was done by myself. I just want to show the trajectory, i am not sure which message to show path in rviz.
Thanks for your help.

A:

Just to add to the options mentioned by others: you could perhaps also look at moveit_visual_tools by Dave Coleman. From README.md:

Animate Trajectories

Higher level robot and trajectory functions

publishTrajectoryPath
publishTrajectoryPoint
publishRobotState
publishAnimatedGrasps
publishIKSolutions

publishTrajectoryPath(..) would seem to fit with what you describe.
Edit: whether this would work obviously depends on what particular type of robot trajectory you are working with.
