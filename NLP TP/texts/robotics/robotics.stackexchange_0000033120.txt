Q:

Fixed Frame [/laser] does not exist

my launch file
 <launch>
    <node pkg="hokuyo_node" type="hokuyo_node" name="hokuyo_node">
        <remap from="/scan" to="/base_scan" />
     </node>
 </launch>

Why rviz says Fixed Frame [/laser] does not exist?

A:

Nobody is publishing tf information from the /laser frame.
I guess, you input the fixed frame manually in the box and you also see the laser, so that should be fine.
Problems will arise if you have data in other frames.

It's only if you don't have tf information, you can hardcode something. The better way is to publish tf information as you did!

Uh,I know I can choose from Fixed Frame combo,but why I need to input some text(different than text which can be choose) in Fixed Frame box? Is it useful for something?
Comment by dornhege on 2011-07-20:
Usually the Fixed Frame has a combo containing the frames send by tf for you to choose. If nobody publishes you can still just input anything (e.g. /laser)

Thank you~I don't know what means of 'input the fixed frame manually in the box', but I found that when I add tf node with /laser transform,it works!

The option target frame is missing in groovy's rviz. What can be done instead?
