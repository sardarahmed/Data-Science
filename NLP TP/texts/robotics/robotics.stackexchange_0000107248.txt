Q:

ros2- where is the data libopencv-dev

I want to find this github address.
(I cant find it,because main opencvs github has opencv/opencv -b 4,3,2,1)
Thank you.

A:

The current version of libopencv-dev in Ubuntu Jammy is 4.5.4. To find the related commit in the opencv GitHub project, you've to check the tags (or releases page on GitHub). There you'll notice the 4.5.4 tag which is created from commit 4223495.
This is the source code that is used by the Ubuntu maintainers to create the apt-package (OpenCV even provides a OpenCVPackaging.cmake file).
