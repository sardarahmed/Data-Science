Q:

rqt_plot for data in DignosticArray message

I have been trying (unsuccessfully) to plot /diagnostics/status[0]/values[0]/value (a stringified floating point number).
Is such a topic string supported by rostopic or rqt_plot ?  If so, how do I access the value of interest ?

A:

Sadly, you can't plot strings in rqt_plot, and the diagnostics messages don't support floating-point diagnostic values.
You may want to look at the diagnostic_analysis package for alternate ways to analyze diagnostic data, or consider publishing your numeric data on a dedicated topic.
