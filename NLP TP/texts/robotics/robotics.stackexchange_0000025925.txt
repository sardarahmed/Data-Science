Availability of a Pioneer2AT model

Hi,
Any chance of the Pioneer2AT model hitting the model database?

A:

I'm working on a Pioneer 3AT model right now, which should be good 'nuff for you. :)
I'm working on the ROS plugin right now which should be the last thing I need to finish before I publish it.
Here's a preview:

My model is named pioneer3at, and you'll probably want to comment out the plugin line at the bottom of the sdf.

Hi, really excited about your post.  Thanks!  Looking forward to testing it.  I'm using gazebo standalone and will be using it with player, so ROS is not really necessary for me.  All the best!

That's actually good to hear, because I'm spending some extra effort to make the plugin generic so that it works with both player and ROS. :) I added a link to the full model I'm working on. Just remove the plugin line from the bottom of the sdf and you should be set. :)

Hi, I'm testing it just now, and two issues:

The uri in the model.sdf are wrong.  They are not model://Pioneer/meshes etc. but model://pioneer3at/meshes...
When I insert the pioneer in my heightmap terrain world it starts moving and I can't get it to stop.  But when I insert it in an empty world it sits quietly.

It seems that I forgot to move the model back to my repository from the working directory.... :P As for the other problem, the robot has no forces acting on the joints by default, so it will probably roll into a valley by default.

Thanks a lot, bro, really appreciate all your effort that we're benefiting from :)

You may also benefit from the plugin I'm writing for it. I'm using gazebo topics for the plugin, so it should work with Player. http://pastebin.com/mVpCcRhz http://pastebin.com/cvEyxTp9

So what is the status as of now?  I just looked at the bitbucket site and it says the plugin is going to be merged with official gazebo models?  Any idea when this will happen?

Well, I'll give the maintainer an e-mail and see if he'll pull it.
Comment by logicalguy on 2013-03-14:
Just an idea - I've renamed the model name in the model.sdf file to pioneer3at rather than Pioneer3AT, just to make it consistent with the name of the pioneer2dx model.  What do you think?

probably a good idea
