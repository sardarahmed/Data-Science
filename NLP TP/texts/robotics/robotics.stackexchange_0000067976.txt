Q:

GPS Mission Planning in ROS?

I'm working on my entry for Sparkfun's Autonomous Vehicle Competition, and my current mission planning software is non-existent.
Can anyone recommend a good mission-planning software that would allow me to create a series of GPS waypoints on a map? Bonus points if it integrates well with ROS and rviz, and can be used offline.

A:

For reference, I ended up writing a simple tool which converts KML/KMZ files into my custom path format: https://github.com/trainman419/dagny_robomagellan/blob/670a45856950bc4008bbe05aa838a7b1c70a9332/goal_list/scripts/kml2yaml.py
This means that I can do my mission planning in Google Maps, Google Earth or any other KML editor, and then quickly convert that result for use on my robot.
EDIT
I also considered rviz_satellite and the Qt Marble framework, but the lack of easily-usable, high-res satellite maps means that they're not very useful for planning a mission the size of AVC.
