Q:

How to ensure colcon does not run doxygen

I noticed upon building Gazebo Garden that it runs doxygen. This takes a significant time. Is there a way to disable this?

A:

This is not a colcon option, but Gazebo libraries have a cmake flag for disabling documentation. You'd pass it through colcon via --cmake-args -DBUILD_DOCS=OFF. This is a good tutorial to look through for this and other flags.
