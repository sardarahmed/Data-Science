Q:

Setting joint velocity in Gazebo

Hello all,
I'm trying to simulate an obstacle avoiding robot in gazebo. I've been following this tutorial.
The problem is that this tutorial uses the following function in order to move the robot.

SetForce(0, torque);

The problem with that is it eventually makes robot to spin.
So i looked in API ref and found

SetVelocity(0, vel);

Code compiles just fine however, this doesn't seem to have any effect on model.
So how can I set velocity of wheels from a plugin ?

This question is quite Gazebo-specific. You might get better feedback if you ask it on answers.gazebo.com

A:

The velocity controls will not respond unless the max force limit is large. Edit your sdf to increase the limit or programatically use setMaxForce() to increase the force to a large value. Gazebo will work within these limits to try and instantaneously accelerate your joint to those speeds, so you need no force limits on your joints if you are working on velocities.

Thank you. I actually asked the same question in gazebosim and got the same answer. Forgot about this one :)
