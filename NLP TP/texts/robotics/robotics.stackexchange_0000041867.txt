Q:

The problem of sensor_msgs::fillImage

Hi,
I rosmake the robotino package and got the error "undefined reference to `sensor_msgs::fillImage". Any one has the idea how to solve it? Thanks.

The ROS version is 1.8.10.

A:

sensor_msgs::fillImage is defined as an inline function in the header file sensor_msgs/fill_image.h in /opt/ros/fuerte/include. Are you sure that you are including it?
Edit: In a recent update, lib files for messages were removed. It could be that your cmake still tries to link against it. Try make clean before building your package. You can also use rosmake --pre-clean.
