Q:

Robot heading uncertainty values

I'm tracking the state of a robot using an EKF defined by:
$$(x,y,\theta)$$
where $x$ and $y$ are the coordinates in the ground-plane and $\theta$ the heading angle.
I initialized the covariance matrix $P$ to the following values: 
$$P
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{xx}^2 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & \sigma_{yy}^2 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \sigma_{\theta \theta}^2 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
where $\sigma_{xx}=1$, $\sigma_{yy}=1$ and $\sigma_{\theta \theta }=0.1$
In the system i'm using, valid measurements are rearely obtained so the predicted covariance matrix becomes very big.
My question concerns the angle uncertainty, the angle is predicted from angle increments $\Delta_{theta}$ so, at each time stamp $k$:
$$\theta=\theta+\Delta_{theta_{k}}$$
We wrap the value of the obtained angle to make $\theta\in[-\pi,\pi]$.
Does the uncertainty have to be also wrapped to the interval $[-\pi,\pi]$? means that making $\sigma_{\theta }\in[-\pi,\pi]$?

A:

No, the uncertainty should not be wrapped.
Remember, uncertainty is fundamentally different than angle. At the most trivial level, uncertainty cannot be negative or even zero (i.e. $\sigma_\theta > 0$).
At another level, the angles $\pi$ and $3\pi$ represent the exact same thing, and wrapping the angle is more a nicety than an actual requirement. But $\sigma_\theta=\pi$ implies less uncertainty than $\sigma_\theta = 3\pi$ so if you wrapped you'd be fundamentally changing the uncertainty.
