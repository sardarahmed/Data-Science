Q:

usb_cam Exit code -11

Hi, I'm really new in ROS(I started a year ago, though), and I have a question using usb_cam package.
I'm working on using purethermal1 with Flir Lepton 2.5,
and launched usb_cam-test.launch file, but the process is failed with exit code -11.
There're some WARNINGS, but I think nothing is related to process failing.
I dont know what causes exit code -11, so I ask question here.
But it's OK when I try same process with logitech webcam.
So, my question is,
Do you guys have recommanded ROS Package to watch thermal cam?
I'm using UBUNTU 16.04, ROS Kinetic
I insists ros because we need raw data in ros message to another processing procedure.
I hope cool advice, thx.
And really sorry for my short English.

A:

Never mind with this question. I found myself.
Just using usb_cam package, which is already included ROS system.
The important points are pixel format and width, height.
In purethermal1, pixel format is uyvy, 80 x 60 resolutions.
Just modify that parameter in launch file.
and do the roslaunch:
sudo chmod +x /dev/video0
roslaunch usb_cam usb_cam-test.launch
And everything works fine.
