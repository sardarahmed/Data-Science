Q:

sensor_msgs::LaserScan to PCLPointCloud2 in Indigo

Hi folks,
I want to know how can I convert an sensor_msgs::LaserScan::ConstPtr& to  an pcl::PCLPointCloud2 object?
Specifically, what libraries (e.g., "pcl/conver.h" or something like that), what functions (e.g., pcl::fromLasertoPoinCloud() or something like that), and intermediary conversion variables, if any (e.g., from laser-->laserToCloud_holder-->PCLPointCloud).
PS: giving me the direct answer right here is 10x more useful than sending me to a "Migration" website, etc. (because I am also reading some of them already).
Sample code/projects is also useful!
Thanks in advanced.

A:

The laser_geometry package has a library for projecting laser scans into point clouds: http://wiki.ros.org/laser_geometry

Hi,
Yes, I saw that, but I'm trying to change from pcl::PCLPointCloud2, and not from sensor_msgs::PointCloud2.

Do you think there is an extra step that I would have to follow to get to PCLPointCloud2 form the conversion from laser to sensor_msgs::PointCloud to convert that data to PCLPointCloud2?
Thanks

Yes, but those methods are in the PCL library and not in ROS. ROS will take you as far as pcl::PointCloud http://wiki.ros.org/pcl/Overview
