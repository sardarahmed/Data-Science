Q:

Use of TCP/IP Protocol under ROS

Hi all,
I am kind of new in ROS (well … finished the turtlesim tutorial though :-D…) and currently trying to get functional a new stack to control an arm-robot through TCP/IP.
I understand that ROS allows us to communicate using the TCP/IP protocol and that there is some kind of library called TCPROS which can be implemented to do so (explained in http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/TCPROS.
I was wondering if anybody already implemented it, or if there were any existing packages I could get inspiration from.
Cheers,
Gael

A:

All of the ROS client libraries (e.g. roscpp, rospy) implement this protocol for you.  I probably wouldn't recommend reimplementing TCPROS as first step in getting used to ROS.  You should be able to write a program using one of the client libraries.
FYI: I would also look for existing packages that may already implement drivers for your hardware here:

I did not know the protocol was implemented in roscpp library. Is there any information about this you could give me ?

We are currently working on the hardware part, so I don't think there is any packages that have been implemented to control our hardware. Anyway i'm sur there are already packages already implemented to allow TCP/IP communication. I cannot find any of those.
