Q:

rqt plugin with custom icon in Ubuntu sidebar (Unity Launcher)

Hi,
is there a way to set a custom icon for a rqt plugin, that is then shown in the Ubuntu sidebar (Unity Launcher)? If you have several rqt plugins open, a custom icon would help to switch between the rqt windows.
I want basically replace the ROS icon in  the image below:

Thanks

+1. But I just wanted to reiterate that rqt allows multiple tools/plugins laid out on a single window, as a screenshot in http://wiki.ros.org/rqt?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=ros_gui.png

Are you starting rqt and then select plugins from the menu or are you invoking individual plugins in standalone mode, e.g. rqt_graph, rqt_plot?
Comment by sam_123 on 2015-06-14:
@Dirk Thomas, I invoke my own plugins usually in standalone mode.

@130s, for the case where you have multiple plugins in the same window, it would be nice to define an icon for the perspective. Is that possible? I guess not (couldn't find something about it)
Comment by Dirk Thomas on 2015-06-14:
No, perspectives currently don't have an icon.

A:

The next release of rqt will use the plugin icon for the application when running in standalone mode: https://github.com/ros-visualization/qt_gui_core/pull/54
If you have defined an icon for your plugin that will address your use case.

cool, thanks.
Is it possible to do something similar for perspectives?
Comment by Dirk Thomas on 2015-06-14:
Plugins already have an icon and they are provided with the ROS package. Perspectives are user created and don't have an icon. So that would require more effort - also from the user whenever a perspective is created. Therefore I don't think I will implement it but pull requests are always welcome.
