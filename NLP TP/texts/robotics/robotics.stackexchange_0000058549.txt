A:

You can get a "ROS free" version of gmapping from openslam.org. For AMCL, I´m not sure if a standalone is available (originally AMCL was a player driver, so that´d be a ROS free version). It would be pretty relatively easy to strip the AMCL CMakeLists.txt/package of ROS related parts though.
Note that this site is called ROS Answers though, so using these packages without ROS is really beyond the scope of it ;)
