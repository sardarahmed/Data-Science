Q:

Couldn't find executable named teleop_twist_keyboard.py

I tried to control my bot using teleop_twist_keyboard.But I just cannot run  teleop_twist_keyboard.py.Having examed the package,I thought I install the package correctly.I just cannot find out the reason.I have tried to edit the CMakeLists.txt file ,but the file is read only.Can anyone help me

A:

Source you environment source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash
Try running without .py rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard

It should work most probably else try running this:
rospack list | grep teleop_twist_keyboard
if you don't see anything its probably not installed properly.
UPDATE:
The issue is with this command sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python, it creates a symlink between python and python3. But ROS melodic requires python2 not python 3. so you need to remove the symlink then install python 2 and create a symlink with python 2 and then run it again. I'll write the commands you need to follow.

sudo rm /usr/bin/python to remove the symlink from python to python 3
sudo apt install python2.7 check your /usr/bin/directory if python2 present skip to next step.
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python2 /usr/bin/python creates symlink with python2
source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash source your ros env.
rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py
