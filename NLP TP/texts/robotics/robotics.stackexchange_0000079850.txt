Q:

How to ask to ros the service parameter data type

I am learning ROS from the Wiki site and doing some commandos on the terminal to improve my understanding about it:
I would like to know what are the parameters of a Rosservice, I am doing something like:

$rosclient@rosclient-VirtualBox:~$
rosservice list

I get:

/clear /kill /reset
/rosout/get_loggers
/rosout/set_logger_level /spawn
/teleop_turtle/get_loggers
/teleop_turtle/set_logger_level
/turtle1/set_pen
/turtle1/teleport_absolute
...etc etc

then I do:

$rosclient@rosclient-VirtualBox:~$
rosservice info
/turtle1/teleport_absolute

and  I get:

Node: /turtlesim
URI: rosrpc://rosclient-VirtualBox:40839
Type: turtlesim/TeleportAbsolute
Args: x y theta

but I need to know what x,y theta are... are float, ints or what (please note this example is pretty trivial to infer the data type, but I am looking for somthing like rosmsg )
thanks

A:

rossrv offers exactly the same sub-commands as rosmsg. See its wiki.
For your particular case,
$ rossrv 
list      md5       package   packages  show      
$ rossrv show turtlesim/TeleportAbsolute
float32 x
float32 y
float32 theta
---

Or without package name:
$ rossrv show TeleportAbsolute                                                                                                                                                            
[turtlesim/TeleportAbsolute]:
float32 x
float32 y
float32 theta
