A:

It can't find opencv on your system, either it's not installed or installed somewhere else. Have you installed opencv?
It could be that you've installed a different version of opencv (when I check the path /usr/include/opencv on my pc I find usr/include/opencv4 for instance). If that's the case you'll need to update the CMake file to build against the version of opencv you've got installed.
