Q:

Are there examples of robots using diff_drive_controller in ros2_control?

We are working on the development of a custom differential drive robot using ROS 2 Foxy. Until now, our development was in simulation only and we are now transferring our code to the actual physical robot. I was looking into ros2_control to describe our hardware components and I thought it would be logical to use the diff_drive_controller. So, I have been looking for examples using this approach. However, I have not found any repositories that use ros2_control with the diff_drive_controller. Is anyone aware of physical robots that uses ros2_control with the diff_drive_controller controller in ROS 2 Foxy?

Hello Wilco, we are in the same situation and looking for a ros2_control diff_drive_controller example.

Hey, I also started with ros2_control stuff. I'm atm trying to get it running but I encounter a wired bug. Just posted the question here https://answers.ros.org/question/377820/ros2_control-created-node-by-controllerinterface-gets-nodename-of-controller_manager-no-matter-what-diff_drive_controller/
Do you have it already running on your robot?

A:

Hi all,
There is an example for a simple diff-drive robot in ros2_control_demos repository.
See here for the explanation how the example works.
Is this what you have searched for?

That was not available at the time of writing the question, but that is indeed what we were looking for.
