Q:

move_base - missed desired rate

Hi all,
I have a quite high level question. I'm currently trying to unplug the amcl node from the navigation stack and substitute it with a custom localization algorithm. Although I'm able to broadcast the transformation /map -> /odom with a high frequency (40Hz), I'm getting lots of errors such as
[ WARN] [1422360986.992858074, 13.073000000]: Control loop missed its desired rate of 10.0000Hz... the loop actually  took 0.8180 seconds

[ WARN] [1422360986.993048443, 13.073000000]: Map update loop missed its desired rate of 5.0000Hz... the loop actually  took 0.7770 seconds

as well as
[ERROR] [1422360988.321754058, 14.389000000]: Extrapolation Error: Lookup would require extrapolation into the future.  Requested time 13.881000000 but the latest data is at time 13.871000000, when looking up transform from frame [map] to frame [odom]

I was wondering what can cause such an error. The parameters in move_base are set so that the /amcl is not popping any of those warnings/errors.
Thanks and regards.

A:

The first errors come from the code taking longer to run than expected. It should be independent of the tf source.

Thanks David. Actually the update rate was too slow
