Q:

Action Client Results

So I've been looking at action clients now for a while.  I have used these before, but never really used the results from the action servers that I've made in the past... but now I made a server that sends back results, which I get no errors from during compile time, but I haven't figured out how to use them on the client side without causing the build to fail.
ik_solve_msgs::IK_SolveActionResult ik_solve_results;
ik_solve_results = m_ikclient.getResult();

fails... I've tried as many ways as I can to see if I can get this working, but haven't had any success.
error message I'm getting,
error: no match for ‘operator=’ in ‘ik_solve_results = actionlib::SimpleActionClient<ActionSpec>::getResult() [with ActionSpec = ik_solve_msgs::IK_SolveAction_<std::allocator<void> >, actionlib::SimpleActionClient<ActionSpec>::ResultConstPtr = boost::shared_ptr<const ik_solve_msgs::IK_SolveResult_<std::allocator<void> > >, typename ActionSpec::_action_result_type::_result_type = ik_solve_msgs::IK_SolveResult_<std::allocator<void> >]()’

Does anyone actually know how to get the results back and use them?
all I see in the examples only uses the results to tell if the action server has finished, which I use,
bool finished_before_timeout = m_ikclient.waitForResult(ros::Duration(30.0));

any help would be greatly appreciated!

A:

The result is a ConstPtr.
Dereference it by putting a * in front of the result to use it this way.

Thanks, that's the correct answer.  I found that getting results like this resolves my build issue, but haven't been able to test it yet since I have some other bugs to work first.
ik_solve_msgs::IK_SolveResult ik_solve_results = *m_ikclient.getResult();
