Q:

uvc camera nodelet for multiple HD cameras

Hello,
I am currently trying to display the output of multiple cameras (Logitech c930e) using uvc_camera nodes in HD (1920 x 1080). For each camera, there is a dedicated monitor. All the monitors are mounted on same pc with graphic cards. My question is:
When I run the cameras separately using "guvcview" command, I can display the streaming of two cameras simultaneously on two monitors. But as I switch to HD mode at 30fps one of the camera stops displaying. However if I run the same configuration with 5fps, it works.
In order to use it under ROS framework, when I run two separate nodelets "roslaunch camera_nodelet.lauch" at HD 1920 x 1080, I get the following error for the second camera only:
[ERROR] [1376479436.485809503]: Failed to load nodelet [/uvc_camera] of type [uvc_camera/CameraNodelet]: unable to start capture
[FATAL] [1376479436.486049480]: Service call failed!
[uvc_camera-2] process has died [pid 27429, exit code 255, cmd /opt/ros/groovy/lib/nodelet/nodelet load uvc_camera/CameraNodelet /camera_process __name:=uvc_camera __log:=/home/spacebot/.ros/log/612e5f9a-04c9-11e3-871b-00248c04ba14/uvc_camera-2.log].
log file: /home/spacebot/.ros/log/612e5f9a-04c9-11e3-871b-00248c04ba14/uvc_camera-2*.log
The camera_nodelet.launch file for the second camera contains:
<param name="width" type="int" value="1920" />
<param name="height" type="int" value="1080" />
<param name="fps" type="int" value="5" />
<param name="frame" type="string" value="wide_stereo" />
<param name="device" type="string" value="/dev/video1" />
<remap from="/image_raw" to="/image_raw_02"/>

Could someone please suggest or comment that what exactly is happening?
Thank you!
PS: setting parameters from command line to change image resolution haven't been helpful.

Comment by Eric Perko on 2013-09-08:
Are both of your cameras connected to the same USB bus/controller? Can you try hooking them to USB ports that are on separate USB controllers?

A:

Thank you Eric, I just found that it was the issue of using same USB bus. By moving one camera to other USB bus solved the issue of the HD video streaming.
I guess "guvcview" was inherently adjusting the frame rate and the resolution whereas running "rosrun uvc_camera camera_node" command simply started both cameras with HD and due to USB limits, one of the camera output crashed.
