Q:

How to install Hokuyo laser driver on Indigo

I can intall the drivers for the Hokuyo laser range finders on ROS Fuerte by
$ sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-laser-drivers

But how can I install the same drivers on the ROS Indigo?
I can not find the package including hokuyo_node on ROS Indigo.
I have down loaded the source code of hokuyo_node in the website http://wiki.ros.org/hokuyo_node?distro=groovy,but I do not know how to use it to install the driver.
Could any one give me some advice. Any help is much appreciated!

A:

What you are looking for is hokuyo_node package, ros-indigo-hokuyo-node. A quick Google search shows this:
http://wiki.ros.org/hokuyo_node
But most probably you would like to move to the newest drivers: http://wiki.ros.org/urg_node
