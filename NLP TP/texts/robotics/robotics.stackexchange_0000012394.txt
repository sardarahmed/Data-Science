Q:

Servo coupler size needed

Hey all I would like to know what type of coupler I would need for this type of servo?

The specs are:

I'm guessing that the 25T means it has 25 teeth in the part that holds the adapters?
So I would guess I would need something like this?

But I also would like to know what size those are called for my servo. I've seen them advertised as 5mm to 8mm. 6mm to 8mm, etc etc so I don't know if those are going to work? Some also just have a smooth round hole without the teeth and I'm not sure if that's something I could use as well?

A:

RC Servos come with several different styles of exit shafts (often called splines due to the teeth that are cut into them).  There are quite a few different styles.  Tooth count (yes, 25T means 25 tooth) is a major indicator of the styles; but, some styles have the same tooth count but different diameter so you cannot go by tooth count alone.
Two of the most popular RC Servo Manufacturers are HiTEC and Futaba
The companies make motors with several different spline/shaft sizes
Futaba's most common sizes are 1F(15 tooth),2F(21 tooth),3F(25 tooth),4F(25 tooth)
HiTEK's most common sizes are A1(15 tooth),B1(25 tooth),C1(24 tooth),D1(15 tooth) 
HiTEK also some motors with an H25T spline which matches the popular Futaba 3F spline.
I can't tell for sure; but, it looks like the JX Servo uses a  25T (probably 3F-style) spline.
ServoCity lists has several different Servo Couplers
This coupler is a 3F style
