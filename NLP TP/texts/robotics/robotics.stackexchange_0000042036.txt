Q:

What type of messages can be used in services?(existing and custom)

Hello!
I was just curious about what kind of messages I can transmit over services and topics. Is there a list available somewhere which I can refer to  for this? I know that simple messages can be of the following types
1)a built-in type, such as "float32 pan" or "string name"
2)names of Message descriptions defined on their own, such as "geometry_msgs/PoseStamped"
3)fixed- or variable-length arrays (lists) of the above, such as "float32[] ranges" or "Point32[10] points"
4)the special Header type, which maps to std_msgs/Header
Also, what if I want to pass my own class instance as a message? What do I need to do that?
All help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

A:

hello you can look at the type of messages from here
http://www.ros.org/wiki/msg
in order to look what is inside of a specific message header file, you can check its reference
for example here is the laserscan msg
http://www.ros.org/doc/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/LaserScan.html
if you want to create your own services and messages, check out this wiki below

hope these help you
