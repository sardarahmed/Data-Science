Q:

Working package for fiducial pose recognition?

Hi all,
I've been trying to compile the fiducial package (http://www.ros.org/browse/details.php?name=fiducial) without success due to a compilation error in its dependency, opencv_candidate (http://www.ros.org/browse/details.php?name=opencv_candidate).  (I've included the rosmake output below.)  I'm on Ubuntu 10.04 using Diamondback.
Should I be using another package (or other option) for fiducial pose recognition?  Has anyone else had luck compiling the fiducial package, and its opencv_candidate dependency?
Thank you,
Billy McCafferty

Hi,
I'm not sure this is what you need, but have you looked at ar_pose?
