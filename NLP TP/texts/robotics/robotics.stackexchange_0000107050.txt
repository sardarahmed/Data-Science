Q:

I have a ros-humble pc and a ros-melodic bot, how should I use the pc to control the bot remotely with rviz

It cound't be control and it shows me Could not contact ROS master at [http://192.168.1.245:11311], retrying...how should I do to resolve it.Should I try to use ros1bridge or install a docker ros-melodic

A:

If you are new to ros, it's a bad idea to try to configure a mixed ros1 / ros2 system. Debugging the problems you are sure to have requires advanced ros knowledge.
If your physical robot uses melodic, and you want a desktop computer to interact with it, the desktop should run ros melodic too. The best option is to first install Ubuntu 18 on the desktop, but if that is difficult, then the next best thing is to run a Docker container with melodic on your linux desktop computer.
You will have to follow an install guide. There are firewall, networking and graphics configuration you need to do if you want this to work.
