Q:

Can you change ROI (region of Interest) for stereo camera without recalibrating?

Hello,
I've built a high-resolution stereo camera (two Prosilica GC2450-C's), and I'm setting a region of interest that needs to be changeable without manually recalibrating the stereo camera. I'd like to be able to take full-frame pictures (no region of interest), identify where in my image is my target, and then set a smaller region of interest onto the target so that I can increase my framerate. Do I need to recalibrate the stereo setup when I change the region of interest? The camera intrinsics and rigid-body-displacement between the cameras won't change at all when I change the region of interest, but I'm wondering if changing the image size will require a manual (checkboard) recalibration. Thanks!

A:

Changing ROI should not affect calibration.
See REP-0104.
