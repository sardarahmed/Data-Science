Q:

Save all recorded bag files with `rosbag record`

I am recording data from a range scanner with ROS Melodic using the following command:

rosbag record -o nav310_ws/bagFiles/session --split --duration=1 --max-splits 1 /cloud

In the bagFiles folder, only the latest bag files are kept. So I was wondering how to copy all recorded bag files and save them to another folder. I tried the following command just after the first one, but it did do anything.

cp -a nav310_ws/bagFiles/.
nav310_ws/allBags/

Thank you for any suggestion you could provide.

A:

If you want to keep the older bag files, you should not be using the --max-splits 1 option. The command:
rosbag record --help

explains what the options do.
