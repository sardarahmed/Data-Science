Q:

tabletop_objects stack installation

Hi,
I need to work with the tabletop_objects stack. I was wondering if someone could help me with the following:

Is tabletop_objects ready to use with ROS Fuerte or should I use ROS Electric ?
Has anyone used the tabletop_objects detector with Kinect input and without the manipulation ?

Thanks
Aditya

A:

I think it's best to create one post per question. Regarding usability of tabletop_object_perception in Fuerte: sure. Just install it with
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-pr2-object-manipulation
