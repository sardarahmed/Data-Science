Q:

Hydro release for Raring

I've got ubuntu 13 and I want to start ROS development.  Any update on hydro release. right now I'm just reading tutorials and twiddling my thumbs waiting for the release.  should I just go ahead and work on compiling it now? or is it just a matter of days before the official release.  (does it have to do with the DARPA challenge? or something?)

A:

Despite the fact that Hydro has not yet released (which might be about one more month) there are already Debian packages available for Raring. Please see the status page (columns HbinR32 and HbinR64) for whats available already: http://ros.org/debbuild/hydro.html

I did see that page, but I notice ros-base  was red. Is that not a problem?  If not, what's the command to install the full hydro and whatever version of gazebo works with it?  I would really appreciate your help. (I'm on ubuntu Raring 32 bit)
Comment by Dirk Thomas on 2013-06-18:
ros-base (as well as other variants) is not yet available since not all packages have been released into hydro by now. It is each packages maintainers responsibility to perform that release. You can install any package which is already available (e.g. apt-get install ros-hydro-*).
