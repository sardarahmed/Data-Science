Q:

How do I send numpy array with ROS services?

Hi, I am writing a service in ROS and need to send 3D numpy arrays through this service. I know that for the messages there is numpy_msg, but haven't found anything similar for the services.
Thanks for the help! :D

A:

Not sure if there is an existing serviec/message type that you can use out of box, but reshape the 3D array into a 1D array then simply use float64[] would probably work.
