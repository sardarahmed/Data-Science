Q:

catkin_make_isolated builds tf after a package that requires tf?

I am building ROS on a Raspberry Pi 3 using catkin_make_isolated. The full command is sudo ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release --install-space /opt/ros/indigo -j2.
I have a package that requires tf, but when using the above command, tf is built after the package, and so the whole make fails.
When building without the new package, the make finishes fine.
Any ideas? Thanks

Please include the CMakeLists.txt and package.xml of the package that "requires tf". Make sure to remove all the boilerplate comments from them though (especially CMakeList.txt).

A:

Thanks for helping! I actually went over the CMakeLists.txt myself afterwards and after removing all the junk found the problem myself. I solved it by removing a non existing add_executable that was left over from the download off github. Maybe I should notify the guys who uploaded it.
