Q:

kdl or orocos_kdl from electric to indigo

hi there, i'm new to ros. my friend has ros files with ros-electric structure and now i want to use it with indigo..
and now i have problem with kdl or orocos_kdl (everytime i search about kdl on google, it always shown orocos-kdl, so i thought today they called it orocos_kdl. am i wrong?).
after i following ros-tutorial rosbuild to catkin, i try to catkin_make, and this is the result
CMake Error at /opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:75 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "orocos_kdl" with
  any of the following names:

    orocos_kdlConfig.cmake
    orocos_kdl-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "orocos_kdl" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "orocos_kdl_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "orocos_kdl" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  skripsi_mocap/CMakeLists.txt:7 (find_package)

make: *** [cmake_check_build_system] Error 1
Invoking "make cmake_check_build_system" failed

anyway, the orocos_kdl was write down for kdl before. because i thought it's a call-name failure so i changed it to orocos_kdl on CMakeList and package.xml. so i don't know if my decision is right enough or not.
i'm following this link: linking-against-kdl-ros-hydro.
and this is my CMakeList :
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
...
orocos_kdl
..
)
....

find_library(orocos_kdl_LIBRARY NAMES ${orocos_kdl_LIBRARIES} PATHS
${orocos_kdl_LIBRARY_DIRS} NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
set(orocos_kdl_LIBRARIES ${orocos_kdl_LIBRARY})

....

catkin_package(DEPENDS orocos_kdl)

please help me.. :"

A:

Since orocos_kdl is not a catkin package you need to find it separately and not as part of the find_package(catkin)
So try
find_package(orocos_kdl REQUIRED)

instead of
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS orocos_kdl)
