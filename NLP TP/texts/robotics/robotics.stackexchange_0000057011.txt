Q:

Can I Run a nodelet as a regular C++ class

If i load up a nodelet, from a reguler c++ program, call it's init function, and then call ros::spin(), will it function as a regular node?

A:

Yes, you can make a node out of a nodelet. In fact that's somehow what the nodelet manager does. This might be a very good idea if you have code that might be used/combined somewhere as a nodelet, but also can provide standalone functionality easily.
