Q:

how to make Collision Markers visible in rviz?

according to this tutorial, i can successfully check the state validity. but i don't know what i should do to make the collision markers visible in rviz? do i need to manually publish a topic on the collision markers? i thought the /planning_scene_validity_server should do this job. i've already added "Marker" in rviz, but don't know which topic it should listen to.
thanks.

A:

well, just find this method in collision_models.h:
void getAllCollisionPointMarkers(const planning_models::KinematicState& state,
                                   visualization_msgs::MarkerArray& arr,
                                   const std_msgs::ColorRGBA& color,
                                   const ros::Duration& lifetime);

and now i can visualize these markers by manually publish them myself.
