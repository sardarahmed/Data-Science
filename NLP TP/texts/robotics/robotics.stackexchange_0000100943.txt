Q:

How to verify correct actionlib.SimpleActionClient setup?

I am trying to create a SimpleActionClient in my Python service node using the following lines of code:
move_base_client = actionlib.SimpleActionClient('move_base', MoveBaseAction)
move_base_client.wait_for_server()

I've got this working previously but I'm now trying to implement it on a different system where move_base is already running.
The code just hangs when it waits for the server and I'm not sure why. I'd like to verify that move_base_client has connected to the move_base topic as instructed to begin troubleshooting.
Any ideas on how I might do this?

A:

You need to make sure the action server is running. Do a rostopic list | grep goal and look for topics ending with ".../goal". The entire "..." part is the name of the action server.
