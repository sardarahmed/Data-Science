Q:

Error on joy_node (Couldn't open joystick)

Hello, I have an error on joy_node.
I wanted to use joystick to control Ar.Drone. So I used joy package. At the first time, I successfully used joystick("rosrun joy joy_node".)
But next time I executed joy_node, an error occurred.
[ERROR] [1473937621.294455702]: Couldn't open joystick dev/input/js1. Will retry every second.

Then, I tried some solutions.
First, I checked what is the joystick's name.
ls -l /dev/input/js*
crw-rw-rw-  1 root root 13, 0  9月 15 19:06 /dev/input/js0
crw-rw-rw-+ 1 root root 13, 1  9月 15 19:24 /dev/input/js1

Plugging and unplugging, I could see my joystick was js1.
Second, I changed permissions of /dev/input/js1 to 777 and set the parameter.
sudo chmod a+rw /dev/input/js1
rosparam set joy_node/dev "dev/input/js1"

After all I couldn't solve this problem...
Thank you for any help.

A:

rosparam set joy_node/dev "dev/input/js1"

The path to the joystick device is /dev/input/js1, not dev/input/js1 (note the starting /).
