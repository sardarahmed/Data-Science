Q:

Ros nodes not starting from a launch file

'm trying to create a launch file for starting all the nodes. But for some reason, running the launch file doesn't run the node. The topic in which the node publishes is listed when I run rostopic list, but when I try to echo, nothing is displayed.
On the other hand if I just do a rosrun, it all works perfectly fine.
This is my launch file:
<launch>

  <node pkg="robot_pose_ekf" type="robot_pose_ekf" name="robot_pose_ekf">
    <param name="output_frame" value="odom_combined"/>
    <param name="base_footprint_frame" value="base_footprint"/>
    <param name="freq" value="30.0"/>
    <param name="sensor_timeout" value="1.0"/>
    <param name="odom" value="true"/>
    <param name="imu_data" value="true"/>
    <param name="vo_used" value="true"/> 

 </node>
  <node pkg="IMU_filter" type="test.py" name="test">
  </node>

</launch>

I'm using Indigo. I'm trying to launch a python node in a folder called scripts within the IMU_filter ROS package.

Are you sure that the nodes aren't running? The topics being created seems to indicate otherwise. After launching the launch file, run rosnode list and put the output here.

A:

Your nodes are being launched in silent mode, to provide them with console print access you need to add the output="screen" tag.
example: <node pkg="move_base" type="move_base" name="move_base" output="screen">
