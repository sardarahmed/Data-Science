Q:

How to adjust center of mass when going over obstacles?

Hi I have a robot currently setup using ROS-Kinetic and Gazebo. The machine has four wheels and a differential driving system. I am testing how the machine goes over street curbs and often times as the angle of the machine changes it falls backward. The real robot I am modeling adjusts its center of mass to go over obstacles such as curbs. Do you guys have any suggestions on how I should go about this feature?

A:

How about adding a link which holds the amount of mass you want to move, and connecting that link to the rest of the robot by a prismatic joint you can control?

I actually do have something like that. I have a wheel assembly on either side of the machine. Each with two wheels. I could hook this up to the main chassis with a prismatic joint. What is the best way to go about controlling this joint?

I'd say similarly to how you're controlling the rest of the robot... Since you're using ROS you may want to use that here too
