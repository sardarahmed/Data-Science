Q:

roslaunch ROSARIA problem

Dear all.
I can run:rosrun ROSARIA RosAria
But when I run the following in a launch file
I get the error:
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [ROSARIA/RosAria]: ROSARIA
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/groovy/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/home/acp/patrol_ws/sandbox
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/groovy/share
ROS path [3]=/opt/ros/groovy/stacks
ROS path [4]=/home/acp/patrol_ws
ROS path [5]=/home/acp/patrol_ws/skynetish/generic_teleop
Any clue about this?
I appreciate your help

Try out p2os-vanderbilt. It's stable in groovy. http://www.ros.org/wiki/p2os-vanderbilt

is the folder in which the ROSARIA is located added to $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH variable?

A:

Hey Man:
Maybe I know what is wrong with your launch file.
In my opinion, the value of the pkg attribute should be "rosaria" rather than "ROSARIA" becuz the name of the directory u put your source code in is "rosaria" .
So if u change  the value to "rosaria" ,the problem will be solved.
Hope u success!Best wishes~
