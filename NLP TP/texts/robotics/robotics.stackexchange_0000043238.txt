Q:

Using sound_play in ROS custom nodes written in c/c++

Hi all,
I successfully managed to get sound_play working on my machine.
I was just wondering if there is a way to use it through c/c++ code within my node.
I found something for python in http://www.pirobot.org/blog/0022/ but not for c/c++.
For the time being I used a system call within the code as follows:
system("rosrun sound_play say.py "Hi There"");
A small barebone example code would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks in advance.

A:

sound_play exposes a C++ API that's documented here: http://docs.ros.org/latest-available/api/sound_play/html/index.html
There's a simple example here: http://docs.ros.org/latest-available/api/sound_play/html/test_8cpp_source.html
