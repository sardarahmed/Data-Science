Q:

unused args [...] for include of [...]

I'm trying to pass an argument to a launch file, and I keep getting this error.
The main launch file has something like this:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<launch>
    <include file="$(find p2os_urdf)/launch/upload_pioneer3at.xml">
        <arg name="foo" value="bar"/>
    </include>
 ...
</launch>

The included file looks like this:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<launch>
    <param name="testing" value="$(arg foo)"/>
</launch>

Yet I keep getting this error:
unused args [foo] for include of [/home/sciencectn/builds/ros/src/p2os_urdf/launch/upload_pioneer3at.xml]

I assume it means the "foo" argument was never used when it clearly is. What's going on?

A:

roslaunch is very strict about argument passing; you can't use an argument ($(arg foo)) without first declaring that the launch file takes an argument (<arg name="foo"/>).
in addition, passing arguments that are not expected, or failing to pass arguments that do not have a default is an error. (very similar to passing arguments when calling a function in C++ or python)
Therefore, your included launch file should be:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<launch>
    <arg name="foo"/> <!-- declare that this launch file requires an argument -->

    <param name="testing" value="$(arg foo)"/> <!-- use the argument -->
</launch>
