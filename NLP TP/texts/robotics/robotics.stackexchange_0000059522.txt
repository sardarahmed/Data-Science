Q:

Importerror : cannot import name

Hello,
I have been working on a node using a normal python IDE (spyder). Everything works fine, I can import all the needed python modules, some installed in /usr/local/lib and other in /usr/lib .
When I run my code with rosrun,
    from withings import WithingsAuth, WithingsApi
ImportError: cannot import name WithingsAuth

withings is a module that was installed under
Does somebody know how to fix this?

A:

Apparently, when a ROS package has the same name as a python module, there is a conflict. Changing my packages's name to withings_pkg solved the problem.

I put my python script in the src folder. While generating srv headers, the python srv are automatically put on the withings/src/withings folder so if I try doing  "from withing import" it will look on the local folder instead of the global libraries folder of python.
