Q:

Installing ROSAria in ROS Kinetic

Hi, I am trying to install the ROSAria package in my ROS Kinetic using the following tutorial. While building my package using catkin_make, I get the following error:
From what I understand, it is throwing an error because it cannot find -lAria. Please help.

A:

If you are running a 64-bit OS, make sure that you have the 64-bit ARIA library installed (libaria amd64 package).
(I just updated the tutorial to mention this more explicitly.)
