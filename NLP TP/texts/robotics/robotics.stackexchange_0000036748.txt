Q:

Data Recording to simple text file

I am a newbie here, just started working on ROS a week ago. Is there any way to record /save some data into a simple text file directly from the server or client?
I want to record the request received by the server, alternatively can anybody give example of this implemented by rosbag ?
The basic c++ methods of fstream and ofstream do not work in ROS.

A:

See this question for how to convert ROS messages to text file from the command line.

Here is a good introduction to the rosbag API.

fstream and ofstream do work in ROS. All ROS nodes are still C++ executables. I've used fstream and ofstream many times for simple logging in my ROS nodes.

ROS also logs all ROS print statements (ROS_INFO) to log files. Mine are located in ~/.ros/log. Files called {node}-{number}-stdout.log contain this information.

Depending on the task at hand, maybe the simplest solution is: rostopic echo /mytopic > textfile
