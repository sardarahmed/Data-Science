Q:

RVIZ start up error

This is a new Fuerte installation.
I am going through the PR2 Gazebo tutorials and while trying to visualize using RVIZ, I'm receiving this error:
/home//.rviz/display_config does not exist!
I can hit the "ok" button and go in to RVIZ, but I then receive errors stating that, for instance,
No transform from [bl_caster_rotation_link] to [/map]
A similar question was asked previously, but that question was closed stating that the issue was outdated... not sure what that means... any help would be appreciated.

A:

Ok. That's weird.
The error is still appearing at start up of rviz... but now it doesn't seem to be affecting anything.
I can use RVIZ now. All I did was ctrl-c out of the terminal that was running rviz, ctrl-c out of the PR2 simulation in Gazebo and then restart both.
Any ideas how to fix that display error?
