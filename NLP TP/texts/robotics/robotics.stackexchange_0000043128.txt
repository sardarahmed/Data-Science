Q:

Can't get color image with Camera1394

I can get nice grayscale image but not color image. Coriander only gives me mono format, but the camera is videre color camera. Even dynamic_reconfigure GUI can just be set to mono format.
Any ideas?
P.S. I have also checked videre_stereo_cam. But videre_stereo_cam can't support monocular camera. So I think camera1394 is the only choice.

What model camera are you using?

Model No. STH-DCSG-VAR, color Serial No. 3281

Have you been able to use the debayer option in Coriander? The camera might be outputting Bayer pixels.
Comment by LeonInTexas on 2012-08-23:
Thanks, Ryan. I tried Bayer option and it works!

A:

Have you ever tried the SVS library? I have the same model camera you do, except mounted as a stereo pair. I couldn't use videre_stereo_cam, so I started my own ROS node based on SVS to access images and other info from the camera. So far it's going well and I am able to publish images in ROS. If you have access to SVS (it was usually shipped with those cameras) then perhaps you could use some of my code.
