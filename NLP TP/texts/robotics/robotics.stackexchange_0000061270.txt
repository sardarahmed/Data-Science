A:

Could you check if there is urg_node in /opt/ros/hydro/share with a command roscd urg_node?
I guess that urg_node is not installed yet. At installing it, you might look at an error message.
If you look at error message like E: Could not open lock file ~ and E:Unable to lock directory ~, you should use sudo apt-get update. Please pay attention to input with sudo.

I just installed ros-hydro-urg-node without any issues.  You may need to run sudo apt-get update before installing.

I did sudo apt-get update! Today, I tried to install ros-hydro-urg-node with sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-urg-node again. I could do that. I guess that it's the problem of network environment in my case. At my apartment, I couldn't do,but at my lab I could do that.

I'm sorry, @mjcarroll. you might be right. I might have executed apt-get update withoutsudo.
