A:

Try sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-brown-perception.
gscam is part of the brown_perception stack.

Maybe try 'sudo apt-get update' first? I must say, I'm not an expert in these things but I got it installed in Groovy this way.

update I done. But still have this problem.  But on electric it installed ok. But on fuerte and groovy it produces the same error

Well, then the problem seems to be fuerte specific. I can't help you there, I'm afraid.

Did you install ROS using apt-get? What do you find if you do 'apt-cache search ros fuerte brown'?

Are you on Oneiric?  The brown_perception stack is not building for oneiric under fuerte: http://www.ros.org/debbuild/fuerte.html
