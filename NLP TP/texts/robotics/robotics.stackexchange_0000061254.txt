Q:

MoveIt self-filtering

Hello!I want to use MoveIt to do robot planning&executation, so I use a Kinect to sensor the surrounding world. The tf tree is divided into two parts, robot and the Kinect connecting by world link. I have added the self mask in the YAML file, but there're no function. There still exist point clouds on the robot links.
Thanks in advance for any suggestions and helps!

A:

As explained here, you must provide your sensor configuration. The relevant parameters for self-filtering are padding_offset and padding_scale.
