Q:

household_objects database

Hi, all,
I followed those steps(http://www.ros.org/wiki/sql_database/Tutorials/Installing%20a%20PostgreSQL%20Server) to link the database, but it failed. The errors are as below. The version of Ubuntu is 11.04. Thanks.
/usr/bin/pg_restore --host 10.217.132.113 --port 5432 --username willow --dbname \"household_objects-0.2\" --verbose "/home/kptee/database/household_objects-0.2.backup"
pg_restore: connecting to database for restore
pg_restore: [archiver (db)] connection to database ""household_objects-0.2"" failed: FATAL:  database ""household_objects-0.2"" does not exist
pg_restore: *** aborted because of error

Process returned exit code 1.

A:

Nutan,
I have never used pg_restore from the command line, so can offer no advice there. I always use the pgadmin GUI, it works great for me, you can get it via sudo apt-get install pgadmin3

if figured it out. In pgadmin, i use the name of "household_objects-0.2", but it could not contain the point.
