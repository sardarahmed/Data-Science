Q:

Gazebo: Turtlebot dont drive straight forward/ Odometry wheel velocity

Hello Guys,
I have encountered the problem that my Turtlebot didn't drive really straight and he also have some problems with the rotation. After a short period the robot loose the straight path and he drifts away more and more. I use the turtlebot from the turtlebot package in gazebo.
I create a Twist msgs:
self.cmd_vel = rospy.Publisher('cmd_vel_mux/input/navi', Twist, queue_size=10)
and then i set a linear speed:
move_cmd = Twist()
move_cmd.linear.x = 0.1
move_cmd.angular.z = 0
Is there a way to drive straight with no deviation?
How can i publish the wheel velocity of my turtlebot maybe the wheels have a different velocity?

A:

I would use a feedback loop of some sort. Measure real speed vs commanded speed possibly?
