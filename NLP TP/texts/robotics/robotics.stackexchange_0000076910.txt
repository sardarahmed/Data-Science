Q:

Can Turtlebot2 directly use Octomap to navigate?

I have two questions.
First, in octomap_server,the published topics octomap_binary and octomap_full are the topics for navigation which likes  like grid_map and proj_map.Yes or No. And why.
Secondly, can 2-DOF robot(Turtlebot2) directly use the map above. I means it doesn't need downprojected 2D occupancy map from the 3D map.

A:

Hi,
move_base uses a 2D occupancy grid map to plan trajectories. The octomap topics are 3D occupancy maps, which would be used by some other 3D planning approach (e.g., move_it). They are not the same as /grid_map or /proj_map from rtabmap_ros. You should use /map output topic of octomap_server with move_base. So for your second question, yes it needs the down projected 2D map.
cheers

Thank you very much.

Is this the standard way for robot navigation with 3d environment in ros till now? Or is their any other better method?
Comment by matlabbe on 2020-12-24:
As long as you can simplify navigation in 2D (even if the terrain is 3D), move_base seems the most ROS way to do that. For 3D trajectories (having to move in Z, e.g., quadcopter), then using OctoMap with OMPL/move_it can be another approach, though not sure if there is one most popular approach for the 3D case.
