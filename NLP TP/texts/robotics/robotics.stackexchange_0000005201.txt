Q:

How can I power a wheel but let it spin freely when not under power?

How can I power a wheel but let it spin freely when not under power?
I saw the question How can I modify a low cost hobby servo to run 'freely'? but I'm more interested in knowing if there is some sort of gearbox that disengages ( moves to 'neutral' ) when no torque is being applied to it.
Two ideas that come to mind are:

A drive gear on a spring loaded arm with a nominal amount of resistance before engaging. Perhaps when under power it would first use power to move in one direction, then it would engage with another gear, but without power the spring would return it to a non-engaged position
A centrifugal clutch - although I'd like something that works at low RPMs as well

The idea is to create a small bot that can move up and down a track, but if someone interacts with it when not under power it will just roll and won't damage the gearbox.

A:

You can use a magnetic clutch. When the strain on the horn passes a particular mark, it overpowers the pairs of magnets holding the clutch plates causing it to slip without damaging the gears. You can easily make them, and here is a company selling them http://robosavvy.com/store/dagu-magnetic-servo-clutches-for-miniature-servos.html
If you want to use an off the shelf one there are clutches designed for r/c cars that you maybe able to use. There is a description of one here http://nitrorc.com/articles/clutch.html and here is a company that sells them http://www.bukupower.com/clutch.aspx .These are designed for use with gas vehicles so some modification to your design maybe required. 
It may also not be too hard to make a gear train disengagement mechanism you can control using a servo.
