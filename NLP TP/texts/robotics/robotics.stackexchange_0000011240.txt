Q:

Integrating Forward Kinematics Map

Let the forward kinematics map be denoted by $\mathcal{F}$ such that
$\mathcal{F}: \theta \in \mathbb{R}^{n} \rightarrow g \in SE3$
Let the minimal representation of $g$ be given by $x \in \mathbb{R}^{6}$ using axis-angle or other forms of attitude parametrization. If we differentiate the forward kinematics map, we get
$\dot{x} = J_{a}\dot{\theta}$, where $J_{a}$ is the analytical Jacobian. This equation is commonly used in numerical inverse kinematics. However, can we do the reverse?
$x(t_{f})-x(t_0) = \int^{t_{f}}_{t_{0}}J_{a}\dot{\theta}dt$

A:

(EDITED TO CLARIFY PARENTHETICAL ABOUT CARTESIAN MANIPULATORS)
Your equation is true in general only for those manipulators in which $J_a$ is independent of $\theta$ (such as with Cartesian manipulators).  Otherwise, the expression is only true in the small (the region of $\theta$ close to $\theta_{t=0}$.
The equation is not true in general because elements of $J_a$ often contain functions of $\theta$.  I suppose if you could integrate the expression it would be true, but that just gets you back to  your original kinematics function.  The Jacobian represents a linearization of the kinematic mapping.  It is only a first-order approximation, so the expression does not hold globally. 
(EDIT BASED ON OP COMMENT)
If you do want to numerically integrate using your equation, you would need to modify (update) $J_a$ at each iteration based on the new values of $\theta$.  This would then be similar to the algorithm for velocity control, although I believe your timestep would be finer.
