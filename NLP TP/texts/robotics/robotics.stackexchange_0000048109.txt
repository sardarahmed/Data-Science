Q:

Problem with the controllers running PR2 on gazebo

Hi, i'm working on ros electric the PR2 tutorials and everything works OK, but the PR2 robot doesn't move i try with other examples like moving the shadow robot but i dont have succes.
When i did the rxgraph the topic of the controller  does not published anything in the gazebo.
I think that the problem is with gazebo because the controllers works really fine, i don't know if i need to install some stack or package for this or what happen..
Anyone has an idea??
Thank you!!

A:

I had similar problem. What I found is that you have to switch off the controller that is already assigned to joint you are trying to control. They don't explicitly tell you that in tutorial but it is a must.
