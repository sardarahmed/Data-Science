Q:

run Gazebo in ROS indigo in Virtualbox with libGl and openGl errors

Error [gazebo.cc:220] Waited 11 seconds for namespaces. Giving up;  
libGL error: pci id for fd 10: 80ee:beef, driver (null);  
OpenGL Warning: Failed to connect to host. Make sure 3D acceleration is enabled for this VM;  
libGL error: core dri or dri2 extension not found;  
libGL error: failed to load driver: vboxvideo;  
Error [Node.cc:90] No namespace found;  

Like I said, first run Gazebo, I see some error like that. any problem?
I just follow steps in http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_installing   which is   "Test that stand-alone Gazebo works"

Never tried on a virtual machine. I know that virtualbox has a lot of issues with OpenGL. Have you tried on a native lunix ?

Parallels 10 has no issues running gazebo 5 or higher. Also did you enable 3D acceleration in your VB settings?

A:

if you can run headless, try unsetting environment variable DISPLAY, and run gzserver only.
