Q:

Gazebo UI crashing on launch

Hi, I am new to the ROS community.  why is gazebo GUI crashing when you try simulation tutorial instruction 'roslaunch gazebo_worlds empty_world.launch' ?
The error that I get is
[gazebo-2] process has died [pid 32382, exit code -6].
log files: /home/username/.ros/log/ef5ae1c0-9d25-11e0-99ad-001d0900b3d5/gazebo-2*.log
Any idea ?
bdw ..I am using ubuntu 10.04
Thanks in advance.

Hi Dornhege, it has created just blank (o bytes) log files. So I am not sure why is it not logging anything.  One more thing that I observed it after I restart my machine, it works as a get around and I do not see a crash.

Did you look in the logfiles? What do they say?

A:

Please check per Bemfica's suggestion on graphics support first.
And list graphics card and driver are you using in this post.
You might want to try disabling Compiz to see if it helps.
Just double checking, but did you install diamondback version? if so, instead of roslaunching empty_world.launch, try
roslaunch gazebo_worlds debug.launch

upon gazebo crash, you should see gdb terminal in the console, type "bt"
(gdb) bt

and please post any outputs here.
thanks!
John

Thanks John.. using 'roslaunch gazebo_worlds debug.launch' seems to have solved this in diamondback.  Thanks again
