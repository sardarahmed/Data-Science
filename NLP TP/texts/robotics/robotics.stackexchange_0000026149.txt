Q:

Connection Manager is not working

I got this when I try to run gazebo:
Error [Server.cc:238] Could not open file[worlds/empty.world]

Error [ConnectionManager.cc:89] Connection Manager is not running

I have no idea what has happened because it was working for me some time.
I tried to reinstall gazebo and follow instructions that I found in Internet but none of them helped.

I have a same problem. I've just changed my system into 64 bit for Gazebo 1.5 and drcsim. But, I got this problem.

In my case, I have rebooted my machine and tried again. And it works now.

A:

This error:
Error [Server.cc:238] Could not open file[worlds/empty.world]

suggests that something is wrong with your environment setup.  Probably you didn't source /usr/share/drcsim/setup.sh before trying to launch the simulator.
