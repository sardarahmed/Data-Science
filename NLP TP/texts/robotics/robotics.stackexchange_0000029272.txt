Q:

Supporting ROS services in Ignition bridge

I could find that Ignition supports 'topic' and 'services' in the transport library, but Ignition bridge which is for ROS2 integration only supports 'topic'.
( https://discourse.ros.org/t/thoughts-on-ignition-gazebo-simulator-and-ros2-bridge/16477 )
Is there any way to use services in Ignition bridge? I'm afraid of delay time if I can use only 'topic' message.
