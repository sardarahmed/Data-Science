Q:

Getting Turtlebot Heading

We are trying to get the heading of our turtlebot. We can get the Quaternion data about the robot's pose but want to convert to a simple euler angle. Is there C++ ROS code that is already available that supports this?

A:

Yes, there is. Using the standard tf libraries:
tf:Quaternion q(x,y,z,w);
double yaw,pitch,roll;
btMatrix3x3(q).getEulerYPR(yaw,pitch,roll);

Yaw is what you want.
