Q:

Husky (Clearpath) Controller source code

I am looking to make some changes in the clearpath_base package for the Husky controller in ROS Hydro. However, I do not see the source files in the ROS directories. How do I get access to the source code? More specifically I am trying to add failsafe states in the controller so when it loses communications it does not continue executing the previous state. Please advise.
Thanks!

We're not always on these forums, but could you go into a little more detail on what you're looking for? What you're describing should be in the controls already. That is, unless you're talking about losing comms with a regular wireless gamepad, which a timeout won't solve.

Is this what you are looking for?

If you're looking for the actual firmware that runs on the motor controllers themselves, you would be best off contacting Clearpath directly - they are very helpful.
