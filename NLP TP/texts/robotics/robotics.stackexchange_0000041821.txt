Q:

Compiling PCL (PCL 1.5) in ROS fuerte

I've cloned the PCL sources (for PCL 1.5) from https://github.com/wg-debs/pcl in my ROS_WORKSPACE and renamed it as pcl.
I cannot compile pcl1.5 in my ROS_WORKSPACE. With "$ roscd pcl" my current directory changes to /opt/ros/fuerte/share/pcl which is not in my ROS_WORKSPACE.
I want to just make an executable file i.e. openni_viewer in my ROS_WORKSPACE/pcl/visualization/tools and execute that.
In the CMakeList.txt in the directory "pcl/visualization/tools" there is a instruction for that... PCL_ADD_EXECUTABLE(openni_viewer ${SUBSYS_NAME} openni_viewer.cpp) target_link_libraries(openni_viewer pcl_common pcl_io pcl_kdtree pcl_visualization)
But it is not compiled with $ rosmake pcl (I cannot get a binary executable file from pcl/viaualization/tools/openni_viewer.cpp)
Earler, I used to clone the stack "perception_pcl_addons" to my ROS_PACKAGE_PATH and just $ rosmake pcl_visualization (using previous versions of ROS) which then created a binary executable file openni_viewer.
Do you have any suggestions?
My confituration:
ROS fuerte,
Ubuntu 11.10
with best regards,
oli

did you get it working? I'm still looking for a solution to compile a ros supported pcl version.

A:

The PCL sources in https://github.com/wg-debs/pcl do not contain a ROS package. That is why roscd cannot find them and rosmake cannot make them.
Those sources were apparently used to create the ros-fuerte-pcl Debian package for the supported Ubuntu versions (Lucid, Oneiric, and Precise). To build them on another system, look inside the Debian rules to see how to build it.
Probably, it looks similar to a normal stand-alone PCL build, but with the USE_ROS parameter set. The following is my best guess:
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -DUSE_ROS=1
$ make 
$ sudo make install

Please let us know what actually works for you.
