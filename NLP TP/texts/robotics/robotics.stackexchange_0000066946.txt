Q:

Can I move built package frome one machine to other?

Hi! I have a problem with working in a virtual machine of ROS Electric, which is running on Ubuntu 10.04. It does not want to compile any nodes, written in C++ code. So I wonder if I can create the nodes in some other virtual machine where there are no problems in C++ compilation and then just move it back to Electric?

A:

I believe this would only work under the following circumstances (I did it once under Ubuntu 12.04 / Hydro):

The machine you are building on uses exactly the same operating system version, and has exactly the same set of libraries (+versions) installed, including the ROS version
Both machines use the same architecture (e.g. x86 or x64)

In those cases, you could just copy the binaries. However, in general I would recommend highly against it, and instead fix the original issue. Why can't you compile C++ code on that machine? Which error messages do you get?
