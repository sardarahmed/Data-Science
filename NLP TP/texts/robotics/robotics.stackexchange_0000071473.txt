Q:

ROS Programmable Drones/UAVs in the Market

Hello,
Does anyone have any recommendation for programmable drones (preferably ROS compatible) available in the market? For research purposes (mainly navigation problems) in a robotics lab?
Thanks,

A:

Using Pixahwak running APM or PX4 and onboard computer running Ubuntu and ROS. Mavros can be used for communicating between flight controller and onboard computer.

@crazymumu, Thanks. Is there any commercial drone in the market that has all these pieces? or do we need to build our own drone you suggest?

@crazymumu Can I use the same steps like for a Parrot AR-drone? http://ardrone-autonomy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
Or is there another way to build up a communication? I do have a quadcopter with pixhawk(APM) and onboard computer with Ubuntu/ROS.

You will at least need Parrot AR-Drone 1.0 or 2.0 quadrocopter if you want to use ardrone_autonomy. Based on what you have, Mavros is a better option.

@crazymumu Any info about the commercial drones using Pixahawk?

3DR Solo is based on pixhawk and has onboard computer. But i do not know it is hackable or not. At least they support DroneKit, so you may tie telemetry channel to network (and then run mavros on other machine).

@vooon can u please expand on your suggestion of using dronekit with mavros? Dronekit will connect to the solo and control it. What do you mean by tieing telemetry channel to network?

Can you please define us about the names of drone instead of flight controller/auto pilots?
