Q:

Mathematical modelling of system dynamic on matlab

I want to make a matlab (simulink) control model for the system in the image below.

The original pdf is only accessible if logged in Carleton's Learning Management System.
How do I get the dynamics of the system with given details in the image?

A:

the Simulink diagram is straightforward. It is a matter of connecting blocks. For the differential equations provided in your post, the simulink is 

For $u_1$ and $u_2$, I've chosen the unit step. You can change that of course. For $L$, I've set it to 0.5 since you didn't provide the actual value. The result of the position of the vehicle is shown below:
