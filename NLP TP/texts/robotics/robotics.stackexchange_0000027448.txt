Q:

GPS in gazebo simulation

Hello,
I got a robot model with an IMU that works and I want to fuse that with the ros package robot_localization. Now I want to add GPS data to fuse it with the IMU data. But I can't get it  to work. Currently I get this error:
_Sensor[gps] is attempting to load a plugin, but detected an incorrect plugin type. Plugin filename[libhector_gazebo_ros_gps.so] name[name_gps]
This is the code, the format is sdf and based on the tutorial:

    
  
    1  
    10.0  
    base_footprint  
    fix  
    fix_velocity  
    5.0 5.0 5.0  
    0.1 0.1 0.1  
    0 0 0  
    0.1 0.1 0.1

A:

According to the source code the hector gps plugin is a model plugin. This means the SDF plugin specification should be a child of <model>. Your code snippet has the plugin a child of <sensor>.
