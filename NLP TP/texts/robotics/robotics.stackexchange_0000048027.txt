Q:

Creating ROS Package with Hokuyo_node catkin

Hi i am new to ROS
In the tutorials, a package was created using the following command
roscreate-pkg beginner_tutorials std_msgs rospy roscpp
If i want my package to have a Hokuyo_node do i have to include all of the dependencies of the Hokuyo_node
Or Can I just do
roscreate-pkg example std_msgs rospy roscpp Hokuyo_node
will the dependencies of Hokuyo_node automatically be added?
I noticed when i miss-spelled Hokuyo_node roscreate-pkg did not give any errors...
Is possible to play with the Hokuyo node if you dont currently have a LIDAR?

A:

A package's dependencies should automatically be added when you specify it as a dependency.
The dependency is just a name as you might only create the dependency later. A warning might make sense here to avoid spelling mistakes. You could file a ticket to request that.
I'm not sure, what you want with a hokuyo_node without a Hokuyo. You can start it, but it should immediately give you an error that there is no sensor.
