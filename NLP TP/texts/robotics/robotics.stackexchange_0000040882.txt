Q:

Hokuyo Laser Installation ubuntu

Hello ,
I installed the ROS software on my Ubuntu system properly and ran most of the tutorials to check if I have installed correctly and it did.
I then tried to connect my hokuyo urg 04lx 2d sensor to the desktop and referred to the supported sensor page . However I am unable to download the hokuyo node repository. Can anyone tell me how to do it.
PS : I am a complete newbie to linux operating systems , so a detailed command line explanation will be appreciated.
Thanks
Ankit

A:

The hokuyo node is a complete black-box driver, it shoulder work if you've downloaded it properly from laser_drivers. If you're a 'complete newbie' it's fairly likely you did that wrong. Go to the terminal, copy this in line by line (if you followed setup instructions verbatim).
cd ~/ros_workspace
svn co https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/laser_drivers/trunk laser_driver
cd laser_driver
rosmake
roslaunch hokuyo_node hokuyo_test.launch

and it should launch and spurt out your info on topic /scan
