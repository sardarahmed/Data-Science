How can I fix "install joint_state_publisher" error (it is installed already)?

I am new to ROS and learning URDF from http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/Tutorials , I am at this http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/Tutorials/Building%20a%20Movable%20Robot%20Model%20with%20URDF tutorial and facing an error that says "you should install "joint_state_publisher" " which is installed

Please don't paraphrase or summarise errors.
Add a verbatim copy of the entire error message (including a few lines before and after it) to your question.
You can use the edit button/link for that.

A:

thanks, but I was making the mistake. joint_state_publisher_gui was not installed (I installed it now), and I was confusing it with joint_state_publisher.
thanks again.
