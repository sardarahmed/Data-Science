Q:

ROS Live Community Meeting February

I was participating in the meeting that was about Robot Description Formats.
I would like to ask the links that were shared in the chat. Because, I was using a phone and it is impossible to follow them.
Also, could you inform where I can listen the record again?! I have the language limitation of understanding the content in English completely.
Thank you for the meeting!

Thanks for listening!
We are preparing a post for a summary of the meeting, a link to the recording, and the notes (which will include links) to ROS Users and the ROS blog (http://www.ros.org/news/).
In the meantime, here is the link to the notes taken during the meeting:
