Since the openni.org website is no longer available, where can I download the nite2 needed for the openni2_tracker package?

A:

I'm not sure if you'll find what you're looking for here, but the openni website was migrated to http://www.openni.ru.
EDIT: I should have also provided a link to Occipital's "structure.io" site: http://structure.io/openni.
