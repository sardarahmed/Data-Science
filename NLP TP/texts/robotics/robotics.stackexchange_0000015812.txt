Q:

Find out Robot Coordinate using odometer data

I have a data set name Robot_odometery which consist of 3 field namely, Time(s),Forward velocity(m/s) and angular velocity(rad/s). I taken this dataset from http://asrl.utias.utoronto.ca/datasets/mrclam/index.html website. I want to calculate x,y,theta coordinate using this odometer dataset. As per the conversion from rectangular co-ordinate to polar ones I came to know two formula to calculate x and y. x=rcos(theta) and y=rsin(theta). I want to know that is that right approach to find out the Robot  coordinate (x,y). or there is any thing else that can be used to find Robot coordinate from odometer data.  

A:

Hence the orientation and position are the integrals of the angular ($\dot{\theta}$) and forward velocity ($v$) (in robot frame) respectively. So you have everything you need to calculate your pose. 
Now, the problem is that you misinterpret the tree states you have. $x$,$y$ represent the x and y position on a euclidean plane. $\theta$ is the heading of the robot and not the polar angle corresponding to polar coordinates. I.e. it is the angle the robot is turned around the z-axis at the position (x,y).
Therefore, if you integrate the angular velocity over time you get the orientation - i.e. theta - and with the heading you can integrate the forward velocity to determine the coordinates x and y. 
Something like that:
$$
\theta_k = \dot{\theta}_{k-1} \cdot \Delta t + \theta_{k-1} \\
x_k = v_k \cdot \Delta t \cdot cos(\theta_k) + x_{k-1} \\
y_k = v_k \cdot \Delta t \cdot sin(\theta_k) + y_{k-1} 
$$
