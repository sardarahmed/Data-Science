Q:

Is there a technical description of nav2d packages?

Hi
I'm studyng on a project that is related to nav2d tutorials, and I want to understand the code for navigator.cpp (RobotNavigator.cpp) and LocalizerNode (selfLocalizer).
I can see the node connection to each other in rqt graph but is there a book, link that describe the codes in Block Diagram or Flow Chart how these two are designed theoretically ?

A:

The LocalizerNode is just a wrapper around the particle filter used in amcl. You can check the documentation there, and there is also a lot of literature on localization methods, likely the best being Probabilistic Robotics.
To understand how the rest of nav2d works, please refer to the Tutorials and the API-Documentation.
