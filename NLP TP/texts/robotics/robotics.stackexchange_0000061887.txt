Q:

How to setup Xtion Pro Live Ubuntu 14.04 openNI(1/2)?

What is the right way to setup Xtion Pro Live with Ubuntu 14.04? (later on I wanrt to use it with ROS)
All How-To's found in internet refer to http://openni.org which is down.
The new site for openNI2 is http://structure.io/openni but the information provieded there does not help me.
I tried many things but seems to be that I'm to stupid to get it to work.
What I'm doing wrong, what should I do?
What do I need? openNI1 or openNI2?
Do I need to install with apt-get or build from source.
Do I need to install this sensor driver: https://github.com/PrimeSense/Sensor (building fails for some reason).
I'm totally desperate and confused due to the both version 1 and 2 from openNI.
// Here is my connected sensor
pat@hostx:~/Sensor$ lsusb | grep ASUS
Bus 002 Device 004: ID 1d27:0601 ASUS
// Here is the sample I used
pat@hostx:~/OpenNI-Linux-x64-2.2/Samples/Bin$ ./SimpleRead
Couldn't open device
DeviceOpen using default: no devices found

A:

Xtion 0601 runs using openni2, and 0600 runs using openni. If you want to use the former with ROS, let the openni2_launch wrapper run the driver and setup all the topics for you. It will also install all the correct dependencies:
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-openni2-launch
If you're looking for Openni2 specific documentation, it's now hosted by Occipital (http://structure.io/openni).

THX sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-openni2-launch solved the issue for ID 1d27:0601. Then afterwards roslaunch openni2_launch openni2.launch

I'm trying to set up an rgb stream to my web browser using mjpeg_server and openni2 with Asus Xtion Pro Live. I ran roslaunch openni2_launch openni2.launch,rosrun mjpeg_server mjpeg_server, but I can't see anything on my web browser when I type in the url http://myurl.com:port/image_topic. Help!

Please open a new question instead of doing this. Include any error/debug output, your distro and hardware setup.

My 0600 xtion only works with openni2, but not with openni
