Q:

"Recursive Print Statement" with Nodelets

I have recently converted a few of my nodes to nodelets to take advantage of zero-copy message passing. Even though I have converted all of the standard ROS logging macros (e.g. ROS_ERROR()) to the nodelet-aware equivalents (e.g. NODELET_ERROR()), I get the following warning printed to my terminal:

Warning: recursive print statement has occurred.  Throwing out recursive print.

After this message prints it appears that the logging macros cease to function. Has anyone else encountered this message when using nodelets? How can I fix it?

A:

There are open tickets on this issue:

ros-pkg 4854
ros-pkg 4855

The first ticket includes some suggested workarounds.  My understanding is that this problem still exists and needs to be fixed.

Thanks for the link. Switching from using standalone nodelets to using a manager fixed the problem.
