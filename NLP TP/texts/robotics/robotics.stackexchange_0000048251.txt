Q:

RGBDSLAM Headless, Error: Input point cloud has no data!

System description: Ubuntu 11.10, 64-bit, ROS Fuerte, RGBDSLAM installed/compiled, openni_camera/openni_launch installed
My goal right now is to generate a point cloud via a robot, running RGBDSLAM in headless mode, so that I can offload the *.pcd files to a remote server for additional CV processing.
I am able to run RGBDSLAM and initialise/start/pause the capture process, using the commands described here:

ros.org/wiki/rgbdslam#USAGE_without_GUI

In fact, my problem is identical to the one described in the following thread:

answers.ros.org/question/12886/problem-capturing-rgbdslam-pointcloud-data-in-headless-mode/

When I finally attempt to save the point cloud that I thought I was capturing, I receive the following output:

[ INFO] [1360639708.445177201]: Pause toggled to: false

I started this thread because I am still experiencing this issue even after I hardcode the store_pointclouds directive to true in my rgbdslam/launch/headless.launch file (answer #1) and make sure that the openni driver is running before I engage RGBDSLAM-headless (answer #2) ... and because I'm unable to comment on that other thread right now..
I have also tried adapting the published camera data topics in my openni launch file and the headless.launch file, as suggested here

answers.ros.org/question/31690/rgbdslam-gui-not-getting-data-from-kinect/

And I successfully enable default registration of depth and color, via dynamic_reconfigure, as suggested here:

answers.ros.org/question/11939/activating-openni-depth-registration-by-default/

Regardless of what I try, however, I am still unable to save point clouds. If anyone has any suggestions, I'd love to hear them!

A:

I'm going to investigate this issue when I have a bit more time, but I have since mirrored the rgbdslam framework on two other systems, without issue. Thus, it appears to be a driver issue on the original system (Foxconn D270S mini-atx, with a fresh install of Ubuntu 11.10)
