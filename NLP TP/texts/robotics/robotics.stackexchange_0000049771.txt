Q:

rqt_plot not plotting data

Beginner Level Tutorial, 6. Understanding ROS Topics.
Examples work as expected until I get to 1.5 Using rqt-plot.
The graph shows up but I can't get data to plot (blank graph).
Tried all previous steps 4 times but still no plot with x:y or theta.
No errors are shown.
Reload doesn't help.
I'm using fuerte with ubuntu.
What can I try?
Thanks.

I have this issue as well, using groovy in Ubuntu. Changing the topic name in the rqt_plot GUI doesn't change the graph, it stays blank.

A:

Make sure you running turtlesim_node running, in order for necessary topics (/turtle1/pose/ in this case) to be published.
Btw however, I haven't been able either to specify topic x:y as an argument from commandline. You can work it around by giving the topic name on GUI's designated field.
Using ros-fuerte-rqt amd64 0.1.6-s1360620793~precise.

I had the same problem and was not able to specify a topic from command line. Shouldn't this be changed in the tutorial?

I opened an enhancement request. If you/someone could volunteer to modify the wiki I would appreciate it (right now I have no time to work on that).

I edited the wiki to reflect the actual use of the tool.

@Michele Palmia great!

In groovy it works perfectly well to plot a pose with "rosrun rqt_plot rqt_plot /uav/0/pose/pose/position/x:y:z".  So what exactly is not working?

@TommyP what does this command return dpkg -p ros-groovy-rqt-plot?

@TommyP make sure the name of the topic is exactly the full name that's published. In your case do you see /uav/0/pose/pose/position is published (check by rostopic list)?

I have the same problem. The plot window pops-up but no plot. My turtle keeps turning around... it is about to pass out, LOL I'm using the hydro version and unfortunately I couldn't figure out what the answer says. Please help!!
