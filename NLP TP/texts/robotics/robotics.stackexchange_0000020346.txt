Q:

Free 2 and 3d simulators

What physics simulators exist which are open source/free? AI Gym uses a proprietary for-cost physics engine making it nonviable. 

A:

As for as I am understanding your question, you are asking about open source physics engines for simulation, So here's a short list: 
1. Box2D,
2. Bullet Physics,
3. Chipmunk,
4. Chrono::Engine,
5. DynaMo,
6. Moby (Physsim),
7. Newton Game Dynamics,
8. Open Dynamics Engine,
9. Open Physics Abstraction Layer,
10. OpenTissue.
