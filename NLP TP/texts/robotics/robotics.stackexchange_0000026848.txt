Q:

Why Inertias are represented as parallelepiped in GAZEBO 2.1.0

As title, what is the meaning of that parallelepipeds? Should not they be allipsoid?

A:

The inertia visualization in Gazebo 2.1 shows the dimensions of a box of uniform density with equivalent mass and moment of inertia values (though off-axis terms are not yet considered). It could also be shown as an ellipsoid; we implemented the visualization as a box, since it was simpler.
For reference:
gazebo pull request 745, when the feature was implemented.
gazebo issue 203, which was the feature request for inertia visualization.
gazebo issue 880, which is an outstanding issue to consider off-diagonal terms in the inertia matrix during visualization.
We should add some of this information to the wiki. Thanks for asking.
