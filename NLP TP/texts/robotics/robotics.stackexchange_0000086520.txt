A:

ROS and tensorflow are just coupled over the API.
You can implement something with ROS and tensorflow if you want.
As tensorflow as well as ROS contain APIs for C++ and Python, you should be able to implement something within ROS which uses tensorflow with GPU Support.

There's already quite some activity around ROS + Tensorflow. Perhaps the OP could start there? See: google.com/search?q=ros+tensorflow.
