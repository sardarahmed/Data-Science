Q:

Skip Master Chooser

I am developing an android app with rosjava, and I am setting the Master URI programatically. Therefore, the Master Chooser screen does nothing for me. Is there a way I can skip it totally?

Thanks to Kazuto for the lead, but there are a few issues with his answer. I was able to solve them with the included code. First, I changed startMasterChooser in RosActivity.java to public, and then pasted this code into my activity:
@Override
  public void startMasterChooser() {
    
    SharedPreferences prefs = PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(getBaseContext());
    String masterURI = prefs.getString("masterURI", "http://192.168.1.113:11311");
    
    Intent data = new Intent();
    data.putExtra("ROS_MASTER_URI", masterURI);
    onActivityResult(0, RESULT_OK, data);
    
  }

Alternatively, you can just hardcode the masterURI...I chose to have it as a preference. Hopefully changing the RosActivity code doesn't have any effect on future work.

I think this is better solution because it can work well without adding a new global variable.
