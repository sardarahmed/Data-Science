Q:

How to read positions from tf::TransformBroadcaster

This may be a bit of a dumb question, but how do you read poses from tf::TransformBroadcaster?
The wiki, http://wiki.ros.org/tf/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20tf%20broadcaster%20%28C%2B%2B%29, explains how to send poses using it, but now how to read poses (if that is something you do).
If you are not supposed to read poses from tf::TransformBroadcaster, then what exactly is the purpose of it?
When i say "read" from a tf::TransformBroadcaster, i mean to define a callback for a topic like normal

A:

You do not read from a Broadcaster as it is (as the name suggest) only broadcasting transformations. You can use a Listener to get transformations: http://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20tf2%20listener%20%28Python%29
