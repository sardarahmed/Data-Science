Q:

How to change the directory for rostest log files?

Hi everyone,
my question is if it is possible to change the directory
where rostest saves the test results and if so how it is
done. The intention behind this is that I want an automated
testing system embedded into jenkins. Right now, rostest
saves to a hidden directory in my home directory but as
jenkins is an online tool and my project is distributed
I want the results to be saved on my server.
Some additional information:
I have ros fuerte running on my PC (and on the
server too, but I'm not sure since I am not
the owner...).
Thanks in advance!

A:

There are several environment variables available in particular ROS_TEST_RESULTS_DIR looks like it's what you want.
