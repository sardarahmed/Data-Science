Q:

RGBDSLAM Frequency

Hi,
I am using the Bumblebee to perform visual Slam just by remapping the RGBD SLAM package to take data from the stereo camera instead of the Kinect. The results that i got are not as good as the ones that i have with the Kinect. When i come back to a region that i already scanned, the superposition of the pointclouds is not perfect. I am acquiring data at 5Hz from the Bumblebee. Can this be a problem of Frequency ? What is the optimal frequency to work with the RGBDSLAM package ? is it 30 fps ?

Thank you

A:

I have seen your video, maybe your Bumblebee have not been calibrated correctly, because your depth image was incorrect, please calibrate your sensor then run RGBDSLAM
