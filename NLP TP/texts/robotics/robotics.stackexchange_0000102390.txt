Q:

Gazebo for testing offline with the new ABB Robot Driver

Since the new ABB robot driver requires the RWS/EGM connection to be up between the robot and the PC, I'm not sure how can I test some motion controllers offline.
Is there a "ready to use" implementation with the new driver?
Otherwise can you please tell me how can I test my motion controllers with Gazebo before testing them on the real robot? thanks in advance.

A:

The best way to test -- ie: as close to the real robot + controller as possible -- would be to setup a cell in RobotStudio.
Note that Gazebo does not "use" nor is compatible with any real driver, as there is no real hardware for the driver to connect to or control.
