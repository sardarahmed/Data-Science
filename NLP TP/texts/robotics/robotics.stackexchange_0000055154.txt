Q:

How to animate a robot like a character in a 3D animation movie?

Hi.
I would like to handle animation sequences for a robot. Is there a way to manage this using a ROS package?
Here are the features that I would expect from such a package:

manage a sequence "data container" for sequences manipulation
read this container to activate the robot joints
view/edit this container
generate containers from recordings
generate containers with tools similar to a 3D graphics animation software (like Blender or Maya), using keyframes or IK

I have found this one, which looks in line with my requirement, but unfortunately for the PR2 only: http://wiki.ros.org/puppet
Bags could be also a part of the solution (data container management): http://wiki.ros.org/rosbag
Any feedback appreciated, could it be a similar requirement, documentations, contact, etc.

If you use Maya, make sure to check out this open source plugin:

This is a nice plugin, but the OP specifically asked for a ROS package to do this. Your suggestion is Maya only.
