Q:

move_base tuning

Whats are the variables that go into determining what cmd_vel move_base will output. I have a robot thats capable of 4m/s but during autonomous navigation the maximum that it ever chooses to go is 0.75m/s.
Here is my current understanding.
min_vel_x and max_vel_x bound the possible cmd_vel that move_base will output
I also read somewhere that gdist will also affect cmd_vel but in testing I have tweaked this value a lot using rqt_reconfigure and it doesn't show a noticeable difference.
Are there any other parameters that I can tweek in order to make my robot move closer to its full speed (just talking about x direction)?

A:

Try to increase the vx_samples and maybe also the sim_time. You are only using 3 samples for linear velocity, which may be the cause of your reduced speed.
Bear in mind that increasing this values will also increase the load on your CPU.
