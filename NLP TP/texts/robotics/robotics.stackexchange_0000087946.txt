Q:

Serial Connection to Hokuyo from Master

Hi,
I am currently getting the error:
[ERROR] [1531729856.715593296]: Error connecting to Hokuyo: Could not open serial Hokuyo:
/dev/ttyACM0 @ 115200
could not open serial device.

Initially, after encountering this problem, I was able to resolve it by adding myself to the dialout list as suggested:
https://answers.ros.org/question/286646/error-connecting-to-hokuyo-could-not-open-serial-hokuyo/
I was able to view the data from the Hokuyo after doing this.
I am now trying to access the Hokuyo from a different machine.  On the drone (where the Hokuyo is connected), I changed ROS_MASTER_URI and ROS_IP to match the PC.  On the PC, I then ran:
$ roscore
$ ssh drone-user@drone-IP

I am able to run '$ rostopic list' correctly.
However, after typing '$ rosrun urg_node urg_node', I receive the error mentioned above.
Any help is greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Justin

A:

I have managed to fix the error, it was caused by a large discrepancy in time between the PC and the drone.
Connecting both devices to the internet and synchronizing their times was enough to resolve the issue.
Initially, I tried using the 'chrony' package for Ubuntu but I was unable to synchronize the times using this.
Any suggestions on how to get the drone to synchronize its time to match the PC's would be greatly appreciated!
