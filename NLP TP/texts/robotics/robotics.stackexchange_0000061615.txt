Q:

Can I remove console_bridge dependency in class_loader when installing from source?

I am trying to install the indigo release "robot" set of packages on armhf from source.
For the class_loader package, the changelog states:

0.2.0 (2013-03-13)

use find_package for Poco/dl instead to make it work on other platforms
update Poco cmake file to include libdl on non-windows systems
No longer CATKIN_DEPEND on console_bridge

However the packages CMakeLists.txt still contains (on line 9)
find package(console_bridge REQUIRED)
Am I safe in removing the requirement?
Thanks in advance

A:

This is probably a bad idea. Even if class_loader isn't exporting the dependency on console_bridge, it's probably still depending on it internally.
