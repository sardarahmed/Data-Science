Q:

Unable to integrate with Qt

I am trying to implement Grid based FAST SLAM in ROS. I have taken the source code from http://openslam.org/gridslam.html .
I have made a catkin package and put all the source code in src folder.
Now, I am trying to build that package using
$catkin_make
It is giving me the error:
qapplication.h No such file or directory.
I have qt4 installed already and have qapplication.h file at /usr/include/qt4/Qt
I have tried using .pro file and qmake but still its giving me the error.
what should I do please help...

A:

write the following lines in your Cmake
find_package(Qt4 COMPONENTS QtCore QtGui)
INCLUDE(${QT_USE_FILE})
ADD_DEFINITIONS(${QT_DEFINITIONS})
rosbuild_add_executable(qt_test src/qt_test.cpp)
target_link_libraries(qt_test ${QT_LIBRARIES})

also please see this question

but instead of
rosbuild_add_executable(qt_test src/qt_test.cpp)
add_executable(qt_test src/qt_test.cpp)  worked for me..
Thanx :)

rosbuild_add_executable for rosbuild system and add_executable for catkin. I made mistake that I thought you worked with rosbuild system...
