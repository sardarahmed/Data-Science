Q:

unable to build qt gui packadges: catkin_make must be invoked in the root of workspace

Hi all,
Newbie to ROS, I have downloaded "qt_gui_core" under my "ros_ws" (/ros_ws/qt_gui_core/qt_gui_core) and complied with cmake ./CMakeLists.txt successfully. When I try to run catkin_make to build I get the error message:
The specified base path "/ros_ws/qt_gui_core/qt_gui_core" contains a package but "catkin_make" must be invoked in the root of workspace.
What am I doing wrong? How is one supposed to compile these packages without a catkin_ws and under ros_ws? also, qt_gui_core contains many subdirectories (qt_dotgraph, qt_gui_cpp...) am I correct by assuming the get built if I successfully build qt_gui_core/qt_gui_core?
Thank you very much

A:

Check out the tutorials on how to create a proper workspace for ROS/catkin.
Note that there is no difference between a ROS workspace and a catkin workspace.
The layout for a workspace is typically <PATH_TO_ROOT>/src/<PACKAGES>.
Choose <PATH_TO_ROOT> how you see fit, put all packages in the src folder below (in your case, the qt_gui_core package). You can have multiple packages in src.
Before you compile, go to the  src directory and call catkin_init_workspace, remember to call source /opt/ros/<DISTRO>/setup.bash (where <DISTRO> is indigo, jade, kinetic, whatever you have).
You don't need to call cmake manually, catkin_make will do that.
After you compiled, call source <PATH_TO_ROOT>/devel/setup.bash after compilation to actually use this workspace.

Before you compile, go to the src directory and call catkin_init_workspace [..]

That's not actually necessary: catkin_make (or catkin build) will do that automatically for you.

@gvdhoorn, really? Nice. Didn't know that ;-)
