Q:

Running catkin over fuerte

I am using Fuerte over Ubuntu 12.04. I have been building my packages with Rosbuild but now I have to use Catkin as some of the packages that I need are only released for Groovy.
Inside opt/ros/fuerte/share I have a folder named catkin. Do I need to build this package? I have tried but it doesn't have a Makefile.
As I didn't succeeded in building this package I got Catkin source code from GitHub (release for Fuerte) and tried to build it with Rosbuild but It doesn't have a Makefile either.
I have also followed several tutorials for using Catkin in Fuerte but it is not clear to me how to create a Catkin workspace and if this is the origin of my problems. I have tried to follow the instructions at: ros.org/wiki/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace, but I get an error when executing catkin_init_workspace. The system doesn't recognize the command.
Thank you very much in advance.

A:

I do not recommend using catkin in Fuerte. If you want/need to use catkin then you should update to Groovy. The reason the catkin_init_workspace command is not found is because the version in Fuerte does not have that command.
