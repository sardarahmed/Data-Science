Q:

Convert sensor_msgs::PointCloud2ConstPtr to pcl::PointCloud::Ptr

Hello
I'm using the SampleConsensusModelLine, which requires a pointcloud on the form of pcl::PointCloudpcl::PointXYZ::Ptr. However, the callback for the point cloud uses the form sensor_msgs::PointCloud2ConstPtr. How do I convert one to the other?

A:

To convert PCLPointCloud2::Ptr to PointCloudpcl::PointXYZ , you have to use the function "fromPCLPointCloud2".
For example :
pcl::PCLPointCloud2::Ptr cloud_filtered (new pcl::PCLPointCloud2 ());
pcl::PointCloud<pcl::PointXYZ>::Ptr cloud_filtered1 (new pcl::PointCloud<pcl::PointXYZ>()); 
    
pcl::fromPCLPointCloud2(*(cloud_filtered), *(cloud_filtered1));
