Q:

rospy.ServiceProxy( ) is not working

Hi there, I am incredibly new to ROS, and I am trying to learn by creating a program with turtlesim.  I am currently writing a node that will call turtlesim's Spawn service, and I am getting an AttributeError: 'module' has not attribute 'ServiceProxy'.
Here is the code I have written:
#!/usr/bin/env python

from turtlesim.srv import Spawn
import rospy

def spawn():
    spawn_turtle = rospy.SerivceProxy('spawn_turtle', Spawn)
    spawn_turtle(50,50,10,"turt")
    rospy.spin()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    spawn()

Thank you so much for your help!

A:

I think you're misspelled ServiceProxy

You're right...thank you so much for pointing that out.  I guess that's what happens when I am programming late at night.
