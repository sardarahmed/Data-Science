Q:

When is the case to use hard real time?

If I use an industrial robot with its hardware controller, should I install linux hard real-time like xenomai to use this kind of hardware controller?
If not, when is the case to use xenomai?

A:

In general, hard real-time OSes are used when there is a (usually periodic) task that is terminally critical, i.e. a process that needs to be run every few milliseconds, for example, and which, when queued, must be completed within a given time window to avoid a system failure. Note that "system failure" in this case doesn't have to mean that it will fry your CPU or break your robot, but instead that the resulting behaviour is considered a breach of the system's critical specifications, such as user safety or the like.
