Q:

Rviz Client md5sum Error

I am running Ubuntu 14.04 and indigo on my host computer. I want to visualize some rviz visualization markers on my remote laptop. However, I cannot install Ubuntu 14.04 on my laptop since some hardware problems (too new?kabylake). So I installed Ubuntu 16.04 and kinetic instead. However, when I subscribe to the same topic, I get this error:
[ERROR]: Client [/rviz_1493900002586455363] wants topic /prm_graph to have datatype/md5sum [visualization_msgs/Marker/4048c9de2a16f4ae8e0538085ebf1b97], but our version has [visualization_msgs/Marker/18326976df9d29249efc939e00342cde]. Dropping connection.

I checked that the message type both are "visualization_msgs/Marker". The only difference is those numbers and letters. Any idea why this is happening? I guess it is because the ROS version is different.

BTW, the Rviz is running ok on another client computer that is installed with Indigo.

Your two system use different versions of the visualization_msgs/Marker (It was changed between Indigo and Kinetic)

A:

I will pose the answer for myself. The reason is that the MD5Sum value for visualization markers is changed for different ROS distributions. Here are the steps to fix this problem (example: use Kinect rviz to display Indigo visualization markers)

Find the MD5Sum for Indigo. (Go to /opt/ros/indigo/include/visualization_msgs/Marker.h, find the MD5Sum    value, which is 18326976df9d29249efc939e00342cde)

Change MD5Sum for Kinect. (Go to /opt/ros/Kinect/include/visualization_msgs/Marker.h, replace the MD5Sum    with the value in Indigo distribution)

Download Kinetic Rviz source files to your workspace and compile it. (The newly compiled Rviz will use this modified Marker.h file, which has Indigo's MD5sum, to compile)

Now you should have a re-compiled Kinetic version of Rviz to visualize markers that are sent from Indigo.

Did you find a workaround for this?

Hi George, the revised answer is updated above.

This is really not a good idea, as your from-source RViz is now incompatible with all other 'normal' ROS installs. Also: editing files in /opt/ros/.. is not a good idea. For one thing, your changes will be overwritten next time ROS pkgs get updated.
