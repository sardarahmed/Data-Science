Q:

the argument scale of quoternion function "setRPY"

Hi
I want to use "setRPY"function and the arguments are the gyro sensor values.
I want to convert the angle to quotarnion by this function.
then , I have something I want to confirm.
Should I set the scale of the sensor value (angle) to [-2π , 2π]?
I don't know the scale of the function's argument .
please let me know the correct scale of the function.
My code is the following :
gyro_msg.vector.x = data.gxPI()/180;
gyro_msg.vector.y = data.gyPI()/180;
gyro_msg.vector.z = data.gz*PI()/180;
gyro_pub.publish(gyro_msg);
sensor_msgs::Imu imu_msg;
dt = (float) ( endTime - startTime ) * 0.000001; // μsec→sec
// integration
data.theta += dt * data.gz*PI()/180;
// range constraint
if(data.theta>=2PI()) data.theta -=2PI();
else if(data.theta<=2PI()) data.theta +=2PI();
imu_msg.header.stamp = ros::Time::now();
imu_msg.header.frame_id = "/base_link";
tf::Quaternion q;
q.setRPY(0.0, 0.0, data.theta);
thank you

A:

According to my experience, I think the Roll Pitch Yaw range is (-π , π].
