Q:

NavStack Robot Moves Backwards

Hi Folks,
When my robot is trying to avoid an obstacle, it tends to move backwards. How can I disable that option so that the robot only have forward velocity, and rotational velocity?
Thanks

What local planner are you using?

A:

I need need to disable the escape velocity, which causes the robot to move backwards when stuck.
Just went inside:
base_local_planner_params.yaml

and added this parameter:
escape_vel: 0.0
