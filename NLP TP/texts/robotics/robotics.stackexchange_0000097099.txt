Q:

how to map point cloud Data comming from serial port

I have a serial data frame, it contains some points defined at (X,Y,Z) and another information, i have received this frame in ROS, and extracted the data related to point cloud, now how can i visualize these points in RVIZ, and if i want to implement slam later what is the data type involved to encapsulate these points

A:

Your best bet is to populate a sensor_msgs/PointCloud2 and publish it. A topic with this message type can natively be visualized in Rviz. If you're looking for an example of populating this type of message, check out any of the lidar drivers such as the Velodyne driver for melodic.

thank you, what is the purpose of converting from sensor_msgs/PointCloud2 to PCL datatypes

Purely for convenience of editing the data. PCL is not a requirement (see the ros2 version for an example without PCL).
