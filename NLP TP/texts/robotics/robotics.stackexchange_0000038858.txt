Q:

ERROR: Unable to communicate with master!

Hello.
I'm Korean student. So i cannot speak English very well.
Thank you for your consideration.
I am setting Turtlebot on my netbook and my notebook (Network Connection)
http://www.ros.org/wiki/Robots/TurtleBot/Network%20Setup
My netbook is TurtleBot laptop.
My notebook is Workstation.
I am able to ping each other.
One is 192.168.0.67 and another is 192.168.0.63
and i can see "echo $ROS_MASTER_URI" and "echo $ROS_HOSTNAME". "turtlebot start/running, process 16951" also.
but when i enter the command "rostopic list", i see "ERROR: Unable to communicate with master!"
I don't know why..
because when i set "Network Setup" first time, there work correctly..
but after the reboot, i cannot do anything..
Please help me ~.~

could you post the output of "echo $ROS_MASTER_URI" and "echo $ROS_HOSTNAME"? Many times when I get this error, it's because of settings error

my notebook..   ROS_MASTER_URI == http://192.168.0.67:11311   and ROS_HOSTNAME == 192.168.0.63
and my netbook.. ROS_MASTER_URI == http://192.168.0.67:11311  and ROS_HOSTNAME == 192.168.0.67

IP of my notebook is 192.168.0.64  (turtlebot-workspace)
IP of my netbook is 192.168.0.67   (turtlebot-robot)

i think "roscore" is right..
but.. i cannot start turtlebot service..
when i enter the command "sudo service turtlebot start", i can see the message "rustlebot start/running, process 3326"
and i enter the command "rostopic list", i can see the message only "/rosout" and "/rosout_agg"
i don't know..

not sure if it's a typo, but in your comments, your turtlebot-workspace IP 192.168.0.64 does not match the notebook's ROS_HOSTNAME 192.168.0.63 so that could be why it's not working correctly

oh sorry. i was miss typing.. t.t

A:

I am not familiar with the turtlebot setup, but this typically means that you do not have a roscore running. Open a new shell, type "roscore" and try again...
