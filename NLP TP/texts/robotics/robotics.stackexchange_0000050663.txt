Q:

publishing negative values from command line

Hi!
Is it possible to publish negative values via rostopic pub ?
I tried
rostopic pub -1 /my_point geometry_msgs/Point 1 2 3

with no problem, but when I try
rostopic pub -1 /my_point geometry_msgs/Point 1 -2 3

it says an error:
Usage: rostopic pub /topic type [args...]

rostopic: error: no such option: -2

Is it anyhow possible to publish negative values from terminal?

A:

See also the comment here on using negative numbers with ROS command-line tools.  As described in the link, you can use the -- flag to tell the parser to stop looking for additional command-line options.
So, the following should also work:
rostopic pub -1 /my_point geometry_msgs/Point -- 1 -2 3
