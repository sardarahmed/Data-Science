Q:

Is the hector_gazebo_plugins plugin built-in or do I build it myself?

I'm pretty new to Gazebo, so I apologize.  I'm confused about Gazebo plugins.  I have used the skid steer plugin and the differential drive plugins that were in a Gazebo tutorial and they both worked fine in my robot models.  So I know how to use plugins, at least a little.
Now I'm starting to add sensors to my robot models and I can't figure out how to use the hector_gazebo_plugins GazeboRosSonar plugin.
http://wiki.ros.org/hector_gazebo_plugins
Is this something that is already built into Gazebo or ROS or is this something that I need to download and build on my machine?  If the latter, then where are the download and install instructions?  The above URL appears to just be API documentation.
I'm using ROS Hydro and Gazebo 1.9.

A:

You may as well install the compiled one with:
$ sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-hector-gazebo-plugins
What are you using for your robot model?  .urdf or .sdf? Assuming .urdf here you can find an usage example.
Hope this helps

Thanks.  I'm new enough that I sometimes forget to try the ros-[version]-[package name] naming convention.

It works!  Thanks!

I know this is a two year old question, but I am in the same boat. How did you make it work? I tried replacing the {name} with my link name and setting the visualization to true but there is no laser visualization in gazebo.
