Q:

Is there a published feature matrix for Gazebo?

While looking at "the competition", I noticed useful Feature_Matrix, and thought it might also be a good basis for metaphor to provide links to the functionality (and tutorials) for key Gazebo components.

A:

Good idea. We have a more high-level feature matrix here, but without links to tutorials.
