Q:

problem in using rosserial/arduino in groovy

Hello every one.
I want to use Arduino uno to just send a helloworld to ros. I am using groovy.
from the and follow the instruction here that is in rosserial tutorials
I followed ROSBUILD, after "rosmake rosserial_arduino" I can not run "roscd rosserial_arduino/libraries" because this location does not exist. after that I found the rosserial_arduino in /opt/ros/groovy/share/ and in this folder I found ros_lib. So I added ros_lib to my arduino IDE libraries.
I want to write codes in my IDE, just after adding #include<ros.h> I see this error:
In file included from sketch_sep05a.ino:1:
/home/mohammad/Desktop/Arduino/arduino-1.5.3/libraries/ros_lib/ros.h:38:29: error: ros/node_handle.h: No such file or directory
In file included from sketch_sep05a.ino:1:
/home/mohammad/Desktop/Arduino/arduino-1.5.3/libraries/ros_lib/ros.h:49: error: expected initializer before ‘<’ token
I think that header files like ros.h have problems. what should I do?
What is the best way to use rosserial and rosserial_arduino in groovy?
thanks a lot!!!

A:

If you checked out the groovy-devel branch from the rosserial github project, then you need to build with catkin, not rosmake. You will also likely have to do the "install" step, because rosserial_arduino actually gets a number of it's roslib files from rosserial_client during the install step.
