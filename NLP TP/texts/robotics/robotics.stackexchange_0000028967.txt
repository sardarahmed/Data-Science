Q:

What ROS and ROS2 releases goes with Ignition releases

I was unable to find any information on compatibility of Ignition Gazebo with the different versions of ROS and ROS 2. I can see for example the Ignition Citadel runs on both Ubuntu Focal and Bionic. Is it then safe to assume ether of the ROS Melodic and Noetic and ROS2 Dashing and Foxy would work with it? What combination is intended?

A:

The branches being maintained on ros_ign can be compiled against multiple Ignition versions.
Right now, these are the versions being tested on CI for each branch:
melodic branch:

ROS

Melodic

Ignition

Blueprint
Citadel

dashing branch

ROS

Dashing

Ignition

Blueprint
Citadel

We're planning to add support for Noetic and Foxy shortly after they're released.
