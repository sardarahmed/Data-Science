Q:

Problems with openni_tracker launching

Hi,
I am trying to use openni_tracker. I have ros-fuerte-openni* installed. roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch is working properly and I can see the image in rviz. However, when I run rosrun openni_tracker openni_tracker, initially there was the following error.
Find user generator failed: This operation is invalid!

I googled for the solution to this problem and was instructed to install NITE-bin-dev-linux-64-v1.5.2.23. Now the error has change to the following.
Find user generator failed: Can't create any node of the requested type!

Any help?

A:

I see you posted new answers here and here.  Just FYI, that's really not how this site should work; the answers are really for answers, not new questions.
Based on all of your information I have several pieces of advice.  First, I already mentioned you should update NITE on one of your comments.  After seeing this question, I see you already did that.  On Fuerte and 12.04, I just tried openni_tracker with NITE versions 1.5.2.23 and 1.5.2.21 and it worked with both.  During my testing I noticed that if I run openni_tracker before starting up the Kinect/Asus with openni_launch, I get  the same error you are seeing.  So first hint, make sure the device is running and publishing point clouds before starting the tracker.
Second hint: based on the second comment I linked above, you are getting a bunch of ELFCLASS warnings in the output of niReg -l.  This sounds to me like you installed the x64 version of NITE, but you are on an x86 system.  Try installing NITE-Bin-Dev-Linux-x86-v1.5.2.23 instead.

Thank you sir. Your suggestion to install NITE for x86 worked. Sorry for posting on multiple questions, will be careful in future.
