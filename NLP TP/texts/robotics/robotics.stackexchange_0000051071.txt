Q:

How to display base_footprint outline in rviz?

I've defined a base_footprint tf frame: map --> odom --> base_footprint --> base_link -->> camera frames
A footprint is defined in costmap_common_params.yaml
My .urdf.xacro file is read and parsed correctly during rviz initialization.
(Is this where a base_footprint outline should be defined?)
How do I display the base_footprint outline in rviz?
Thanks!

A:

Robot footprint
It shows the footprint of the robot; in our case, the robot has a footprint, which
has a width of 0.4 meters and a height of 0.4 meters. Remember that this parameter
is configured in the  costmap_common_params file. This dimension is important
because the navigation stack will move the robot in a safe mode using the values
configured before.
