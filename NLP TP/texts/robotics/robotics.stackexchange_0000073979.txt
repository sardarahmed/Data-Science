Q:

can't find ros message API ducouments

hi, I currently can't find any API documents about ros messages like std_msgs, mavros_msgs...ect, including all member functions, class definitions or structures. It  suppose be there, but I can't google it anymore.
Is that because server problem or it will not be access any more.
Thx

I'm not having any trouble with the documentation at http://wiki.ros.org/std_msgs .Presumably you have a link to documentation that doesn't exist any more; perhaps if you provide a link to that documentation we can help figure out where it went.

Hi @ahendrix, what I mean is not the link you provided. The documentation here:https://mirror.umd.edu/roswiki/doc/diamondback/api/std_msgs/html/namespacestd__msgs.html, I can jut find in mirror.

A:

In short, you should not be referring to that documentation. It's generated based on the generated headers, and discards the message semantics.
The other reason why you can't find any documentation about member functions on the message types is because there are no public member functions; generated C++ types are only classes with public data members, also known as POD types (plain old data).
Instead, you should be referring to the msg API link on the std_msgs wiki page, or the documentation on the page itself. You can infer the generated C++ type name and field types directly from the message generation.
