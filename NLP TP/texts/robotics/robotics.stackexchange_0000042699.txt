Q:

2D pose estimate button problem

I'm trying to do the autonomous navigation tutorial I am having problem on "2D Pose Estimate" button in rviz  when i click on it and drag an arrow to set the initial location for turtlebot, the red particles dosen't appears and also location of robot dosen't changes.
fixed frame is set to /map
Target frame is fixed frame
Rviz output:

[ INFO] [1343324167.032855241]: Setting pose: -0.286 -0.421 -2.323 [frame=/map]

Anybody knows how to solve the problem?

A:

The reason you don't see particles stems from the fact that the particlecloud topic does not appear to be publishing...  Some things to try:
roslaunch turtlebot_navigation amcl_demo.launch map_file:=/tmp/my_map.yaml

If you followed the tutorials, you've already done that. Other things:
rostopic list

Edit your question and put the output of the above at the bottom. Also, check for errors in configuration. I'll be more useful after more output...
