Q:

Are service callbacks queued?

Dear all,
Reading the doc and tutorials I understand that when the topics are received (on the subscriber side) they are queued in a callback queue before being processed (on a call to spin(), spinOnce(), callAvailable(), callOne()...). Now what I did not get is weather the service callbacks (on the server side) were also queued in the same callback queue. Hence the question:
Are the service callbacks queued in the same callback queue than the topics or are they processed independently as soon as they are received (i.e. without waiting for a spin(), spinOnce(), callAvailable(), callOne()...))?
Thanks,
Antoine.

A:

By default, yes they are all queued on the node's callback queue.
