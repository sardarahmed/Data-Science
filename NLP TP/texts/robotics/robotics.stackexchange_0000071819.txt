Q:

Converting a basis to a quaternion python

Hello,
I have information in this format (what I assume to be a rotation matrix)
xBasis:(-0.923067, -0.221423, -0.314514) 
yBasis:(-0.380463, 0.645773, 0.661985)
zBasis:(-0.0565259, -0.730718, 0.680336)
origin:(0, 0, 0)
and I would like to convert it to a quaternion. Could you please advise me the best way to do so in Python?
Thanks in advance!

A:

Use quaternion_from_matrix method from transformations.py in tf package
from tf.transformations import quaternion_from_matrix

q = quaternion_from_matrix(tr_matrix)
