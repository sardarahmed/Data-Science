Q:

Using PointCloud in AMCL

Hi, I am using the AMCL filter from ROS packages and I have configured it following the instructions on the website.
I am wondering if it is possible to change the sensor input from the laser to a pointcloud without using any other package.
Thank you

I know you said "without using any other package" but the common way to acheive what you're asking about is to input your point cloud in the pointcloud_to_laserscan node, which will output a laser scan that you can feed into AMCL without problems.

I've tried it, but I am using ROS Hydro and I haven't been able to build that package and use it.

Oh I see. I think the best way to acheive your goal is to focus on using that package though rather than searching for an alternative.

pointcloud_to_laserscan was added to hydro and indigo very recently, so it hasn't gone through the process of being fully released yet (so you won't be able to grab it via apt-get). It had been replaced by depthimage_to_lasrscan in groovy, but clearly there's some use for it yet!

For now please build from source, and make sure to open an issue on github if you have any problems, since it underwent a bit of a rewrite. Check the launch files for usage examples.

thank you.
I am new in programming and I didn't know about the possibility of issuing in github.
