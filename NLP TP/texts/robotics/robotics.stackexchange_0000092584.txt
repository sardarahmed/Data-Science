A:

In ROS1 you could loop play using the -l command.
However, it appears that this has not been implemented yet in ROS2.
You can follow the development of rosbag for ROS2 here

I can't mark your answer as correct even though it is :) rosbag2 doesn't have capabilities yet to play the data in a loop.
