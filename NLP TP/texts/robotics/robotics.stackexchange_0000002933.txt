Q:

Does RoboRIO support Java 8?

My FRC team will recently upgrade from  CompactRIO  to RoboRIO.
CompactRIO only supports up to Java 1.4.
What version of Java does RoboRIO?

A:

Yes it supports Java 8 Embedded.
Which basically is Java 8 SE without any graphical library support (because the RoboRio is headless).
Beta teams using Java are currently using Java 8 Embedded for Arm as the JVM on the RoboRio, and Eclipse as the IDE with WPILib provided plugins for project development.
