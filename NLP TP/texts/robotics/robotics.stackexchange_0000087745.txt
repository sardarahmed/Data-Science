Q:

Trouble installing ros-indigo-ros-base in Ubuntu 16.04

I am trying to install ROS-Base in Ubuntu 16.04. Here are my steps:

sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'

sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-key 0xB01FA116

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-ros-base -y

I keep getting a E: Unable to locate package ros-indigo-ros-base error. Is indigo still available?

A:

Please check the install page carfefully: Indigo is not supported on Ubuntu 16.04:

ROS Indigo ONLY supports Saucy (13.10) and Trusty (14.04) for debian packages.
