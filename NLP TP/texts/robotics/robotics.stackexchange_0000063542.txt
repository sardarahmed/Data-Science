Q:

Task scheduler recommendation/advice

Hi all,
I am looking for some advise on choosing a way/tool to achieve high level control (or say tasks scheduling) with ros. I am naturally more inclined to using scripting (e.g. in python as naturally it integrates with ros) because I have been programming for years and I am convinced of the versatility of languages.
Though I was wondering whether there were other solutions that you would recommend based on experience (e.g. solutions that improve workflow, are more something-friendly... and do not limit the expressive power)
Thanks,
Antoine.

A:

Straight-forward scripting with actionlib interfaces works. If that is sufficient for your goals depends on the task at hand.
The standard ROS way is probably to use Smach, which builds on the concept of state machines
There is a task planning architecture developed by our group, although I consider that experimental. There might also be other solutions in ROS.

Hum, if Smach is as standard as I expect it to be that may well be a no brainer... Thanks ;)

Could actionlib be used also for different tasks such as navigation and manipulation? For example, patrolling around in a room and once you spot small objects on the ground, pick them up, place them on a table and continue patrolling. Can a behavior like this be implemented with actionlib?
