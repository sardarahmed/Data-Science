Q:

Multi exclude in rosbag record?

Hi.
When rosbag is used as follows
$ rosbag record -a -x "/usb_cam/(.*)"

how can I add more exclusion?
For example, I would like to exclude
/usb_cam/*

and
/usb_cam_repub/theora/*

It should be simple, but I'm not familiar with regex.

It's not clear to me what you want to achieve, but as I also encountered the problem (I want to record everything, except raw and compressed camera image topics), I posted a bug report: https://code.ros.org/trac/ros/ticket/4031

A:

Use the following:
rosbag record -a -O data.bag -x "/usb_cam/(.*)|/usb_cam_repub/theora/(.*)"
