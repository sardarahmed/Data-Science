Q:

ROS time across machines

When there are several machines involved, how are timestamps created? It looks like to me that they're being generated by each machine's individual time, so if one machine is out of sync with another than all the messages will be in the past or the future. Is this actually the case or am I missing something, and how do people deal with this limitation?

A:

You're correct, they just use the system's current time.  The typical way I've seen to synchronize time across computers is to use Chrony.  With Ubuntu, you should be able to just run apt-get install chrony.
Here are some resources I've found on a quick search:

The important information is that your ROS system computers are tightly coupled in time, but loosely tied to the outside world's time.
