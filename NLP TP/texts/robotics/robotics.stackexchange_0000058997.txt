Q:

Recompile turtlebot from source problem

Hi Everyone,
I need to implement a multi-turtlebot application with Hydro ROS so that I installed the turtlebot from source using the instructions below:

mkdir ~/turtlebot
cd ~/turtlebot
wstool init src https/raw.github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot/hydro/turtlebot.rosinstall -j8
source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash
rosdep install --from-paths src -i -y
catkin_make

I spawned two turtlebots but I have problems with the “odom” topic that doesn’t resolve correctly.  I am getting just one “/odom” topic instead of two like “robot1/odom” and “robot2/odom”
Since I have this problems, incorrect resolution of each robot prefix, I made some changes on the source file gazebo_ros_create.cpp  located at  HOME/turtlebot/src/turtlebot_create_desktop/create_gazebo_plugins/src
Then, I compiled the from ”/turtlebot”  “folder” using “catkin_make”  but I noticed that my changes didn’t take effect.
Am I doing something wrong?  Or Do I need to do something else to see the effect of my changes?
Please any help would be very much appreciated!! Thanks
