A:

You don't need to manually maintain the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
You can easily add repositories from multiple different sources (git, svn, local, rosinstall, ...)
Very easy setup of a new workspace from a larger projects rosinstall (in constrast to manually downloading/cloning/checking out of single code locations)
You can run VCS commands for multiple different repository sources (rosws update/rosws status) instead of doing that for each
You can have multiple workspaces for different projects, ros distros, etc. and switch between them easily

It's up to you, but recommended. I manage everything with rosws.
