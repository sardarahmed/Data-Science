Q:

How to add ROS icon/ flair to my profile or website?

In stack overflow, a user can add his/ her participation information in the profile. They call it stack overflow user flair (https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/60724/how-do-i-add-the-stack-overflow-profile-icon-to-my-blog), I was wondering whether ROS answers have anything similar?

A:

ROS Answers is an instance of AskBot. According to support user flair? it doesn't support what you're looking for.
