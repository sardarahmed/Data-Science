Q:

openni and ar bounding box doesn't work well together

Hi everyone,
I'm working with the RoboEarth package to model 3D Objects. The results were mediocre and because of that we tried to calibrate our kinect. (using this tutorial: http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_camera/calibration)
We found out that there is a second (seems to be the newer one) launch file for the openni (the old and original one: openni_camera openni_node.launch | the new one: openni_launch openni.launch) which is needed for the calibration.
But it seems that the ar-bounding-box package is not working with that file. Could this be true?
Furthermore we noticed that the ar_bounding_box is not working reliable with the old launch file (openni_camera) as well. Sometimes it takes 5-10 restarts to get it run. Do you have any idea to correct that?
Thank you for your help.
regards Ronny

A:

We just updated the roboearth packages so that you can use the launch files from the openni_launch package. Please update to the latest version and try again.
