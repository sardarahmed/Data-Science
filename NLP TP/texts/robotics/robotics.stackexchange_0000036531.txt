Q:

Omni-directional navigation

Hi all,
i am currently working with an omni-directional platform and try to get the navigation stack running. This already working but only in a differential drive manner. Is there any stack/repository which already implemented a omni-directional path planner/execution? I looked into the tum package, since rosie seems to move in some videos omni-directional.
Regards,
Frederik

Just to make sure: Is your local_base_planner (http://www.ros.org/wiki/base_local_planner ) configured with holonomic_robot set to true? Acording to the docs, thats what makes the planner issue strafing commands to the base. Otherwise it uses differential mode. Best regards, Ben

A:

As @Ben_s mentioned, the navigation stack supports holonomic (omni-direction) path planning. The pr2 has this ability. If you set the holonomic_robot parameter to true, move_base will generate plans that contain both x and y motion, and it will output a cmd_vel message with an x, y, and theta component, rather than just an x and theta. It's up to you to interpret this message appropriately for the drive train of your robot.
