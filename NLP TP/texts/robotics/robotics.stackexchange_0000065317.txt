Q:

Unable to cakin_make openni2_camera

Hi,
I am using Odroid XU3, with ubuntu 12.04(precise) and ROS(Hydro).
I've got OpenNI2 installed on my Home folder, and I can run openni2_example from odroid-development. But when I catkin_make, there is the error of [package 'libopenni2' not found] and [package 'openni2' not found]. Have you encountered this problem before? Can you suggest a solution for me to fix this problem?

A:

You'll need to isntall libopenni2 -- under ubuntu/debian you should be able to install the package libopenni2-dev if it is build for your platform, otherwise, you will need to build from source, I believe the hydro releases were built from: https://github.com/hcw70/OpenNI2

I tried to install libopenni2-dev but I got this
Package libopenni2-dev is not available, but is referred to by another package.
This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
is only available from another source
E: Package 'libopenni2-dev' has no installation candidate
