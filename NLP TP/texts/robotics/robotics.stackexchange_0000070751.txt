Q:

ROSARIA make error (jade)

I am trying to install Rosaria on a brand new ros-jade-full-desktop install.
I have followed the tutorial instructions but I am getting the following error when trying to 'catkin_make' with the rosaria source:

  Add the installation prefix of "rosaria" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "rosaria_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "rosaria" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.

I am running Ubuntu 14.04.3 with anaconda 3.5 build of python. Don't know what else could be relevant.
thanks in advance

A:

You seem to build only one package, rosaria_client, which has a dependency to rosaria.
You probably haven't put the client into the same ROS workspace, i.e. the same src folder, where you did the first build (see 1.4 of the tutorial).
Put the rosaria_client pkg next to the rosaria pkg, and it should work
