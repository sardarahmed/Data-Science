Q:

Best way to check if ROS is running

I am writing a script, which relies on ROS currently running. I would like to check if ROS is currently running on the script's machine. What's the best way to do this?
A couple ways I am considering are pinging Master URI and checking the processes. However, I'm asking to see if there's a better way. Perhaps an environment variable is set.

A:

If you want to do it in a script, run a regex over the output of "rostopic list" for "/rosout."  If its not in the output then the roscore is not running.

Thanks @Nash. rostopic list  does print out an error if roscore is not running, which I can use to check if ROS is running. However, it seems a bit hackish still.

@Nash thx this works with rostopic python API. My example can be seen here.
