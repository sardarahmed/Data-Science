A:

Once you launch the driver, many topics will be published (point clouds, depth maps, RGB images, etc.). To work with these topics in Python, you simply need to subscribe to the correct topic and perform the desired processing in the callback. Check out the rospy tutorials for instructions on how to create Subscribers: http://wiki.ros.org/rospy/Tutorials
One note: the Kinect produces a lot of data. You may find it difficult to write Python code that can keep up (especially if you are working with the point clouds). In my experience, most people that use the Kinect do most of their processing in C++, and they usually use PCL.
