Q:

Doubt about ultrasonic and IR sensors

Hi all,
I've seen in the SDF format, that there are IR sensors, but when I include one in a model, Gazebo gives me an error (Error [SensorManager.cc:151] Unable to create sensor of type[ir]).
How can I create an IR sensor?
And, the next one: to create an Ultrasonic (range) sensor, I need to create a ray sensor as it's parent?
I'm very noob with Gazebo, and still learning, but the tutorial on the web is with a contact sensor and doesn't works for my purposes.
Thank you.

http://gazebosim.org/wiki/Tutorials/1.3/control_robot/mobile_base_laser has a tutorial that uses a laser sensor. I don't know if the laser can help you, but maybe the tutorial could clarify some ideas.

A:

The upcoming version of gazebo (1.9) will have ultrasonic sensor built in.
You can create an IR sensor using a ray sensor, and just use one ray.
