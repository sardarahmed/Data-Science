Q:

How to add a controller to my own robot?

Hi, I am building a simple robot from scratch because I want to learn the complete procedure of building a robot.
I already built a robot like this(in urdf file):

And I want to send the command(geometry_msgs/Twist) to move the robot, I don't know how to correctly send the command to the robot.
There are some resources, but I am not familiar with controllers, so I have difficulties reading these resources. Hope these provide some useful hints.

Is there simple answers that I can control the robot?
Thanks in advance, I know this might be a simple question for you guys :)

A:

One way to do this is to implement a custom Gazebo plugin. We've done that in the package diffdrive_gazebo_plugin. To use it, you'll have to add it to your URDF, like here. If you want to see it in action, you can use the kurt_empty_world.launch file to start it, and uos_diffdrive_teleop to send Twist commands.
Our plugin is for a six-wheeled robot, but modifying it for your four-wheeled robot shouldn't be too hard.
