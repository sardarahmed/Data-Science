Q:

The relation between pointcloud and rgb data in gazebo

Hello everyone, I designed a robot in gazebo. The robot is equipped with a depth camera Kinect. That is, the file "libgazebo_ros_openni_kinect.so" is called.
Is the output RGB image corresponding to the point cloud? (For example, does the top left corner of the point cloud correspond to the top left pixel of the RGB image?)
Please help me

A:

I believe the same frame is used as the origin of both the depth and rbg sensors.
If you need a more realistic model that includes the baseline between different sensors (e.g. the IR and RGB), consider looking at these models for realsense and kinect cameras. They define individual frames/plugins for each sensor

The Kinect camera I'm using on the. So I want to confirm whether the information obtained from "/rgb/ image_raw" and "/ depth_registered / points" correspond. That is, "/ depth_registered / points" is equivalent to the result of adding x, y and z coordinate information to color information(same as image from "/ rgb / image_raw").
