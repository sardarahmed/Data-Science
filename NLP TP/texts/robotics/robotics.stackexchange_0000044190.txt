Q:

question about projectpixelto3dray

Hi
I have a question about the function projectPixelTo3dRay, according to the API the return value is a 3d ray passing through (u,v).
But what does that mean? Why Z is 1? How I can calculate the point where it intersects the ray with the floor (Z = 0)?
Thanks

Thanks domhege, but how I can transform between the camera system and the system floor? you know any example?
Comment by dornhege on 2012-09-17:
Use the tf library. Obviously someone, somewhere must compute this transformation, i.e. where is the camera relative to the floor.

A:

I think those are camera coordinates, Z=0 does NOT equal floor. Z=0 should equal the origin of the pinhole camera model.
You will need to transform between the camera system and whatever system you have that defines where the floor is.
