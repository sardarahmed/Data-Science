Q:

catkin_make: cmake error: cannot find stdmsgsConfig.cmake

I am having the following error while trying to using catkin_make for my workspace,
CMake Error at /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:83 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "stdmsgs" with any
  of the following names:

    stdmsgsConfig.cmake
    stdmsgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "stdmsgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "stdmsgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "stdmsgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.

can anyone please suggest me why ?

A:

It looks like you're trying to use the stdmsgs package in your CMakeLists.txt when it should be std_msgs.
