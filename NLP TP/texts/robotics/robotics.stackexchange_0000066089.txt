Q:

Several and independent workspaces

Hi everyone,
For my training with ROS, I would like to create an additional workspace (e.g. in ~/catkin_ws2/) next to an existing one (~/catkin_ws/). Assuming that ROS Indigo was already installed on my computer, I followed the ROS tutorials to setup another catkin workspaceÂ :
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws2/src/
$ cd ~/catkin_ws2/src/
$ catkin_init_workspace
</code></pre>
Then I run `catkin_make` in `~/catkin_ws2/` and added the lines
<pre><code>source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
source /home/myhome/catkin_ws2/devel/setup.bash
</code></pre>
at the end of my .bashrc file in `/home/myhome/`. I specify that I already did all of this with the previous workspace.<br>
But when I echoed the `$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH`, there were still the path of `~/catkin_ws/` in it.
Why is it still here since I didn't tell to ROS that the first workspace still exists ?

Many thanks for your replies.

A:

That means that the workspace in ~/catkin_ws/ was sourced when you built the workspace in ~/catkin_ws2/. You'll have to clear the build, devel, and install folders of ~/catkin_ws2/ and in a new terminal (without sourcing stuff in your ~/.bashrc) source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash and then build ~/catkin_ws2/ with catkin_make.
