Q:

doors detection and navigation with point cloud datas

Hello
I would like to ask for some help regarding point cloud data and doors detection / navigation through them. The map is created using Gmapping and map server and can obtain parameters such a seed or closest distance to the wall. Try to figure out some algorithms for doors detection and write my own node. Any help?
