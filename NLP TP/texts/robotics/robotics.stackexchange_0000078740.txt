Q:

using kdl_parser_py

Hello!
I've created a ros package with kdl_parser_py dependency. Now when I do catkin_make I get the following results:
CMake Error at /opt/ros/kinetic/share/kdl_parser_py/cmake/kdl_parser_pyConfig.cmake:141 (message):
  Project 'flax_assist' tried to find library 'kdl_parser_py'.  The library
  is neither a target nor built/installed properly.  Did you compile project
  'kdl_parser_py'? Did you find_package() it before the subdirectory
  containing its code is included?
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /usr/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:75 (find_package)
  flax_assist/CMakeLists.txt:7 (find_package)

But I'm sure kdl_parser_py is installed and rospack find kdl_parser_py works.
How to use it then?

A:

Python dependencies are runtime dependencies only, so they should not be listed in your find_package(catkin COMPONENTS ..) call in your CMakeLists.txt.
See catkin documentation » How to do common tasks » Package format 2 for how to declare and resolve Python dependencies in Catkin packages.
