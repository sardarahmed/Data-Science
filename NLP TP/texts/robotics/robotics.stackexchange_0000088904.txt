Q:

How can I know if I have the latest version of ROS packages?

I have installed ROS Lunar on an Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS.
I have followed the steps in Lunar Installation instructions for Ubuntu.
How can I know if I have the latest ros packages' version?
I did:
sudo apt update; sudo apt upgrade

And it doesn't install anything. Maybe I have to add another repository.

If apt-get upgrade doesn't install anything, then it would appear you have the latest releases of all packages.

Maybe I have to add another repository.

No, I don't believe so.
