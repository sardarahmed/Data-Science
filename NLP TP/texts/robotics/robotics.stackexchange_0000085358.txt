Q:

"Package [] does not have a path" when trying to load file with meshes into gazebo

ROS kinetic, Ubuntu 14.04
I have followed all the steps in the tutorial to create a catkin workspace and a package, and when i run rospack find my_package i get the location to my_package. However, when I launch my project i get the error
[rospack] "Package [] does not have a path".

Also, i can load the same urdf into rviz without a problem.
Here is a snippet from the code:
   <link name="base_link">
    <inertial>
      <origin rpy="0 0 0" xyz="0 0 0"/>
      <mass value="187"/>
      <inertia ixx="7.9" ixy="-9" ixz="-0.4" iyy="234" iyz="0.03" izz="233"/>
    </inertial>
    <collision>
      <origin rpy="0 0 0" xyz="0 0 0.04"/>
      <geometry>
        <mesh filename="package://romovi/src/romovi_dae/corpo_c.dae"/>
      </geometry>
    </collision>
    <visual>
      <origin rpy="0 0 0" xyz="0 0 0"/>
      <geometry>
        <mesh filename="package://romovi/src/romovi_dae/corpo_v.dae"/>
      </geometry>
    </visual>
  </link>
  <gazebo reference="base_link">
    <kp>1000.0</kp>
    <kd>10.0</kd>
    <mu1>10.0</mu1>
    <mu2>10.0</mu2>
    <material>Gazebo/Red</material>
  </gazebo>

A:

Okay, it seems that the setup bash only works for the terminal where you run it, and i was using two different terminals, one for loading the world and the other to load objects into the world.

Any time you open a new terminal you have to source your workspace and the setup.bash of your ROS distribution. These don't carry over to a new terminal.
