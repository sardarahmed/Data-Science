Q:

Anyone know what came of "Pyro?

About 15-20 years ago there was an active project called Pyro. See for example:  https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1047568.1047569 "In this article we describe a programming framework called Pyro, which provides a set of abstractions that allows students to write platform-independent robot programs." Pyro worked with ROS and maybe some other frameworks. I am trying to connect to that project, if anything is still happening there. Even if not, I'd like to take a look at whatever code is still left over. Does anyone know someone related to that project?

I'll not close this for now -- due to the connection with ROS and the chance that there *may be * someone here who recognises the name, but I would really recommend you post this somewhere else.
A quick Google shows that at least one of the authors of the paper you link has a Github profile, so it should not be too difficult to get in touch with him.

Thanks. Indeed I've emailed people and have posted it elsewhere. I am casting a wide net :)

For normal question this would be an reason to immediately close it, as cross-posting is not allowed.
Please edit your question and link to the other places you've posted.

A:

From following up with the authors I believe that Pyro is no longer a supported project although the code may still be available.
