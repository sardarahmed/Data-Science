A:

You need to make sure that the fixed frame in RVIZ (under global options) is set to the same frame as the root of the planning scene. Currently, you have it set to "base_link" -- if using the default settings for the PR2, you need to set it to "odom_combined"

Why set to odom_combined is important? How to understand and learn it well? Thank you~

If odom_combined is the frame that the planning scene is referenced to (depends on what the root of  your tree is based on the SRDF/URDF), then that happens to be where the plugin puts everything properly. Really, the plugin should transform to other frames, but it currently does not do that.
