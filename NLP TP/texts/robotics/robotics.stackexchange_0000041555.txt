Q:

simple installation problem in rosjava_core

Sorry I'm totally new to use ROS. I have had a java agent (program) which was used to control satellites and now I want to use it into ROS.
I have read some documents and think it should be okay for the running concept of the ROS. After that, I've passed all tutorials of ROS but when I try to install rosjava_core, I meet some problems. I don't know why I can't install it. When I follow the "rosws update", it just tell me:

[rosjava_core] Installing https://code.google.com/p/rosjava (default) to /home/wildfire/Robtic_java_workspace/rosjava_core
WARNING [vcstools] Command failed: 'hg --version'
errcode: 127:
/bin/sh: hg: not found
[/vcstools]
Exception caught during install: Error processing 'rosjava_core' : Unable to create vcs client of type hg for /home/wildfire/Robtic_java_workspace/rosjava_core: "Could not determine whether hg is installed 'hg --version returned 127, maybe hg is not installed'"
ERROR: Error processing 'rosjava_core' : Unable to create vcs client of type hg for /home/wildfire/Robtic_java_workspace/rosjava_core: "Could not determine whether hg is installed 'hg --version returned 127, maybe hg is not installed'"

Anyone can tell me what's this problem?
