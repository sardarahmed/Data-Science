Q:

rqt_graph is not working in my ros

Tutorial Link : -  http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingTopics
I'm installed rqt by using sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-rqt
While I'm running this command rosrun rqt_graph rqt_graph
It gives the following error message .
[rospack] couldn't find package [rqt_graph]
What may be the problem? I'm using ubuntu 11.10
I'm installed all the necessary requirements but while I run
rosrun rqt_graph rqt_graph
I got the following error message
ImportError: No module named rospack
[rospack] Error: could not find python module 'rosdep2.rospack'. is rosdep up-to-date (at least 0.10.4)?
[librospack]: error while executing command
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'pluginlib::LibraryLoadException'
what():  rospack could not find the qt_gui package containing qt_gui_cpp::Plugin
Aborted
How can I overcome from this problem?

A:

ros-groovy-rqt is just the framework that rqt_graph uses. To get rqt_graph, you need to install:
sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-rqt-graph

or
sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-rqt-common-plugins

Hello still I have this error. I'm edited my Qn.

Can you clarify your problem by asking a new question, it looks like your issue has nothing to do with rqt_graph. It looks like your ROS environment is not set up right
