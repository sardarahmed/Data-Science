Q:

Request for new package included for default installation

I have a new ROS package and I want to share with the community but how do I need to do so that anyone could use a command like sudo apt-get install ros-jade-NEW-PACKAGE to install it?
Or is it possible to make it available in the ROS default installation?
I think there are some procedures to follow and I should go through some kind of verification of the effectiveness of my new package. Anyone could give me some advice?
