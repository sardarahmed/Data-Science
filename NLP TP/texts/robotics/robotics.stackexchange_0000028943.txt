Q:

Heightmap providers for the DEM tutorial

Hi everyone,
I try the tutorial of Gazebo for heightmap DEM. Some links are dead and the tutorial cannot continue.
I look for an elevation map provider and the link with Gazebo and the GDAL library.
Is there someone with this issue too ?
Regards.

I found the following tutorial helpful: https://github.com/AS4SR/general_info/wiki/Creating-Heightmaps-for-Gazebo#Open_in_Gazebo.
It also points to a source for the DEM (but use it only for testing, the map gets scaled before downloading it because it is intended to be used in a computer game).
A great tool to automate the entire process to get the DEM into Gazebo is this one: https://github.com/MatthewVerbryke/gazebo_terrain

Thanks I didn't receive a notification of your answer :(
I'm looking for something more precise but I don't think it exist. I stock the tool to automate that 2 months ago, I didn't get time to test it :P.
