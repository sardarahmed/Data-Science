Q:

rviz Error - Global Status: Fixed frame [map] does not exist

I loaded a map in rviz using the map_server. I made the pgm file of map using p3at robot in Gazebo.
The map is loaded but showing error:
The error is : Fixed frame [map] does not exist.
I am not able to spawn the robot in rviz again.

You can explore the problem by setting up one or more static tf as in https://answers.ros.org/question/221329/rviz-fixed-frame-map-does-not-exist/?answer=286624#post-id-286624 ,  to fulfil the map->base_link tf relationship described by mig , above.

A:

You don't have a localization as e.g. amcl running.
Thus, the transformation map->base_link (or whatever you have for your robots link) does not exist.

amcl is running but timeout is occurring at obtaining the transformation map->base_link !

the above answer is all you'll get without providing more information.
We need the launch files, configurations, the output of rosrun tf view_frames.
Ideally, send a link to GitHub where you have your files...
