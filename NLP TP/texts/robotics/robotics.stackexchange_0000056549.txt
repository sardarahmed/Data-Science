Q:

amcl_omni.launch missing on Hydro (Ubuntu 12.04)

I'm following the navigation stack tutorial and I've noticed that the launch file it mentions for AMCL doesn't actually exist. I looked into the AMCL directory and it's empty, but I can still run the node itself via rosrun.
rosdep says it's okay, and I've tried reinstall via apt-get to no avail. I have installed ROS from the repositories.
The tutorial in question is this one (and section):
(see first link in comment. I don't have enough karma to post the link.)
Particularly, this line:
<include file="$(find amcl)/examples/amcl_omni.launch" />

When launching, it gives the following error:
while processing /home/knifa/HexapodKit/ROS/src/hexapod/launch/hexapod_nav.launch:
while processing /opt/ros/hydro/share/amcl/examples/amcl_omni.launch:
Invalid roslaunch XML syntax: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: u'/opt/ros/hydro/share/amcl/examples/amcl_omni.launch'

Looking into the AMCL directory only shows the following files:
knifa@ubuntu:/opt/ros/hydro/share/amcl$ rosls amcl
    cmake  
    package.xml

I am expecting to find this file, which is on the navigation git repository:
(see second link in comment. I don't have enough karma to post the link.)
The binary for AMCL itself is still available in the /lib folder.
knifa@ubuntu:/opt/ros/hydro/lib/amcl$ ls
    amcl

Any ideas why it isn't there already? Should I just copy it from the repository?
Thank you!

Please actually show what files your looking for and how with the error messages you're receiving.

I've edited my post now. I don't have enough karma to link the tutorial and files I'm expecting to find.

A:

It looks like that file is not installed in the hydro version of AMCL. I expect that it was forgotten to be installed in the upgrade. I suggest you file a ticket here: https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/issues/new
