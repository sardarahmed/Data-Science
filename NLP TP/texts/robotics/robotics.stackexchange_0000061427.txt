A:

This is usually done by creating a URDF (robot kinematic model) which defines the kinematics and joints of your robot, and loading it into the robot_description parameter.
Your hardware driver then publishes the joint_states topic with the name and position of each joint mentioned in the URDF.
The robot_state_publisher node reads this joint_states topic and the URDF, and publishes the transform tree (TF) in full 3D for your robot.
You can then visualize this in Rviz with the Robot Model display.

The Using URDF with robot_state_publisher Tutorial gives a more in-depth walkthrough of all of the steps in this process.
