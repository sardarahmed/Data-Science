Q:

Save ROS configurations like "profile" in Matlab

Hi,
I am launching a main.launch file. This file is calling several other configuration files of several nodes depending on the task. I know that I can record the data using rosbag record when I'm on mission.
Is there a possibility to save all the configurations along with rosbag? I am looking for some thing similar as profile in Matlab.
Any help is much appreciated. :)

A:

You can use rosparam dump to save parameters to a yaml file.
http://wiki.ros.org/rosparam
I use a script to save all parameters right before recording a bag.
#!/bin/bash
rosparam dump `date +%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S`.yaml
rosbag record /topic1 /topic2 /topic3

Edit: Removed -u option from date.

Great. In order to use local time instead of universal you can remove -u from date option.
