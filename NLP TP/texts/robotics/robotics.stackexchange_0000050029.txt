Q:

Multiple user tracking using pi_tracker

Hello Everyone,
I am using using ROS Electric, and pi_tracker package for skeletal tracking. In the published /skeleton topic by pi_tracker, there is a field named 'user_id'. Although in the tracking window, the tracker can track more than one person, but in the /skeleton topic message, user_id field is always equal to 1. I am not sure, whether it can't track more than one person, or there is any other parameter that needs to be set to get multiple user tracking data. Your help will be highly appreciated.
Thanks.

A:

You could also look at the source for openni_tracker.cpp for some hints on how to define unique tf frames for each user.
Also, when I first was getting started with ROS+Kinect, I wrote a package that borrowed heavily from pi_tracker and openni_tracker to provide exactly what you are looking for.  Actually, I essentially did what @Pi_Robot suggested, and I publish arrays of skeleton messages.  You can find my tracker code here and the message definitions here.
