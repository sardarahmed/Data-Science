Q:

Is mrpt_ro_slam deprecated?

I would like to use the mrpt_slam package so that I can run mrpt_ro_slam (range only slam). It looks like the package ended at Hydro (http://wiki.ros.org/mrpt_ro_slam) and I have Indigo. Is the mrpt_navigation package the continuation of the mrpt_slam package? It is on Indigo and Jade (http://wiki.ros.org/mrpt_navigation) and contains mrpt_localization, but it is unclear to me if it has some version of range only slam.
Basically, my question is if there is a range only slam package that has not been deprecated?
