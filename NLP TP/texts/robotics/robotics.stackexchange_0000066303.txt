Q:

communication with android over the Internet

I'd like to make an app on Android that will receive:
-stream video from cameras
-map
-some other data like velocity, state of program etc.
The app should also send some requests.
Could You help me how can i achieve this?
Should I use ROSjava or it won't give me all the needed features?
Maybe use websockets?rosbridge ?Or sth else (protocol/technology), especially for video streaming? If u could show me some examples or share some thoughts, it would be nice.
Sadly i am new to java/android and network programming.

A:

A good starting point would be the camera_tutprial_app from rosjava. It streams data from the camera (using the old API) to a ros node.
