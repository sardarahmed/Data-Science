A:

It seems that it can not find the navigation stack, have you installed it correct and do you find it ? Try roscd navigation , does it work?
If not you migth have not installed the navigation stack, you can install it by typing sudo apt-get install ros-<ROS_REALESE>-navigation, if you use fuerte you would type sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-navigation
Hope that help you

Hi ooon, thx for your help. It not works and show "no such package/stack 'navigation'". Would you please instruct me how to install navigation package?
