Q:

Recording a tod_training bag

Hi everyone,
Does anyone know how to record a tod_training bag file. I have some unsuccessful attempts. I don't know why my bag files are not valid. I changed all the topics names of my kinect output topics as
/camera_info
/image  (initial name ../rgb/image_color)
/image_mono
/points2
as my main bag file i record these topics to main.bag
In main.tf.bag
I have my tf message.
I edit config.txt having the name main
But it doesn't take the image and point cloud instances as it should be.
How can I record a tod_training bag with kinect? What are the bottlenecks?
Best regards..

A:

Hello!
For recording bags we have our own program - tod_training image_pcl_recorder
You can launch this for the openni by running:
roslaunch tod_training record_openni.launch bag:=pwd/awesome.bag interval:=0.5
It writes bag file with needed topic names.
Best regards,
Alexander.

This launch file is currently missing in my svn co from :https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/branches/trunk_diamondback/stacks/object_recognition/tod_training
Where can I find it?
