Q:

Fix annoying warnings about CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE

Hello, I am building some components on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, with ROS fuerte, rtt build from source from latest master (e95fe17c5ef504b03785818260d212d54e5bdf54).  I am building components with rosmake, and sometimes I get the following annoying warning during build:
CMake Warning:
Manually-specified variables were not used by the project:

  CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE

I ran rgrep, and verified that none of our CMakeLists are defining this variable.  It does appear in the CMakeCache files, which I assume is what is throwing the warning.
Should I silence these warnings, and how?

A:

The variable is set by cmake.mk which can be found in /opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros/core/mk. The file /opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros/core/rosbuild/rostoolchain.cmake contains more information about the purpose of the file. I think it has something to do with cross compilation.
