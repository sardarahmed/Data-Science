Q:

rosbag doesn't playback at same speed

Hi,
I have recorded a rosbag w topics at ~7 Hz. When I use rosbag play on those topics, they playback at 2Hz. The rosbag info too shows a total time of say 10 secs for instance but on playing it, it goes on for much more than 10 seconds.
Any tools you would recommend for me to debug without having to go through the code?
Thank you
edit 1: turns out it's image_view that I'm running which slows it down. Is this a known problem that image_view doesn't show images at ~7Hz at 3MP?

A:

Turned out to be a decompression issue. I had compressed bags that were unable to decompress and play at the desired frequency of the messages. Using rosbag decompress on these before playing them does the trick.
I didn't initially know of the decompress tool in rosbag so I was re recording the messages (at the slow speed) into another bag and playing that. But that seemed to do some unnatural behavior. Firstly the bags were much longer (which makes sense due to the slow speed) but then using the --clock option didn't make them use the time that was on the messages. They would still use the computer time.
