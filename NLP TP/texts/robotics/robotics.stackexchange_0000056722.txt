Q:

global_planner finds a path but is not able to find a valid trajectory

Hi,
I am trying to use the global planner global_planner.
It finds a path either in dijsktra or A* and changing the different parameters as this image shows

But then the robot stays still and (most of the times) I get this warning:
[ WARN] [1390404456.350870633, 3038.563000000]: Invalid Trajectory 0.000000, 0.000000, -0.300000, cost: -1.000000

until a fatal error appears, after 6 seconds:
[ERROR] [1390404456.403586383, 3038.611000000]: Aborting because a valid control could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors

Is there some parameter or remap missing in the global_planner wiki?
Is there any example of the global_planner with a launch and yaml files?

Thanks in advance!
Update
I found out that the global_plan publishes the poses from goal to origin whereas navfn publishes them from origin to goal.
I would say this is the problem that makes the robot stay still, I copy a couple of results:
oringin (x≅0) and goal (x≅1) of a path in navfn:
  pose: 
    position: 
      x: -0.1
      y: -0.05
...
  pose: 
    position: 
      x: 0.998614728451
      y: 0.0215734690428

oringin (x≅0) and goal (x≅1) of a path in global_planner:
  pose: 
    position: 
      x: 1.0
      y: 0.0
...
  pose: 
    position: 
      x: -0.25
      y: -0.05

A:

I'm pushing a patch but I've just made it work reversing the vector of the plan.
