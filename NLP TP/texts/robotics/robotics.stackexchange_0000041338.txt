Q:

John Hsu: File missing from gazebo_plugins package libgazebo_ros_time.cpp libgazebo_ros_time.so Meka A2

Ubuntu 12.04
Fuerte
John, or anyone else:
It looks like the source to build libgazebo_ros_time.so has been removed from gazebo_plugins?
The page for the package
http://ros.org/wiki/gazebo_plugins
still mentions the GazeboRosTime plugin.
So, has this plugin been removed due to changes in Gazebo?
Thanks,
David.

More info:
I'm trying to launch the Meka A2 Virtual Robot, as per this page:
http://mekabot.com/wiki/doku.php?id=user_guides:software:ros_tutorials
While Gazebo is trying to launch, I get an error:
Error [Plugin.hh:100] Failed to load plugin libgazebo_ros_time.so: libgazebo_ros_time.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
Searching Google reveals 2 threads suggesting that the gazebo_plugins package did not compile correctly.
I double-checked that it did compile correctly, then I checked the SVN for gazebo_plugins and noticed that the file libgazebo_ros_time.cpp is missing.
I decided to check when the file was removed from the SVN...
Current revision is 39596
In a new directory:
% svn co https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/simulator_gazebo/trunk/gazebo_plugins@38276
revision 38276 20 Oct 2011 by hsu
was the last revision I could find the source for the time plugin.

You can use the tutorial in http://mekabot.com/wiki/doku.php?id=user_guides:software:ros_tutorials, which works with Fuerte.
