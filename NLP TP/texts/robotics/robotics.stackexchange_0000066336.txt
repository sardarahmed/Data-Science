Q:

Where are the screw joints in Indigo?

Hi,
I'm trying to use screw joints in indigo, but i'm getting an error saying that 'screw' is an unknown joint type.
Thanks

Looking for something like this in gazebo/ros:

A:

The joint types supported by URDF are (from wiki/urdf/XML/joint - Attributes):

revolute
continuous
prismatic
fixed
floating
planar

It would appear that SDF (Gazebo's modelling format) does support them (and they are used in ROS (see this answer by John Hsu for example), but this has not been mirrored in / ported to URDF.

Thanks!  So is there any way to connect to a gazebo screw joint?  Either with some   tags or some plugin?

Seems torso.gazebo.urdf uses screw type joints. It places them inside gazebo tags, so that would probably work.
