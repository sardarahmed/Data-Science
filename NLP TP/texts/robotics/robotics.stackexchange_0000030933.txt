Q:

how to increase move_arm action speed?

Hi all,
I'm currently testing on PR2, with the "move_arm to joint position" client, the motion's stability when stopping. In order to find the highest speed which ensure a smooth stop, I need to change arm's speed.
Does anyone knows how to do that ?

Hi Guido,
pr2_arm_navigation/pr2_arm_navigation_config/config/joint_limits.yaml contains the actual velocity and acceleration limits that are used. If you are using the trajectory filter (which you will be if you are using the launch files in pr2_3dnav), it will use these values to determine the maximum velocities and set appropriate times for each waypoint in the trajectory so that these limits are always obeyed.
The "Moving the arm through a Cartesian pose trajectory" tutorial does not use the trajectory filter though. It assigns the times to each waypoint individually. It computes the time between waypoints assuming a linear segment between waypoints.
The behavior of the underlying joint trajectory controller is described here: http://www.ros.org/wiki/robot_mechanism_controllers/JointSplineTrajectoryController
Hope this helps,

Probably because one of us changed it for the right and forgot to make the corresponding changes for the left :-)

Thank you for your answer, this is what I needed to know. By the way, I don't think it is worth a new question so i post it in this comment: why does the left arm have smaller velocity and acceleration values than the right arm ?
