A:

i couldnt solve the issue but i found a way around i used the 2nd method given in the ROS.org website and installed it manually from github.
http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Arduino%20IDE%20Setup
its the "3.1.2 Installing from Source onto the ROS workstation"

Not all packages are available on all platforms. I don't think rosserial_arduino has been released into jade.

I see rosserial_arduino is released into Jade already?

Then @naqu.nick should check what platform he's trying to install onto.
