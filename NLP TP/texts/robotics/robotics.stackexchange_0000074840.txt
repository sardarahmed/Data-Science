Q:

Using static transform publisher within rgbdslam

I'm using rgbdslam (with kinect + freenect driver) to process octomaps which are currently somehow rotated round the x-axis and therefore giving me wrong occupancy grid maps when I try to save with map_saver. I tried to fix this with static_transform_publisher but don't know exactly how to use it. As far as I understood, this has to be added to the beginning of my openni/freenect+rgbdslam.launch - file:
What are the frame_id and child_frame_id?

A:

You would use your own frame_id, e.g. "rotated_map", and the frame_id given in the fixed_frame_name parameter of rgbdslam ("map" by default"). If you want the conventional "map" to be the corrected one, just change the fixed_frame_name parameter in your rgbdslam launchfile.

We tried the following but didn't succeed:
< node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="rotated_map" args="0 0 0 0 0 90 /openni_camera  /map 10"/>
and in rgbdslam's launch file
< param name="fixed_frame_name" value="/rotated_map"/>
Thank you very much in advance
