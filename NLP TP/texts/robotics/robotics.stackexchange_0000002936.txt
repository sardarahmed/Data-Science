Q:

Best strategy for area scanning using little sensing bots

I'm currently working on a school project about simulating robots scanning an area, but it has been a struggle to find what strategy the robots should use.  Here are the details:
I am given a certain amount of robots, each with a sensing range of $r$.  They spawn one after another.  Their task to scan a rectangular area.  They can only communicate with each other when they are within communication range. 
I am looking for the best strategy, (i.e. time efficient solution) for this. 
Any reply or clue to the strategy will be appreciated. 

A:

Distributed cooperative coverage algorithms for robots sounds like an area of active research.  I suggest looking at some academic papers.  Here are a few to get you started:
Multirobot Cooperative Model applied to Coverage of Unknown Regions
Cooperative Coverage of Rectilinear Environments
