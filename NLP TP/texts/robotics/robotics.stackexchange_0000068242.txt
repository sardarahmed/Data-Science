Q:

Powering Hokuyo from Kobuki

Hello! I recently purchased a Hokuyo UST 10LX, and i'm having a difficult time figuring out how to get power from the Kobuki (Turtlebot 2) to the scanner. There are a few posts on here about getting the software to work with Hokuyo, but i'm still stuck on the hardware side of things! Do we need to connect the +VIN and -VIN to a 12v supply on Turtlebot?  If anyone could shed some light / share their knowledge I would greatly appreciate it!

A:

The cable wiring is as follows:
Red: COM Input +
Gray: COM Output -
Light Blue: IP Reset Input
Orange: Synchronous Output
Brown +VIN (12VDC / 24VDC)
Blue: -VIN
Since I plan on using the Ethernet connection for communication, I only need to connect the brown and blue cables for power.
