Q:

Using ROS for Biped motion planning

I bought a 60cm humanoid robot with RC-Servos. I'm already able to drive all servos with ROS. Are there ROS packages for BIPED motion planning available?
Also the question arose, if URBI might have advanatages compared to ROS for a biped?

A:

With hrpsys, some biped robots, HRP2 and Atlas (simulation only afaik) are already capable of planning using MoveIt!. @Kei Okada can provide more correct info.

I can't find any documentation for hrpsys, is there any available?

@jonny-j I just added documentation section. Basically hrpsys is completely missing user doc to date, and interest like yours helps the maintainers to take action :)
