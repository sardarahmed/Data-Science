Q:

Deleted workspace the wrong way

Hello,
I have deleted some workspaces by deleting the complete workspace folders in my home folder. Just right mouse click and delete.
Now when I open a terminal I get multiple messages:
bash: /home/lauran/ur5_ws/devel/setup.bash: No such file or directory
bash: /home/lauran/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash: No such file or directory
bash: /home/lauran/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash: No such file or directory
bash: /home/lauran/ur5_ws/devel/setup.bash: No such file or directory
bash: /home/lauran/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash: No such file or directory
bash: /home/lauran/robot_ws/devel/setup.bash: No such file or directory
bash: /home/lauran/robot_ws/devel/setup.bash: No such file or directory

I don't use these workspaces anymore but I've read that I should have deleted my workspaces more properly.
Is there a way where i can fix these errors so that there won't a situation where these deleted workspaces cause any problems?
Thank you.

Try opening the file /home/lauran/.bashrc in a text editor (gedit fi) and scroll to the end. Most likely you have a number of source /home/lauran/../devel/setup.bash lines there.
Remove (or comment) those and save the file. Open a new terminal. The errors should now be gone.

Workspaces are just directories with files, so removing them is exactly the same as you would with any other directories and / or files.
I wouldn't know of a more "proper way".
