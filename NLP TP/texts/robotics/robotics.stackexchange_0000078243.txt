Q:

no msgs shown while following actionlib tutorial

I am following this tutorial on action lib:Writing a Simple Action Server using the Execute Callback But after i build the package and than run the fibonacci_server node i'm not getting any ROS_INFO as shown in the tutorial like this:
[ INFO] 1250790662.410962000: Started node [/fibonacci], pid [29267], bound on [aqy], xmlrpc port [39746], tcpros port [49573], logging to [~/ros/ros/log/fibonacci_29267.log], using [real] time
When i checked the rqt_graph I'm getting:

When i run rostopic list -v, i'm getting:
Published topics:
 * /fibonacci/feedback [actionlib_tutorials/FibonacciActionFeedback] 1 publisher
 * /fibonacci/status [actionlib_msgs/GoalStatusArray] 1 publisher
 * /rosout [rosgraph_msgs/Log] 1 publisher

 * /rosout_agg [rosgraph_msgs/Log] 1 publisher

Subscribed topics:
 * /fibonacci/goal [actionlib_tutorials/FibonacciActionGoal] 1 subscriber
 * /fibonacci/cancel [actionlib_msgs/GoalID] 1 subscriber
 * /rosout [rosgraph_msgs/Log] 1 subscriber

My CmakeLists.txt file is exactly as instructed but after i run the command line: rosrun actionlib_tutorials fibonacci_sver what i get is nothing.

A:

Everything is all right here. To get the image shown in the tutorial (which was taken from rxgraph, an older alternative to rqt_graph:

change visualization in the drop down to Nodes/Topics (all)
uncheck the Actions check box, as well as the Dead sinks and Leaf topics

But I must say I am unsure why the ROS_INFO output does not appear. Maybe this has been removed from rosrun?
