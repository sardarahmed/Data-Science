Q:

How to meet Bullet requirement for rosdep tf2_bullet? Or can I trick rosdep?

I am attempting to do a ROS install on Raspbian (pi). 3.10.25+
Pretty much everything has gone very well until I tried to install the tf2_bullet package that I need for create_node.
To install new packages I have been following the instructions here: http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Setting%20up%20Hydro%20on%20RaspberryPi#Installing_new_packages
Running
rosdep install  --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro hydro -y --os=debian:wheezy

I get the error:
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved to system dependencies:
tf2_bullet: No definition of [bullet] for OS version [wheezy]

I have manually installed bullet on my system from source (although I'm not sure I did it right).
I've already checked and create_node does in fact need tf, which depends on tf2 down to bullet.
I see in the source for rosdep that it does a look up in the data dictionary passed in to RosdepDefinition, but I haven't yet found where that data dictionary is created.
Anyone know how to get bullet installed or how I can get rosdep to move past this point?
Thanks

A:

There is a pull request open for adding command line support to ignore specific keys in rosdep:
https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rosdep/pull/301
What you can do to ignore the bullet rosdep key is providing an empty definition for it locally.
Create the file /etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d/10-local.list with contents:
yaml file:///etc/ros/rosdep/local.yaml

And create the file /etc/ros/rosdep/local.yaml with contents:
bullet:
  debian:
    wheezy: []

Then execute rosdep update and try again.
To get this permanently fixed, if you figure out what package to install, you could also file a pull request to change the definition for weezy in this file: https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/blob/master/rosdep/base.yaml#L304-L306

Seems ok. It let me keep going, but not sure what it might affect.

It might be even better to do  sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian wheezy-backports main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list  , and add
bullet:
debian:
wheezy:
apt:
packages:
- libbullet-dev
to the yaml file.
