A:

I think here is not the proper place for asking this question, Object Recognition is a general issue.
there is lots of different algorithm for object recognition, as an first step i recommend you to have a look at texture matching algorithms like SURF and Sift. there is lots of sample codes if you google them.
And also for Object Segmentation Purposes you can have a look at PCL library samples.
For Speech Recognition you can use PocketSphinx,
For TTS you can use festival package,
GoodLuck
