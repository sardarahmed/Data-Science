Q:

audio_capture / audio_playback not working

I have been following the audio_common tutorial.
I run:
gst-launch-0.10 alsasrc ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! alsasink

and it works correctly.
When I continue the next steps,
roslaunch audio_capture capture.launch

roslaunch audio_play play.launch

no sound is played back.
When I check the topics, /audio is there and generating values. rxgraph shows them connected. But, when I run roswtf, I get:

ERROR The following nodes should be connected but aren't:

* /audio_capture->/audio_play (/audio)

I am running on Natty.
Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

This sounds like a network setup issue. See http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/NetworkSetup
