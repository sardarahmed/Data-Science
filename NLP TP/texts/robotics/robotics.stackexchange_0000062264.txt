Q:

XV_laser_drive/Tutorial

I did a upgrade to Indigo so I could get Rviz working properly.  I am trying to install the xv_laser_driver.  I get an error with catkin_make.  This is what I get:
Base path: /home/brent/catkin_ws

A:

No need to comment anything, just declare rpms in xv11_laser.h
gedit ~/catkin_ws/src/xv_11_laser_driver/include/xv_11_laser_driver/xv11_laser.h

Add the following to line 43 after public: then save the file
uint16_t rpms; 

Run catkin_make in your catkin workspace, and you should be all good now :)
cd ~/catkin_ws/
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash

Tested with a Jeston TK1 running Ubutnu 14.04 & Indigo
