Q:

how does my program find the file system path to a package?

When reading data files, it is often necessary for a program to find the file system path name for the containing ROS package. That may differ depending on where the package is installed on the system.
rospack find solves this problem from the command line and in shell scripts.
How do I find the correct path in a C++ or Python program?

A:

I already knew the answer, but a colleague recently mentioned that it is somewhat buried in the ROS documentation. There are good answers on the Packages page, however:

Python
C++
