Q:

How to set gazebo log dir to a different destination then ~/.gazebo/log

Hello,
I am logging state.log from gazebo-9. But however it insists logging under .gazebo/log.
Is there any way I can set the log dir to a different directory, similar to ROS_LOG_DIR  in ros?
Best regards,
C.

A:

If you're logging from the command line, you can pass the --record-path flag.
If you're doing it through the C++ API, you can pass the path to LogRecord::Start.
If you're triggering it through a message, you can use the base_path field.
If you're using ROS 1, pass extra_gazebo_args:="--record-path <path>" to empty_world.launch.
If you're using ROS 2, pass record_path to gzserver.launch.py.

Hello @chapulina I am launching gazebo trough a launch file, in ros.  and the ros gazebo arguments do not include record-path. is there a way I can still use ros, and give this command line argument?
