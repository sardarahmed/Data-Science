Q:

I am trying to setup youbot and receive the below error

CMake Error at /opt/ros/hydro/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:75 (find_package):
Could not find a configuration file for package pr2_msgs.
Set pr2_msgs_DIR to the directory containing a CMake configuration file for
pr2_msgs.  The file will have one of the following names:
pr2_msgsConfig.cmake
pr2_msgs-config.cmake

Call Stack (most recent call first):
youbot_driver_ros_interface/CMakeLists.txt:5 (find_package)
-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
Invoking "cmake" failed

A:

The youbot_driver_ros_interface package depends on other packages. Probably you don't have the pr2_msgs package installed. You can install it with sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-pr2-msgs (use your ROS distro instead of hydro, if you are not using hydro).
