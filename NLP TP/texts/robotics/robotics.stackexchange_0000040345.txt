Q:

Error with rosmake bumblebee2 (fuerte)

I'm new to ROS, so I got stuck at this step of installing the bumblebee2 package.
I solved a prior dependency issue with libdc1394v2, however my error when make is trying to compile bumblebee2.cpp, the following error occurs:
Building CXX object CMakeFiles/bumblebee2.dir/src/bumblebee2.o
/home/juan/ros_workspace/bumblebee2/src/bumblebee2.cpp:55:45: fatal error:  
camera_info_manager/camera_info.h: No such file or directory

I'm thinking that it could be some some sort of package dependency issue, but I'm not sure how I would fix this, or where the header file is that it's looking for.
Thanks

A:

This question may be similar to yours.
You seem to be using a very old camera driver, not actively maintained.
