Q:

What device do I need to project a laser to point at a specific location?

I'm searching for a (commercial) projector that just projects a single laser point into the world (e.g. using two moving mirrors). However, I'm struggling because I'm not sure what such a thing is called. I either find area projectors that use lasers, party equipment or laser pointers. 
What is the name for such a device? 

A:

The underlying mechanism used by high performance laser painting devices is usually a galvo (Galvanometer scanner, Laser Galvanometer or Mirror Galvanometer).
High performance galvos, like this one from scanlab are essential to the  laser micro-machining (drilling, cutting, marking) industries:

Their cost and performance may significantly exceed your requirements however. These are designed to position themselves in microseconds, to sub-micron (near field) accuracy.
I have no association with Scanlab, but I worked for many years in the laser micro-machining industry and they are the products I'm most familiar with.
