Q:

Submitting a collection of ROS mercurial/git/bzr repositories

Currently our lab has a rather primitive single repository indexed by ROS that holds a whole bunch of unrelated stacks.  I'd like to split these out into individual repositories, yet still have them indexed together under our lab banner, as a number of other groups seem to have done.
It's not obvious to me how to do this outside of svn.  Do I create an overarching repository that simply holds the .rosinstall file for the various other repositories, and submit the address of this repository and .rosinstall to ros-users?  And will modifying the .rosinstall in future allow me to add new stacks?

A:

I think it's best to have one repository per stack. To have all repositories indexed, you can provide a rosinstall file that contains all your repositories. This rosinstall file needs to be accessible by a URL, i.e. it's not really necessary to have it in a repository. I like to have it under version control though. For each run, the indexer reads this rosinstall file, i.e. when you change it, the indexer will use the updated file.
