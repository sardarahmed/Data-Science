Q:

run ROS2 in two vs code remote containers

Hello everyone,
I tried to run to ROS2 two nodes in different containers as described here: https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Guides/Run-2-nodes-in-single-or-separate-docker-containers.html?highlight=container (I used foxy instead of eloquent). Everything works just fine.
Then I started two instances of vs code and opened the workspace in a remote container (based on the same image as above). In the first remote container I start the talker, in the second remote container I start the listener. Unfortunately they don't find each other. Does anyone have an idea what might be the solution?
Thanks a lot
Jeremy

A:

I found the solution of the problem. The issue is that Fast-DDS comes with SharedMemory transport by default which doesn't work in this case. A solution can be found here: https://answers.ros.org/question/370595/ros2-foxy-nodes-cant-communicate-through-docker-container-border/.
