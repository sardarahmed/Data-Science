Q:

Warnings when running turtlebot_gazebo

Environment

Ubuntu 12.04.2 (run on Virtualbox on Mac OSX Mavericks)
hydro

Questions
I installed turtlebot-simulator.

sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-turtlebot-simulator
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-turtlebot-apps
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-tutlebot-rviz-launchers

Run roscore and launched the simulator.
roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_empty_world.launch
I got these warning.

OpenGL Warning: No pincher, please call crStateSetCurrentPointers() in your SPU
OpenGL Warning: You called glBindTexture with a target of 0x806f, but the texture you wanted was target 0xde1 [1D: de0 2D: de1 3D: 806f cube: 8513]

Are these warnings serious? If so, how can I fix them?

A:

Running OpenGL applications inside VMs is often fraught with problems. If things are generally working it's likely ok to ignore them. Otherwise you may need to look into updating your video drivers.
