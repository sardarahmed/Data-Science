Q:

opencv 3.0 and cv-bridge

I am currently using OpenCv 3.0. And now I would like to use it with ROS (as Ros still has OpenCv 2.4 ). I need to use cv_bridge in my work. However, because cv_bridge is linked with open cv libraries of openCV 2.4 (which I must hide from ROS system inorder to use opencv3.0) I tried to compile it with 3.0 libraries, but without any success.
There are a lot of changes made on transitioning from 2.4 to 3.0 including lots of variable names. 
Has anyone tried to do so with any sucess? I would appreciate any information on how to proceed.

A:

I don't think it should be too hard to fix those errors right? Most errors are probably things like
CV_RGB2GRAY

To
cv::COLOR_RGB2GRAY

cv_bridge isn't that big so I'd try to fix those errors (and perhaps do a pull request when you are done)
