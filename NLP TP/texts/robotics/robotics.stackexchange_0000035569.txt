Q:

upgrading to pcl 1.3 in electric

Hi,
I'm trying to use some features that are specific to pcl 1.3; I believe 1.0 or 1.1 is in the electric release?
So I downloaded/installed the (non-ROS) pcl 1.3 package with apt. But now the build system gets confused, and will compile against the 1.3 headers but link against the 1.0 libraries.
Errors appear as follows (many of these):
CMakeFiles/pcl_test.dir/src/pcl_test.o:
(.rodata._ZTVN3pcl6search17OrganizedNeighborINS_11PointXYZRGBEEE[vtable for pcl::search::OrganizedNeighbor<pcl::PointXYZRGB>]+0x68):
undefined reference to `pcl::search::OrganizedNeighbor<pcl::PointXYZRGB>::radiusSearch(int, double, std::vector<int, std::allocator<int> >&, std::vector<float, std::allocator<float> >&, int) const'

My CMakeLists.txt looks like:
#...
rosbuild_init()
#...
find_package(PCL 1.3 REQUIRED COMPONENTS io)
include_directories(${PCL_INCLUDE_DIRS})
link_directories(${PCL_LIBRARY_DIRS})
add_definitions(${PCL_DEFINITIONS})

rosbuild_add_executable(pcl_test src/pcl_test.cpp)
target_link_libraries(pcl_test ${PCL_LIBRARIES})

manifest.xml declares dependencies on pcl and pcl_ros (I have also tried omitting these deps, in the hopes the linker would then do The Right Thing)
Thanks mucho!
-Nick
