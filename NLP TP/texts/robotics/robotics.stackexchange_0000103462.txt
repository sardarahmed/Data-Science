Q:

Is there a big difference between ros2foxy and ros2humble?

I saw a smart cart for ROS2, which happens to be the direction I want to learn, so I want to buy it. However, the official system for the cart is ROS2foxy, and I am learning ROS2humble, which is causing me a lot of frustration. I would like some advice from you guys. Is there a big difference between foxy and humble, and should I buy it?

It would be better if the title of your post was the question you are asking. You can edit it using the little "edit" link just under the existing title.

thank you!

A:

All of robotics covers a very large number of technical areas (mechanical, electrical, software, algorithms), so I would say the decision to buy a robot with ros2 installed depends which aspects of robotics you are interested in right now. If you have a halfway decent desktop/laptop computer, you can definitely do most of your learning/exploring in the software simulator. It's not as satisfying as making a real object move, but the crashes are also less expensive.
The difference between foxy and humble is that humble will have more features implemented and a lot of bugs fixed. However, most of the concepts & software APIs in the two versions should be the same.
