Q:

ROS Remote Network Setting with Port Forwarding Problem

As title, I was using ROS for about 5 months, currently I have to move the simulation part to another Virtual Machine which was built on a cloud server and the port is forwarding from local_IP:11311 to global_IP:50230,  here I face the problem for the network setting.
Computers' setting are as below:Q

Computer 1 as a data saving computer :

Local wifi network ip =  192.168.0.80

Port 22 Forwarding to = Lab_IP:29

ROS_MASTER_URI = http://Cloud_IP:50230

ROS_HOSTNAME = 192.168.0.80 / Lab_IP ( I've tried both configuration but in vain )

ROS_IP = 192.168.0.80 / Lab_IP

Computer 2 as ROS MASTER:

Local network ip =  192.168.101.83

Port 11311 Forwarding to =  Cloud_IP:50230

ROS_MASTER_URI = http://192.168.101.83:11311

ROS_HOSTNAME = 192.168.101.83

ROS_IP = 192.168.101.83

The problem I'm facing now is that I can do rostopic list but when I echo those rostopic, it shows

WARNING: no messages received and simulated time is active.
Is /clock being published?

Is there anything that I misunderstood at the tutorial ?
Any suggestions will be appreciated, thanks !

A:

Finally get this problem done.
So here's how i solve the problem:

I use my router as a openvpn server
As a client, he remote computer owns a local ip of my local environment.
All ip and master_uri settings are just like what to do with local computers.

That's it !
