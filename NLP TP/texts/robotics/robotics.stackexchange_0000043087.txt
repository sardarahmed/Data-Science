Q:

Asus Pro instead of Asus Pro Live

Hi, i am using the openni_camera module together with the openni_launch on ubuntu 12.04 and fuerte.
when i run openni_launch, it detects the device, but sadly not correct. It detects my Xtion pro live (with RGB) as a Pro, meaning no RGB is provided.
Can anyone direct me as to how to find what's wrong?
Can installing a new driver from the OpenNI website change anything?
Thanks a lot, i hope someone can somehow help me.
EDIT
Just to help other people who search for this issue :) The error that i get, when i set depth registration to on using dynamic_reconfigure is

Device does not provide image + depth
stream

I also get this after running openni_launch (I never used any other camera on this system):

[ERROR] [1344530831.835241577]: Tried

A:

This issue happened for me after I installed the unstable binaries for 12.04 here.  So I went back and installed the stable Ubuntu 10.10 version of the OpenNI Compliant Hardware Binaries.  Now openni_camera finds my device as "unknown", but I am able to get both depth and RGB (and depth registration using dynamic reconfigure).  So far it is working fine.
