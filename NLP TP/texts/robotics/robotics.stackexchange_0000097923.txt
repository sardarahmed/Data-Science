Q:

Where are the map files stored when rosrun map_server map_saver is run

I have used this command to store map
rosrun map_server map_saver static_map:=dynamic_map
This is the output i got:
Waiting for the map
Received a 1984 X 1984 map @ 0.050 m/pix
Writing map occupancy data to map.pgm
Writing map occupancy data to map.yaml
Done
Where are these maps physically stored? If i want to use them again how do i load them?

HI,
By default the maps are stored on the same location where you run the command with the names to map.pgm and map.yaml.
If you want to specify a different path and filename you can use the -f option.  There are quite more parameters, and instructions on how to use map_server on its wiki page http://wiki.ros.org/map_server

map yaml and pgm files do not have to be in the same path. If you edit yaml file you can see pgm file path in there.
