Q:

plan moveL moveP

hi
i have multiple waypoints (std::vector<geometry_msgs::Pose> waypoints)
i can plan these waypoints using computeCartesianPath:
computeCartesianPath( waypoints, eef_step, jump_threshold, trajectory, true );

i think "computeCartesianPath" equals moveL function.
how can i plan moveP

You'll want to explain (for others) what "moveP" actually does. I believe you're referring to a specific motion type on Universal Robots, but it's not universal terminology. So without describing what you're trying to achieve, it's going to be difficult to help you.

A:

MoveP will move the tool in linear motion at constant speed with circular blends. The size of the blend radius is per default a shared value for all the waypoint. A smaller value will make the path turn sharper whereas a higher value will make the path smoother. reference
The Pilz Industrial Motion Planner provides such an implementation in MoveIt. reference prior question

A specialized MoveIt capability takes
a moveit_msgs::MotionSequenceRequest
as input. The request contains a list
of subsequent goals as described above
and an additional blend_radius
parameter. If the given blend_radius
in meter is greater than zero, the
corresponding trajectory is merged
together with the following goal such
that the robot does not stop at the
current goal
