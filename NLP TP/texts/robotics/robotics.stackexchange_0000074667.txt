Q:

Connect Rtabmap on Tango to ROS

Hi,
@matlabbe, I am using Rtabmap application on Tango. I would like to connect the tablet to ROS indigo on my laptop. I followed the instructions on this link. But, I get some errors when I do catkin_make in ROS Java Android workspace section. Would you please help me how to connect it properly? Is there another way to read the data from Rtabmap app on ROS?
Thank you.

Hi,
RTAB-Map Tango app doesn't have ROS inputs or outputs. It is a standalone version. Indeed, it would be nice to run it like a ROS node, publishing the map outside the tablet. I did not play with ROS Java yet, so not sure how integrate it.
I don't know if it could be easier to build ROS CPP as static libraries to be included in RTAB-Map app, so that no data conversion from C++ to Java would be required to publish the messages (all mapping/visualization processing is done in C++, only menus are in Java).
If you use ROS Java, you may have to convert C++ RTAB-Map/OpenCV/PCL classes to Java to publish them.
For your errors about "ROS Java Android workspace", you may post a new question about the errors (specific to ROS Java).
cheers
