Q:

Mirroring the ROS debians not working with reprepro

Hi,
Upon trying to mirror some packages with a filter list at http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu
I'm running into this error with reprepro:
conf/updates:
Name: pr2-ros-pkgs
Suite: trusty
Method: http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu/
ComponentS: main
Architectures: amd64
FilterList: purge pr2rosdeps.packages
DownloadListsAs: .gz
VerifyRelease: blindtrust

Could not find 'main/debian-installer/binary-amd64/Packages' within './lists/pr2-ros-pkgs_trusty_InRelease'

IS this done by design to prevent this sort of updating/access from this repo, or just a bug?
Edit: adding more info
It seems that the archive.ubuntu.com also provides a trusty/main/debian-installer in its conf/dists file. I'm thinking that this is preventing the merge of the ROS pkgs into my repo because the ros repo doesn/t have a trusty/main/debian-installer, which its expecting it to.
Thanks!

A:

I was able to solve this by separating the grabbing of the ROS packages into a seperate distribution clause in my conf/distributions file.
