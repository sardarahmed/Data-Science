Q:

use gazebo with walltime

Hi,
I would like to use gazebo with walltime, so that the movement of the robot is exactly the same like in the real world. For example I used the trajectory_msgs/JointTrajectory message and set up one trajectory point with [..].time_from_start = ros::Duration(10.0), but the robot's arm moved much faster. How can this be done?
thanks

A:

with updateRate less than zero Gazebo tries to match simulator::GetSimTime() + simulator::GetPauseTime() with simulator::GetRealTime().  If you are seeing "simulation speedup to catchup", that means GetPauseTime() is not returning the correct value.  Can you reproduce the behavior?

OK, I will see if I can do it reproducibly.  Incidentally where is a good place to post queries about gazebo internals?
