---Python Nodes---
kaymak@kaymak-X550JX:~/catkin_ws/src/my_robot/scripts$ chmod +x my_first_node.py 
kaymak@kaymak-X550JX:~/catkin_ws/src/my_robot/scripts$ ls

A:

Open bashrc file;
nano ~/.bashrc

Add this to the end;
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

Then save and quit.
If it works, you fixed it.
If it doesn't work, you can add it to the bottom of the bashrc file;
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/<user_name>/catkin_ws/src:/opt/ros/melodic/share

<user_name> -> write your own user name in this section
