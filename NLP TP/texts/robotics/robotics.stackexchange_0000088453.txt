Q:

rqt - python: Fatal IO error 2 (No such file or directory) on X server :0.0

I am learning ROS Kinetic by following the tutorials. I am running Ubuntu on Windows 10 and using Xming for GUI. All was going good until I reached Using rqt_console and roslaunch tutorial. When I entered following command
    rosrun rqt_logger_level rqt_logger_level

It worked fine for the first time. But when I closed the window and ran the same command again I  got the following error:-
python: Fatal IO error 2 (No such file or directory) on X server :0.0.
Later I found that any command involving rqt gives me the exact same error. However everything else including graphical programs and widgets are running absolutely fine.
I have tried removing rqt and reinstalling but nothing helps.
    pyhton -V

gives me Python 2.7.12
Can anyone please help with this problem. Thanks

A:

ok. so after struggling for a few hours after this post I checked out rqt -h which showed me all available options including --clear-config. which is suppose to clear the configuration (including all perspectives and plugin settings). So I did this:-
rqt --clear-config

and then
rqt_graph --clear-config

and one of these did the trick. Hope this helps someone.
