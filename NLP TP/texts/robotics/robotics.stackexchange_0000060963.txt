Q:

razer_hydra hydra.launch hangs on "starting stream"

Hello,
I recently upgraded my razer_hydra install to the indigo branch, and made sure that the udev rules were properly installed.  Now when I run the command:
roslaunch razer_hydra hydra.launch publish_tf:=true

I get the output:
process[razer_hydra_driver-1]: started with pid [8245]
[ INFO] [1405699624.237070758]: Using filter corner frequency of 3.0 Hz

[ INFO] [1405699624.280525075]: starting stream... (first packet takes a few seconds)

and the process hangs there.
Has anyone else had this problem? When I was using the hydro branch, things worked fine.
Thanks!
Kel

A:

Looking at the code:
https://github.com/aleeper/razer_hydra/blob/indigo-devel/nodes/hydra_node.cpp
It's working just as intended. Have you checked that you can rostopic echo joy
?

So I didn't realize that the line of code was removed that said something like "First message recieved, everything should be working now"
However, I get nothing from
rostopic echo /hydra_joy

Could this be a problem with the udev rules?  When I downloaded the source and catkin_made, it did not place the 99-hydra-indigo in my udev folder.  I had to do it manually.

Ok, so I blew away my build and devel and catkin_make again.  I also switched from the ros fork to you aleeper git, and it works fine.  So not sure if it was my environment or something in the hydro-devel branch of the ros fork.  Probably my workspace :)
Thanks for the help!
