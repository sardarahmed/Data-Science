Q:

Setting inertia for a whole robot

Hi all,
I am trying to model a quadrotor, i have the .model file from an old implementation in gazebo but i need to rewrite it as a .urdf to be used in ROS. My problem is that rather then setting the inertia for each link i would like to set it for the whole robot (in fact the controller will consider the quadrotor as a unique body). Is it possible somehow?
Thank you

If the links are connected via fixed joints, you should be able to assign inertia to any one of the fixed-joint-connected links and set the rest of the links inertia to some very small numbers (1e-6).  As of diamondback, inertia of fix-joint-connected links are lumped into their parent.  In general, 0 inertia will not work as the urdf2gazebo parser will ignore the link and break the kinematic chain.
On the other hand, non-fixed-joint-connected links with inertia close to 0 might make your dynamics unstable.
