Q:

How to change a planner's timeout?

I'm trying to change the planner's timeout from the default value. I've looked in the config yaml files, launch files etc, searched online, but couldn't find anything, does anyone have any ideas?
"The timeout for planning must be positive (0.000000 specified). Assuming one second instead."

Which planner? In which context?

I'm using a pathplanning pipeline (it's OMPL but I haven't been able to change the specific algorithm it uses, so it defaults to RRTConnect) and making a planning_interface::MotionPlanRequest . I would like to know if it's possible to change the planning time similar to how Rviz does planning., but in C++.

A:

Still not quite sure what context your working in, but http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/moveit_msgs/html/msg/MotionPlanRequest.html has an allowed_planning_time field (as well as the planner_id field to change the planning algorithm). You can also use the MoveGroupInterface, which has a setPlanningTime method.
