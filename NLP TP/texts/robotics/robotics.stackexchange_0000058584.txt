Q:

How to put headers into devel/include folder with catkin_make?

Have a lib in my package and want to share its header.
According to "how-to" I use this command:
install(DIRECTORY include/${PROJECT_NAME}/
    DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_INCLUDE_DESTINATION})

But after "catkin_make" command no headers are in devel/include folder. (Lib itself successfully appears in /devel/lib folder)
When I run "catkin_make install" command headers appear in install/include folder properly.
What am i doing wrong?

A:

That is fine as it is. The headers don't need to be copied from you package source folder to the devel/include folder. Just make sure that you export the include folder in your CMake file using:
catkin_package(INCLUDE_DIRS include)

And if you use your own headers add the folder to the include directories using:
include_directories(include)

Then any downstream package will find you package headers when adding the include directories with:
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS your_package)
include_directories(${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS})

Thanks. That's was my folly: missed that find_package thing.

This works fine for building, but some IDEs won't be able to find the include directory, as this method doesn't add it to the CPATH variable. The devel/include directory does get added to the CPATH variable, though, so generated messages can be found by the IDE, but not the package's own headers.

Is there a way of getting your headers into the devel/include folder?  Other than installing them there.  In my case, it's for an external project that needs to find things in a standard place.
