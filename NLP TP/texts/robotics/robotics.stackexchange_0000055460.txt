Q:

Workflow of release by catkin_{generate_changelog, prepare_release}

First of all, releasing packages are getting easier and easier and even kind of fun. Thanks for the hard work guys!
I'm a bit confused with the steps of first-time release of a package (that I follow wiki). There the steps go as:

$ cd %HOME_PKG_TOBE_RELEASED%
$ catkin_generate_changelog

Here CHANGELOG.rst files are generated in each package. I modify these files to replace the lines that have Forthcoming with the appropriate version number (and date if I wish). Then,
$ catkin_prepare_release

which bumps version of all packages inside the directory. Problem occurs next; the command complains that there aren't changelog entry corresponding to the new version.

Here I end up manually creating tag and push to the upstream repository, and move to the next steps in the tutorial.
Am I doing something wrong, or is it worth opening an enhancement request?

catkin_tag_changelog does that for you and now catkin_prepare_release does that for you automatically.
The workflow should be:
$ catkin_generate_changelog
<edit changelog entries, do not touch forthcoming heading>
<commit changes to changelogs>
$ catkin_prepare_release
