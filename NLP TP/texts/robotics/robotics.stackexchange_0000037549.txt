Q:

manifest wiki page issues

I was just looking into the use of the <export> tag and noticed a couple of problems on the  wiki page for manifest.xml:

There is an error message:
Unsupported navigation scheme 'Menus/ROSFilesystemConcepts'!

at the top of the page

Clicking on the "manifest.xml tags reference" link takes you to a page titled "ROS packages Fuerte documentation" which doesn't seem correct given that Fuerte isn't out yet.

I feel a vague sense of guiltiness reporting a bug on answers.ros.org--probably it should go on trac but I'm feeling lazy. If in fact it would be better to report it there, it would be nice if every wiki page had a link somewhere that got you to the right part of trac to report wiki problems...
