Q:

a few wierd problems with the ardrone_autonomy

Hi, guys, I have installed the ardrone dirver on my laptop and I am having a few problems when when using it with Ardrone 2.0.

After running the driver, I used this command  rostopic echo /ardrone/navdata, what I find is that the altd and vz are always 0 while vz, vy are updating.

It is found that the video_channel  parameter either being 1 or 0, the image is always published to the /ardrone/front/image_raw and /ardrone/image_raw. The /ardrone/bottom/image_raw topic always has nothing.

I have a node subscribing to the /ardrone/image_raw (callback1) and /ardrone/imu (callback2) topic. I set up a counter that is incremented by 1 in the callback2 function. In the callback1 function, I first print the counter and then set it to 0. What I notice is that the counter value varies a lot. I mean the IMU data is published at 200Hz and the image at 20 Hz. the counter should be around 10, right ?

I really appreciate it if anyone can help with these issues.

A:

I know that it's been a while, but from what I know about the AR.Drone and ardrone_autonomy here's my input:

Is AR.Drone flying? If it's not, then you should see altd showing 0. The velocities are estimated using the bottom camera and they're only going to estimate the x and y velocities, not z.

The video is streamed from the front camera automatically along the /ardrone/front/... topics. Unfortunately, the AR.Drone 2.0 doesn't support streaming both cameras at the same time.In order to get a video stream form the bottom camera along the /ardrone/bottom/... topics you need to call a service to switch cameras using rosservice call /ardrone/togglecam or something similar. Using tab to automatically fill in your commands is very useful.

Not really sure what you're getting at here.
