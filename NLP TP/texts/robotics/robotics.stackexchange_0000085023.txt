Q:

Using a URDF in Gazebo clarification

I'm running on an Ubuntu machine, with ROS Kinetic Kame, and was starting in on this tutorial (see title)
http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/Tutorials/Using%20a%20URDF%20in%20Gazebo
I get the following error:
[gazebo.launch] is neither a launch file in package [urdf_sim_tutorial] nor is [urdf_sim_tutorial] a launch file name

At the terminal prompt, I entered:
user@UBU01-LC:~/catkin_ws$ catkin_make

Followed by:
user@UBU01-LC:~/catkin_ws$ roslaunch urdf_sim_tutorial gazebo.launch

My thoughts: perhaps I don't have files in the right directories, or I'm trying to run from the wrong directory
Any suggestions or advice is appreciated.
Thanks!
Ryan

A:

Have you made sure to source the devel/setup.bash between invoking catkin_make and calling roslaunch?
