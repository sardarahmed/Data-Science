Q:

Parallel compilation : does --jobs works?

Hi,
I have a debian installation of Diamondback and I did not succeed usung parallel compilation.
I may build 2 packages at the same time using --threads, but when only building one package I can't ask it to build in parallel the exe. If I go into my package I can run make -j3 without any problem and it works.
Is it an issue in my CMakeLists or a rosmake issue ?

export ROS_PARALLEL_JOBS=-j3
but there is no way to make the --pjobs working. I have enougth with the former.

This is the actual correct answer. rosmake --pjobs=4 or --threads=4 doesn't work for me either. Neither does export ROS_PARALLEL_JOBS=-l3 (-l instead of -j) as mentioned at http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/EnvironmentVariables#ROS_PARALLEL_JOBS
