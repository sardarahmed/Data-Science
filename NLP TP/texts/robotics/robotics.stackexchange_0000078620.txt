Q:

static transformer question

Hi
I am trying to build a map using slam. I am using Arduino due and Ros indigo, I am capable of  building map with few error
I have this line in my launch file:
node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="base_to_kinect_broadcaster" args="-0.17 0.04 0.1975 0 0 0 \/base_link \/camera_link 100" />

I need to know if this line is necessary and what the parameter after the arg=   mean and how to tune them.
this is my main question.
I hope any one can replay with good answer I just need explanation and how to tune the parameter and what exactly this parameter mean.

Also: not sure whether you added them for the forum, but remove the backslashes (\), they're not needed (nor valid).

A:

Quoting tf - ROS,

static_transform_publisher x y z yaw
pitch roll frame_id child_frame_id
period_in_ms
Publish a static coordinate transform
to tf using an x/y/z offset in meters
and yaw/pitch/roll in radians. (yaw is
rotation about Z, pitch is rotation
about Y, and roll is rotation about
X). The period, in milliseconds,
specifies how often to send a
transform. 100ms (10hz) is a good
value.

static_transform_publisher x y
z qx qy qz qw frame_id child_frame_id
period_in_ms
Publish a static coordinate transform
to tf using an x/y/z offset in meters
and quaternion. The period, in
milliseconds, specifies how often to
send a transform. 100ms (10hz) is a
good value.

To answer your question : The coordinate systems of your camera and base link are different. Each camera image needs to be transformed into the global coordinate system. This transformation happens via the base_link frame. If you run
rosrun tf view_frames

you will see the frames in your system.
To set the arg values properly, identify your base_link coordinate system origin and the camera coordinate system origin, measure the transformation and rotation between the two systems and update x,y,z, roll, pitch, yaw accordingly.

you mean that I need to identify the origin of the camera related to the base link or related to the ground and is x mean here the desired position on x related to the object or mean something else.i am sry if my question is stupid but just to clear thing for me. thanks for answer,

You need to identify the origin of the camera wrt to the base_link.
So (x,y,z) is the origin of the camera's coordinate system in base_link coordinate system.
Eg: If (0,0,0) in camera's coordinate system is (10,-2,5.5) in the base_link coordinate system, then (x,y,z) is (10,-2,5.5). Same with r,p,y
