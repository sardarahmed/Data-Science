Q:

etherCat communication

Hello, it was recommended that i looked at ROS for an AGV system.
The AGV's will be used as order pickers and delivery machines.
We are planing on modifying pallet lifts and interfacing with their controller via etherCat.
Wondering if ROS supports etherCat communication, send/receive.
And if so if you could send me a sample, or a link to one.
