Q:

Conventions in wiki.ros

For example in: http://wiki.ros.org/stdr_simulator/Tutorials/Create%20a%20map%20with%20gmapping there are several sections numbered 0.1
Is the idea that they are strict independent alternatives to each other? It's not totally clear, and sometimes it seems like there's a dependency between identically numbered sections.
Or is that a typo?

A:

That was using level 3 headings instead of level 2 headings so they didn't enumerate properly. I've fixed it and they're enumerated correctly now.
