Q:

Using Dynamixel Motors on Kinetic

I am trying to use Dynamixel motors on ROS-kinect. I am giving this command.
khan@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-dynamixel-motor

and getting this response. I am also trying to install it on Raspberry Pi 3 in which I have installed Jessie Kinetic and having the same response which is as follows.
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-kinetic-dynamixel-motor

Your response is much appreciated. Thank you.

A:

I got dynamixel package running on Kinetic. It is not in apt-get repository yet.
Just create workspace, do git clone of dynamixel repository, then catkin_make. Don't forget to add appropriate source setup.sh line to your .bashrc and restart terminal/roscore before using. It should compile without errors on Ubuntu 16.04 (tested on PC only).
Create normal worksapce:
~$ mkdir -p ~/my_workspace/src
~$ cd ~/my_workspace/src
~$ catkin_init_workspace

Clone dynamixel source code and compile:
~$ git clone https://github.com/arebgun/dynamixel_motor.git
~$ cd ~/my_workspace
~$ catkin_make

Add your new worksapce to bashrc and source it (so it is visible to roslaunch)
~$ echo "source ~/my_workspace/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
~$ source ~/.bashrc

Run your shiny new dynamixel manager:
~$ roslaunch dynamixel_tutorials controller_manager.launch

Should work on Ubuntu 16.04
