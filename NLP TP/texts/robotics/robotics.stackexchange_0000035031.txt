Q:

ROS support for industrial robotic arms?

I would like to purchase a 4-6 axis industrial robotic arm with 3 to 6 kg payload and in the $50K range.  Is there ROS support for any from the major manufacturers, e.g. Kuka, Fanuc, ABB, Motoman, or Denso?  Even Linux support would be acceptable and I could develop the ROS software myself.

A:

Motoman seems to be developing ROS support: http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-software/robot-operating-system-making-its-way-into-industrial-robotics
There is also a ROS integration of the KUKA LWR: http://www.ros.org/wiki/lwr_fri
