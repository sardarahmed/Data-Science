A:

Sounds like a serial port desync / data corruption.
Does the same problem occur if you don't plug in the Kinect?

I tried to plug in kobuki on virtual machine  using another laptop with and without kinect and there is no error no error.
So How can i solve that problem if it's about ports??

Try to use one of the USB2 ports on your laptop for the Kobuki, and use the USB3 for the Kinect only.

let me try it..should i just plug them different ports or should i set ports using some kind of command line command?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-05-26:
Just use different ports. The USB3 ones should be blue(-ish) on the inside. USB2 is black.

I tried; kinect to the 3.0 and turtlebot to the 2.0 port
but again same error.

Try all the ports that you have. There is a chance that if you connect things to different controllers it'll work. But no guarantees. The Kinect v2 uses a huge amount of bandwidth, so different controllers will mean less interference.
All of this assuming that this is the problem, of course.

btw: are you running everything in a VM, or was that just for this test?
Also: please try to use just the Kobuki in your t430. Not in another laptop.

If it's just the T430 btw then I would try and find out if you changed anything lately. Updates to your Linux kernel? Settings you changed?

In the begining there was no error. Gvdhoom i thougt that too,maybe some updates occured that error so i re-installed clean 14.04 and didnt update or upgrade anything. But error stil there. In my opinion it seems like it's all about usb ports. As u mentioned kinect uses huge bandwith.but solution?
