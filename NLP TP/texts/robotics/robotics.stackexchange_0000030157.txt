Q:

deb packages for former "ni" stack

Hi all,
looking at the list of ROS diamondback packages, there are two packages for the former "ni" stack: ros-diamondback-openni-kinect (0.1.1) and ros-diamondback-openni-ros (0.1.0), to me they both seem to install more or less the same stuff. Which should one use, or is this just an artefact?
Best,
Georg

A:

openni_kinect was temporariliy named openni_ros.  It was renamed in later releases.  It will be deleted as soon as all released stacks not longer depend on it.  More information was announced on the mailing list at http://code.ros.org/lurker/message/20110308.224900.56b0ced3.en.html
