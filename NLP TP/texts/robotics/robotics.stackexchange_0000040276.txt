A:

ROS doesn't come with OpenCV. OpenCV is an external library. Having said that, most of the packages have been developed with 2.3.1. I suggest installing 2.4 and submitting tickets to packages that don't compile.
Also, it is preferred to ask only one question per posting so we can close the question when it is answered. You asked 4 questions.
