Q:

can't get ar_track_alvar on Fuerte

Hi, I wanted to get a marker detector like ar_track_alvar but after running
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-ar-track-alvar

it says the package can not be found. It is not also available from source code link
https://bitbucket.org/sniekum/ar_track_alvar.git
May you guide me how to download it or even I appreciate if you know any other marker detection package in ROS?
Thanks in advance.

A:

The debbuild page says that 0.3.0 should be in ros public, have you tried updating your debian info by running:
  sudo apt-get update

As for a source checkout, I believe it was recently moved to github: https://github.com/sniekum/ar_track_alvar

I was trying the source from bitbocket.org not from github.com
and I have a ubuntu 10.04 as operating system. Why I tried to get it from source was cause I couldnt not get it from command line. after updating apt-get, the sudo apt-cache search can not find it even. Thanks
