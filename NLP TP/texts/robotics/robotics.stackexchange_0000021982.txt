Q:

How to find Inverse Kinematics solution to 6 link manipulator planar robot using DH parameters

I want to find out the inverse kinematics solution of 6 link manipulator planar robot, using DH Parameters, but I don't know how to, I know how to calculate for 3 link manipulator but not for 6 links, I found out that we have to use Inverse Transformation Matrices for higher DOF problems but I was not able to find the solution even with those, and I couldn't find any example either, in which they would show how to solve this problem. Can anyone tell me the solution to this problem or provide me with a link to the solution?

A:

This question is a bit too broad to answer here.  I recommend you find a good robotics manipulation textbook and work through it.  Here are three classics:

Robotics: Modelling, Planning and Control by Bruno Siciliano, Lorenzo Sciavicco, Luigi Villani, and Giuseppe Oriolo.  Available on Amazon or pdf.
Robot Modeling and Control by Mark W. Spong, Seth Hutchinson, and M. Vidyasagar.  Available on Amazon or pdf.
A Mathematical Introduction to Robotic Manipulation by Richard M. Murray, Zexiang Li, and S. Shankar Sastry.  Available on Amazon or pdf.

But there are many others on the topic.  I prefer the first book by Siciliano et al.  Note that the last book by Murray et al uses a different formulation for kinematics.  They use Product of Exponentials instead of DH Parameters.
