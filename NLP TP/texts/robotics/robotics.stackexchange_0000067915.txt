Q:

no map receive, Gmappping with Velodyne HDL-32E

Hi All!!
I really need your help!
I am trying to make a map using “Gmapping” package, however I could not receive  any map data from it.
To make 3D scan data to 2D, I use but_velodyne_proc, then /odom date seem to be published correctly over /tf topics.
Also I checked  /tf frame, then it seems fine.
/velodyne(scan frame)-->/base_link-->/odom-->/map
But if I tried to visualize a map with rviz, they said "no map received" and "No tranceform [] to [map]"
I am new to ROS.
Thank you for your time and I will appreciate any help!!

you're welcome

A:

Did you specify the fixed frame in rviz ? To set the fixed frame see the section Global Options in the left panel. Generally we choose either /base_link or /map frame as a fixed frame.
