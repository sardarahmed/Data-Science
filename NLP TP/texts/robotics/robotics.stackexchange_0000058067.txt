Q:

Third-party ros messages

Hello,
Is it possible to write a standalone C++ or Java program that can prompt you for a text for example and then send it as a ROS message which will be received by a listening ros node?
By standalone I mean that it is possible to compile the program on any machine with no need to ros installed, just using the necessary ros libraries.
Did somebody already do that? I don't really understand how ros internally works and any help on how to collect the needed libraries for that would be very appreciated.
Thank you

As a very last resort, you can just implement the ROS network protocol. I would not recommend that, though.

I also found something called ros_bridge which looks vers interesting but i didn't test it yet as I already have a working solution thanks to demmeln.
You can check it here:

Rosbridge works perfectly and I use it now to publish and subscribe to topics. It is very useful and you can implement a control interface for a robot using any programming languages supporting web sockets.
