Q:

tf::createQuaternionFromYaw equivalent in ros2

How should I create a quaternion of a simple yaw (zaxis) rotation in ros2?
The alternative in ros1 were essentially tf::createQuaternionMsgFromYaw or tf::createQuaternionFromYaw but these options are not there anymore.

A:

As far as I know there is no out of the box tf/tf2 function that does that in ros2.
However, you can easily achieve that with a simple helper function e.g.:
auto createQuaternionMsgFromYaw(double yaw)
{
  tf2::Quaternion q;
  q.setRPY(0, 0, yaw);
  return tf2::toMsg(q);
}
