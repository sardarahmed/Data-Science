Q:

OpenCV3 - Install extra-modules ROS Kinetic

Hello everyone !
I know there's already a post about this subject : http://answers.ros.org/question/229246/how-to-build-opencv-extra-module-while-opencv-is-installed-with-ros/ but there's no answer.
OpenCV3 is included with ROS Kinetic.
Is there a way to install opencv extra-modules while opencv is already installed  ?
Thank you for your help !

A:

Hey Matt,
the OpenCV package that is installed with ROS already include the extra-modules with exception of the
neural networks I guess. Have a look at the opencv3 ros package. The question how to compile and
install only the extra-modules is a question I also interested in. But until now I get now answer for it, too.

Manuel
