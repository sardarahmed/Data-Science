Q:

Trying to install dependencies

Trying to install dependencies for rgbdslam following the instruction on the page:
rosdep install rgbdslam_freiburg

But I keep getting the error saying:
ERROR: Rosdep cannot find all required resources to answer your query
Missing resource XXXXXXX

Basically, it is missing the resources that it is suppose to install, like octomap.
I've tried grabbing the missing resources manually, using rosws, but got stuck at octomap, where the error pops up even though octomap is already in the package path. So I decided to double back and try to investigate what I did or assumed wrong in the first place.
Any help?

A:

I assume that the missing resource is octomap_server? To install this you can run sudo apt-get install ros-DISTRO-octomap-mapping. Then try to run rosdep install rgbdslam_freiburg again. All other dependencies should be installed afterwards.

Thats a bit odd, wouldn't the sudo apt-get install ros-DISTRO-octomap-mapping install all the rosdeps automatically for you anyway?

No, the sudo apt-get install ros-DISTRO-octomap-mapping will install the dependencies of octo-mapping, not the dependencies of rgbdslam. So you still need to run rosdep install to install the other rgbdslam dependencies.

It still doesn't work. And the following problem occurs:
