Anyone using the new XBOX One Kinect?

Does anyone know what or when to expect the new XBOX One Kinect sensor to work with ROS (Openni2?)

EDIT : Thiemo from the Institute for Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bremen has released a kinect v2 driver! Check out this post from ROS news for more info.
The folks over at openkinect seem to be hard at work in hacking kinect v2.  There's not much info on the wiki page as of this post, but some of the threads on the forums are quite encouraging.

I got it working on Ubuntu 14.04 and ROS Indigo up to the point where I can see the colored point cloud in Rviz. I think you just have to follow the instructions here : https://github.com/code-iai/iai_kinect2

Hey, I tried the same. I installed libfreenect2. But for me the issue is that I cannot even run with Protonect. So I was wondering whether my USB controller has any issue. I get no devices found when I run Protonect. Although the USB port is USB 3.0. Which USB controller are you using?

I also use USB3.0. Do you see the kinect listed with the lsusb command ? Did you try to run Protonect with the options gl, cl or cpu ?
Comment by srik11 on 2016-01-20:
Hey!, Thanks, found the issue. libusb was not the latest version. But now Protonect runs with cpu and gl but does not run with cl. I am guessing opencl is not completely installed. I have an intel GPU, so i am not able to install beignet. for my kernel 3.16. Did you face this issue?

In the beginning I also had issues, I saw only black windows with no data I remember. I have a nVidia GPU. There was a rely I gave, you can have a look : http://answers.ros.org/question/209393/how-can-i-use-kinect-v2-with-ros-in-ubuntu-1404/
Did you get the kinect2_bridge working ?

You guys should really ask a new question so others can benefit from your answers.
