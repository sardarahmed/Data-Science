Q:

MoveIt2 Tutorials Getting Stuck

Just trying out MoveIt2 on Humble (source install as described on MoveIt PikNik site here) and have an issue where some of the tutorials (those involving RvizVisualTools) are getting stuck.  Initially I encountered the problem in a VM but tried with a native install to the same effect.
I initially found the issue when trying the Visualizing in RViz tutorial (here).  After some testing I found the issue also in other pre-packaged tutorial examples.
Those in particular I have found so far are move_group_interface_tutorial, motion_planning_api_tutorial, and motion_planning_pipeline_tutorial.  For each of these three here are my observations:

move_group_interface_tutorial:

Gets stuck after first click of 'Next' button
The planning result is played back in RViz but execution never seems to continue after the call to move_group.plan(my_plan)

motion_planning_api_tutorial:

Never gets past first prompt for 'Next' button (i.e., clicks do nothing)

motion_planning_pipeline_tutorial:

This one just works...

Via experimentation it seems the culprit is the addition of the SingleThreadedExecutor spinning in a separate thread but I can't figure out why some cases are working and others not (and getting stuck in different calls).
Anyone else seeing same/similar behavior by chance?
I will keep investigating but I felt the fact some of the tutorials were non-functional worth mentioning.
Thanks,
Brett
Update:
I just found this issue which I believe to be the same:
MGI CallbackGroup doesn't trigger callbacks when running external Executor #1474

A:

I am going to mark this as answered as I am pretty sure this Github issue (bug -- currently still open) captures my question.
