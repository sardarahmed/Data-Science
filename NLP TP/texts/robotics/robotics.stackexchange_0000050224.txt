Q:

How to move turtlebot for a certain pre-defined distance

Hello
We would like to write a code that makes Turtlebot move linearly to a specified distance, for example 2.3 meters.
We would like to know what will be the best strategy to implement this?
One way that we thought about is to send a constant linear velocity on topic twist.twist.linear.x and stops after a certain time t such as t=distance/velocity.
Is this a good approach?
is there any other better strategy?
Thanks
Anis

A:

One approach that is slightly better than timing is to use TF to see how far you've gone. One example I know of is using TF to measure angle in an older piece of code we used to draw a square on the ground using a TurtleBot. Doing a distance comparison should be even easier than angle comparison. In a straight line, the odometry of a Turtlebot shouldn't be too bad so TF should provide a more repeatable distance than timing (especially over longer distances at slower speeds).
