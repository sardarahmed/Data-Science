Q:

path planning for turtlebot using moveit planner

Can I use moveit planner as global path planner for the turtlebot navigation? More precision: ros automatically use Djiasktra for path planning when navigating a turtlebot. I want ros to use one of the planner available in moveit or OMPL for path planning. How can I do this? I use ros Kinetic

A:

To extend the above answer:
You can definitely use OMPL inside of navigation. All the planners and algorithms are pluginlib plugins. You can create an OMPL plugin to replace the global planner that uses Dij. / A*. There are a few out there already if you search through GitHub.
Ex.
