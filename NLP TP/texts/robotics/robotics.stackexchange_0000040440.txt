Q:

installing artoolkit

Whenever I rosmake artoolkit package I get the following error..
  mkdir -p build
  if [ ! -f ARToolKit-SVN-r311.tar.gz.md5sum ]; then echo "Error: Couldn't find md5sum file ARToolKit-SVN-r311.tar.gz.md5sum" && false; fi

The md5sum file that is shown missing is present in artoolkit directory.

Comment by piyushk on 2012-05-13:
Note that the script is able to find the md5 file, as it does not echo "Error: Coudn't find...." to the screen. This looks like a failure in downloading the tar file itself.

A:

I agree with @piyushk, it's a problem downloading the tar file. Somehow the SSL protocol seems to be a problem:
SSL routines:SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO:unknown protocol

On my PC, it works fine; maybe just try again (it might be that the server had a hiccup). Or just replace "https://" by "http://" (the file is also served without SSL).
