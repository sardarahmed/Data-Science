Q:

"colcon_core.package_augmentation" Error When Building Python Package With Colcon in ROS2 Humble

I get the following error when trying to build my python package with Colcon build
    [0.235s] ERROR:colcon.colcon_core.package_augmentation:Exception in package augmentation extension 'python':
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/colcon_core/package_augmentation/__init__.py", line 97, in augment_packages
    retval = extension.augment_packages(
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/colcon_installed_package_information/package_augmentation/python.py", line 44, in augment_packages
    dist = next(iter(dists))
StopIteration

What could be the reason for this error and how can I solve it?

A:

My error went away after I ran the following commands:

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade

Running these commands updated the following packages which fixed my issue:

python3-colcon-cd
python3-colcon-core
python3-colcon-installed-package-information
