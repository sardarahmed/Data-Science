Q:

Creating models for household_objects_database

Hi, I'm trying to add a new model in a local version of the household_object_database so I can recognize my own objects with the tabletop_object_detector.
I made a model in Solidworks and exported it to STL format, which I exported again to PLY format using Blender. Then I deleted all models from my local database and used insert_model.cpp to add my own model and added it manually to a model set, the database seems fine now. The problem is, when I launch tabletop_complete.launch I get the following error:
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'  
what(): std::bad_alloc

Everything works when I use the original models from the database, so I suspect that the model I made is faulty. Is there a better way to create models?  I also tried 3DSom as described in the link below, but 3DSom is licensed and doesn't work properly for me. Are there any other ways to create 3D models? Thanks in advance!

A:

My teammate solved the problem today, it appears that the household_database uses models specified in meters, while the model I had was specified in centimeters. Specifying the size in meters solves the problem.
As for ways to create 3D models, it doesn't matter what application you use, as long as it is able to export the model to PLY format. I used models created in 3DSom, Solidworks and 3dSMax and converted them to PLY format with Blender, which worked perfectly for me.

I used the latest version of the household_object_database, but I removed all objects in it for my own use.
