Q:

what realtime patch should I use with ROS?

ROS and Orocos are both capable of running realtime priority threads.  What Realtime patch is the preferred method for realtime under Ubuntu?
Userspace support for RTAI and Xenomai are both available in repos, but there does not seem to be corresponding kernels available.  I would prefer to use a prebuilt kernel if possible to simplify repeatability.

A:

That depends on the real-time requirements of your system: both response times and ability to tolerate occasional lapses.
Vanilla Linux kernels provide good real-time performance these days. Unless your system requires very low response times or very hard guarantees, I recommend sticking with the stock kernel until measurements reveal a need for something more.
If hard real-time is needed, the simplest Ubuntu upgrade path is probably to install the linux-rt kernel, with Ingo Molnar's real time preemption patch.
In either case, you probably need to set some PAM variables in /etc/security/limits to  [grant non-root users permission](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuStudioPreparation#Real-Time Support) to create SCHED_FIFO threads.

Good point about decent real-time in vanilla.  Thanks for the pointer to the limits file.
