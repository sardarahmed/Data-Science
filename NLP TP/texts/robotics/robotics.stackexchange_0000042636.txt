Q:

Starting nodes on remote machine with different ROS version

Hi,
I have some launch files that I can start on my control pc that run some nodes on the robot, which is a different pc.
The robot I am working with recently gut updated to ros fuerte, while my control pc still uses ros electric. (If I was in charge I would upgrade the control pc, too, but this is not my decision, I will talk to the responsible people)
Now the problem is, the launch files do not work cross-version.
This is the output I get:
remote[i60sr1-0] starting roslaunch
remote[i60sr1-0]: creating ssh connection to i60sr1:22, user[bublitz]
remote[i60sr1-0]: ssh connection created
remote[i60sr1-0]: env: /opt/ros/electric/ros/bin/roslaunch: Datei oder Verzeichnis nicht gefunden

[i60sr1-0] process has died
remote roslaunch failed to launch: sr1

It looks like roslaunch is trying to start another instance of roslaunch on the remote machine, gut is looking for roslaunch in the wrong place.
Now the question is: Is it possible to run nodes remote on a different version of ros? If yes what should I do? I already tried setting the ROS_ROOT variable in a script that is called by env-loader, but that dosn't do it.
Thanks for any help.

A:

Have a look at the documentation for the machine tag. You can set ros-root and ros-package-path for each machine.
Using two different ROS versions might cause all different kinds of problems and should be avoided though.

Yes. The short answer is: "don't mix ROS distros at runtime, it hurts".
