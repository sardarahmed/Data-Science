Q:

How do I dereference a namespace name in my launch file?

I want to use the name of my namespace in my launch file, to do some more things, but for that, I would have to dereference my namespace name in the launch file like we dereference arguments using $(arg argument_name)
Any idea how this can be done?

Hi @electrophod
How about using the Group option that provides the XML launch. Like so:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<launch>

  <arg name="ns0" default="ares"/> <!-- Namespace 0 -->
  <arg name="ns1" default="ares"/> <!-- Namespace 1 -->

  <!-- Group namespace 0 Nodes -->
  <group ns="$(arg ns0)">
    <!-- Include nodes that works in namespace 0 -->
    <include...>
    ...
    </include>
  </group>

  <!-- Include nodes that works in global namespace -->
  <include...>
  ...
  </include>

  <!-- Group namespace 1 Nodes -->
  <group ns="$(arg ns1)">
    <!-- Include nodes that works in namespace 1 -->
    <include...>
    ...
    </include>
  </group>

</launch>

And call it like this:
roslaunch package my_launch.launch ns0:=namespace_0 ns1:=namespace_1

I do not know if that is exactly what you want, if it not the case I will update the answer.

In my experience, it is rarely necessary to parameterize the namespace string. If you use the  tag, the namespaces will naturally nest, without the developer doing anything further.

@Mike Scheutzow I guess so, but maybe it is an interesting way of organizing your worspaces, for intance let us imagine that we need to work with a fleet of vehicles which is lanched and controlled concurrently with the same architecture.
