Q:

Missing Package pr2_mechanism_msgs in pr2_mechanism stack

I'm running ROS Fuerte and Ubuntu 12.04.  I downloaded the stack "pr2_mechanism" using the mercurial repository listed here.  The command I executed was:

$ hg clone https://kforge.ros.org/pr2mechanism/hg pr2_mechanism

When I try to compile package "pr2_mechanism_diagnostics" within this stack, I get the following error:

Failed to invoke /opt/ros/fuerte/bin/rospack deps-manifests pr2_mechanism_diagnostics
[rospack] Error: package/stack pr2_mechanism_diagnostics depends on non-existent package pr2_mechanism_msgs

The package "pr2_mechanism_msgs" should be in the stack "pr2_mechanism" since it appears in the repository's web interface.  However, the package is not included when I clone this repository using the command above. The only packages included are:

pr2_controller_interface
pr2_controller_manager
pr2_hardware_interface
pr2_mechanism_diagnostics
pr2_mechanism_model
realtime_tools

Why is pr2_mechanism_msgs missing?

A:

Why are you installing from source? Just take the debian package:
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-pr2-mechanism

Thanks.  I did not know there was a pre-built debian package available.
