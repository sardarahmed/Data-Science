Q:

sdf robot model slippery, slides no friction

Hello
I got an issue with a humanoid robot modeled in sdf format. The model itself is fine. However, my problem is the model slips, slides, and can't stay in place as soon as i move a joint (via plugin of window).
The model plug in is not the problem in this case.
I tried inserting the  tags,    tags but they don'e work.
I suspect I need a separate world plugin but i am not sure about this since the model already has a plugin.
You anyone please advise?
Thank you

Please post your SDF files, and tell us what version of Gazebo you're using.

i am using Gazebo I am not comfortable posting the whole sdf file. Can i post an sdf file that has only the lower body, that is with links (visual + collision) and joints?

thank you hsu i will saw the mu values and they are way higher than what i have, in fact these values are crazy high. i will post some of the code for the links and joints once i figure how to properly use this website.

It will be hard to debug your problem without a complete SDF file. We can take this offline so that you don't have to post a complete SDF. Please contact me using nate@osrfoundation.org

A:

Ideally, it will be sufficient if you can post a simple (stripped down) version of the model that others can use to reproduces the problem.
Here is an example of usage of friction (not a terribly good one because we are using a very large mu as the place holder until we get better contact properties).  But in general, contact friction should have an effect in simulation.
It's possible the problem might be more than just contact; for example you can isolate the issue by turning off controllers/plugins to see if friction behavior changes.
