Q:

rosbridge 2.0 limit bandwith

Hi, I'm using rosbridge to have a web-based user interface with my robot.
As some of the message I want to check are published quite fast, the amount of CPU and bandwith required is high.
There is any option to limit the bandwith or the refresh rate?
I'll be happy receiving only one every four messages or something similar.
I'm using ROS hydro and Ubuntu 12.04.
Thank you!

A:

Take a look at the throttle_rate parameter in roslibjs (https://github.com/RobotWebTools/roslibjs/blob/develop/src/core/Topic.js#L21). This will place a delay between messages inside of rosbridge and decrease bandwidth.

I've changed the default throttle_rate from 0 to 200 and now messages are displayed much slower. However, I think that the data transmitted between the robot and the website is still the same. Is there any other "throttle_rate" like param for the rosbridge webserver?
Comment by rtoris288 on 2015-03-17:
throttle_rate is sent directly to rosbridge server, no throttling is done client side. Passing this parameter through the client should have rosbridge limit the rate at which is sends that topic across the wire.
