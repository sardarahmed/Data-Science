Q:

How do I add a repository Ubuntu Bionic

My output of
cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list

is
deb http:packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu main

So I want to replace this as its missing the distribution name.
Searching at https://repogen.simplylinux.ch/generate.php I am shown the following:
###### Ubuntu Main Repos
deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/  main 
deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/  main 

###### Ubuntu Update Repos
deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ -security main 
deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ -security main 

My question is: How do I replace my malformed repository with the one I found at the repogen website?
Thank you

Is
deb http:packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu main

a typo? It seems to be missing the // between http: and packages.ros.org/...

I wouldn 't use repogen for this: it seems to be slightly out-of-date (only lists Bionic (alpha 2)), it doesn't help you configure the ROS repositories and seems to be more geared towards setting up the main sources.list. For ROS you'd use an add-on file (ros-latest.list) which is not part of sources.list, but placed in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ (which is a directory, not a file).

A:

It's just a text file, so you can edit it using nano, vim, joe, gedit, anything. You will need to use sudo though, as it's a file in a non-world-writable location (ie: only root may change it).
On my system (ROS Melodic on Ubuntu Bionic) ros-latest.list contains:
deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu bionic main

Note the bionic between http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu and main.
The following command will write this line to the ros-latest.list file:
echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu bionic main" | sudo tee /etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list
