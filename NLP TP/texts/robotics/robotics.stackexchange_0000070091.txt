Q:

Question about nodes

Hi all,
I have a question about how nodes are implemented in ROS. From what I understand the "type=" definition refers to an executable file that ROS runs. Consider this example:
Now when I go into the robot_state package I don't find an executable called robot_state_publisher. Would anyone care to explain why that is?
Regards,
Devin

A:

You are right, type="<EXECUTABLE>".
The robot_state_publisher is defined in the robot_state_publisher package (not robot_state, this is just a name for the node).
However, if you install executables from apt-get (or build them yourself), they don't end up in the package, but in /opt/ros/<DISTRO>/lib/<PACKAGE>/<EXECUTABLE> (or <CATKIN_WS>/../devel/lib/<PACKAGE>/<EXECUTABLE> if you compile it yourself).
However, nodes need to be implemented in a special way. Check out this tutorial for a simple example. Make sure to read the in-source comments.
