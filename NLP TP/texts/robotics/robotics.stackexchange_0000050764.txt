Q:

sending goals at real time to a robot

How to send goals at real time to a robot without using rviz? (the coordinates of the goals on the map are known)
I want to write a code to get a message in the terminal like this:
'press 1 to go to (8,2)'
// (8,2) x,y is the coordinate of the goal.

Have a look at the above link.I am using a similar program to send goals to the robot. Davinci  is right that you need tell us more about the setup. If you are using your own robot not a Turtlebot then you need setup navigation stack before sending goals

Yes I know this one but it is not enough to make an interface with the user. It is not turtlebot, it is my own robot.
