Q:

What is the Windows equivalent of launch-prefix="xterm -e" for launch files?

I am moving from Ubuntu to Windows 10 (using Melodic) and I can't seem to find the equivalent to launch-prefix="xterm -e" for windows. What I am trying to do is open each node in a separate window from the master when I run the launch file. Here is my launch file (with xterm still there):
> <launch>
> 
>     <node pkg="cpp-test"
>         type="listener"
>         name="test_listener"
>         output="screen"
>         launch-prefix="xterm -e">     </node>
>   
>     <node pkg="cpp-test"
>         type="talker"
>         name="test_talker"
>         output="screen"
>         launch-prefix="xterm -e">     </node>
> 
> </launch>

There is also the issue that I am not opening a standard command window, but rather a custom one from a shortcut. So my question is what command can I put in the launch file so that I can open up a separate window for the master and both nodes?

Not an answer, but: could start be used here? Together with the shortcut that you use to open a "regular ROS cmd window"? Potentially append a %* (not sure this is needed) so that all args (ie: actual node executable path and args) are passed as args of the shortcut?

A:

This is a new use case for me. start is a cmd.exe intrinsic command, so cannot be used directly. However, you can use it in combination with cmd.exe:
launch-prefix="cmd.exe /K start"
This does launch the node in a new window, which correctly captures the output of the node.
However, on a cursory view, it doesn't appear to propogate the ROS command line to the launched tasks. I've created a task in the Windows porting status to track this. https://github.com/ms-iot/ROSOnWindows/issues/108.

Thanks, this does what I need it to do. It would be nice to have ROS command functionality too, but for now this is a good solution.
