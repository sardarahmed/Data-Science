Q:

Stationary/inertial reference frame

In Modern Robotics by Kevin Lynch, there is a term "stationary" frame, but this is never defined. Googling shows that this is synonymous with inertial frame.
Apparently inertial frame means rigidly attaching an accelerometer to a frame would show that the frame has 0 acceleration.
However, in Modern Robotics, it says body frames, which are attached to moving objects, are also inertial frames. How is this possible? If the body frame is attached to a baseball bat, and our robot swings the bat, won't the frame undergo acceleration?

A:

Due to the way that frames are defined in the Modern Robotics book (and in this type of vector-field mechanics in general, such as those of Featherstone), both the spatial frame and the body frames are defined as stationary inertial frames. This requires a bit of a different conceptual understanding than the more traditional moving frames that have been "attached" to moving bodies in most dynamics textbooks.
As stated in the MR quote in the answer by JJB_UT, the body frames that are used to perform calculations at each instant in time are defined as the stationary inertial frames that are in the same pose (position and orientation) as the more classic moving body frames might be at that same instant. This key difference is what enables a lot of the simpler math in MR compared to other dynamics textbooks and notations.
