A:

There are a couple of good posts about converting bag files to CSV, which can be imported into excel: http://answers.ros.org/question/9102/how-to-extract-data-from-bag/ and http://answers.ros.org/question/55037/is-there-a-way-to-save-all-rosbag-data-into-a-csv-or-text-file/
For the very simple case of extracting a simple message on a single topic, rostopic echo -b file.bag -p /topic works quite well.
