Q:

Octomap in rgbdslam

I am trying to build 3d indoor map using rgbd slam package. I am using ros fuerte version. I am confused which package of octomap to be installed for mapping with rgbdslam package. In tutorial, the link is given only for electric version.
Any body have idea about it?

A:

To install octomap in Fuerte, just run
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-octomap ros-fuerte-octomap-mapping

Make sure that there is no other version of octomap_mapping / octomap_server in your $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH and compile rgbd-slam. It should then compile and link against this installed version of octomap.
