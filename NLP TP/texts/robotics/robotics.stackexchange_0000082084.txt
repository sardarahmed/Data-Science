Q:

Two problems with the p3dx! Stalls and emergencies and the white "MOTORS" Button

Hello,
I have two questions or problems with my Pioneer 3 DX.
I am using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with ROS Kinetic Kame and the p2os package,
After a successful connecting with the p2os_driver I have to push the white "MOTORS" button at the side of the P3DX. Is there a terminal command to release the brakes / the engine so I can start right away? Without pushing the white button?
My second question:
If I drive with the p3dx with a high construction it comes that the robot wiggles in curves and turns off. Is there a way to disable the ESTALL / STALL emergency? Change some parameters? I read, that is possible with the ARCOS see Pioneer 3 Operations Manual at STALLS AND EMERGENCIES.... But I do not understand how to do this with the p2os package...
Thanks in advance

You definitely found the right way to do the motors. You might look at the launch files -- there's several in the p2os_launch package that do most of the motor enable commands for you. As for the ESTALL/STALL emergency, I don't know off the top of my head, but, if you file an issue on the repo

I can get to it when I have a few.

A:

If you change the ARCOS configuration parameters and save them using the ARCOScf tool, then the parameters will be saved and used as defaults for all future connections.   Software such as p2os could override the parameter for its current connection session by sending certain commands, but I would guess that p2os probably doesn't do this for STALLVAL.
Make sure your added construction or equipment is balanced and is not too heavy.  See the robot manual for recommended payload weight limit for good control.
