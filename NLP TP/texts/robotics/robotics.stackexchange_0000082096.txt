Q:

Simulating quadrotor with Realsense in Gazebo

Dear all,
i am trying to make a real quadrotor with realsense so as to avoid the obstacles, but before that, i think it will be necessary to simulate this in the gazebo to try the algrithm, cause you know, crashing in the real world really costs a lot.
i have been searching for the suitable model for a couple of days, and now i am trying to use hector-quadrotor and equipped with a realsense r200. is it a good idea for my situation? or can anyone give me some tips on how to make it ?

Saw your question about simulation in gazebo. I am going to do the same thing. do you have finished this simulation? I am trying to use hector -quadrotor and equipped with a realsense r200 in gazebo to simulation. but I have no idea to do it. can you give me some suggestion? thank you very much!

there was a xacro file of realsense, but i don't see such a file in the package presently. there is a launch file named spawn_quadrotor_with_kinect.launch in hector_quadrotor_gazebo\launch, adapt it to realsense version, and it will work.  if need any help,email me at  whiskysolo@126.com

A:

I may suggest RotorS from ETH. They have implemented a lot of algorithms with a various models of multirotors, including a framework for easily transporting the algorithms to a real quad.

Hope this could help.
