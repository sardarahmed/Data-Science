Q:

3D plot using rxplot

Hi,
I have the messages /master_position   with x, y, z
so I using command
rxplot -M 3d /master_position/x /master_position/y /master_position/z

or
rxplot -M 3d /master_position/x:y:z

but it didn't work and got this error
rxplot: error: You may only specific 2 or 3 topics with '3d' or 'scatter'.
When 2 topics are provided, time is used as the third axis.

Thanks

Update: bug is now closed, will be included in next release.
This is filed as a bug here:
https://code.ros.org/trac/ros/ticket/3376
I'm hoping to get time later this week to close out some rxplot tickets.
