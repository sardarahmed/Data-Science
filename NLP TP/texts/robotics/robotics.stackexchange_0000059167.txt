Q:

Problem with getCostmapCopy() in Hydro

Hi!
I'm trying to move code from Fuerte to Hydro. In the old code there was:
costmap_ros_->getCostmapCopy(costmap_);

but this function is no longer exist in Hydro. How Can I replace this?
Thanks

A:

Instead of accessing a copy, you can just access the costmap itself with getCostmap()
