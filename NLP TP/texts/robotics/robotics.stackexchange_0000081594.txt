Q:

PR2's `robot claim` Source Code?

Is there source code out there somewhere for the PR2's mechanism for  claiming a robot? I used to know where it was when I had a PR2.

A:

It's in the pr2-core debian package (not a ROS package):
The executable: https://github.com/pr2-debs/pr2-core/blob/master/root/usr/bin/robot
And the library: https://github.com/pr2-debs/pr2-core/tree/master/root/usr/lib/robot

Looks my easter eggs are still there, and ClearPath has added a few of their own.
