Q:

Waiting for action server when using SimpleActionClient

In my code, I have constructed a SimpleActionClient with the MoveArmAction interface to communicate with move_right_arm action. I have also launched the right_arm_navigation.launch file from pr2_3dnav, but the code does not get past the "move_arm.waitForServer()". It does not throw any errors and the terminal where I launched the right_arm_navigation.launch shows the same "Move arm action started" message before and after I ran my code. I tried reading the debugging messages from the rxconsole, but didnt get very far.
We are currently using Diamondback on our PR2.
Does anyone have/had the same problem?
Thanks,
Nash

A:

I just ran across this error - check and make sure that you are specifying the constraint_region_orientation for the PositionConstraint. You need to either give it a valid orientation or if you just want the identity, make sure that constraint_region_orientation.w = 1.0.  By default, ROS quaternion messages are initialized to all 0.0 which is an invalid orientation.

Thanks!, I had to specify valid constraints for both position and orientation for it to work.
