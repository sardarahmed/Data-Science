Q:

Tutorial about how to move ackermann vehicle

Hello,
I have created an ackermann vehicle. (http://wiki.ros.org/ackermann_vehicle)
Does anyone know if there are anywhere tutorials on how to control/move this vehicle and to link a map to a vehicle?
I searched for some tutorials regarding ackermann vehicle but could not find any.
Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.

A:

The ackermann_vehicle subscribes to aackermann_msgs/AckermannDriveStamped on the ackermann_cmd topic.
You should be able to use the ackermann_qt node to control your simulated vehicle: http://wiki.ros.org/ackermann_qt?distro=hydro
