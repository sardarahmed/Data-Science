Q:

Is anyone using perl with ROS?

I am very new to ROS...
I am much more familiar with perl than Python, but can't seem to find any information (perl modules, etc...) for interacting with ROS from perl.  Is there a good reason for the lack of perl support (other than no one has done it yet)?
I have been read through the various documents (Technical Overview, TCPROS, Slave_API, etc...) but am having a little trouble understanding exactly what needs to be done to implement the perl code to interact with ROS.

A:

Mostly, there are no Perl bindings because no one has done it, and it's kind of a lot of work; you have to implement the XMLRPC node API, service clients and servers, topics, and message generation.
I knew Perl and C++ when I started working with ROS, and I picked up enough python to work with ROS fairly quickly.
