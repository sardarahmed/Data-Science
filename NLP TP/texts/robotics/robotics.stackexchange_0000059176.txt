Q:

Tf has two or more unconnected trees

Hi,
I am new to ROS and I am trying to run the indoor example of the hector_quadrotor packadge. I followed the instructions ,ran the launch file (indoor_slam_gazebo.launch) and rviz and gazebo windows appeared. The problem is that rviz shows errors in the laserscan, map and robot model all of which are related to not having a transform and having two unconnected trees. I made an image of the tf tree and this showed two seperate trees: a world tree and a base_link tree.
How can I fix this?

A:

Fixed the laser and robot model by setting the fixed frame parameter in rviz to base_link. The map still gives the error "no transform from [map] to [base_link]"

For the map to base_link you need to run a form of localization. such as slam_gmapping or amcl
