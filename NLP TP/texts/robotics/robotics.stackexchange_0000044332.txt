Q:

ImportError: No module named rospkg

Hi Guys,
I was trying to follow the tutorials under rosserial_arduino from this link:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Hello%20World
But I have gotten an error message for this command:
rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyUSB0

I got following error message:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/sanket/ros_workspace/rosserial/rosserial_python/nodes/serial_node.py", line 38, in <module>
import roslib; roslib.load_manifest("rosserial_python")
  File "/opt/ros/fuerte/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/roslib/__init__.py", line 50, in <module>
from roslib.launcher import load_manifest
  File "/opt/ros/fuerte/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/roslib/launcher.py", line 42, in <module>
import rospkg
ImportError: No module named rospkg

Thanks in advance.

A:

This specific error should be resolved by installing rospkg.  On Ubuntu install python-rospkg via apt.
