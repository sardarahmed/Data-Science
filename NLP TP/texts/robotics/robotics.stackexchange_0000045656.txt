Q:

Can't start gazebo

I am just starting with ROS. On a new Ubuntu 12.04 installation, i issued apt-get ros-fuerte-* and installed everything (except openni-dev that needs SSE3 and i have only SSE2).
Now i can't start gazebo!!
roslaunch gazebo_worlds empty_world.launch

BTW, /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/simulator_gazebo/CMakeLists.txt shows 1.6.16. I am confusing this with 1.0.2 (written in above log) and 1.2 on http://gazebosim.org !!
Please help me getting started with ROS.
Thanks

Should roscore be already running before gazebo ? Trying it gives me at the end:

Comment by SL Remy on 2012-11-11:
1.6.16 is the version of the simulator_gazebo (ROS) package.. it uses Gazebo 1.0.2 which is a standalone piece of code.
Comment by SL Remy on 2012-11-11:
Can you edit your question and include some information? What operating system are you using? (e.g. Ubuntu Precise, Debian Squeeze, etc.). What is the result of lspci |grep VGA (what graphics card are you using)?
Comment by SL Remy on 2012-11-12:
Could you try roslaunch gazebo_worlds empty_world_no_x.launch
Comment by amh on 2012-11-12:
still the same error (Update 2)
Comment by amh on 2012-11-12:
@Amal Please check my Update 3
Comment by SL Remy on 2012-11-13:
@amh roslaunch starts a roscore if there isn't already one running

A:

It seems that it truly may be the gazebo server that is segfaulting...
