Q:

Create a clock (datatype/md5sum) for slam_gmapping

I have managed to do teleoperation, laser scan as well as passing tf to the slam_gmapping node. (As shown in the rxgraph below)

The only thing that is missing now is the "/clock" topic which has a md5sum datatype.
Question:

How to create a clock to use slam_gmapping on lego nxt instead of pr2?

A:

Why do you need the clock topic? It is only used when the use_sim_time parameter is set to true, otherwise your computer's clock is used. You can find more information here.
