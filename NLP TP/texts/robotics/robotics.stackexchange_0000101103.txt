Q:

robot arm control with ros/arduino

I just started ROS, I wonder if ROS with Arduino could control my robot arm and solve kinematics and inverse kinematic equations in real-time run? Does anyone have a similar experience?

Hi @mahmoud_shaban
Yes it is possible to use ROS with Arduino to control robot arms. There are very good examples how to apply Forward and Inverse Kinematics.
is it real time? From an industrial controls point of view it's not. However, you wouldn't use Arduino in those settings in general.
Take a look at this example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-XXnPHYhxs
