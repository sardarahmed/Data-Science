Q:

How can I setup skeleton tracking using a Kinect and ROS Indigo on Ubuntu 14.04?

I read about openni_tracker, but that doesn't work with Indigo, so, I'm struck. Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks!

hey buddy!!!!!!!! did u got any help ??? i also need to use this..

A:

It's not true that openni_tracker doesn't work on Indigo. What is true is that openni_tracker is not released as a debian package on Indigo i.e. as of right now, it can't be installed via apt-get. There have been some recent issues with properly releasing the package.
Note that the README for the package mentions that in newer versions you will need to install the NITE package separately before using the package. So your general steps are going to involve

Downloading a NITE package and unzipping the archive
Running the install.sh script as root to install the package
Clone the openni_tracker repository into your ROS workspace src/ directory
Run catkin_make to compile the package yourself.

If you run into compilation errors (ignore warnings about deprecated Xn functions), then you likely haven't installed the NITE package correctly. If openni_tracker builds, but it won't run for some reason, then you need to do some further debugging steps. Here are a few good resources:

Issue 9 on the openni_tracker GH page has some nice debugging tips

I am currently trying to get openni_tracker to run. I just wanted to see what command is being used to run openni_tracker. I am trying to run it with rosrun openni_tracker openni_tracker but this returns that it can't find an executable.

That's the right command. Likely, either you don't have your environment/workspace setup correctly (have you sourced the setup.bash?), or you haven't successfully built the openni_tracker package with catkin_make.
