Q:

Not able to use roscd command as it gives error

I get the following error when I use roscd:
Inspiron-5559:~$ roscd beginner_tutorials
roscd: No such package/stack 'beginner_tutorials'

But everytime when I source the setup.bash file then it works:
Inspiron-5559:~/catkin_ws$ . ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
Inspiron-5559:~/catkin_ws$ source devel/setup.bash

Then
Inspiron-5559:~/catkin_ws$ roscd beginner_tutorials
Inspiron-5559:~/catkin_ws/src/beginner_tutorials$ 

Hence I need to source the file everytime for roscd to work..How do I remove this error?

A:

Yes, you have to source your workspace everytime. If you're working with only one workspace add
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

to your .bashrc file and every time you open a new terminal your workspace will automatically be sourced.
If you use more than one workspace you may encounter some issues if you do this for every workspace you use so you'll probably want to manually source your workspace in that case.
