Q:

Extreme CPU usage when ploting using rxplot and rxbag tools

Hello all.
For some reason when I plot data using rxgraph or rxbag tools, the CPU usage explodes.
For example :
I trying to plot some fields of a topic that consist of 20 numerical fields and published on rate of 10Hz (not a high rate for my understanding).
when I attempt to plot at the same time 10 different graphs, the CPU usage jumps to over 90%.
The CPU usage not really improves even if I record and play a bag file.
Can anyone offer an explanation for this phenomenon ? Or suggest a way to deal with this problem ?

A:

rxgraph is pretty old and has degraded over time. I would suggest checking out rqt if you are using ROS Fuerte or Groovy. RQT is much better maintained at this point in time.
