Q:

rosinstall openni_kinect error

Hi,
when I do
rosinstall ~/openni_kinect /opt/ros/electric 'http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_kinect?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=openni_kinect.rosinstall'

I get the following error message:
rosinstall ~/openni_kinect /opt/ros/electric 'http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_kinect?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=openni_kinect.rosinstall'
Is not a local file, nor able to download as a URL[http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_kinect?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=openni_kinect.rosinstall]: [Errno 104] Connection reset by peer couldn't load config uri

http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_kinect?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=openni_kinect.rosinstall  This can be caused by empty or malformed remote rosinstall

Is it the link? or the remote rosinstall file have problems ?

A:

The ROS wiki hasn't been super reliable over the past few days. Try again and see if it works. You could also try downloading the rosinstall file separately, and using rosinstall with the local file.
