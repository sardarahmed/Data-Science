Q:

Failing to load my Global Planner

Hey Guys,
I am following this tutorial to write my own global planner.
Everything seems to work fine and I can see my plugin, when I call:
rospack plugins --attrib=plugin nav_core
but if I want to use it I keep getting this error:
Failed to create the dijkstra_planner/DijkstraPlanner planner, are you sure it is properly registered and that the containing library is built? Exception: MultiLibraryClassLoader: Could not create object of class type dijkstra_planer::DijkstraPlanner as no factory exists for it. Make sure that the library exists and was explicitly loaded through MultiLibraryClassLoader::loadLibrary()
Could this have something to do with my ROS version? I am using indigo und not hydro like in the tutorial.
I would be very thankful if anybody could help me.
Greetings

A:

That usually happens when you don't call PLUGINLIB_EXPORT_CLASS. Do you have the appropriate call to PLUGINLIB_EXPORT_CLASS at the end of the source code for your plugin?

Yes, I do, it is at the beginning of my source code like in the tutorial.
