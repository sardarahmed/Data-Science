Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: map_server

I'm trying to launch a map_server with a given map.yaml + bitmap, but nothing happens :
$ roscore &
[1] 12749
...
$ rosrun map_server map_server cave.yaml 
[ INFO] [1360845376.280636084]: Loading map from image "./bitmap/cave.png"
$ rostopic list
/rosout
/rosout_agg
$ rosservice list
/rosout/get_loggers
/rosout/set_logger_level

The map_server node doesn't appear to be running and doesn't show up in rqt_graph. What am I doing wrong ?
Cheers
edit: Here's the cave.yaml file.
image: bitmap/cave.png
resolution: 1
origin: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
occupied_thresh: 0.65
free_thresh: 0.196
negate: 0

edit2: ROS version is Groovy.

Is you resolution really 1m/cell?

No. I was just trying to get things working.

A:

This is what happens when map_server cannot find the bitmap file. There was a typo in my yaml config file.
