Q:

MsgSrvDoc links 404 on wiki: how to correct?

Hi,
I've noticed in the wiki page of move_base that the links to the message documentation are broken (404).
They lead to http://docs.ros.org/en/move_base_msgs/html/action/MoveBase.html
They should lead to http://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/move_base_msgs/html/action/MoveBase.html
I tried to correct it on the wiki but it seems they are auto-generated.
<<MsgSrvDoc(move_base_msgs)>>

## AUTOGENERATED DON'T DELETE
## CategoryPackage
## CategoryPackageROSPKG

Does anyone knows how to make it correct or notify the right person that can correct it ? It seems this issue is global with every packages and every distro.

Looks like this is still fall-out from Migration of docs.ros.org content into /en prefix.
This is not limited to move_base.
I noticed the same when posting on Discourse, but assumed it would clear up after everything had been rebuilt or sorted out. Perhaps that's not the case.
Perhaps @tfoote can comment here.

A:

Thanks for noticing this it was a missed url element in the migration.
It's fixed in https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/roswiki/pull/321 and should be live on the site.

To answer completely the question, I assume the best way to handle this kind of issue is contacting you ?
