Q:

Problems rqt_plot array

Hi!
I am trying to plot a topic /mytopic/taskSpace/position[0] using rqt_plot. My ROS version is Indigo and I have Ubuntu 14.
When I type in the console rostopic echo /mytopic/taskSpace/position[0] I can see the values, but when I make
rosrun rqt_plot rqt_plot /mytopic/taskSpace/position[0] The values are not plot. Also there is not errors in the console. Even when I add again the same topic, the console shows PlotWidget.add_topic(): topic already subscribed: /mytopic/taskState/position[0]
I don't know how to solve this and it would be very usefull for me since I need to plot a lot of topic in order to check my code.
Than you so much!

A:

I could find the solution. For someone with the same problem, it is necessary to fill the time stamp data in the message
msg.header.stamp = ros::Time::now()
