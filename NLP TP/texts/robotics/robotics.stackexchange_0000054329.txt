Q:

Move base to absolute coordinates?

Hi again,
I'm playing around with actionlib and smach trying to make my robot move to four specific absolute points on the map. I'm using MoveBaseGoal to drive the robot, however, it seems to accept only cordinates (i.e. the target pose) relative to the current pose (/base_link frame).
How do I make my robot move to an absolute point on the map (relative to the /map frame that is) without having to translate it from /map to /base_link everytime?
Thank you!
Cheers,
Hendrik

Not /map but /odom which in this case is basically the same as /map (statically the same position/orientation). I'll try using /map instead.

Oh, wait, you said the target_pose... nope, that's set to /base_link. I'll try that with /map as well. Totally overlooked that... //edit: works! Thanks a lot! Sometimes it's the smallest things that have greatest influence...

A:

Are you setting the frame_id of the requested target pose to /map?
