Q:

make_plan service call fail

Hi everyone,
When I call to make_plan service of move_base node I get this error:
move_base must be in an inactive state to make a plan for an external user
I've checked that when I execute call() function, move_base is in Active mode. After that the action that is being executed is canceled, it passes to the preempted state. I suppose at that state it could be possible to make a call so I wait calling periodically to exists() service method to check if the service is both advertised and available.
I don't get it working well, so I would like to know what I'm doing wrong or if there is another way to check service's availability.
Thanks

I have also added this as a bug on the github nav-stack page:
make_plan service call should be available at all times
