Q:

Error in bring up Turtlebot3

Hi, i am very new to this. When I launched my turtlebot3, the lidar starts spinning and it seems to be working but get this message:
[ERROR] [1501190507.582025]: Error opening serial: [Errno 2] could not open port /dev/ttyACM0: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/dev/ttyACM0'

The thing is I previously connect the opencr board to with wrong wire and it caused a short, so the opencr board is likely to be damaged. Is this error message related to the short problem.
Thanks!
