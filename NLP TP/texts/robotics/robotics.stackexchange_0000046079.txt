Q:

From arm_navigation_msgs::RobotTrajectory to pr2_controllers_msgs::JointTrajectoryGoal

Hi everyone,
I'm looking for a solution for this problem in Internet, but I'don't found anything.
I'm working with OMPL planning, and when I find a plan, I'd like to execute in the PR2 Controller.
Anybody know how I can do it??
From: arm_navigation_msgs/RobotTrajectory trajectory
to: pr2_controllers_msgs::JointTrajectoryGoal
Redards.

A:

arm_navigation_msgs::GetMotionPlan::Response response;
pr2_controllers_msgs::JointTrajectoryGoal goal;

goal.trajectory = response.trajectory.joint_trajectory;
