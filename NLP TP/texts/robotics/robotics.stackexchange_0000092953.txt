Q:

catkin_make_isolated ignore package

Hi all,
is there a way to specify some packages to ignore while invoking catkin_make_isolated ?? I'm looking for some command line option, I already know about CATKIN_IGNORE.
I tried -DCATKIN_BLACKLIST_PACKAGES as I would when using catkin_make but that doesn't seem to have any effect.
Thanks.
Edit: Couldn't find anything, thus opened catkin #1027.

cool for fixing this :-) This is worth a self-answer that you can accept :-)

A:

As I couldn't find anything to blacklist packages while invoking catkin_make_isolated, I added a blacklist option - see
catkin #1027.
Use :  catkin_make_isolated --ignore-pkg foo bar
