Q:

Package using pcl make error

hi, I used a source code from
pcl/range_image & visualization
in my ROS package(pcl_tutorial) to create a range image. But when i make the package, i get an error
In file included from /opt/ros/fuerte/include/pcl-1.5/pcl/visualization/range_image_visualizer.h:44:0,
from /home/karthik/Desktop/OpenCV/sandbox/pcl_tutorial/src/pcd2range_image.cpp:13:
/opt/ros/fuerte/include/pcl-1.5/pcl/visualization/image_viewer.h:41:28:
fatal error: vtkImageViewer.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.

I have highlighted the lines which i think has the error. Please help me out with this error.
I would like to make you know that :- as in the highlighted lines /opt/ros/fuerte/pcl-1.5/pcl/visualization/image_viewer.h ,i checked out the directory, which is named pcl-1.5. But i installed pcl from
pcl/Downloads
(prebuilt binaries) which happens to be pcl-1.6(as seen in ubuntu software center)
And the error vtkImageViewer.h , from my synaptics package manager, i found vtk has dependencies of pcl 1.6 which are installed and pcl 1.5 which are not installed.
Should i uninstall all pcl-1.6 packages and install pcl-1.5 because my ROS uses pcl-1.5(as i assume from the above) or should i reinstall vtk5.8.0-5(as seen from synaptic package manager) is there any other way?? please help me out.

Putting the solution itself or the summary of it would be better.
