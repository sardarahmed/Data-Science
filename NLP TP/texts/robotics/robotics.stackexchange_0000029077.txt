Q:

Failed to load plugin (gazebo-11)

Hello, I am using ROS2 Foxy (built from source) and gazebo11 (installed by command sudo apt install ros-foxy-gazebo-ros-pkgs) on Ubuntu 20.04.1. When I  try to follow the test from installing tutorial (http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros2_installing&cat=connect_ros) I get an error:
[Err] [Plugin.hh:178] Failed to load plugin libgazebo_ros_diff_drive.so: libgazebo_ros_diff_drive.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
on the step:
gazebo --verbose /opt/ros/eloquent/share/gazebo_plugins/worlds/gazebo_ros_diff_drive_demo.world
I already cheeked GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH, it point directly to the folder where the .so file is located.
Thanks for helping.

Hi @faade,
Did you source the ROS 2 workspace in the terminal that you are running Gazebo?
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash

Regards
