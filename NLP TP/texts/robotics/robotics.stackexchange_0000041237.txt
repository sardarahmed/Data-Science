Q:

Sleep command in launch file?

Hi,
Is there any way to make a launch file sleep between executing different nodes and launch files?
Also is there any way to write some logs from launch file ?
Thanks!

Can you give more information about what you're doing that you need the sleep for?

A:

Launch files intentionally make no guarantees about the timing or order in which various nodes start running. It is a basic ROS concept that each node should start and run independently, while others may come and go.

Many kinds of logging are available, via launch files and other mechanisms. What are you looking for?
