Question about laserscan and hector_slam mapping

Hello, I am using hector slam to build the map with original balgfile odometry data.
The picture is the result with delayed laserscan data overlayed on map. I have set laser_z_min_value=-200, laser_z_max_value=200, laser_min_dist = 0 ,laser_max_dist=200 in the launch file, by which I think all the scan data has been included to build the map.
My question is: what does the color of laserscan particles in Rviz mean? As for area of ① ⑤, the red particles form a boundary, while ② ③ ④ have no red particle(maybe some orange particles), and there is no boundary formed at all. If the color represents the particles of the same height, then why area ④ with high density of light green particles forms no boundary?

That's weird

A:

In RViz->Displays->Laser Scan->Color Transformer, you can set the laser scan colours to reflect the intensity of the laser scan. The colour depends on the intensity of the laser scan message received; first, the intensity at each point is normalised, and then a colour is computed based on that intensity. You can read more on the rviz wiki.
