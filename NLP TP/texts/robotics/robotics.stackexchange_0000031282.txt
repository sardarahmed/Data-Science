Q:

Why are corners not detected in images with chessboard fiducials?

Using pose_estimator in tod_training for creating a training base, I wonder why sometimes the pose estimation fails. On fat_free_milk from tod kinect training data pose could be estimated on all of its images.

This might also be an OpenCV issue since the underlying cv::findChessboardCorners in OpenCV does not return any corners. How come?

Thanks for your suggestion.

You might want to reword the question headline. It doesn't read as a question.

A:

Some things to try:

Bring the object closer; maybe the chessboard is too small.
Mess with the lighting; even with a black-and-white image, things are tricky.
Make sure you're giving OpenCV the correct chessboard size; it wants the number of rows/cols, not the number of corners, IIRC.

Sorry for the misunderstanding. The chessboard was detected in about 80% of all pictures similar to the one in my question, WITHOUT incorporating your suggestions. I hope I can try whether using your suggestion pushes the success rate to 100%. Need the laboratory though for this.

Thanks for the suggestions. Using a larger chessboard seems to be a prospective idea to try next time. It worked in 80% of all test cases, so I think the general configuration was correct. In my case, lighting should not be changed too much. The OpenCV mailing list shows similar issues.
