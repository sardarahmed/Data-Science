Q:

Camera calibration and fish eye cameras

HI all,
Can camera_calibration package be used to calibrate fish eye cameras?

A:

The quality of calibration will depend on the type of lens youÂ´re using. For very high FOV lenses, camera calibration will likely fail or give unusable results, as the pinhole camera model that is used behind the scenes via OpenCV does not work with high FOV (> 180 deg, projecting points onto an image plane and all that). See also this answer at stackoverflow. For moderate fish-eye effect, calibration might work, though.
Your best bet is probably using OCamCalib for determining proper calibration (see also comment in the link I posted above). After determining calibration parameters, you should be able to use your own variants of the world2cam and cam2world functions (If possible, you could even provide a ROS package with their implementation, so everybody can use them ;) ).

Thank you. I dont have a fish eye lens with me at the moment. Will try it out when I get one. OCamCalLib looks promising
