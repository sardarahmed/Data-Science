Q:

Is there a way to manually enter transforms in RViz between two cameras?

I have two Kinects and want to merge the point clouds from each one into a single scene in Rviz.  However, from what I have seen RViz can only handle one camera at a time.  How might I add more than one camera and how once I have the extrinsic calibrations, could I manually enter the transform between them?

A:

rviz can handle multiple cameras, provided they are all properly linked by a tf tree. If you want to manually calibrate two cameras against each other, you could write a small node with a tf TransformBroadcaster and modify the transform it publishes via some kind of GUI. This way, you could adjust the relative camera positions in real-time. Using a interactive marker for this would result in a system that is pretty intuitive to use. Not sure there´s an implementation of this directly available (probably yes, but I´m not aware of it).
