Q:

How do you use ignition gazebo?

Trying to use ignition Gazebo with the following command
ign gazebo world.sdf

but it doesn't load and I don't get any feedback
Looking at the help it doesn't actually seem to have that command
The 'ign' command provides a command line interface to the ignition tools.

  ign <command> [options]

List of available commands:

  help:          Print this help text.
  msg:           Print information about messages.
  topic:         Print information about topics.
  service:       Print information about services.
  fuel:          Manage simulation resources.
  log:           Record or playback topics.
  sdf:           Utilities for SDF files.

Options:

  --force-version <VERSION>  Use a specific library version.
  --versions                 Show the available versions.
  --commands                 Show the available commands.
Use 'ign help <command>' to print help for a command.

A:

The missing support you are looking for is being currently shipped in cmdgazeboX.rb files (where X is the major version)
~ ‚ùØ dpkg -L libignition-gazebo5-dev | grep cmd.*.rb
   /usr/lib/ruby/ignition/cmdgazebo5.rb

I would recommend to follow install instructions and use the latest metapackage avaiable (Edifice release in the moment of writing this). The metapackage should leave everything ready to run.
