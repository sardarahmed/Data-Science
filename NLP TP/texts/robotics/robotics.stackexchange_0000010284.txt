Q:

Mounting a gimbal BLDC motor

I'm trying to build my own motorised camera gimbal using a BLDC like this, where the shaft is hollow. Does anyone know how the camera platform should be mounted? Should a shaft be somehow pressed into the hole?
Any thought appreciated.

A:

On gimbal motors, the two sides of the motor casing are the mounting points. The hollow shaft allows you to feed wiring through the motor.
If you look at the motor you have linked more carefully the two sides are split and have bolt holes on them. So you just mount the motor with those.
