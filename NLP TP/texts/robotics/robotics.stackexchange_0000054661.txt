Q:

Format of source.yaml for Development Test for svn

I'm eager to take advantage of Development Test for my svn packages. In its REP (137), looks like svn is supported but what URL does source.yaml require?
I haven't seen any svn repositories listed in either Groovy nor Hydro. I assume it might be the path of the top directory of a package in either trunk/branch/tag (eg. in our case https://rtm-ros-robotics.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/rtmros_common) ?

A:

SVN is still supported. The only difference is that the version information is encoded within the URL. SO the URL must point to a specific tag or branch.
