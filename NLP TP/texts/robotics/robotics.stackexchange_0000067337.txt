Q:

Where is the c++ documentation for geometry_msgs in hydro?

I found the c++ docs for geometry_msgs in diamondback: http://docs.ros.org/diamondback/api/geometry_msgs/html/index.html.
When I replace "diamondback" in the URL with "hydro", it's a stub: http://docs.ros.org/hydro/api/geometry_msgs/html/index.html
After lots of searching, I can't seem to find the hydro docs in any other location.
Do the docs I'm looking for exist? If so, where?

A:

rosdoc_lite is not able to document generated code in catkin packages. So the API documentation of the generated message code you are looking for does not exist afaik.
