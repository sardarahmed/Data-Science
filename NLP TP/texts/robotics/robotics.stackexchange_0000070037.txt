Q:

Displaying Big Maps in RViz

I have a large map that I'm trying to display in RViz.  However, it appears highly downsampled. The debugging is shown here:
[DEBUG] [1445440488.123087442]: Received a 10032 X 6075 map @ 0.020 m/pix
[ WARN] [1445440488.187623157]: OGRE EXCEPTION(3:RenderingAPIException): Zero sized texture surface on texture MapTexture1 face 0 mipmap 0. Probably, the GL driver refused to create the texture. in GLTexture::_createSurfaceList at /build/buildd/ogre-1.8-1.8.1+dfsg/RenderSystems/GL/src/OgreGLTexture.cpp (line 420)
[ WARN] [1445440488.188283064]: Failed to create full-size map texture, likely because your graphics card does not support textures of size > 2048.  Downsampling to [2048 x 1240]...

Is there any way to get around this restriction?
