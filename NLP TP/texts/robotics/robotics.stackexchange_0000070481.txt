Q:

ImportError: No module named RPi.GPIO

I use ubuntu 14.04 on Raspberry Pi 2.
I installed rpi.gpio
$sudo pip3 install RPi.GPIO 

ubuntu@ubuntu:~/catkin_ws$ rosrun ros_start led_blink.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "/home/ubuntu/catkin_ws/src/ros_start/scripts/led_blink.py", line6, in <module>
    import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
ImportError: No module named RPi.GPIO

Please tell me the solution.

A:

Afaik ROS doesn't use Python 3, but Python 2. You'll have to install RPi.GPIO for Python 2 (if possible).
