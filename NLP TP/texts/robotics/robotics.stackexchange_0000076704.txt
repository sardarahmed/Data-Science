Q:

Running Turtlebot_gazebo error

I'm trying to run turtlebot_gazebo but I have some problems.
Here's the subject in details. I'm running ROS kinetic which is supposed that it can't link to gazebo as far as I know. I installed gazebo with the help of your site, however, the package I got and installed was called turtlebot_simulator, and turtlebot_gazebo was inside it (if I misunderstood the thing let me know). I tried to launch it using " $ roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch" but this didn't work. Finally, I browsed to folder "launch" inside turtlebot_gazebo and tried to launch it using "$ roslaunch turtlebot_world.launch" and it gives me the following error:
Invalid  tag: environment variable 'TURTLEBOT_GAZEBO_WORLD_FILE' is not set.
Arg xml is 
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file
how can I fix it?
Thank you
