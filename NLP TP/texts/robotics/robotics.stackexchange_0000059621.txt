Q:

how to extract a topic data from a text file using matlab?

I did the following
rostopic echo /topic_name > filename.txt 

Then I got a text file the contains the data of the topic...
I want to save the data using matlab code in arrays
for example I have the following text file:
 secs: 4113
  nsecs: 565000000
  frame_id: ''
pose: 
  position: 
   x: 5.0
   y: 5.0
    z: 5.0
  orientation: 
    x: 0.0
    y: 0.0
    z: 0.0
        
    w: 0.0
 --- 
 header: 
  seq: 2544
  stamp: 
secs: 4113
nsecs: 590000000
  frame_id: ''
pose: 
  position: 
   x: 5.0
y: 5.0
  z: 5.0
 orientation: 
x: 0.0
   y: 0.0
   z: 0.0
    w: 0.0
---

I want to save the pose position.x = [ 5 2 ..... ]
same as for y and z.. I want to save the data in arrays using matlab ?
