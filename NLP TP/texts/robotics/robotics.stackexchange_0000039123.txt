Q:

Gmapping for indoor aerial vehicle?

Hi.
I would like to combine gmapping for indoor aerial vehicle.
Something similar as http://robotics.ccny.cuny.edu/blog/node/152
However, I think they used custom Gmapping, not a stack on ROS.
Clear path to achieve will be
Subscribe IMU to correct laser scans with respect to attitude.
Subscribe height from some sensor (sonar, laser).
Provide corrected information to gmapping.
If there is an implementation to do this, it would be great to know that.
If it is not, it is good to know that how to provide height information to gmapping.
