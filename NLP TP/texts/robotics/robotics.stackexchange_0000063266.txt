Q:

Reading information from yaml document

I want to access the map information from map.yaml . Can I use the basic C++ file handling to read all the fields from the file? I tried using yaml-cpp but its instructions were clumsy and even if there were no compiler errors, I could not get rid of dereferencing errors during run time. Is there a tutorial on ROS to demonstrate how to read map data from yaml file?

A:

Maybe this topic can help you to solve your problem. But if I were you I would be more specific. I have many programs with reading yaml files, but from your question I don't understand very well yur problem.

My code is working now. And the dereferencing error was because I was passing a wrong argument as file name.
