A:

The IRI of an OWL identifier does not have to coincide with the file from which the data is loaded, and does not even have to exist. It is intended to be a globally unique identifier.
For example, the RoboEarth namespace http://www.roboearth.org/kb/roboearth.owl# is used for all information downloaded from the RoboEarth knowledge base which is usually not in the roboearth.owl file.
In the tutorial that you have probably followed, you have downloaded the respective OWL file from RoboEarth, it should have been cached in the file re_comm/tmp/serveadrink.serveadrink.owl
Alternatively, you can also manually search the RoboEarth knowledge base after creating an account at http://api.roboearth.org/

KnowRob is a complex system and requires some understanding of the underlying knowledge representation techniques. I'd recommend to start with the 'getting started' tutorial that refers to an OWL tutorial which explains these terms: http://www.ros.org/wiki/knowrob#Tutorials
