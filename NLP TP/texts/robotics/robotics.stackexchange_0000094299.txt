Q:

ros2 launch xml example

I see that a yaml and xml front-end was added to ros2. In the feature request I see that there was intent to add support for these to the ros2launch cli, but I am struggling to create a .launch.xml file and launch it with ros2launch
Are there any full examples of creating an xml launch file and then using the launch cli tool to run it? The design document and the test here show me the syntax, but I'm still unsuccessful.

A:

There is a tutorial about how to migrate launchfiles from ROS1 to ROS2: https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Tutorials/Launch-files-migration-guide/.
There are some XML examples in the demos, e.g. in this folder: https://github.com/ros2/demos/tree/master/demo_nodes_cpp/launch/topics.
It would be a great contribution to add more examples to the demos.
About your questions in the github issue:

If I have a launch file, how can I get it running?

ros2 launch /path/to/file_launch.xml

Do I need to create a package, do I need to add it in package.xml whatsoever...

No necessarily, as commented above.
If you do want to install some launchfiles with a package, you can:

(cpp package): https://github.com/ros2/demos/blob/948b4f4869298f39cfe99d3ae517ad60a72a8909/demo_nodes_cpp/CMakeLists.txt#L207-L211
(python package): Install the launchfiles in the share folder using data_files argument of setuptools setup. Like here, but with a launchfile.

In those cases, you will be able to do:
ros2 launch package_name name_of_launch_file_launch.xml

In case you have problems running a specific launchfile, you can copy it here and I will try to help.
Best,
Ivan

That worked, thanks! Nonetheless, I would add it somewhere on index.ros.org
