Q:

/opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash : No such file or directory found

I have installed ROS Noetic on my Virtualbox with UBUNTU 20.04. Every time I run this command: source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash. I get the above mentioned error. I have tried removing this line from .bashrc file..(was not there...I added it and then removed it...no difference). The problem is I cannot find setup.bash file anywhere. Also I reinstalled by making new folder and opening it terminal. Still no difference. This setup file does not seems to be downloaded or the directory is completely unknown,

If that file can't be found, I'd make sure you've correctly installed ROS.
What's the output of dpkg -l | grep ros-noetic?

A:

Hello, thank you for the reply. Yes you are correct. It was not installed correctly. I ran: sudo apt install ros-noetic-desktop-full  .... again and the problem got solved.
