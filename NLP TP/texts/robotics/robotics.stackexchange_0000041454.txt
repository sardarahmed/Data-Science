Q:

Check if roscore is started in C++

Hi, what is the best way for a C++ application to check if roscore has already been started? I think I would like to avoid doing a system() call. Catching exceptions is also an undesirable feature for me because I am working on a Qt application. Thanks!

A:

There is the roscpp API function ros::master::check(). Note that you have to call ros::init before. ros::init won't block, instantiating a ros::NodeHandle will block and wait for the core though.
