Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: ROS on windows

Hi! I'm Korean college student.
I succeeded in communicating between Windows and Ubuntu using the example in hydro / win_ros.
(windows - hydro, ubuntu - indigo)
If I try to run the ROS code using visual studio2015, I get a link error.
I also made various settings as shown on the wiki.
Is there a way to solve it?
Also, I would like to compile with open source code by adding the ROS code, would not it be a problem?
thanks

win_ros has not been maintained for a very long time (and Hydro has been EOL for quite some time now too). Do you really need to use win_ros, or do you just need to be able to communicate with a ROS node graph from Windows? If the latter, you could look at rosbridge_suite, ..

.. ros.net, rosserial_windows or perhaps even ROS on Win10/WSL (#q238646).

A:

ROS 2 does support Windows! You write your windows code in ROS 2, then use the ros1_bridge on your Linux system to communicate with ROS 1.
