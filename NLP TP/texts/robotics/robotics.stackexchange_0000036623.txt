Q:

LaserScans not in the Map

Is there a node that returns all of the LaserScan points that are (probably) not in the map?
Edit: Clarification: I was assuming a static map relative to a robot that has already been localized. What I'd like to be able to say is "these laser scans are of the wall (which has always been there) and this person shaped blob of laser readings is new."

Could you add some detail to this question? What map (local or global from costmap_2d with s standard nav_stack config? or something entirely different?)? And do you mean the points there are to be inserted into a map as fresh obstacles or a "scan" representing things your scan missed in the map?

A:

For future users who stumble upon this question, I've written a node (not yet pushed to our public repository) that does this task.
