Q:

Installing an older version of a ros package by source

I used to run version 1.8.9 of openni_camera, and I'd like to revert back to an older version of it. The source is found here.
This is actually a commit between versions 1.8.8 and 1.8.9. Does anyone know how I can go about installing this package through source?
I've previously installed openni_camera as a deb package, and have uninstalled it using sudo apt-get --purge remove ros-groovy-openni-camera. What I've tried so far is putting the source folder into my catkin workspace (~/catkin_ws/src), and using catkin_make in ~/catkin_ws, but I'm faced with an error:
$ catkin_make

I'm running Ubuntu 12.10 on ROS Groovy, and using an Asus Xtion Pro Live. Please help!

A:

dynamic_reconfigure requires cfg file to be executable. So doing:
$ chmod a+x cfg/OpenNI.cfg

should be enough to make it compile.
It might be not very good idea to use commits between releases though, since there can be unfixed bugs. So I hope you know what you are doing.
