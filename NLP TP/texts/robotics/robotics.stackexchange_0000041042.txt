Q:

rgbdslam and octomap under ROS electric

I am quite confused by the octomap packages since it doesn't specify details on how to get it run on electric. I cannot update my ros to furte cuz my whole lab is using electric version.  Right now I'm trying to use octomap to save and view the map I get from rgbdslam package. But when I run rosrun octomap_server octomap_saver filename.bt  it shows the following:

chong@ubuntu:~$ rosrun octovis octovis filename.bt
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named octovis below /home/chong/rospkg/octomap_mapping-experimental/octovis
[rosrun] Found the following, but they're either not files, 
[rosrun] or not executable:
[rosrun]   /home/chong/rospkg/octomap_mapping-experimental/octovis
[rosrun]   /home/chong/rospkg/octomap_mapping-experimental/octovis/src/octovis

and by the way I've already done
chong@ubuntu:~$ cd rospkg
chong@ubuntu:~/rospkg$ svn co http://alufr-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/branches/octomap_mapping-experimental/
Checked out revision 2780.

so does anyone know why this happens? and how can I solve it? and detailed instructions will be appreciated because I am new to ROS and even ubuntu... Thanks !

A:

You've checked out the source code but you have not compiled it.
$ rosmake --rosdep-install PACKAGE-NAME
