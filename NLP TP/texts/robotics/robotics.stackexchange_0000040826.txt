Q:

Running the turtlebot on fuerte/12.04

Hi!
Does a tutorial for setting up my workstation for interacting with the turtlebot under fuerte exist yet? I am working on a recently rebased Fuerte and Ubuntu 12.04 computer. To change over the turtlebot I followed this:
http://mirror.umd.edu/roswiki/Robots(2f)TurtleBot(2f)fuerte(2f)Robot(20)Upgrade.html

I understand fuerte is a new release, but I was unable to find any good notes on how to patch my workstation.
Thanks!

A:

You can do this by doing

sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-desktop-full
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-turtlebot
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-turtlebot-apps
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-turtlebot-viz

It should get your workstation in good working order with dashboard and what not.. Wish they would have not mirrored my untested wiki mod for fuerte yet.
