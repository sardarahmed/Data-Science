Q:

Gazebo depth sensor not working properly in RViz?

So im busy setting up a proper simulation environment for my robot. During the process i added depth sensors in the URDF file of the robot and images come out great. Though pointclouds show me planes instead of points. So there is a problem somewhere.
To verify it was my problem only i opened up the turtlebot in gazebo and rviz and it shows me the same thing as for the robot i'm working on. So it is a problem for me in general, but I've no idea what it can be. Maybe i've failed to install an important part?
Anyone has an idea? Thanks in advance
For info, im on 14.04 and running Indigo

I'm trying to reinstall ROS, maybe that will help
EDIT: that didn't help

A:

The problem seems to be I'm running Ubuntu as a virtual machine, which doesn't give gazebo enough juice or something. So if anyone runs into this problem, stop using a VM.
