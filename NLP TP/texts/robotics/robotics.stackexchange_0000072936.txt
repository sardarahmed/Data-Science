Q:

No able to use rosserial_arduino

Hello guys, I built ROS indigo on my pi 2 and tried to use the rosserial_arduino (after making my workspace having rosserial metapackage with catkin_make install). The problem is that whenever i try to initialize serial communication with an arduino with rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM0,it just says : No such file or directory. I checked my ports with ls /dev and my arduino is on ttyACM0. Please help me out.
EDIT
This problem was solved by rebuilding my workspace with catkin_make install but new errors have crept up again :
This is the error now on executing rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM0
Traceback (most recent call last):

It looks like part of the error message is missing; can you edit your question to include the command you're running and the full error message?

No. I copy pasted the error message. That's all it says. Nothing more. I checked.

Hey guys i solved it. All i had to do was rebuild my workspace with catkin_make install and install the diagnostic_msgs package into a source built ROS distribution. Thank you all for your help.
