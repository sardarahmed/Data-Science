Q:

automatic playing of bag files

hello everyone
my question is simple: I have two bag files to be played in sequence. Is there a way (for example, a launch file) to make this sequential execution automatic without need to perform it manually from the shell?
I want, in particular, first bag to be played. After end of playing, second bag must be executed. I can't use something like
rosbag play bag1.bag bag2.bag  

since first bag has a timestamp whose year is 1970, so second bag cannot be played before 40 years are past...
thanks for support

A:

What about:
rosbag play bag1.bag
rosbag play bag2.bag

in a shell script.
