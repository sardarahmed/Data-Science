A:

To cite the Installation instructions for indigo:

ROS Indigo ONLY supports Saucy (13.10)
and Trusty (14.04) for debian
packages.

On 16.04 you need to install kinetic.

Completely correct! On 16.04 only Kinetic and above is supported.
When you want to use Indigo you need to install Ubuntu 14.04
