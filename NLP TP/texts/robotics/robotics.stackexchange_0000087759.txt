Q:

What is the most recommended SLAM package to use on MRS1xxx LiDAR?

I want to be able to use SLAM to map an area, save the map with the capability of restoring it at anytime, and ultimately tell my robot (which contains encoder-based servo motors ) to drive to a specific location in the map itself.
I previously tampered with a turtlebot3 and its SLAM capabilities, and i was wondering if there exists a package that best offers these functionalities for the LiDAR.
I'm relatively new to ROS; thus, there might be some terminologies that i may be unaware of. However, thanks to the ease of use of this wonderful framework, i been learning pretty quickly.

There are multiple packages you can use but since you have encoders and Lidar, I recommend Navigation Stack. It will do just what you're wanting and has an excellent tutorial that accommodates a beginner.
