Q:

Planner is not working for Baxter simulator in Rviz and with Moveit

I installed Baxter and Moveit simulator to work with Baxter as said here.
However, I am having an issue, the planner is neither working in Rviz if I just drag the interactive marker and then plan nor if I run this tutorial. It keeps failing when I drag the marker in Rviz and then plan and when I run the tutorial code, it keeps saying no motion plan found.
My PC also hangs after running the Gazebo and Rviz together for about 5 minutes, it has 16 gigabytes of RAM with a core i7 processor. So, capacity of the computer should not be an issue.

@Geoff could you please help?

A:

I figured it out, after running the commands from Baxter simulator tutorial, you first need to run the following commands in two separate terminals from this tutorial :
rosrun baxter_tools enable_robot.py -e
rosrun baxter_interface joint_trajectory_action_server.py

Then you need to select command "With Electric Gripper(s)" and run the following command:
roslaunch baxter_moveit_config baxter_grippers.launch
