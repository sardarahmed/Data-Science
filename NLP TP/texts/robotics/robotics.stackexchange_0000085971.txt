Q:

Implementation of a* algorithm on turtlebot simulation

Hello, I am working on Ubuntu 14.04 and ROS Indigo. I am trying to implement relaxed a* algorithm as given in this tutorial. I am new to ROS and I dont have actual turtlebot. I want to run this with a simulation of turtlebot.
I am getting following error when I run roslaunch relaxed_astar test.launch:
process[move_base-27]: started with pid [14681]
[ INFO] [1521382205.529584483]: Initializing nodelet with 4 worker threads.

This is my test.launch file:
 <launch>
 <include file="$(find turtlebot_bringup)/launch/minimal.launch"></include>

   <include file="$(find turtlebot_bringup)/launch/3dsensor.launch">
     <arg name="rgb_processing" value="false" />
     <arg name="depth_registration" value="false" />
     <arg name="depth_processing" value="false" />
     <arg name="scan_topic" value="/scan" />
   </include>

   <!-- Map server -->
   <arg name="map_file" default="/home/deepali/catkin_ws_turtlebot/src/relaxed_astar/maps/my_map.yaml"/>
   <node name="map_server" pkg="map_server" type="map_server" args="$(arg map_file)" />

   <!-- Localization -->
   <arg name="initial_pose_x" default="0.0"/>
   <arg name="initial_pose_y" default="0.0"/>
   <arg name="initial_pose_a" default="0.0"/>
   <include file="$(find turtlebot_navigation)/launch/includes/amcl/amcl.launch.xml">
     <arg name="initial_pose_x" value="$(arg initial_pose_x)"/>
     <arg name="initial_pose_y" value="$(arg initial_pose_y)"/>
     <arg name="initial_pose_a" value="$(arg initial_pose_a)"/>
   </include>

   <!-- Move base -->
   <include file="$(find turtlebot_navigation)/launch/includes/move_base.launch.xml"/>

 </launch>

What changes shall I make in test.launch file so that I can test the algorithm with the simulation??

Do the launch files for turtlebot accept a sim argument?
Comment by stevejp on 2018-03-19:
You should probably look at using turtlebot_simulator instead of turtlebot_bringup. Additionally, while you're still getting it working you should launch nodes one at a time instead of all at once (to help identify issues).
Comment by DeepaliA on 2018-03-19:
Which launch file from above turtlebot_simulator package shall I use to replace $(find turtlebot_bringup)/launch/minimal.launch and  $(find turtlebot_bringup)/launch/3dsensor.launch   ??

A:

I changed my test.launch same as turtlebot_in_stage.launch which is in turtlebot_simulator package.
My test.launch file:
<launch>
      <include file="$(find turtlebot_stage)/launch/turtlebot_in_stage.launch"/>
</launch>

After that I have just added the following line
<param name="base_global_planner" value="RAstar_planner/RAstarPlannerROS"/> 

in move_base.launch.xml file.
It works fine.
