Q:

error while installing ccny_rgbd_tools

Hi, I can't install ccny_rgbd_tools using the instructions that the README provides, the compiler always shows me the following message:
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:83 (add_executable):
Cannot find source file:

  apps/global_cloud_align.cpp

Tried extensions .c .C .c++ .cc .cpp .cxx .m .M .mm .h .hh .h++ .hm .hpp .hxx .in .txx

[rosmake-2] Finished <<< lib_rgbdtools [FAIL] [ 0.43 seconds ]

I don't have any idea where that file could be. Can you tell me what I'm doing wrong and how can I solve it?
Thanks in advance, Raul
