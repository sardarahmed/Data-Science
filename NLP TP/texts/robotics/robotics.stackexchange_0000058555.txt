Q:

Include ImageMagick headers file in catkin pakage

I am trying to include the header files of ImageMagick in my catkin package.
I am using include_directories() function in CMakeLists.text file.
like this :
find_package(ImageMagick COMPONENTS magick)
include_directories(include ${ImageMagick_INCLUDES} )
still its giving the error no such file or directory.
What to do to resolve this??

First of all if you don't use the "REQUIRED" keyword you can't even be sure that the package has been found. And second you should output the content of the variable ImageMagick_INCLUDES to check what it actually contains. It might just be empty because either the package was not found or the variable name is actually wrong and should be different.

A:

I'm whether a catkin expert nor have I ever used ImageMagick but after a short search I found this CMakeLists.txt.
They do
find_package(ImageMagick COMPONENTS Magick++ REQUIRED)

This might help you.
