Q:

Spawning pr2 problem (pr2_simulator)

Hello everyone,
I have problems with the pr2_simulator. I have installed it and I was following the first steps in the "Introductory Tutorials" of pr2_simulator.
I was trying to spawn the pr2 robot in a Gazebo empty world.
I had to use
roslaunch gazebo_ros empty_world.launch

instead of
roslaunch gazebo_worlds empty_world.launch

in order to launch the 3d environment. (If I remember well it's because of the newer versions of Gazebo...)
However, when I launch the command
roslaunch pr2_gazebo pr2.launch

I get an error:
spawn status:  SpawnModel: Model pushed to spawn queue, but spawn service timed out waiting for model to appear in simulation under the name pr2

What can I do? :(
Thank you in advance!

Hi!,
I think that there is some problem with the urdf files for the pr2_robot. Probably the urdf files from the pr2_package you downloaded, are too old for the Gazebo version you are using. I think its a similar problem as the one asked here http://answers.ros.org/question/200497/cant-spawn-model-in-gazebo/
So i think the solution could be to make sure you are using the latest version of the pr2 package, and the ones that match the ubuntu version you have.
I hope this helps you!
