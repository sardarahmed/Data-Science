Q:

how do i select light-weight 6dof robot?

I plan to do some scientific research, after modeling and path planning for the robot, The algorithm outputs the Joint control torque(or Joint variable), and then i want to input this result to the robot Control platform to check my algorithm, as far as I know, most robot can only provide point-to-point tracking instructions(NOT torque\joint variable input API),any robot can supports torque or joint variable as the robot input(when i input joint variable or torque, robot can move)?  
How can I program a 6 DOF robot using torque rather than joint positions as input?
If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to let me know.

A:

This article explains how to implement joint-torque control on top of position-controlled robots.
