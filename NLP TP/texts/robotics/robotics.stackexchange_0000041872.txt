Q:

How can I include a package in a new folder?

I have a folder Scenario that contains five packages and I would like to include this folder in another one, devel.
So I would like to change the path from /home/Scenario to /home/devel/Scenario but I couldn't find any command to do that automatically.
Do I need to change the path manually in every files in each package?

A:

What files are you concerned about? If you didn't use any hard coded, absolute paths in any of your sources / scripts, then the location of a package should not affect its proper functioning (or building).
As long as packages are (indirectly) on your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, things should be fine. ROS will sort out the locations of packages during building and execution, using the information in the manifest.xml file (among other things). rosmake also sets up the include paths for C++ code.
For bash scripts, use rospack: to make use of a file inside my_package in the /home/me/somedir directory, instead of doing:
do_something_with /home/me/somedir/my_package/my_file

do:
do_something_with `rospack find my_package`/my_file

this way it doesn't matter where my_package is, as long as rospack can find it.
tl;dr: stay away from absolute paths and things should 'just work'.
PS: a rosmake --pre-clean might be a good thing to do after moving them.

cmake hard-codes paths. When moving an already compiled ros package to a different directory, it is important to call make clean in that package before building it. rosmake --pre-clean does that in all packages in the dependency tree.

:) just added that, but thanks.
