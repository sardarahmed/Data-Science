Q:

Linking namespace to executable

Hello,
i have two executable i build them with:
 add_executable(MapProcessing src/MapProcessing.cpp BasicCalculation.cpp)

added minimal example
function header MapProcessing.h
#ifndef MAPPROCESSING_H_
#define MAPPROCESSING_H_

#include <BasicCalculation.h>

class MapProcessing
{
public:
    MapProcessing();
private:
    void DoSomething();
};

#endif /* MAPPROCESSING_H_ */

function cpp
#include "map_processing.h"

void MapProcessing::DoSomething(){
     Eigen::Vector2d vector(1,0);
    double test=BasicCalculation::test;
    int p=BasicCalculation::a();
    double test=BasicCalculation::AngleBetweenXaxisAndVector(vector);
  }
}

header namespace:
#ifndef BASICCALCULATION_H_
#define BASICCALCULATION_H_

#include <Eigen/Core>
#include <Eigen/Eigenvalues>
#include <Eigen/Geometry>

namespace BasicCalculation{
  double AngleBetweenXaxisAndVector(const Eigen::Vector2d& vector);
  static double test=2;
  static int a(){return 1;}
};

#endif /* BASICCALCULATION_H_ */

cpp namespace
#include "BasicCalculation.h"
using namespace BasicCalculation;

double AngleBetweenXaxisAndVector(const Eigen::Vector2d& vector)
{
   calculate angle;
   return angle;
}

when i build this. I get an error
undefined reference to `BasicCalculation::AngleBetweenXaxisAndVector(Eigen::Matrix<double, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1> const&)'

but variable test and function a() are working.
I have no idea why...
can u please help?

The function named in the undefined reference error is not linked to your executable. Error sources are: You named it slightly different (including the function signature) or you did not compile+link the code that contains this. For more help you've gotta come up with a full minimal example.

ok I edited my full minimal example

I don't see where namespace_one is defined? What is in namespace.h?
Comment by Hunk on 2013-08-14:
sry namespace_one is my BasicCalculation i have added the full minimal example and delete namespace_one now

A:

The function double AngleBetweenXaxisAndVector(const Eigen::Vector2d& vector) in your cpp is not defined in the namespace. The using directive does NOT do this. It does something else.
