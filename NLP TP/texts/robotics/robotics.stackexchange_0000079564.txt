Q:

Upgrade Indigo package versions (particularly moveit_commander)

(Moved from here on behalf of @shzargar)
I want to use set_max_acceleration_scaling_factor (newly added method to moveit_commander) in my python program to control the velocity but I get:
  File "./nextage_moveit_waypoint.py", line 117, in main
    larm.set_max_velocity_scaling_factor(0.5)   
AttributeError: 'MoveGroupCommander' object has no attribute 'set_max_velocity_scaling_factor'

running this : rosversion moveit_commander
gives me this: 0.6.1
I tried to do update with
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-moveit-full-pr2 (or sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-moveit)
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
but at the end, rosversion moveit_commander returns me the same version.
How I can update my moveit_commander and make sure that I have set_max_acceleration_scaling_factor

A:

moveit_commander for ROS Indigo at the time of writing is version 0.7.8 (changelog), but its binary is not yet available to general public and only available on so-called "shadow" repository (testing repo before the public release). You can apply the setting in the link and update.
Note that in order to update an already-installed Ubuntu package you may want to run apt-get with --reinstall option, e.g.:
    sudo apt-get install --reinstall ros-indigo-moveit-commander
