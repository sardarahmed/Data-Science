Q:

Matlab can't create my ros action clientï¼šFailed to create a simple action client

I use this command to create a ros action client in matlab:
[actClient,goalMsg] = rosactionclient('/do_dishes'); 

However, an error occured:
Failed to create a simple action client with name /do_dishes and type action_tutorials/DoDishes. Verify that the action type is valid. 

I do not know if I need to define the action message type in matlab.
DoDishes_client and DoDishes_server nodes worked well in ROS.
So who can help me?

A:

I have solved this proble.
We should "Create Custom Messages from ROS Package" by ourselfs.
Firstly, install "Robotics System Toolbox Interface for ROS Custom Messages"
Secondly, because my packages and matlab are both in ubuntu system, so I just enter follow codes in matlab command window.
userfolder = '/home/robot/msg_gen';
rosgenmsg(userfolder);

and I had put my packages "action_tutorials" into msg_gen. Then message file will be generated in /msg_gen/matlab_gen  . You can watch https://www.mathworks.com/help/robotics/ug/create-custom-messages-from-ros-package.html for more details.

I have done that but I couldn't use that custom message in Simulink. I can't even open it using " rosmsg('show','xxxxxx')" or " YYYY= rosmessage('XXXX')". My message is there in rosmsg list (Matlab) but i cant access it in matlab.
