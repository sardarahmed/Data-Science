Q:

Android Heap Space Errors

Hi All
I'm trying to embed a ROS Android application into my android device however I get the following errors
[2012-11-27 10:20:22 - Dex Loader] Unable to execute dex: Java heap space
[2012-11-27 10:20:22 - org.ros.android.android_tutorial_pubsub.MainActivity] Conversion to Dalvik format failed: Unable to execute dex: Java heap space

in the console output of eclipse.
The project is based off the android_tutorial_pubsub project with my own NodeMain incorporated  into it.
My Project has all the JARs from the android_tutorial_pubsub/libs wrapped up into a user library (a solution on stack overflow which didn't fix the problem).
The org.ros.android_gingerbread_mr1. is included in the build path, as when I include it as a library under the project>>properties>>android i get a conflict between its JARs and the ones from android_tutorial_pubsub. So its included on project>>properties>>Java Build Path as a required Project. (allows the MainActivity to compile and doesn't conflict JARs.
I've also adjusted the eclipse.ini file Xss property to 1024 as suggested by some.
Anyone have any thoughts?

Okay, I published the last line of the error in Google and came up with a couple of different responses the one that worked is listed here in stack oveflow:
stackoverflow link
I increased my
Xms values to 512 as suggested and the program advanced.
cheers
