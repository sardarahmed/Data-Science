Q:

rosjava Cmake errors

Hello,
I am currently trying to test rosjava in cturtle using the wiki provided at: http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosjava_jni .
After running the "make test" command while in the , I am receiving the following error:
CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /opt/ros/cturtle/stacks/client_rosjava/test_rosjava/build/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /tmp/buildd/ros-cturtle-client-rosjava-0.1.3/debian/ros-cturtle-client-rosjava/opt/ros/cturtle/stacks/client_rosjava/test_rosjava/build where CMackeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "/opt/ros/cturtle/stacks/client_rosjava/test_rosjava/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "/tmp/buildd/ros-cturtle-client-rosjava-0.1.3/debian/ros-cturtle-client-rosjava/opt/ros/cturtle/stacks/client_rosjava/test_rosjava/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
I have limited knowledge of the CMake and make commands, but I do know that Cmake is essentially a special case of the make command and essentially compiles multiple files of a project.
Any pointers?

A:

You can't run "make test" for packages that are installed via apt-get.  They are binary/read-only.  The "make test" example is only if you install client_rosjava from git.
In other words, don't worry about the 'make test' part of the docs and just continue with the rest of the examples.
