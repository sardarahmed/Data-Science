Q:

ROS.org - how to switch to English

This is how ros.org looks for computer in Japan. Unfortunately not everyone in Japan prefers Japanese language and wants to switch to English ros.org. I do not see such option there anywhere, so I ask here: How to switch into English?

Today http://www.ros.org/wiki/turtlesim/Tutorials gives me English from Japan. Something changed? Was bug and now fixed?

A:

There is something wrong with the wiki search that creates that page. Must be corrected by the site administrator.
As quick workaround just delete the ja phrase from the url of requested page like this:
http://ros.org/wiki/ja/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingServicesParams

change to:
http://ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingServicesParams

and you will see the English version.

The search was finding both the Japanese and English versions.  I've suppressed the Japanese versions in the search.
