Q:

External dependencies with rosjava

Dear all, I am a bit confused with the new gradle build system. In the old version of rosjava, I could define my dependencies on external jars within the Manifest file with something like
        <rosjava-pathelement location="/home/eich/workspace/Cylinder_Reasoner/cylinderreasoner.jar" />

This was than included into the auto-generated property files. How can I set my dependencies with the new gradle build system? The corresponding jar files of the libs are in the main folder of the package. Any Ideas?
Cheers,
Markus

A:

I suggest going through the Gradle Java tutorial: http://gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/tutorial_java_projects.html
Dependencies should either be pulled from a remote repository or built and installed to your local repository.

Yes. Thank you. Just found it. I can simplye call  the dependencies with "compile files" tag. This includes also jars which are not in a repository.
