Can you install other ROS pkgs using apt? What is the output of uname -a? Have you ran sudo apt update recently?

i've run sudo apt update. I can't install any ros package.

If you can't install any ROS packages then I would guess you haven't setup your system correctly.
Which installation guides (if any) did you follow?
What is the output of
cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list

A:

Edit: The output:

:~$ cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list

deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu precise main

The problem most likely is that you've configured your system to ask the ROS package repositories for Ubuntu Precise (ie: 14.04) while you are actually running Ubuntu Xenial (16.04) -- or at least according to your question title.
I'm not sure how that happened, but you should be able to correct this situation using the following command:
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'

Note that this will override whatever you have now in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list.
Did you follow the installation tutorial for ROS Kinetic on Ubuntu Xenial?

Yes I followed http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu for Ros Kinetic on Ubuntu Xenial.
After I run this comment
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'

The output has overridden which resulted is :
deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu xenial main

But cannot install rosbridge package yet. Any other suggestion please?

Did you run sudo apt-get update before trying to install again?
