Q:

problem in writing a simple service and client(python)

When I type

from: can't read /var/mail/beginner_tutorials.srv
/home/exbot/catkin_ws/src/beginner_tutorials/scripts/add_two_ints_server.py: line 4: import: command not found
/home/exbot/catkin_ws/src/beginner_tutorials/scripts/add_two_ints_server.py: line 6: syntax error near unexpected token `('

A:

It looks like the script is being executed by the shell and not by python.
Does your script start with a shebang?
#!/usr/bin/env python

This is required to be recognized as a python node.
Actually, there a quick google turned up mutiple questions about the same thing here on ROS answers

This is exactly the case. I had this kind of response because I had (accidentally) included a space in front of #!/usr/bin/env python
