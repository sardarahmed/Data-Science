Q:

MoveIt: troubles with joint values

I have just started with ROS and MoveIt! and I'd like to use it for planning trajectories on a Sawyer robot (ROS version: kinetic). I have followed the tutorial on SDK intera webpage then I went through the Python tutorial linked at the end of that page.
After the commands roslaunch sayer_moveit_config sawyer_movit.launchand roslaunch sayer_moveit_config group_movit.launch, I ran  python tutorial.py, the script containing the code in the linked Python tutorial, with the only difference that I defined group = moveit_commander.MoveGroupCommander("right_arm") instead of left_arm (because Sawyer robot has only right arm).
Well, in Rviz I can see the planned trajectory. The problem arose while attempting to execute the plan: in the output I can read

a vector of zeros for 'positions', like in this question (but I don't have to rename the joint_states topic, because for Sawyer the topic is already '/robot/joint_states')

"Joint values for monitored state are requested but the full state is not known", whilst $ rostopic echo /robot/joint_states shows a stream of positions..

Googling this error, I have found here
if (!current_state_monitor_->waitForCurrentState(opt_.group_name_, wait_seconds))

ROS_WARN_NAMED("move_group_interface", "Joint values for monitored state are requested but the full state is not "known");

Do you have some some suggestion? What's wrong? I only have these files and the Python tutorial. Many thanks.

A:

One thing you should check is  whether your joint_states message contain all of the available joints
