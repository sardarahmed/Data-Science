Q:

RVIZ: Should fixed frame be disappearing in tf display?

After a recent update of hydro the fixed frame in the tf in rviz is disappearing after the timeout time. Is this the intended behavior or is it a bug that should be reported?

A:

I've observed this as well, I think it's normal. It definitely makes the display less cluttered.
As long as you're not seeing errors on other frames, I wouldn't worry about it.

Well, it was a change in behavior that made me spend half an hour so debugging my code and looking for why the transform was not sent correctly.... But we find the world frame very useful in our application with one or more quadrotors since we use the world frame to check the display orientation.

You can display the world frame by explicitly adding an "Axes" display type and specifying the world frame.
