Q:

Problem running hokuyo_node

Hey Everyone!
I've installed the hokuyo_node package and just started the hokuyo tutorials (http://www.ros.org/wiki/hokuyo_node/Tutorials/UsingTheHokuyoNode).
However, when i type this command:
$ rosrun hokuyo_node hokuyo_node
The terminal displays the following message:
[ WARN] [1350269609.097397459]: The use_rep_117 parameter has not been set or is set to false.  Please see: http://ros.org/wiki/rep_117/migration
[ERROR] [1350269615.350188127]: Exception thrown while opening Hokuyo.
timeout reached (in hokuyo::laser::laserReadline) You may find further details at http://www.ros.org/wiki/hokuyo_node/Troubleshooting
I tried to search information about this error, but haven't found anything so far.
Do you have any clue about what is wrong?
I am beginner at using ROS, so please try to explain with details, if it's possible...
Thanks!

Hey guys!
I'm actually using a Serial-USB converter cable.
When i connect Hokuyo through the cable, is not shown at the default ACM* driver, but at USB0.
I tried to configure the permissions for USB0, using sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSB0.
My sensor is URG-04lx.

A:

Try:
ls -l /dev/ttyACM*

maybe you have more than one device connected to your computer that uses ACM driver. If so run:
rosrun hokuyo_node hokuyo_node _port:=/dev/ttyACMx

Edit:
By default, hokuyo_node assumes that you have connected with USB, which uses ACM. As tfoote wrote in the comment:
rosrun hokuyo_node hokuyo_node _port:=/dev/ttyUSB0

should do the trick.

With your edit use /dev/ttyUSB0 instead of ACM0
