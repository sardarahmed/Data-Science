Q:

How do I work out the kinematic solution of a robot arm?

I draw a robotic arm in Solidworks, but I'm not so sure about how to find out the DOF, forward and backward kinematic.

Could anyone help me understand how to work out the kinematic solution of this robot arm?

A:

If you want to solve it mathematically (not within the SolidWorks), the DOF is the number of independent variables needed to define the configuration of the mechanism. Since you've planar motion in three joints (rotations about one axis) in addition to the slide this will make the DOF is 4 in this case. 
Because your problem is in one plan (Planar robot), you can solve the forward kinematics, by direct projection of the components in the two directions, horizontal and vertical, using the trigonometric functions sin and cosine as we do in the basic physics, and adding the parameter d (for example) for the horizontal component with proper sign to act for the slider movement. As for the backward (inverse) kinematics which will need more investigation, you can also try to solve it algebraically, based on some geometric basics taking the advantage of the simplicity ; in that case you'll take the pose (position and orientation) of the end effector (the tip point), and solve for the three angles, and the slide (d), with some math manipulation you can figure out this. This I'm describing the shortcut to workout your problem. However, if you've more time, and will do more work on kinematics, you can follow one the two approaches:

The product of exponential method ( which I prefer) you can refer to it in the: A Mathematical Introduction to Robotic Manipulation, by Murray 
Or you can use the DH convention, the widely used method. The inverse kinematics is a large topic in the robotic literature, you can find a lot about around. However, if you looking to that in the SolidWrok, this is another issue.
