Q:

rosgraph unable to get node information in Fuerte

In Fuerte, rosgraph, rxgraph and roswtf do not work correctly for me. This error can be reproduced by running the following commands:
roscore
rosrun roscpp_tutorials talker
rosrun roscpp_tutorials listener

The nodes are definitely connected, as I can see the output from both the nodes. Additionally rostopic hz and rostopic echo can successfully subscribe to these messages. rosgraph is unable to determine the node connectivity, and gives the following output:
Nodes:
  /listener :
    Inbound:
    Outbound:
  /talker :
    Inbound:
    Outbound:
  /rosout :
    Inbound:
    Outbound:
Services:
  /talker/set_logger_level
  /listener/set_logger_level
  /rosout/get_loggers
  /talker/get_loggers
  /rosout/set_logger_level
  /listener/get_loggers

Similarly, rxgraph does not show this connectivity either, and the output can be seen in this screenshot. Note that the information for the listener node in the rxgraph sidebar seems correct. The sidebar information for the talker node can be seen in screenshot-talker.
roswtf seems to alternate randomly between:
Found 1 error(s).

ERROR Communication with [/talker] raised an error: 

and
Found 4 error(s).

ERROR Communication with [/talker] raised an error: 
ERROR Communication with [/listener] raised an error: 
ERROR Communication with [/rosout] raised an error: 
ERROR The following nodes should be connected but aren't:
 * /talker->/rosout (/rosout)
 * /listener->/rosout (/rosout)
 * /talker->/listener (/chatter)

I suspect the error to be somewhere in the rosgraph API. Any thoughts would be appreciated.
Thanks!

A:

This problem was attributed to 2 separate bugs in the rosgraph python scripts, that have been reported in 2 separate tickets (ticket 3946 and ticket 3947). Patches to fix the problem are included in both tickets.
