Hi.
I followed the instruction below.

However, I got errors when I installed TurtleBot3 Packages on my remote PC.
shunta@shunta-MacBookAir:~/turtlebot3_ws$ vcs import src < turtlebot3.repos

Do you know how to solve these problems?

A:

It looks like you don't have Git installed. As vcstools uses git to clone the TB3 repositories, you see this error.
I'm pretty sure either the base ROS 2 install and/or vcstools itself depends on it, so it should have been installed for you, but seeing as it isn't, you may want to install it yourself.

Thank you for your answer.
As you said, I installed vcstools below. Then, I was able to install Turtlebot3 packages!
Step1 sudo apt-get update -y
Step2 sudo apt-get install -y python3-vcstools
