Q:

[rospack] Error: package 'rviz' not found

I've been using ROS for a couple of years and Rviz has been working satisfactorily till now. I'm not sure what I've done but I'm getting the error mentioned in the question ( [rospack] Error: package 'rviz' not found ) while executing the following statements:
rosrun rviz rviz 
rospack find rviz

Yes, I have sourced the required directories, this is the output to echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
/home/rohit/glocal/src:/opt/ros/indigo/share:/opt/ros/indigo/stacks

ps. My original error was that one of my launch files which runs the rviz node was giving the following error:
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [rviz/rviz]: rviz
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/indigo/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/home/rohit/glocal/src
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/indigo/share
ROS path [3]=/opt/ros/indigo/stacks

This made me suspect that my rviz package wasn't being found which is the primary error according to me. Any help will be much appreciated.

Your observation is right IMO. Next question might be; is there RViz on your computer?

I would think that it should be there cause I've been using it till yesterday. Any way that I can check if it's there?

Thanks mate, you were right. Somehow my RViz got deleted. So I just installed it again from apt.

A:

I'd run these commands.
apt-cache policy ros-kinetic-rviz
rospack find rviz
cd %YOUR_CATKIN_WS%/src && find . -iname rviz
