Q:

Problems with a new hydro install of hector quadrotor demo

Hello all, I observe the following when trying to test out the new version of the most excellent hector_quad_rotor sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-hector-quadrotor-demo.
user@happyplace:~$ roslaunch hector_quadrotor_demo outdoor_flight_gazebo.launch 
... logging to /home/ubuntu/.ros/log/297f0af6-c010-11e3-8a21-fa163eaa4736/roslaunch-10-100-16-5-23452.log
Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.
Press Ctrl-C to interrupt
Done checking log file disk usage. Usage is <1GB.

Invalid <arg> tag: hector_quadrotor_description
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/hydro/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/opt/ros/hydro/share
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/hydro/stacks. 

Arg xml is <arg name="model" value="$(find hector_quadrotor_description)/urdf/quadrotor_hokuyo_utm30lx.gazebo.xacro"/>

It seems that ros-hydro-hector-quadrotor-description should be a dependency. Can anyone else confirm this experience?

Ok. That's good to know! I don't have a physical quadrotor personally, so I did not install the entire hector package as I thought it would be overkill.  Running sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-hector-quadrotor-demo ros-hydro-hector-quadrotor-description was the path that I tried.
