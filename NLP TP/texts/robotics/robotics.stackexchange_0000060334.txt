Q:

How do I know the variable names in a ros service handler

In the beginner tutorial here:
def handle_add_two_ints(req):
print "Returning [%s + %s = %s]"%(req.a, req.b, (req.a + req.b))
return AddTwoIntsResponse(req.a + req.b)

I understand that the message received will get passed to the 'handle_add_two_ints' function as the object 'req' -- what I do not understand is where the naming convention comes from.  They seem to have pulled '.a' and '.b' out of thin air.  Can someone please clarify or point me to a site that does? What if I am passing many variables of different types... will they always be alphabetically named?

A:

Hi,
you created a definition of your service interface in a earlier tutorial:
http:// wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingMsgAndSrv.
Perhaps you didn't realize because you copied it from another project.
roscp rospy_tutorials AddTwoInts.srv srv/AddTwoInts.srv

The file contains the interface which the function implements.
int64 a
int64 b
---
int64 sum

hope i helped you
cheers Andreas
