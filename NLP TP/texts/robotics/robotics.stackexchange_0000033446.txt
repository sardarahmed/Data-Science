Q:

Calibration of a Panoramic image

I'm trying to get the calibration files (yaml) for a panoramic image. The image has been already rectified (unwrapped) using other the Taylor expansion method (OcamCalib Toolbox in MATLAB), but I'm not sure if in order to process it further I need to obtain the calibration parameters given by camera_calibration.
In other words, given a 360 degree Field-of-view lens, is the pinhole model used by  camera_calibration applicable?

A:

once you have warped your images, the calibration does not makes sense anymore.
Moreover, a 360 degree image does not fit a pinhole camera model.
