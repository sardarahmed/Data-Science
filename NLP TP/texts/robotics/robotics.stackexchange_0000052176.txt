Q:

rosjava_core in Fuerte

I try to install rosjava_core in Fuerte.
I did:
rosws set --git rosjava_core 'https://github.com/rosjava/rosjava_core.git'

    rosws update

But there seems no manifest.xml present anymore? So I can't roscd in to the folder. I also tried rospack profile but that did not work.
I also got this error  which I fixed (?) by renaming the .rosinstall file
ERROR in config: Ambiguous workspace: ROS_WORKSPACE=/home/lennart/fuerte_workspace, /home/lennart/fuerte_workspace/rosjava_core/.rosinstall

A:

The problem is that rosjava was recently catkinized for use with groovy and hydro, and there is no fuerte branch. I've fixed that by forking rosjava and creating a branch just before the catkinization. If you want to use my fork, you can do this:
rosws set --git rosjava_core 'https://github.com/uos/rosjava_core.git' --version=fuerte-devel

Alternatively, you can try getting the rosjava developers to create a fuerte-devel branch so you can do this with the official repo instead of my fork.
