Q:

Are units of force on prismatic joints Newtons?

As opposed to newton-meters as shown in the 2.2.3 UI.
In my case I'm using ROS Indigo and I have an EffortJointInterface with a mechanicalReduction of 1.  when I echo the state for the position controller it has a command field I believe to be newton-meters when the joint is rotary, but is it newtons for prismatic?

A:

As long as all other units you use are SI-metric consistent, then yes, it's Newtons :)

Thanks!  I also just did some physics experiments with primatics lifting loads against gravity and confirmed this.
