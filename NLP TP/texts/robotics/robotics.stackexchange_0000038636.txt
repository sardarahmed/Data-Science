Q:

Writing a new motion planner

I am writing my own planner , called SplineBasedPlanner . It takes in a set of waypoints, and interpolates them with a special kind of spline (not the ones already implemented by ROS). The spline is designed so that a vehicle ,whose params are specified in config files, can traverse the spline smoothly. I want this to plug into move_base.
However, I am confused about what kind of interface (i.e. API) I should provide to do so. Should SplineBasedPlanner resemble base_local_planner's interface? Or should it be more like TrajectoryPlanner? Are there multiple choices?
I'll be glad to provide more specific information if needed.
Update 1: From responses below , I really want both  both  local and global versions for the SplineBasedPlanner.

Is this planner targeted towards generating trajectories from one waypoint to next waypoint?? As DimitriProsser explained below, it is not clear.

A:

The base_global_planner is responsible for drawing paths to the goal and around obstacles, while the base_local_planner is responsible for calculating trajectories and issuing cmd_vel messages in order to achieve the plan drawn by the base_global_planner.
Based on what you've written, it's not entirely clear what category your planner would fall into. I'm going to guess and say that you want to adhere to the base_local_planner interface (TrajectoryPlannerROS), but you'd know better than me. Which of these two do you think it fits better?
