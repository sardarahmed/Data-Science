Q:

Error Running Catkin_Make

After installing/uninstalling some packages from source using rosinstall, I can no longer run catkin_make without error.  I've tried removing the packages I installed, removing/reinstalling the catkin package, running wstool update, and other things.
The error message makes reference to catkin_EXTRAS_DIR, but I can't seem to find any information on what this is.
Can anyone help me understand what I can do to fix this?  What is catkin_EXTRAS_DIR?

Please post your error message as text and format it with the "preformatted text" (010101) button so that it is searchable and readable.

A:

It's not entirely clear exactly what you've done to get here, but it's clear that your workspace is kind of messed up.
catkin_EXTRAS_DIR is one of the variables used internally by catkin during the build process; if it's not set it means that some file for catkin is corrupt or empty.
The first steps at troubleshooting would be to remove the build and devel directories in your workspace, and since the CMakeLists.txt link at the root of your workspace seems messed up, you should remove that too. A fresh build will re-create all of these.
After that, next steps will depend on how you installed ROS. If you did a binary install, you should reinstall any apt packages you suspect are damaged with apt-get install --reinstall <package>. If you did a source install, you should make sure that the source files are still intact, and then run the build steps (catkin_make_isolated, etc) again.

I tried removing build, devel, and CMakeLists.txt, then building again, but this didn't work.  I ended up re-installing ROS which fixed the issue.  I also had some boot issues which I attributed to a corrupt SD card, so that might be what caused this.  Thanks for your help.
