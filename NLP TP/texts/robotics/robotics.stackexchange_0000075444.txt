Hello everyone,
I'm wondering how to add an AR tag in the gazebo's world these days. But I have not found the right way to solve this problem. Or could I add an image to the world?
Thanks first!

A:

Well, I have solved this problem.
A sample approach is to change the original model.
For example, since the model Beer has textures, we could change the model to AR tag.
Besides , we need to replace the cylinder in model.sdf to box, and change the size of the box.
