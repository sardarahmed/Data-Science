Q:

Is it possible to launch a node on another computer from my computer?

I am working on a mobile robot project. I have tested the teleoperation by launching all nodes on the Pi, including the master, the keystroke detector, and finally the node that sends commands to the motors. I have also established a connection between the main computer I'm using and the PI. While I can run almost all nodes on the laptop, the node that sends commands to the motors requires the RPi.GPIO library, which cannot be run from my laptop. I wanted to know if it is possible to just launch that specific node on the Pi from the convenience of my laptop.
Any help would be appreciated. Thank you!

A:

Yes you can remotely roslaunch processes. You should use the machine tag. http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML/machine
There's a tutorial with some tips here: http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/Tutorials/Roslaunch%20tips%20for%20larger%20projects
