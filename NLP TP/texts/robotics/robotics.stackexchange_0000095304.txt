Q:

How to source setup.bash in ROS Window10

Hi everyone. I want to install some packages on ROS Win10, I tried with choco install and it didn't work. So I tried to install from source. When I "catkin_make", it succeeded.But I don't know how to source setup.bash
By the way, I want to use multi machine with ROS_Master on Window. But I don't know how to config .bashrc file to edit ROS_MASTER_URI to make connect with other devices.
Thanks for reading

A:

Hi, 
On Windows 10, you can source your local workspace setup by calling devel\setup.bat.
To check if your local workspace is properly overlayed on top of your environment, run
echo %ROS_PACKAGE_PATH%

you should see something like this
C:/local_workspace/src;C:\opt\ros\melodic\x64\share

You should set ROS_MASTER_URI  as an environment variable on Windows 10. You either set it by using a GUI: open Advanced system settings, click the button Environment Variables, and add new System variables (different approaches to open the GUI can be found here), or set it by using the setx command. So if you want to permanently set ROS_MASTER_URI, the command would be like:
setx ROS_MASTER_URI “http://<ip>:11311/” /m
