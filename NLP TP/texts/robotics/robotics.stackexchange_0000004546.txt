Q:

What are the calculations for a badminton robot and mechanisms?

I am designing a badminton robot but i am very confused about mechanisms needed for a badminton robot and various calculations needed for millisecond response.I am also confused about calculations needed about the forces needed and efficient angles needed for hitting the shuttlecock.Please suggest me some ideas or suggestions needed for construction of badminton robot.

A:

In short, what you are trying to do is well beyond the capabilities of top robotics research labs.
That said, here is a short list of general areas you need to look into:

Robotic arm dynamics (to swing the racket)
Vision processing to track the shuttle
Shuttle dynamics to predict shuttle path (this is not well studying so you would most likely have to create new math here)
Nonlinear control control the arm as well as algorithms to move the robot where it needs to go.

Note that a wheeled robot will probably not do well because it can't move side-to-to.
