Q:

rosmake failed for g2o

hi
i want to install rgbdslam package. so i used the svn co link. in that i followed the readme file and i tried to install g2o. when i gave rosmake i got following error:
root@mutu-Vostro-3550:/opt/ros/electric/stacks/g2o# rosmake --rosdep-install
[ rosmake ] No package specified.  Building ['g2o']
[ rosmake ] Packages requested are: ['g2o']
[ rosmake ] Logging to directory/home/mutu/.ros/rosmake/rosmake_output-20120416-145054
[ rosmake ] Expanded args ['g2o'] to:
['g2o']
[ rosmake ] Generating Install Script using rosdep then executing. This may take a minute, you will be prompted for permissions. . .
Failed to find rosdep suitesparse for package g2o on OS:ubuntu version:oneiric
[ rosmake ] rosdep install failed: Rosdep install failed
if rosmake fails the readme file has the next step.i did it, but i got the following:
root@mutu-Vostro-3550:/opt/ros/electric/stacks/g2o# sudo apt-get install libsuitesparse-dev libcsparse2.2.3
Reading package lists... Done

libcsparse2.2.3 is already the newest version.
libsuitesparse-dev is already the newest version.
what to do?

You should be able to continue compiling g2o anyway, shouldn't you?

A:

i removed the source files and installed g2o from ubuntu software centre
