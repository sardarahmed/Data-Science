Q:

how to change my source directory

I just changed my username and name of my home directory. Now I cannot use catkin_make because the source directory's name has been changed. How can I update, or change my source directory of catkin_ws?

A:

Have you tried removing catkin_ws/{build, devel} and running catkin_make again?
