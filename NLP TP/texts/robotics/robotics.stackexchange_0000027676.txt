Q:

Information from Topic Visualization to a text file?

Is it possible to get information from "Topic Visualization" tool to a text file. For example I want to take values in "gazebo/default/pose/info" topic. Alternatively, can I take this information using c++ and ros ?

A:

You could echo whatever is being published to the topic from the command line and direct that to a file, for example:
gz topic -e /gazebo/default/pose/info > ~/test.txt

Programmatically, you can setup a simple Gazebo subscriber (note this is not a ROS subscriber) which writes to a file, see this tutorial.
