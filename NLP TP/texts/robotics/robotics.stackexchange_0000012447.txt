Q:

Two-wheeled self-balancing robot - Choosing the control system

Would an Arduino Uno have the precision-timing required (using only firmware) to control a two-wheeled inverted pendulum robot, or would it need a RTOS?
Note: Thanks for both answers, they both helped a lot.  I just chose the last answer as the accepted answer.

A:

You only have to do simple calculations. 
We have done it with different hardware: first with a Lego mindstorm to prototype and then with a powerfull myRIO. 
The hardware used:

Prototype: Balancing on four wheels
Final device: Scalevo - The Stairclimbing Wheelchair - ETH Zurich
