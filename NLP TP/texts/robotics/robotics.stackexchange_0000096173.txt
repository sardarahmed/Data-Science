Q:

ROS2, No executable found

Hi everyone,
I have successfully created few ROS2 nodes (one for a publisher with customer message, the custom message one, one responsible for debugging, one for the subscriber).
I have repeated the exact same steps in order to create some other packages.
However, the last one that I created returns "No executable found".
I am developing using python3.
I am pretty sure that package.xml, setup.py, setup.cfg and the actual node class are fine.
Also, no issues when running rosdep, all fine with colcon build, and I have installed everything with . install/setup.bash.
What could the problem be? Any idea?
Thanks in advance,
G.

Do you see the executable when you run?
ros2 pkg executables <pkg_name>

in my case, i didn't see anything with this command

A:

I believe that the error was caused by wrong action on my side..
I built and installed without realizing at the wrong level of the project tree.. that was enough to mess things up ...
lol
