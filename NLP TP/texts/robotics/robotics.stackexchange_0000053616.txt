Q:

Maxon EPOS and ROS

Hello !
I am wondering if anybody has experience with Maxon EPOS controllers and ROS ?
There is a nice package from WPI, but it works with kernel 2.6 ...
The older versions of Ubuntu are not supported, and the new ROS versions are not running on the older Ubuntu systems ...
And the most annoying is that MAXON do no have forums or reliable support !
Thinking of tossing the EPOS controllers to the bin ...
Unless somebody can help.
Tnx ! Yaro
