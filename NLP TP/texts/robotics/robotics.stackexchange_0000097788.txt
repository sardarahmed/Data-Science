Q:

ROS2 run bash script

I would like to run a bash script as a node liek the following:

ros2 run package script.sh

I know this is possible in ROS1, however I cannot find the right way to do it in ROS2.
Do you have any idea ?

A:

ros2 run currently looks in the install subdirectory lib/${PROJECT_NAME}. So, it should work if you install your bash script to that location, for example:
install(
  PROGRAMS script.sh
  DESTINATION lib/${PROJECT_NAME})
