Q:

Autonomous Navigation without Distance Sensors

I'm doing a project with the iRobot Create 2. I want it to be able to map out a room and navigate to a point for example. My problem is that the robot doesn't have any distance sensors. What it can do is detect if there is an obstacle ahead of it or not (0 or 1) and it can measure how far it has traveled in millimeters. Any good techniques out there or best to buy an IR sensor?

A:

With footslam or actionslam it is possible to locate pedestrian and smartphones even they have no distance-sensor. It is an advanced stochastic technic which is derived from classical "sebastian thrun slam" but uses less input data. The precision is low and thats the reason why footslam is often used together with other localisation techniques like satellite GPS. But, a "footslam only" implementation is possible.  Most research on this topic is done by DLR (Deutschen Zentrums f√ºr Luft- und Raumfahrt) which also has invented lots of similar algorithms like MagSlam oder WISLAM.
According to iRobot Create 2 sensors the irobot Create 2 has a "light bumper" as a sensor. To use this in a stochastic model the following sources may help:

Hassan A. Karimi: Indoor Wayfinding and Navigation, 2015, page 125-139
Dmytro Bobkov: Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping for 3D Pedestrian 
Michael Hardegger, Michael: Navigation based on FootSLAM using Inertial Sensors, 2012
ActionSLAM on a Smartphone: At-Home Tracking with a Fully Wearable System, 2013

According my knowledge, there is no ready-to-run footslam-implementaton on github which can be used via out-of-the-box. But under the term "indoor mapping" there are a lots of opensource projects which are used together with smartphones.
