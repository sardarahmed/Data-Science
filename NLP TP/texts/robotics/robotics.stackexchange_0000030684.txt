Q:

Generating messages for rosjava?

Platform: Diamondback, Ubuntu 10.10 64-bit.
I'm using rosjava, so I need to generate class files for all messages.
I tried using the rosjava_deps package (http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosjava_deps), but it depends on the genmsg_cpp package (http://www.ros.org/wiki/genmsg_cpp), which appears to be gone.
How do I auto-generate the message source or class files?

A:

Never mind, I just realised that all I have to do is remove dependencies on all packages that are no longer present in Diamondback.

Hi, I am trying to publish a message from rospy to a subscriber in rosjava. I am using ros hydro. I copy pasted the subscriber code from the tutorials into my rosjava folder and built it with catkin_make. I am getting errors related to adding the dependencies. I need to add them in the gradle file i think and i dont know how. can you help me with this? thanks
