Q:

Wall-E Legs mechanism

I was trying to understand the mechanism of Wall-E's Legs from the Wall-E 3D animation movie of Pixar Animation Studios, how he is able to move up and down and move the tracks on all directions. Can anyone explain how or point me to some resource?, I've been searching for days or watching slow motion scenes from movies but still I don't get the big picture of it.

A:

This is an appropriate question over at movies SE, but even here its probably interesting. Wall-Es character is definitely an interesting one, very dynamic, anthropomorphic, and modelled quite realistic. 
However there is a lot of film trickery going on here. Although Wall-E and other movie robots like Terminator seem like real mechanical systems, there are a lot of cgi clean up going on behind the scenes or scenes are planned in such a way that holding brackets and such are hidden, or things are designed in a way to terminate on faces of other models, but internally are simply non existing. This is Wall-Es case. It‘s modelled exactly enough to look mechanically feasible, but as you‘ve noticed it would be very difficult or impossible to create all his movements.
