Q:

How to subscribe to control commands from the LGSVL simulator using only ROS2?

Hello!
Is it possible to get the control commands i.e steering pattern from the latest LGSVL simulator? What topic should I subscribe to, to fetch this data for training later? Previously it used to be /simulator/control/command. Now it has changed. I would like to strictly avoid using Autoware and Apollo and just use ROS2. Has any one done it this way?
Any pointers?
If I have to change the internal code of LGSVL, any leads on how to do that?
Also if I want throttle, braking information too, how should I go about with just ROS2?
Thanks.
Update:
The LGSVL team have updated their code base to reflect changes to the latest simulator. I'm currently testing it out.
Update 2:
After testing and doing some modification to my needs, I was able collect data. The solution is to use a sensor plugin with custom topic name and type.
