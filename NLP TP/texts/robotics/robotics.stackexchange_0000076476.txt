Q:

std_msgs::Duration multipliation

Hi I want to calculate a distance. Therfore I have a std_msgs::Duration t and want to calculate:
d*d = t*t * w*w;

with w is the speed of sound (for now as a float).
The error I get is:
no match for ‘operator*’ (operand types are ‘const Time {aka const std_msgs::Time_<std::allocator<void> >}’ and ‘const Time {aka const std_msgs::Time_<std::allocator<void> >}’)
 d1_2 = t1*t1*omega*omega;

I think I have to convert the duration into a float. But I don't know how to do.

A:

Take a look at the API reference for DurationBase, which Duration inherits from. You probably want toSec which returns a double.

That looks good but doesn't work:
error: ‘const Duration’ has no member named ‘toSec’

I used std_msgs::Duration. Now I try to ue ros::Duration, than i think your answer work.
