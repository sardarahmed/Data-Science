Q:

What is the relationship between costmap config and URDF limits

What is the relationship between costmap footprint and URDF model collision definition.  Other values like joint velocity and effort limits in URDF and limits in move-base config file how is the relationship to be view. Is the URDF the limiting factor or does move base over ride? I found some information here:
https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_control/wiki/joint_limits_interface
I am guessing that URDF specifications limits and footprint take precidence and anything set in move-base should be aliened with those setting.

A:

Someone might correct me, but my best guess for default move_base is: They are totally independent.
In other words: Both must be setup correctly, matching one each other. In particular move_base doesn't assume the robot configuration to change, i.e. the footprint is constant.
There are some move_base planner implementations that actually take the 3D environment and robot configuration into account.
