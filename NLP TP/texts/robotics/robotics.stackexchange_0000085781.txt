Q:

How do I query the RViz Fixed Frame?

When I use the 2D Nav Goal tool of RViz, I get a position and orientation on /move_base_simple/goal.  How do I know which frame is used for the goal?  In other words, how do I know the currently-selected RViz Fixed Frame?

A:

Oh, geez...the frame_id is in the header of the goal.  Of course.
