Q:

How do you get stereo_image_proc to include a frame_id so that rviz will accept the point cloud messages?

When running stereo_image_proc, I'm attempting to view the point cloud data with rviz. However rviz complains and throws out the messages sayin "MessageFilter [target=/ ]: Discarding message from [/stereo_image_proc] due to empty frame_id".
I can find no reference to frame_id in stereo_image_proc, and I've tried fiddling with the fixed frame parameters in rviz to no avail.
Am I missing something obvious?

A:

It turns out that stereo_image_proc simply forwards the header info it finds in the camera_info message it gets from the left camera. If your camera info manager is not publishing a frame_id with in the camera_info message, neither will stereo_image_proc and you won't be able to visualize with rviz.
