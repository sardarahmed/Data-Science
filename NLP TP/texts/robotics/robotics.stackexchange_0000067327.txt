Q:

E: unable to locate package ros-indigo-desktop-full

I am getting the same error. I tried the 4 steps (http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu) and when I do :
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-desktop-full
I get the error.
E: unable to locate package ros-indigo-desktop-full

When I check for the ros-latest.list, I get the following output:
....@ubuntu:~$ cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list 

deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu vivid main

Let me know what might be going on.
I am running ubuntu 15.04 on vmware player

you have done sudo apt-get update ?

Yes that passes without any errors.

A:

As mentioned in step 1.2 of the page you linked

Setup your computer to accept software from packages.ros.org. ROS Indigo ONLY supports Saucy (13.10) and Trusty (14.04) for debian packages.

That means if you are using 15.04, you will need to build ROS from source.

Thanks for pointing this out. I am now trying to build ROS from source using the following link: http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Source
This is failing at step 2.1.2
"could not have their rosdep keys resolved"

I think I am going to give up and install 14.04.2 which is supported.
