Q:

catkin_create_pkg or roscreate-pkg?

Hello,
I need to modify hector_slam for my situation. So i learned that i need to create/build a new package.
So i want to create just like existing hector_slam package and modify it like i want.
For creating new hector_slam package to modify, which one is suitable and easier for my situation. catkin package (http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage)  or ros package (http://wiki.ros.org/roscreate) ?
Thanks,
Basak

A:

roscreate is a remnant from the old rosbuild build system. For any new projects you should be using the catkin build system and correspondingly, catkin_create_pkg.
