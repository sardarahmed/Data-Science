Q:

What is the name for the transfer function, GH

What is the name for the transfer function, GH, in a simple feedback control system like
$$y=\frac{G}{1+GH}u$$
What do you call G? What about (G/(1+GH))?
I am confused by the fact that that  "open-loop transfer function" and "Loop transfer function" are used to mean GH by different people. Which is academically correct or widely accepted?
There are several terms: "closed-loop transfer function"
"open-loop transfer function"
"overall transfer function"
"Loop transfer function"
"loop gain"
"loop ratio"
Thanks

A:

$GH$ has no special name in and of itself, it is merely a part of the transfer function.
$G$ is the plant/system. It is a mode of the system you want to control.
$y = Gu$ is the open-loop transfer function. It describes how the output of the system changes given a conrol signal $u$.
$y = \frac{G}{1+GH}u$ is the closed loop transfer function. It describes how the output of the system changes given a control signal $u$ and some observation model $H$.
The phrase "Loop transfer function" is used in contexts where the type of controller (open vs. closed) is not relevant.
A good introductory text to these ideas is the sixth edition of Feedback Control of Dynamic Systems by Franklin, Powell, and Emami-naeini.

A:

Both "loop transfer function" and "open loop transfer function" are acceptable terms for $GH$, as are "loop gain" and "loop ratio".  They all mean much the same thing.  We're humans, we can't always stick to a 1:1 correspondence between the thing and it's name.
Are you sure that you meant $\frac{G}{1+GH}$, or did you mean $\frac{GH}{1+GH}$?  The former is useful in its way, but the latter is so common that I saw what you wrote and mistook it for the common form.
This is a complicated subject.  You need a book.  Being naturally modest and retiring, I suggest this one: http://www.wescottdesign.com/actfes/actfes.html.
