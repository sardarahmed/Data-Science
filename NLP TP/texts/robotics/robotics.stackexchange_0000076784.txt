There should be no difference in how you do this with KDL, LMA or IKFast plugins. Have you tried? What is not working?

i use this page .

A:

Nothing in the tutorial you linked is solver-specific. I guess the workflow would be:

generate an IKFast plugin
configure your moveit pkg to use it
use the code from the tutorial

That should work regardless of whether you use KDL, IKFast or something else.
