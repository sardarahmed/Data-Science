Q:

Rospack Error Eigen missing

This is running on Ubuntu 12.04 in a virtualbox on windows7
I'm trying to make the hand_interaction package for kinect, but it won't compile.
Here's my error:

mkdir -p bin   cd build && cmake -Wdev
-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=rospack find rosbuild/rostoolchain.cmake  ..   --
Eigen found (include:
/usr/include/eigen3)   [rosbuild]
Building package hand_interaction
Failed to invoke
/opt/ros/fuerte/bin/rospack
deps-manifests hand_interaction
[rospack] Error: package/stack
hand_interaction depends on
non-existent package eigen
 CMake Error at /opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros/core/rosbuild/public.cmake:133

(message):
Failed to invoke rospack to get compile flags for package
'hand_interaction'.  Look above for errors from rospack itself. 

Aborting.
Please fix the broken dependency!

Thanks!

A:

You are trying to compile a package in Fuerte that hasn't been updated for it yet. Eigen is not part of Fuerte anymore. You could try to remove the dependency on it from hand_interaction's manifest.xml file but you can expect more problems.

If you want to develop a patch for hand_interaction, here is the migration guide: http://ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Migration#Eigen_can.27t_be_found

I'm just trying to get it to run, I don't know enough about it to make a patch... DX But thanks I guess :/

If you can't fix it yourself, try contacting the developers. I don't see any bug reporting links for that stack, so maybe it is not actively maintained.
