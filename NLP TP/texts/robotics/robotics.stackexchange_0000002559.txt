Q:

Are propellers dangerous?

Aren't all propellers super dangerous? How are these startups like Hex and Pocket Drone selling drones as 'kid-friendly' to consumers? What happens if a kid puts his finger in a propeller's movement space while its flying? 

A:

Yes, they are dangerous. I've cut myself multiple times. Once through the nail. The small toy helicopters are apparently some cause for increased eye injury, although studies suggest the injuries are usually not severe. Larger helicopters though seem to have caused fatal injuries in the past.

A:

Small quads that use brushed pager motors aren't too bad.  Typical quads that used brushless motors easily cut through flesh.  These shots were from an RC Groups thread where people were submitting their accident pictures.  Be careful!
For some  truly gruesome pictures (amputated fingers, severed tendons, etc), you can see this French language thread: http://chrismeme11.over-blog.com/article-36258812.html
