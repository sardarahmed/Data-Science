Q:

Is ROS answer able to join stackexchange?

Because I can use stackexchange's function to see message on whatever board.
If ROS answer can join them, I can receive notice message on any of stackexchange board.
Thank you~

A:

No, OSQA/Askbot is not compatible with Stackexchange.
If you are explicitly looking for a Robotics QNA site on Stackexchange, Robotics Research is in the commitment phase of it's launch currently.  It is not a ROS community like this one is, but a more general robotics QNA hosted on stack exchange.

I don't think there is any fix to this.  Some people just don't agree with the way that Stack Exchange works, and want more control over their communities.  I don't think that it is a high priority for either OSQA/Askbot or Stack Exchange to add this feature.

Is there any way to suggest them to fix this uncompatible? If yes,this way will also attract more people to use stackexchange.

What's the big difference between both? From my user point of view they do the same thing - I can ask questions and people answer. I also think adding the ROS Q&A to stack exchange would be a good idea!

Now, robotics.stackexchange.com is the general robotics platform in stack exchange.
