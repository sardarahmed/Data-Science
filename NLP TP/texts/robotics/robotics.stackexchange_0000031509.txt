Q:

Using rosservice from webui

Hi
Does anyone have tried to change parameter of dynamic_reconfigure from webui?
For example , I could't figure out how to change prosilica_diver/set_parameters.
Of course I can change it from command line like below.

   rosservice call /prosilica_driver/set_parameters '{config:{ints:[[x_offset,0],[y_offset,0],[width,0],[height,0]]}}'

but calling from webui(ros.js) as followings did not works.

    gPump.service_call("prosilica_driver/set_parameters",
                       [[["auto_exposure",true]],
                        [["x_offset",pxoffset]],
                        [["trigger_mode","polled"]],
            [["trig_rate",15.0]]
                        ]);

thanks,

A:

Webui was, at one point, for "internal use only".  At this point it is completely unsupported...
