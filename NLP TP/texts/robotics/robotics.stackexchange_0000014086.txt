Q:

Can someone explain what is going on in this calibration video?

I am trying to understand this IMU calibration video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF7sLU0fX7k&feature=em-comments
In the video the operator gets accelerometer data when pointing each axis in the gravity direction. He then has an algorithm at minute 6:34. 
I don't know where this algorithm comes from.
My understanding of how you get an accelerometer bias is you add the output when an axis is pointing in the gravity direction to the output when that axis is pointing antiparallel to gravity and then you divide by 2. Where is he getting this algorithm?

A:

Let b, the bias error of a sensor. 
If you take two measurements of a known value (gravitational acceleration in this case), in opposite directions, say m1 and m2, without any bias towards any direction the following is true:
1) m1 + m2 = 0.
However, if there's a directional bias error, the sensor readings become:
2) (m1 + b) + (m2 + b) = 2b.
Hope this gives some explanation.
