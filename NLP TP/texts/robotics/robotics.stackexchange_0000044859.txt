Q:

how to list all the nodes of a package?

I'm getting used to ROS and I've found several times commands have the following syntax:
command package_name package_node
then it raises a question "How can I list all the nodes of that package??" to use in such commands??

Maybe I'm misinterpreting your question, but if you're talking about running commands in your shell, (like rosrun, roslaunch) tab auto-completion works with ROS commands too.  Tabbing twice should give you all the options you can use.

rosrun robotino_navigation executables [args] -> I think that's only possible to search for all possible packages. In this case, when I tab again to find all the possible executables but it ROS cursor doesn't show these hints

@joq & @tbh: that solves half of my problem. Thank you!

Since you still have a problem, please edit your question to add additional information about it, or open a new question, whichever makes sense to you.

A:

As @tbh said, shell auto-completion will list all the nodes by pressing the tab key twice like this:
$ rosrun package_name <tab><tab>

This doesn't work on all platforms. i.e. Raspian doesn't support tab-completion.

Tab completion works, but there should be a command for that.

Also: Doesn't this list the executable name, not the node name?
