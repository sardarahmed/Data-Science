Q:

ros urdf tutorial on osx

I did some of the turtle sim tutorials and now I'm trying to do an urdf tutorial but I'm running into some issues. What's going on here?
$ roslaunch urdf_tutorial display.launch model:='$(find urdf_tutorial)/urdf/01-myfirst.urdf'

A:

Just making sure: have you sourced the correct setup.bash / workspace? These error messages point to some issues with the environment you are trying to start the launch file in (not being able to find rviz fi).
