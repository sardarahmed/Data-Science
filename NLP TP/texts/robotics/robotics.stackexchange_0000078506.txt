Q:

Navigation Stack : What Am I missing? Robot not moving?

Hi all, this has been a ongoing battle which I am loosing, the wiki is not the easiest thing to follow.
So I have a robot (2 wheel, running Lidar)

It runs Hector Slam which gives me /odom
it can be moved by teleop (nav_msg)

I have created all the files in http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup (move_base running on robot)
I have also setup RVIZ as shown in http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/Using%20rviz%20with%20the%20Navigation%20Stack
However in RVIZ when I press 2D Nav Goal, bugger all happens.
Current errors I seem to be seeing
No transform between frames /map and /base_link available after 20.003237 seconds of waiting. This warning only prints once
[ WARN] [1485103992.288786277]: Timed out waiting for transform from base_link to map to become available before running costmap, tf error: . canTransform returned after 0.101515 timeout was 0.1.
The problem is I am getting super confused now, going via the Tutorials, things like URDF come up which I dont think I need because of the YAML file?  This like build a tf_broadcaster also appear?
**Theres are my topics : Maybe it does not match the yaml file?

/cmd_vel
/initialpose
/map
/map_metadata
/poseupdate
/rosout
/rosout_agg
/rpms
/scan
/slam_cloud
/slam_out_pose
/syscommand
/tf
/tf_static**

I am sure its such a simple thing I am missing!

It looks like you're missing the TF transform between /map and /base_link (TF frames; not topics). It would be helpful to run rosrun tf view_frames or rqt_tf_tree to look at the TF tree (and post the results here if you can)

I used files from here https://github.com/DaikiMaekawa/navigation2d_example but not sure what fixed it yet

A:

So I found this https://github.com/DaikiMaekawa/navigation2d_example and used their yaml files and edited more launch files and it now works.
