Q:

Rostest and C++: Test node does not exist or is not executable

Hi!
I'm trying to integrate my workspace with GitLab CI and have been encountering this issue in the CI shell:
 FAILURE: Test node [husky_test/common_spawn_test] does not exist or is not executable
However, locally, everything works fine and the test yields a success. Here's the testing section of my CMakeLists.txt file:
#############
## Testing ##
#############

if(CATKIN_ENABLE_TESTING)
  add_rostest_gtest(common_test test/common.test src/common.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(common_test ${catkin_LIBRARIES})
endif()

And the gitlab-ci.yaml file contains the following lines for running the tests:
- catkin build --summarize --no-status --force-color
- catkin run_tests --no-status --force-color

Maybe I have to add the file as an executable in the CMakeLists, but I'm not sure. Thank you in advance!
