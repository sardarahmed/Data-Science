Q:

Throttle message rate for subscribers

I have a publisher with a high data rate (approx. 100 Hz) and multiple subscribers. One of them requires the full data rate, while another is quite happy with one message per second.
My simple solution for the latter is to process every 100th message only, but I was wondering if ROS provides a more elegant solution, such as a message filter or a subscription option which lets me choose the desired message rate.

A:

In fact, ROS does. What you're looking for is the drop node from topic_tools.

Thanks for the link. In this particular instance, I would prefer a way to control the rate from within my own node (C++), but I'll keep this package in mind for future reference.
