Q:

Is it possible to navigate and build map at the same time?

Hello~ all
I'm a starter to learn ROS.
Now I focus on Navigation and map generation.
We know that autonomous navigation procedure is :
Load map files(yaml & PGM files) => Localization(amcl) => User assigns the goal =>
Plan an ideal route (global planner+costmap) => obstacle avoidance (Local Planner+costmap) => Reached!!
It means we have to build a map beforehand, then we can do autonomous navigation.
I'd like to know...
(1) Is it possible to immediately update map if robot found a new obstacle not showed on the static map?
(2)is it possible to do autonomous navigation and build map at the same time.
I mean...generate a small part of map and keep updating it to RObot for navigation?
I searched the forum and found the related article as follows, seems not available my request.
http://answers.ros.org/question/37486/modifying-a-known-map-gmapping/
Does anyone know about it?
It would be better to give me some idea or suggestion.
Thanks

A:

You can use gmapping and move_base together to build a map and navigate autonomously in an unknown environment, but because you can't start gmapping with a partial map, this means that your map will always start empty (probably not what you want). gmapping also requires constantly increasing memory over the life of the map, so it isn't well suited for long-term use.
I don't have any direct experience with it, but the hector_slam package provides another SLAM implementation that may do what you're looking for.
