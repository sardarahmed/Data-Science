Q:

rgbdslam/rgbdslam_ros_ui.h not found

I am trying to build my own SLAM project using some of RGBDSLAM code. After I copied some modules I went to compile using rosmake, but it threw me this error
rgbdslam/rgbdslam_ros_ui.h: No such file or directory

I figurd this is happening because I am missing something about service generation. Can anyone guide me how to do that. BTW, I have the following line uncommented in CMakeLists
rosbuild_gensrv()

But I have no idea how to make it recognize the rgbdslam folder in src.

A:

This is probably not the best solution, but you could try adding this line in your CmakeList.txt : include_directories(~/YOUR-PATH/rgbdslam_freiburg/rgbdslam/srv_gen/cpp/include)

Thank you for pointing me in right direction. I didn't use that solution, but I made some changes about include directories in my CMakeLists.txt with help from the same file of rgbdslam, and it helped!

I'm glad it helped you. Would you be able to share your solution? I have a similar problem, I get this error: fatal error: linux/compiler.h: No such file or directory compilation terminated. I have added this include_directories(/usr/src/linux-headers-3.2.0-35-generic/include/linux) but doesn't work
