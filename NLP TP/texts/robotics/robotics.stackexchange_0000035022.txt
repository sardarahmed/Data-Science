Q:

Top level menu doesn't work on Planning Components Visualizer

Hi,
I attended the IROS 2011 workshop on motion planning and went through the tutorials. I wanted to do it again myself and haven't had any problems until I tried to select commands from the top level menu on Planning Components Visualizer. I don't think I had any issues at the workshop just right-clicking "Command..." to display the menu, but it doesn't work on my work environment. I followed the tutorial instructions (http://www.kavrakilab.org/sites/default/files/iros2011_ros_ompl_tutorial.pdf). Do I need to do something else to display the menu other than launching the visualizer at the beginning of Section 6? I ran roswtf and didn't see any errors (although there was 1 warning as below):
$ roswtf
Loaded plugin tf.tfwtf

I'm running Ubuntu 10.04.3 (x86-64) with kernel 2.6.32-34 and using ROS Electric with arm_navigation 1.0.6 and visualization 1.6.4.

Try doing an rm * in the .rviz directory in your home directory.  I've seen that fixed problems where interactive markers aren't working at all.
Comment by tyama on 2011-10-18:
Thanks for your quick reply. Yes, I selected the "Interact" tab on Rviz, and the markers showed up. The status of "Interactive Markers" was OK. But, none of the markers weren't working.
Comment by egiljones on 2011-10-18:
That's all you should need to do.  Are you sure that you've selected the "Interact" tab at the top of Rviz - none of the interactive markers will work if you don't select that tab.  Are any of the other interactive markers working in the application?

A:

I ended up reinstalling the visualization stack, but everything works fine now. Thank you very much for your help, egiljones!
