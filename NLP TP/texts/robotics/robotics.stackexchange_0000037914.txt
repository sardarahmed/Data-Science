Q:

ethzasl_message_transport stack (for UDP Multicast) installation problem

I am looking to use UDP multicasting approach for communication, I found one stack with 'udpmulti_transport' package which does that.
http://www.ros.org/browse/stack.php?name=ethzasl_message_transport
I have been having problem installing this stack, have cloned it from the repository, and added the folder to Ros Package path.
When I try to install it ( rosmake --rosdep-install ) I get error in the packages which seems to be c++ coding error.
pakage udpmulti_transport
  ***udpmulti_publisher.h:30: error: expected ‘;’ before ‘&’ token***

then have similar error in sharedmem_transport
Is there something wrong in the stack or I am making some mistake.
PS: running ROS electric

A:

Found the problem. Evidently ROS electric has some issues with class ros::Message. Its working fine in Diamondback.
