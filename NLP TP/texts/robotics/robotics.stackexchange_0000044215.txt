Q:

unmet dependencies while installing ROS Fuerte on Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit

Hi all,
I have recently upgraded to Ubuntu 12.04, and naturally tried to upgrade to ROS Fuerte. My laptop has the following specifications:
Memory: 1.9 GiB
Processor: Intel® Core™2 Duo CPU T8100 @ 2.10GHz × 2
Graphics: Intel® 965GM
OS Type: 64-bit
I have been installing-removing-installing-removing ROS Fuerte again and again and keep on getting the following error.

Selecting previously unselected
package ros-fuerte-desktop-full.
Unpacking ros-fuerte-desktop-full
(from
.../ros-fuerte-desktop-full_1.0.0-s1347207966~precise_amd64.deb)
... Errors were encountered while
processing:
/var/cache/apt/archives/libassimp-dev_2.0.863+dfsg-2_amd64.deb
E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned
an error code (1)

and also the fact that Ubuntu reported error message saying

'Error: Broken count>0' This usually
means that your installed packages
have unmet dependencies

I upgraded libassimp via synaptic, so now I have libassimp2-d-dev, libassimp3.0 ...
Then, I tried

sudo apt-get -f install

I get the following messages.

I have read a few threads on unmet dependencies, still, I'm not sure what to fix.
Thread 1: http://answers.ros.org/question/43369/unmet-dependencies-for-fuerte-desktop-full-on-1204/
Thread 2: http://answers.ros.org/question/42596/unmet-dependency-on-eigen-for-vision-opencv-now-cant-install-or-upgrade-any-fuerte-packages/
Anyhow, ROS is running whenever I call roscore, but I will not be able to create overlay, since I cannot do this (synaptic will prompt me to remove some ros related packages like ros-desktop-full etc):

sudo apt-get install python-rosinstall python-rosdep

in which I will get the following messages

The following packages have unmet
dependencies:  python-rosinstall :
Depends: mercurial but it is not going
to be installed
Depends: bzr but it is not going to be installed
Depends: python-vcstools but it is not going to
be installed  ros-fuerte-robot-model :
Depends: libassimp-dev but it is not
going to be installed
ros-fuerte-visualization : Depends:
libassimp-dev but it is not going to
be installed E: Unmet dependencies.
Try 'apt-get -f install' with no
packages (or specify a solution).

Any ideas?

Was this the solution?!   I have exactly the same problem. I upgraded my Ubuntu from 10.04 to 12.04 and Fuerte will not install due to the same errors as above.

I have not yet found a solution :(.. tried uninstalling 'libassimp2-dev', and then installed 'libassimp2' and then unistalling it, basically i tried every possible libassimp in synaptic.....
Comment by whiterose on 2012-09-25:
solved by removing libassimp3.0 and installed libassimp-dev... allenh1's solution was right.

A:

Try removing libassimp-dev and the other problems you are having trouble with. You likely have a newer version installed.
If this doesn't work, start the system install over. To do this without losing any data,
I recommend you install as you usually would, but DO NOT format the drive. Doing so will erase your data. By not formatting the drive, you can keep the data but override the operating system files.
