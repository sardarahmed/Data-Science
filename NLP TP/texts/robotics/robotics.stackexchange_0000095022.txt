Q:

Problem while installing ros navigation

Hi, i'm having some problem trying install ros-kinetic-navigation on ubuntu 16.04, it tells me:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 ros-kinetic-navigation : Depends: ros-kinetic-map-server but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

If i try to install ros-kinetic-map-server it tells me:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 ros-kinetic-map-server : Depends: libsdl-image1.2-dev but it is not going to be installed
                          Depends: libsdl1.2-dev but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

And it goes deeper and deeper.
I've tried to reinstall ros with no results.
EDIT: SOLVED
Solved using aptitude:
sudo aptitude install libsdl-image1.2-dev

And follow its instructions

A:

Solved:
Install aptitude.
Then:

It will find you all the needed dependencies and ask you if you want to install them.
