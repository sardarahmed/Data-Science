Q:

Got IK error 33 after generating IK solver using planning description configuration wizard

Hi All,
I recently generated the ik solver for my own 6 dofs robot arm using planning description configuration wizard. But when I tried to calculate the ik solution for a definitely feasible pose, I got the error code 33. I checked the rxconsole and it says that ik initial checking fails. Does anyone know what causes the problem? Thank you!

A:

-33 means IK_LINK_IN_COLLISION. so make sure that at your goal pose your robot does not collide with other objects.
To check the detailed collision information, use the following code:
assuming that you have a variable  planning_environment::CollisionModels* cm_, then you can use:
std::vector<arm_navigation_msgs::ContactInformation> contacts;
cm_->getAllCollisionsForState(*state,contacts);
for(int i=0;i<contacts.size();i++)
{
    std::cout<<contacts[i].contact_body_1<<" and "<<contacts[i].contact_body_2
            <<" in collision"<<std::endl;
}
