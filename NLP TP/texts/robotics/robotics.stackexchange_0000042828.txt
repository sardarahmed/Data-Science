Q:

Creating a throttle node

Hello,
I was only able to find documentation online for command line tools for throttling or the other topic_tools for that matter.
Is there a way to create a throttle node from a launch file? I want to go from 30hz to something less. Thanks,
Blair

A:

Just use the command line tools in roslaunch:
<launch>
  <node name="foo_throttler" type="throttle" pkg="topic_tools" args="messages /input_topic 30 /input_topic_throttled" />
</launch>

Ha! So simple that I didn't even try that. Thanks!

This is the correct answer but I wish there were a way to inform a node that you don't need the data at the higher rate.  Without this capability, a lot of processing is wasted on the publisher.

I have tried this but I can not get the rate I want. For example, my input_topic is 200Hz, but my input_topic_throttled is only 25Hz, even if I use 100 in the args.

Ik it's a very late reply to this post but replying if it can help someone else.
for @ZiyangLl comment, you can write it like this:
<launch>
<node name = "input_topic_throttler" type="drop" pkg="topic_tools" args= "/input_topic 7 8 /input_topic_throttled" />
</launch>

This will drop every 7 frames of incoming 8 frames, So 200/8 = 25 Hz (taking only one frame from every 8 frames, from a 200 frame stack)

@one I guess we replace input_topic with the actual topic I wish to  throttle? Also, I would have to make a script where I create the node right?

Yes, input_topic is the topic you want to throttle. I think you can directly add it to your launch file http://wiki.ros.org/topic_tools/throttle
