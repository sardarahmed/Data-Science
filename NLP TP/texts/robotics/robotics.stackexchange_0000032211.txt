Q:

File conversion from *.urdf to *.xacro

How we can convert a hand-written URDF file to a .xacro file (xml macro for generating URDF files) for robot and world models?

A:

There is no official or programmatic way of doing this, as the process is strongly dependent on the platform that you are using.
When converting from a URDF to a xacro file, I did the following:

Create properties for commonly-used constants
Mathematics constants: M_PI, M_2PI
Conversion constants: Radians to Degrees, inches to centimeters
Physics constants: Speed of Light, gravity (if needed)
Create properties for variable components of your robot (Parts that will be constant over a run, but may change between runs)
Wheel Radius
Ground Clearance
Camera Height/Angle
Create macros for arrays of parts on your robot (a good example would be the super-structure of the turtlebot).
Create macros for any components that are "mirrored"

arms
wheels

This would be a good starting point for creating a xacro file, in general.
Edit:
See this tutorial for further details and syntax.
