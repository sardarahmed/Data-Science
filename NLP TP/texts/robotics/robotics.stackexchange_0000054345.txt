Q:

Aren't the ROS and catkin tutorials mixed?

I've been looking at the ROS tutorial page (http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials), and it appears to be mixed with he catkin tutorial page (http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials).
For example, there's twice the tutorial 'Creating a ROS package', and the 'Overlaying with catkin workspaces' is shown at the ROS tutorial page, while that is a very specific catkin tutorial.
I'm unsure whether I can change the page myself, but I feel as if it should be changed. The current setup is confusing for new users.

A:

I think I fixed what @RafBerkvens is talking about. Basically there were catkin tutorials which were interleaved into the ROS tutorials, but only in the listing. Something like this:

ROS Tutorial 1
ROS Tutorial 2
Catkin Tutorial 1
ROS Tutorial 3
Catkin Tutorial 2
...

Someone added a fork in the tutorial chain which wasn't natural.
@RafBerkvens, does the new setup help?
Edit:
This change is responsible, it also previously wiped out the later Tutorials, which I caught and fixed at the time, but I missed this subtle change before:
