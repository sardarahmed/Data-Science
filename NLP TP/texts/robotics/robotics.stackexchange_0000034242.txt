Q:

Swarm robotics facility in ROS?

I am interested in swarm robotics - I know about swarm simulation in Stage (ver 3.X.X and above - this works when I use stage and fails for stageros). I guess such swarm simulations may be possible in Gazebo (?).
Does ROS provide for any platform/package/software for swarm and/or multi-robot simulation ?

@kwc : Multimaster support, planned for in Fuerte - can that be potentially an answer to this question ?

@kwc : All right ! ....... hope hopen, I have added another screenshot ! ....

The question is appropriate, there just aren't any answers.  Don't worry about cleaning it up.

@kwc : Okay, if it doesn't really suit the topics at answers.ros (I had to create the tag of swarm) then should we scrap it ?

Others can vote your question up.  Note that asking for a confirmation that there's no other solution in the entire eco-system is not really possible, for no one is familiar with every ROS package in the world.  No reply likely means that there's not another version.

@kwc : Hi Ken, I am not getting much of a response on this question. Is there a award of a 'bounty' at answers.ros as in stackoverflow and superuser ?

A:

I think gazebo might be a bit overkill performance-wise although it is theoretically possible. Do you need gazebo for simulation?
There is a stage package for ROS if you were looking for that.

@dornhege : Yep - Stage works good, as of now my means for swarm robotics simulations. Any other software/packages will be most welcome.
Comment by dornhege on 2011-09-13:
I was only referring to the fact that stage is supported in ROS directly. I'm not aware of other packages, but someone else might know some.

@dornhege : I know about Stage (see the reference) - I am currently using Stage. I wanted to check out if ROS has any other leverages for swarm robotics.
