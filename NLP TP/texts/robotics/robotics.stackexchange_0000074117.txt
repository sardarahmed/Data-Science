Q:

Unable to sync with device

hello, i've tried this tutorial but when i rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM1 or rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py _port:=/dev/ttyACM1 (my port is ttyACM1), the result is
[INFO] [WallTime: 1464200241.928070] ROS Serial Python Node
[INFO] [WallTime: 1464200241.933151] Connecting to /dev/ttyACM1 at 9600 baud
[ERROR] [WallTime: 1464200259.039163] Unable to sync with device; possible link problem or link software version mismatch such as hydro rosserial_python with groovy Arduino

i'm sure that my rosserial is in indigo and i've tried installed again following this tutorial. the result still the same.
though, i remember, a few weeks before, i've tried rosserial with HelloWorld and it was successful.
so i really wonder why right know i got this kind of error '-'
Help Please!!
anyway, i'm using Ubuntu 14.04.1 with ROS Indigo

A:

Hey, please check your baud rate. The default baud rate in the tutorial you mentioned above is 57600. This should be set as default when you start serial_node.py, otherwise specify it during startup:
rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py _baud:=57600 _port:=/dev/ttyACM0

Hi, I am also facing the same problem but could not fix it even after setting the baud rate. I am working with razor 9dof IMU and was not able to make communication between Arduino and IMU. Can you please help me out in resolving this problem.
