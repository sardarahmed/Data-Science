Q:

Using turtlesim

I'm thinking about simulating a ROS robot running a maze. I thought of using TurtleSim instead of Gazebo because: it is lighter weight with only 2d, and I would be able to define the maze in two dimensions which would be easier.
I have a few basic questions about TurtleSim:

Is there a way to define "obstacles" or "walls" in TurtleSim?
I guess this amounts to the same: does it simulate a Lidar or similar sensor?

Or should I ignore all the other simulators and stick with Gazebo?

Using turtlesim for this is probably not a good idea: it wasn't made for this and will require quite some work.
I suggest you take a look at stdr_simulator.
