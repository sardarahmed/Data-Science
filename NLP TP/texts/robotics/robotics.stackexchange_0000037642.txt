Q:

[RGDBSLAM installation] missing gsl/gsl_linalg.h

OS: Clean Ubuntu 11.10
ROS version: Electric
I'm trying to install RGBDSLAM for the first time and I'm mystified.  I've followed the installation instructions on the ROS Wiki without issue until step 3.2, but when I execute the line
rosmake --rosdep-install rgbdslam
it fails with this line
~/ros/rgbdslam/external/gicp/optimize.h:44:28: fatal error: gsl/gsl_linalg.h: No such file or directory
Any ideas how to fix this? Let me know if there's more diagnostic info that might help

A:

I suspect you're missing GSL; the GNU scientific library.
The --rosdep-install option should do this for you, but it obviously isn't for some reason. You should file this as a bug against the rgbdslam stack.
In the meantime, you can install GSL with 'sudo apt-get install libgsl0-dev'

@Felix: this is a problem because you don't have your stack setup properly; either you need rosdep.yaml in the rgbdslam_freiburg stack, or you need to convert rgbdslam into a unary stack, with both a stack.xml and a manifest.xml.

Thanks! This worked! How do I go about filing the bug?  Sorry, a bit of a noob here.

This is correct. However, I can't fix this from the rgbdslam-side, so the bug report should be addressed at rosdep.

Thanks, ahendrix. I'll fix that soon.
