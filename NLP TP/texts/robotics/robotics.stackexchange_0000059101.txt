Q:

Problem while trying object recognition

Hi everyone!
I want to try the object recognition kitchen on my ubuntu 12.04 and ros hydro. I followed the install tuto (http://wg-perception.github.io/object_recognition_core/install.html#install ), so I've done this for install:
$ cd catkin_ws/
$ mkdir ork/src
$ sudo apt-get install libopenni-dev ros-hydro-catkin ros-hydro-ecto* ros-hydro-opencv-candidate ros-hydro-moveit-msgs
$ source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.sh
$ git clone http://github.com/wg-perception/object_recognition_core
$ git clone http://github.com/wg-perception/capture
$ git clone http://github.com/wg-perception/reconstruction
$ git clone http://github.com/wg-perception/linemod
$ git clone http://github.com/wg-perception/ork_renderer
$ git clone http://github.com/wg-perception/tabletop
$ git clone http://github.com/wg-perception/tod
$ git clone http://github.com/wg-perception/transparent_objects
$ git clone http://github.com/wg-perception/object_recognition_msgs
$ git clone http://github.com/wg-perception/object_recognition_ros
$ cd ../ && catkin_make

after I try this:
$ rosrun object_recognition_core push.sh
$ source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.sh
$ roscore

in a new terminal:
$ roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch

in a new terminal:
$ rosrun object_recognition_capture orb_template -o my_textured_plane

AND HERE I HAVE AN ERROR!!!:
simonus@robert:~$ rosrun object_recognition_capture orb_template -o my_textured_plane
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/simonus/catkin_ws/ork/src/capture/apps/orb_template", line 12, in <module>
    from object_recognition_capture.ecto_cells.capture import PlaneFilter, FeatureFinder
ImportError: No module named object_recognition_capture.ecto_cells.capture
simonus@robert:~$

And my paths are:
$ export | grep ROS
declare -x ROSLISP_PACKAGE_DIRECTORIES=""
declare -x ROS_DISTRO="hydro"
declare -x ROS_ETC_DIR="/opt/ros/hydro/etc/ros"
declare -x ROS_MASTER_URI="http://localhost:11311"
declare -x ROS_PACKAGE_PATH="/home/simonus/catkin_ws:/opt/ros/hydro/share:/opt/ros/hydro/stacks"
declare -x ROS_ROOT="/opt/ros/hydro/share/ros"

I don't know what I do wrong!Please I need help :(

Can you import object_recognition_capture as a whole?

I had the same error; I had to set my python path to the ork build directory: export PYTHONPATH=SOMETHING/ork/devel/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
