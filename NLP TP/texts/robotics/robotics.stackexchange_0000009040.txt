Q:

Metal shaft design for a 6mm plastic bevel gear

I have a small POM bevel gear with these dimensions:

It has a 6mm hole for the shaft and a M4 hole for the set screw.
Suppose this bevel gear is meshed with a 45T bevel gear and give a max. output torque of 0.4kg/cm. How should the design of the 6mm shaft be? Should the diameter be precisely 6mm? Should it be flattened into a 'D' shape (so that the set screw can hold the shaft)? I'm planning to use a metal shaft.
Any help will be appreciated.
Thanks

A:

Since the bevel gear itselt is made out of plastic, you don't need to do a lot of considerations about the shaft. 
Basically you are talking about a relationship between a hole and a shaft. This relationshift is called a fit. Usually you are defineing your fit by assining special tolerancefields and tolerancesizes to your nominal size.
In this case you have some cheap plastics, where you are almost unable to apply any special tolerances. This comes from the nature of those plastics, they are pretty flexible and can't stand lot of forces, in addition they are very hard to maschine.(I have never seen a broach made for plastics) Therefor most of this plastic parts are made by injection moulding (which is most likely true for your parts). 
So let's this excursion into construction theory end and come back to your question. Just buy a cheap metal pin with 6mm (in most cases it is 6h7). If you measure the pin, you will see it will have somewhere between 5.97 and 6.00mm.
Create a flatspot ( use  a file or an electric driller), to prevent twisting between the gearing and the shaft and you are done.
