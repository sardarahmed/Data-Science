Q:

Problem spawning objects in Gazebo, Robotino

Hello, I'm new to ROS, and URDF, and am working on a project in which I need to use both. I have gone through all of the tutorials on how everything works, and am trying to spawn the Robotino URDF file to no avail.
The error I keep on receiving is
Service call failed: transport error completing service call: unable to receive data from sender, check sender's logs for details
I can spawn basic objects just fine, but for some reason this URDF file just won't work. I have all of the meshes that the URDF calls as well.
I downloaded the urdf from the ROS website repostiory which included the meshes already. I am wondering if the urdf cannot find these mesh files though.
Any help would be appreicated.
My URDF is below

It would help if you posted your URDF for us to look at

What is your spawn command that you're using?
Comment by Gen_Robotino on 2012-06-12:
I am using
rosrun gazebo spawn_model -file robotino.urdf -urdf -model robotino

A:

I used the command svn from the ROS website, which gave me all of the correct meshes.
