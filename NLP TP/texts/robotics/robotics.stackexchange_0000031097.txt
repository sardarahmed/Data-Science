Q:

What is the default behavior of the odometry display in Rviz?

Hello,
I am wondering what is the default behaviour I should expect from the odomety display we have in Rviz.
More precisely, I wonder if the odometry arrows should follow the twist information:

Should the arrow point toward where the robot is going? I mean, when the robot drives backward, should the arrows point toward its back or is it normal that they stay oriented toward its front?
Should the arrow's length be proportional with the instant velocities carried in the twist section of the odometry message?

Thanks in advance
Raph

A:

I believe the odometry visualization in rviz simply allows for visualization of the pose contained in the the nav_msgs/Odometry message. I don't think it does anything with the geometry_msgs/Twist, though that would be a useful feature request for rviz. So, you'd expect the arrow to stay the same size and simply convey the robot's position in the odometric frame at a given point. More information on how rviz treats odometry messages can be found here: http://www.ros.org/wiki/rviz/DisplayTypes/Odometry

Thanks eitan. I did check the doc before posting my question, but the video only shows the pr2 moving forward :) indeed, having odom follow the twist info could be a nice feature.
