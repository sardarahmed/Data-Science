Q:

Husky A200 crashed after Ubuntu 12.04 and Fuerte update

Hi,
I updated the onboard mini-ITX PC in Husky A200 with Ubuntu 12.04 and ROS Fuerte today. while the installations were successful and i was able to complete all the procedures including the download of clearpath packages for Ubuntu 12.04 the system repeatedly keeps saying
"unable to communicate with the master"
Initially I downloaded the various clearpath packages for husky including,
ros-fuerte-clearpath-husky-robot
ros-fuerte-clearpath-husky
ros-fuerte-clearpath-common
ros-fuerte-clearpath-kinect
I performed the steps provided in husky page which is briefly mentioned below.
roscd clearpath_common
sudo ./setup_udev.bash
roscd clearpath_bringup/upstart
sudo ./install.bash eth0 administrator husky_bringup

And finally,
sudo service clearpath start

However, for any further ROS command it mostly says,
unable to communicate with the master!

Interestingly I found that the install.bash file for fuerte also contains the name electric in several places. Should I modify this to fuerte instead?
Looking for some suggestions on restoring the communications in Husky,
Thanks.

Could you include the different ways you've already tried to fix the problem?

Hi,
I found that the mistake I found was absolutely correct. Replacing the name of electric in the install.bash file with fuerte solves the problem.
Thanks.
