Q:

generic way to test message equality

Is there a generic way to test for message equality (or even better for almost equality) in C++?
It would be useful for me, when writing cpp unit-tests.
There should be a way with serialization, at least for strict equality, but how to implement it in a generic manner?

A:

If you want something really strict and low level, you can follow your idea and serialize the messages into binary blobs and compare those.
I would not recommend that for any algorithms though.

Is there a base class for all ROS message classes for this purpose?

No, but I think the serialization traits are specialized.
