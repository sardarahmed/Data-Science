Q:

Monte Carlo map's given?

Hi to all,
I'm trying to program a Monte Carlo Localization.
I know the algorithm steps.
1-Initizalization (particles and pose robot)
2-Sensor update (get lidar data, matching with the map and give weights to each particle)
3-Resampling related to weight.
3-Motion update (move particles related to odometry sensor)
4-Sensor update and so on.
My problem is in step 2. I don't know how to do the matching with the map with sensor data... I don't know the equation or how to do it.
So my question is how to give weight to particles with a map given.
Any help?
Thanks a lot.

A:

This is too much to answer on this Forum/Q&A-page, as this really relates to the core aspects of the respective algorithm.
However, as this is pretty standard, there are a lot of papers, books and examples around.
Either check how it is done in amcl which stands for "Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization", read the book Probabilistic Robotics, Ch. 8.3 by Fox, Burgard and Thrun or check for papers or other sources.
