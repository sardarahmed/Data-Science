You can access to the physical IO.

Can you clarify what you mean by "internal IO" specifically? I'm unfamiliar with that name wrt UR robots. Are you referring to the safety IO, modbus registers, flags or something else?
Also: which controller and which version of Polyscope?

Are you referring to the IO ports on the end effector of the arm? Can you tell us which version of the UR driver you're currently using, there are a few out there.

I have to access to 7 words of 16 bits as input and same for the output on the modbus registers.
Polyscope 3.5
Controller 3.5.1.10661

For future questions: please include that sort of (version) info in your question text.

If you are referring to ur_modern_driver and ur_driver, then there is currently no support for accessing any IO elements apart from the standard ones (ie: tool and standard analogue and digital).
Accessing modbus words is not supported.

Yes, I was referring them. Nobody knows a fork that could do the trick before developing ?

I don't know of any forks that add this.
For writing, you could see whether sending URScript snippets to the /URScript topic works. It's not pretty, but could work.
If you do decide to develop something, start from this fork, and submit a PR! :)

but that of course doesn't mean that one could not exist.

Btw: if you're already using modbus, couldn't you use modbus from your ROS pc to access the words?
