Q:

print cmakelist variable

How can I print the contents of a variable in CMakelists
eg: link_directories(${ZED_LIBRARY_DIR})
I want to print ZED_LIBRARY_DIR
I tried
MESSAGE( STATUS "xxxx:"   ${ZED_INCLUDE_DIRS})
but get no output, thank you for help. I can not seem to find documentation that talks about doing this.

A:

I got around this by passing  -d option on catkin_make and grepping for output.

Hi! Do you know the option to print the message with catkin build?
