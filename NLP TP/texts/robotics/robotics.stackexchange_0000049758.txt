Q:

catkin_package() CATKIN_DEPENDS on 'console_bridge' but it is not a catkin package

The Homebrew installation is still experimental, and perhaps that's what I'm running into here.  But I just wanted to bring a little attention to this problem I'm encountering.
Specifically, when I try to do the isolated install (i.e. ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install) I end up seeing the following error:

CMake Error at
/Users/Yeison/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/share/catkin/cmake/catkin_package.cmake:173
(message):
catkin_package() CATKIN_DEPENDS on 'console_bridge',
which has been found   in
'/Users/Yeison/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/share/console_bridge/cmake/console_bridge-config.cmake',
but it is not a catkin package

A:

I completely removed the src directory from my workspace and pulled down a brand new working copy:
wstool init -j8 src http://packages.ros.org/web/rosinstall/generate/raw/groovy/desktop

It seems to have addressed the problem I was having.  I'm not sure what could have been the cause of it.
