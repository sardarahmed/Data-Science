Q:

TF_REPEATED_DATA error with robot_localization ukf package

Running ROS Noetic. I am receiving the following error on transforms published by UKF node from robot localization:

Warning: TF_REPEATED_DATA ignoring data with redundant timestamp for frame base_link at time 1597872121.936377 according to authority /ukf

I see this error popping up wherever the transform is being used (e.g., rviz) as well as in the UKF node's console output.
I did not have this issue with a hand-coded transform node. I am a bit uncertain how the UKF node handles and publishes transforms internally so hard for me to think about what could be causing this, here is what i know:

Timestamps on incoming odometry (only source I am using right now for testing) are being set correctly
Does not occur with any other transforms published by other nodes
We have multiple developers working on multiple different PCs, Some are VMs, some are physical installations. The error occurs repeatably on all of them so I don't believe it is any sort of system clock error or similar

Sorry for lack of additional detail, not sure what will be most helpful to share. Please let me know and I will update post.

We are aware, its an ongoing discussion in this ticket: https://github.com/ros/geometry2/issues/467
You probably haven't done anything wrong and generally speaking things should work OK in spite of the warnings.
