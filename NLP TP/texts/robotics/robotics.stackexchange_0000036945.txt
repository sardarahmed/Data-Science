Q:

usb_cam vidioc_streamon error 28

When I try to open up two video streams, I am getting an error stating that there is no space left on the device.
I know this is due to the bandwidth limitations of two cameras on one USB hub. I tried to lower the resolution of each camera, but this didn't help.
Did anybody use stereovision and successfully get two cameras to stream simultaneoulsy within ROS?
I am using usb_cam, but publishing two different topics.
thanks!

A:

I had the same problem and solved it as follow:
sudo rmmod uvcvideo
sudo modprobe uvcvideo quirks=128

After doing that, I can acquire images from 2 cameras at the same time.

Checkout this link to see how to add this to your module conf so that changes become permanent.
However, using OpenCV to acquire images from the webcam still does not work. But using the usb_cam pkg, everything is fine.
