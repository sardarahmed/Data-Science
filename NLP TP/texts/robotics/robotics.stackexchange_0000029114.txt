Q:

Camera : how to implement camera to the world?

Hi I am doing project with two Universal robots - UR5 and one mobile robot - Smart. I do not know how to implement the camera as urdf to my world. Could You help me? I attach screen of my scene.

I would like to upload a camera to this world, but I don't know how to do it. I tried to change the code from the tutorial: http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_gzplugins#Camera  but I still have errors in the terminal. Besides, the examples in the tutorials do not show how to insert the camera itself, but how to attach it to a robot, for example. Could someone of you explain me step by step how to do that? I can show you my launch of world and all the urdfs and codes.
Thank You for help! :)

A:

Here is a simple world with a predefined camera: https://github.com/osrf/gazebo/blob/gazebo11/worlds/camera.world
You can find the camera details here: https://github.com/osrf/gazebo_models/blob/master/camera/model.sdf
And, here is how to specify a camera in URDF: http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/Tutorials/UnderstandingPR2URDF#CA-27a380b7379ee7d82de732cd1a9a3490da1152cd_110
