Q:

Connection timed out installing openni_kinect on electric

I have been following the wiki tutorial regarding setting up openni_kinect on electric ubuntu 10.04
I am up to step 2.2 with the ubuntu installation and have tried
hg clone https://kforge.ros.org/openni/drivers
and I get the error
abort: error: Connection timed out
Does anyone know why this is happening?

kforge.ros.org has been down for a long time now. Also, Fuerte is EOL.
Do you have any particular reason for choosing those versions specifically?

A:

The Ubuntu installation (2.1) and the source-based installation (2.2) are mutually exclusive - you should only do one.

I've updated the wiki page to reflect this.
