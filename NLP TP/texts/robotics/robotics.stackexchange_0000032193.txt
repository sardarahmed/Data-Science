Q:

Android and ROS Communication over USB instead of Wifi

I'm interested in running Android devices as IMUs, GPS sources, or even complete Odometry sources.  I once implemented this for IMUs a long time ago over the wifi, but there was some considerable delay and wifi's ability to drop out for a bit.  If this were to work well in most cases, data would have to be sent with minimal delay: thus USB.
So at this point, I know that rosjava wouldn't really be the mode of communication (yet?), since I'd be using serial, but does anyone know if Android can communicate via serial on its USB port?
I guess this would also ensure the android device stays charged.  :P

A:

At least with the Android Honeycomb tablets, turning on USB tethering will automatically mount the tablet as a network device.  This is how we run tablets tethered to netbooks for demos.

Sorry Damon!  This is easier for my needs.  I confirmed that this works on Gingerbread (I have 2.3.4).  One more question: does anyone know how to hop across the networks.  Example: My usb tether is listed as 192.168.42.n, but the wifi clients are in 192.168.43.n.  Can I talk between them?
