Q:

where to find the original cpp file of ROS navigation package on my computer?

I am new to ROS and I am now trying to make some modifications on the original cpp files of base_local_planner, navigation package. I can find the header files such as trajectory.h, but really have no idea about where to find the original cpp files such as trajectory.cpp on my computer, even if I can find original code on github. Are there anybody who know the location of the cpp files?

A:

Assuming that you are using Ubuntu and installed ROS following the instructions on the wiki, the sources are not installed in your computer. Just the binaries.
If you want to modify the code on base_local_planner, you will have to clone the source code from the github repository into your workspace, do your modifications and compile.
Hope this helps
