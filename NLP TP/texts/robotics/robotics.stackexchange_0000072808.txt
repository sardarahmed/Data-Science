Q:

error while creating a MoveIt package

Hi,
I'm at the second last step to complete my MoveIt package for an Epson C3-A601S robot.
( READ: http://wiki.ros.org/Industrial/Tutorials/Create_a_MoveIt_Pkg_for_an_Industrial_Robot Step 3.1)
Unfortunately I've stumbled on an error (I am not talking about the naming conventions):
wim@wim-laptop:~/catkin_ws$ roslaunch epsonURDF_gripper_moveit_config  moveit_planning_execution.launch 
WARNING: Package name "epsonURDF_gripper_moveit_config" does not follow the naming conventions. It should start with a lower case letter and only contain lower case letters, digits and underscores.

Does anyone know who has had the same error or could tell me how I could prevent it?
Kind regards,
Wim

A:

The main error is here:

ResourceNotFound: [epsonURDF_gripper_moveit_config] 

roslaunch cannot find that package in your workspace. Some things to check:

is there actually a package called epsonURDF_gripper_moveit_config in your catkin_ws/src?
make sure you're using the package name, which does not necessarily need to be the same as the name of the directory
have you (re)built your workspace after adding the epsonURDF_gripper_moveit_config package to it?
make sure there are no typos in epsonURDF_gripper_moveit_config (note that Linux is case sensitive)

Easy check:
rospack find epsonURDF_gripper_moveit_config

should return the location of your package. If it doesn't, roslaunch won't be able to find it either.

Hi,
I have found the error.
The square brackets needed to be removed in the launch file. This was the 'stupid' problem. My bad.
Thanks anyway for the quick reply!
