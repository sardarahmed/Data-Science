Q:

laser_assembler while moving

Hi all,
This question is to clarify something. According to http://www.ros.org/wiki/laser_assembler the individual scans are projected into a fixed frame right? So, that means we can readily use the assembled cloud in process like octomap even when the robot is moving. I mean we do not need the robot to stop and acquire the cloud.
Is this correct?
Thanks
CS

A:

Yes, if the fixed_frame stays fixed during movement (something like /map or /odom).
However, you might not get perfectly matching data depending on the accuracy of whoever produces the fixed_frame transformation.
