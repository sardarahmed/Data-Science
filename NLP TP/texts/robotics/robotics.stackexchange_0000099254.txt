Q:

Autoware Auto - Record/Replay a Trajectory in LGSVL

Hi All,
I was trying to use "Record/Replay a Trajectory in LGSVL" from here.
And noticed that the below command does not seem to be working.
ros2 action send_goal /planning/recordtrajectory autoware_auto_msgs/action/RecordTrajectory "{record_path: "/tmp/path"}" --feedback

The passed action type is invalid
To find the right action, I searched in ros2 interface list and updated the command as below.
ros2 action send_goal /planning/recordtrajectory recordreplay_planner_actions/action/RecordTrajectory "{record_path: "/tmp/path"}" --feedback

The updated command seems to be working to record the path.
Similarly for "Reply" I used the below command.
ros2 action send_goal /planning/replaytrajectory recordreplay_planner_actions/action/ReplayTrajectory "{replay_path: "/tmp/path"}" --feedback

Could anybody please check and confirm on the same.
I have tried updating the ade by following the below steps. The version is 4.2.0.
kishor@kishor:~/adehome/AutowareAuto$ ade stop

ADE has been started, enter or run commands using: ade enter

kishor@kishor:~/adehome/AutowareAuto$ ade --version
4.2.0
kishor@kishor:~/adehome/AutowareAuto$ 

Is 4.2.0 the latest version?
And also I have captured the ros2 interface list for the msgs and actions available in the pre-built version. Actions given below:
Actions:
    autoware_auto_msgs/action/PlanTrajectory
    recordreplay_planner_actions/action/RecordTrajectory
    recordreplay_planner_actions/action/ReplayTrajectory
    tf2_msgs/action/LookupTransform

Thank you

Are you building Autoware from source or using the pre-built installation in /opt/AutowareAuto in Docker? Are you running ade or just building from source on a host machine? Which version of Autoware.Auto?
Comment by kk2105 on 2021-06-23:
@Josh, I am using the Autoware pre-built installation. And I am running on ade.
Comment by Josh Whitley on 2021-06-23:
Which version? Have you updated ade recently with the --update flag?
Comment by kk2105 on 2021-06-24:
ADE Version is 4.2.0. Yes, I have updated the ade recently. I am following this link to launch Autoware with LGSvl.

A:

Please try updating your ade containers again. We (somewhat) recently moved the actions for the Record/Replay Planner from the package recordreplay_planner_actions to autoware_auto_msgs but the latest installation in /opt/AutowareAuto of the ade containers should have this update applied.
Please also verify that you have no old instances of ade already running by first running ade stop and then ade start --update --enter from within your AutowareAuto folder.

Thanks for the answer.
Is 4.2.0 the latest ade version? I have also updated my question with more details and steps followed.
Comment by Josh Whitley on 2021-06-25:
You didn't mention previously that you were using the 1.0.0 version. In this version, the action was under recordreplay_planner_actions. This is not a problem with the docs, but with which docs you are using. We are currently transitioning to ReadTheDocs to be able to host multiple versions of our docs (master, release, and tagged release versions). Here are the docs specific to the current latest release (1.0.0): https://autowareauto.readthedocs.io/en/release/.

Sorry, I did not notice that.
Thanks for the clarification Josh. I will follow the right documents.
