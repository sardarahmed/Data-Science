Q:

Navigation: Distance between Waypoints in Global Path

Hello,
I was wondering how the distance between the waypoints is determined in the global planner, and is it possible to increase this distance (i.e. decrease the number of waypoints) on the global path?
Thanks

A:

Currently, the only way to do this is to decrease the resolution of underlying costmap.

Thanks. So the distance between the waypoints is basically the distance between the adjacent cells of the costmap grid? and How can I decrease the resolution of the costmap?

For the global planner, it is likely the same as the resolution of your static map. Otherwise there's a parameter that changes it, sneakily called "resolution" :)
