Q:

advertise() function parameter for vector type

I'd like to publish a vector (cpp) in my publisher, and I do not want to create my own message. Is there already a built-in type for it? What I mean is to replace "std_msgs::Float64" part below:
ros::Publisher pub = n.advertise<std_msgs::Float64>("/radar", 500);

I already checked the message types here and I couldn't see anything for vector. I already desperately tried std_msgs::vector<int> and it didn't work, gave parameter error, seems like it is not the way.
Any thoughts?

A:

If you don't want to do your own, Float64MultiArray is the equivalent. A vector is essentially a 1-dimensional array.
