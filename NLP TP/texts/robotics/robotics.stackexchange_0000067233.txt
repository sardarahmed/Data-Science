Q:

publishing data one after the other with constant time

Hello,
I would like to publish  data from the XML file using pugixml.I need to make the publication (content) one by one with constant time.For example after the publication of first data,it has to wait for 10 secs and then the second data should follow.
Since i m in the beginner level in ROS,i don't know how to achieve this task?
Can anyone suggest an idea?
Thanks,
Best Regards,
Annaiyan
