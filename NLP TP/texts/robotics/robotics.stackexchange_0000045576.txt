Q:

R2D2 urdf moving in Rviz but not Gazebo

Hi all,
I can load my r2d2 urdf from the urdf tutorials in both Gazebo and Rviz. However, in RViz the model is moving in a circle and in Gazebo it is stationary.  Why is this so?
Thank you

Not enough information. How does your set up look like?
Comment by tangell on 2012-11-07:
I'm not sure what kind of information you're looking for?

For example, what tutorial did you follow? How do you move the models in rviz?
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-11-07:
Also which launch files are you running? Which ROS distribution? See http://ros.org/wiki/Support

I'm using ROS fuerte and I followed this tutorial:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/urdf/Tutorials/Using%20urdf%20with%20robot_state_publisher
I'm using the state and launch file from that page. I changed model.xml to model.urdf and made the launch file look for model.urdf instead of model.xml.

A:

The R2D2 Tutorials publish information to /tf, which is visualized in rviz. It does NOT simulate the motors and other functionality for it to be fully simulated in Gazebo.

So when a robot is able to be simulated in Gazebo and Rviz, what kind of extra information or files are being used?
Comment by David Lu on 2012-11-07:
You need to specify the controllers for the different joints.

Can you give me an example?
Comment by David Lu on 2012-11-08:
Alas, I have not myself mastered the Gazebo half of model building. However, I can recommend checking out how other robot models do it, such as http://ros.org/wiki/erratic_description

I found this :  http://answers.ros.org/question/9628/moving-a-robot-in-gazebo/
it looks like it might point in the right direction for that.
