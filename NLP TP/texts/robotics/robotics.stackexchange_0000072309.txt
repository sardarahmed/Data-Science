Q:

Ubuntu/ROS not recognizing Turtlebot 2/USB device

I have a Turtlebot 2 that I am currently having a lot of issues with. I was able to successfully install Ubuntu on my computer, install ROS and test the installation of ROS (through this tutorial http://learn.turtlebot.com/2015/02/01/6/). The problem I´m having is that Ubuntu does not recognize Turtlebot through the USB cable. Ubuntu does recognize other pen drives but not Turtlebot. I have plugged the Turtlebot into other computers and it is recognized in Windows. So I believe this is isolated to a software issue.

Have you tried turtlebot  tutorial?

A:

Also check the permissions of the USB. If I remember correctly, I had to set up a udev rule to automatically set permissions.
