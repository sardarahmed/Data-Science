Q:

ROS turtlesim - not responding to keyboard

Hi,
I just got started with ROS, and I bumped into the first wall when I was going through the tutorial in running turtlesim.
After I ran 'roscore', 'rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node' and 'rosrun turtlesim turtle_teleop_key', it went through the settings fine. However, it is not responding to my keyboard control. I selected the terminal window of the turtle_teleop_key, but no luck.
While running them, I ran rxgraph to see the diagram, but it mentioned that the node communication failed, so I am predicting it's the problem with network setting, but I don't know how to fix it.
I would greatly appreciate for your help.
Thank you.

Are you able to move it via manually publishing to the turtlesim_node?

A:

It's hard to help without further information. As a first step, have a look at the network setup page. rosnode info teleop_turtle might also provide some information.
