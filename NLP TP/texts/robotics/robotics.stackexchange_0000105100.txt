Q:

Moveit 2 On Windows 11: ROS2-Humble Hawksbill

Has anyone tried installing MoveIt 2 on windows? When I go to the official website it says nothing about compatibility with ROS-humble version. It's very similar to how it doesn't mention anything for compatibility with ROS-Iron and it is still compatible in Linux. I tried this tutorial but it has lack of information. Can anyone tell if there is any way to install MoveIt 2 on windows for ROS-Humble? I didn't find any resources online.

A:

You can look at installing via Robostack and see if your needs can be met that way:
https://robostack.github.io/GettingStarted.html
https://robostack.github.io/humble.html
Some core MoveIt packages are available for binary installation. I successfully installed ros-humble-moveit on an existing Robostack Humble installation. I can add a motion planning panel to RViz.
However, moveit2_tutorials is not available to try a more functional test per the quickstart documentation. I briefly looked into building it from source, but it looks like I'll have to try to build a number of its dependencies from source too.
EDIT: I added a number of packages from source and got the moveit2_tutorials RViz quickstart working:

moveit2_tutorials depends on a number of packages that as far as I know aren't available on Windows and might be hard to build.
I currently removed the dependencies moveit_task_constructor_core, moveit_ros_perception and moveit_servo from the CMakeLists.txt in moveit2_tutorials and commented out all the add_subdirectory() calls except for add_subdirectory(doc/tutorials/quickstart_in_rviz)
I will fork it and make a Windows branch to share later, and update with another edit, as well as share a .repos file. I needed to build graph_msgs, moveit_resources, moveit_visual_tools and rviz_visual_tools from source.

You might give it a try and see if you can get a working installation. You can also check out https://github.com/ms-iot/ROSOnWindows/issues and see if there's any information about MoveIt.
Are you planning to control real robot hardware? Even if you get MoveIt working with demos/simulation, hardware driver support tends to be limited.
