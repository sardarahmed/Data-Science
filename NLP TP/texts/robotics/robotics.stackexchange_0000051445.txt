Q:

Ogre Assertion failed causing rviz to crash

Hi,
I try to run the demo from moveit from the sources (as it is not working from packing answers.ros.org/question/63227/issue-with-moveit-tutorials/)
But whenever I try to launch a launch file, it is not working : I get the following error :
rviz: /build/buildd/ogre-1.7.4/OgreMain/src/OgreSceneManager.cpp :807 : virtual Ogre::SceneNode* Ogre::SceneManager::createSceneNode():  the assertion « mSceneNodes.find(sn->getName()) == mSceneNodes.end() » has failed.

It is driving me crazy! I made a fresh install on a VM and it is working perfectly!!
So I really don't know what's wrong with my system! I have the following configuration :

Intel Core i7­3720QM
Nvidia Quadro NVS 5200M GDDR5 1Go
RAM 8Go DDR3 (2X4Go) 1600MHz

I think it might be related to my graphic card driver but I'm not really sure about it.
Thanks
Ben

A:

This doesn't look like a driver related problem, I would guess something in MoveIt is causing this.
