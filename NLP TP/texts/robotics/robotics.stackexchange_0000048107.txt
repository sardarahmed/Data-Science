Stitch 4 Images in Rviz

All,
Any ideas on how I would stitch or "sew" 4 kinect images together making ONE panoramic image in rviz?

A:

Although more experienced users might answer differently, I don't think what you're asking is possible on RViz by itself since it's not an image processing/manipulating tool per se.
OpenCV has a nice stitching capability. You should be easily able to transfer the resulting image to ROS by image_transport.
