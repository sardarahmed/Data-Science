Q:

Ros2 Galactic binary installation on Windows 10: failed to create process

Hi - I followed the steps here: https://docs.ros.org/en/galactic/Installation/Windows-Install-Binary.html without any errors. And then attempted to run a test node and received the following error failed to create process. Command shell output here:
C:\Users\ckr>call C:\dev\ros2_galactic\ros2-windows\local_setup.bat
"[rti_connext_dds_cmake_module][warning] RTI Connext DDS environment script not found (\resource\scripts\rtisetenv_x64Win64VS2017.bat). RTI Connext DDS will not be available at runtime, unless you already configured PATH manually."

C:\Users\ckr>ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker
failed to create process

Any suggestions? Thanks!

A:

Solved!
The issue was trying to install the windows debug package: ros2-galactic-20210616-windows-debug-amd64.zip
rather than the release package: ros2-galactic-20210616-windows-release-amd64.zip.
After installing the release package and trying to run ros2, the only error received was a missing python library packaging. This should probably be added to the current python dependencies list.
This is what is currently on the site for python dependencies (https://docs.ros.org/en/galactic/Installation/Windows-Install-Binary.html#install-dependencies):
python -m pip install -U catkin_pkg cryptography empy ifcfg importlib-metadata lark-parser lxml matplotlib netifaces numpy opencv-python PyQt5 pip pillow psutil pycairo pydot pyparsing pyyaml rosdistro setuptools

Should instead be:
python -m pip install -U catkin_pkg cryptography empy ifcfg importlib-metadata lark-parser lxml matplotlib netifaces numpy opencv-python PyQt5 pip pillow psutil pycairo pydot pyparsing pyyaml rosdistro setuptools packaging

Would also recommend adding a line above this install dependencies section to recommend that people first upgrade pip. Python dependency installation (e.g. crytography, etc.) errors out if pip is not up to date.
python -m pip install -U pip

You really want to post your suggestions on the ros2/ros2_documentation issue tracker.
"no one" will see your answer here (and "no one" in quotes, as of course people will see your suggestions, but not the people who will be in a position to change those pages).
