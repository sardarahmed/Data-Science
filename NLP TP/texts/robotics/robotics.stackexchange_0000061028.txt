Q:

How can i transplant old src from groovy to hydro?

Hi, everyone, maybe some Ros Kong. I'm a beginner in Ros and Ubuntu, but someone who know well of Ros in my tutor's Lab has graduated to another University  and leave us amount of sources. Now I'd like to rebuild these sources which written in groovy and I'm using Hydro. Should I change which part in the source so that I can run their sources?

A:

For the most part, packages that worked in Groovy should continue to work in Hydro. I would try them first without any changes, and troubleshoot any issues as they arise.
If you run into specific issues or trouble compiling, you can update your question with the specific error you're seeing or ask a new question.
