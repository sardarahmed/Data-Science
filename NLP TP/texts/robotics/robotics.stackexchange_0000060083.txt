Q:

navigation yields velocity on Y axis

hi, all,
I am using navigation stack, move_base, for a simple navigation implementation.
my base is driven by two differential wheels, and rotates using speed difference between the two driving wheels. i.e. only speed on X axis and rotational speed
from time to time, speed on Y axis is received on "cmd_vel" topic, and the base doesn't know what to do with it.
how do I configure the move_base properly so that it generates velocity command that suits my robot base?

A:

I suspect you have your local planner configured for a holonomic base, when your base isn't actually holonomic.
Without knowing exactly which local planner you're using, it's difficult to say exactly how to fix this. Fox example, base_local_planner has a parameter called ~/holonomic_robot that you can set to false to disable this behavior, but I think the configuration is different for the dwa_local_planner

yes. that was the reason. thanks.

Had the same issue. it seems that the dwa_local_planner does not handle non-holonomic vehicles. Changed it to base_local_planner and it works like a charm.
