Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: ros cluster

At the fundamental level, can it be said that ROS is an efficient message passing system, since essentially, that is what it is doing and managing for the most part.. If that is the case, is it possible to use ROS for creating a powerful computing cluster instead of using it only for robotics?

A:

There are other, non-robotics-focused, ways of doing clusters; if all you need is message passing, you might want protocol buffers; if you want to think in terms of computational units, not messages, you want hadoop.
So yes, it will work, but you should start with high-level thinking about the problem you're solving.

I am merely looking for a generic cluster that allows me to model problems as computational units that can run in parallel. They may or may not have huge data sets. Do you think hadoop would help in this case? I always thought it was meant for processing huge data sets in parallel.

I would say that small datasets are a subset of large datasets. Some of Hadoop's stuff may be overkill, but it could be the right way to start.
