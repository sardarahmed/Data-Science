Q:

Simple way of 3d perception

I wonder is there any simple (can be computed in microcontroller level) option which is suitable for 3d object perception (depth, position, pose or coordinate estimation) of flying robots except LIDAR, stereovision, omnidirectional camera, laser scanner or any other machine vision based techniques 

A:

The best answer is probably going to be an ultrasonic sensor on a servo, you can get them in a huge range of values, from very close to very far range depending on your application, and varying beam widths depending on your accuracy needs. If you need more than 255 steps you could go with a motor and a encoder but that will be slightly more complex.
