Q:

after running the Publisher and subcriber, .h file is not being made

I have successfully completed the ROS tutorial till the topic "examining a simple subscriber and publisher". I wrote a simple client and server program. But am not able to make it. The .h file which I am including in the client and server .cpp files is not being generated. How do I proceed?

A:

Which .h file?
If it is normal c++ code, you have to write it.
If it is from a message description, you might be missing the rosbuild_genmsg() in CMakeLists.txt.
