A:

if you use the OccupancyGrid (according to the map_server node) in order to navigate the robot ,
you might need the map in PGM format and a description file in YAML ,with the data on the blueprint
transformed into a grid (in fact , an array)  which contains occupancy value.
=> You may convert the pdf into image file like bitmap and recreate the map by drawing things manually
(eg. wall , static obstacle , free area)
[Make sure that the resolution of the converted image is measured , it must be written in the description file.]
From image editing app like photoshop , you need to draw everything according to color definition .
[Black = Occupied , White = Free , Dark Grey = Unknown Area]
Map examples can be found easily on many repos as well as description file(YAML) ~ :D

Thanks for the reply. I converted pdf file into a png format by taking a screenshot and tried loading it into rviz and stage. But i am having issues with dimensions i.e robots moves faster in stage than in rviz which is creating problem. do you have any idea how i can solve this?

Also, if you have any tutorials on how to create maps using pdf files, can you point me in right direction?

I'm not sure , it might be the resolution of the map .

As far as I know ( 1-year experience ) , There is no way to do the conversion from PDF to PGM file at the moment.

Implementation might be done by
Convert PDF to PNG  -> Define Scale size of the pixel cell compared to the real world -> Re-Paint Area (Wall , Free , Unknown) -> Export the image file and description file.
Some PDF to Image Library and OpenCV can achieve this , but it would be the hard way :(
