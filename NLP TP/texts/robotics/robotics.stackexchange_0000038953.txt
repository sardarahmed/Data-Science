Q:

How to get the position of end -effector of PR2 right arm in the simulator

Since we can use Cartesian controller to control the arm of PR2 to move, but how to get the current position of the arm in the simulator? Is it in robot coordination or in world coordination?
If we have a world coordination how to convert to pr2 robot coordination?

A:

Read up on the tf library.
In short: The position of everything can be retrieved in any coordinate frame you want. So you define what frame it is in.
