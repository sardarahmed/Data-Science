Q:

rostopic shows /odom publisher and subscriber, but topic monitor shows "unknown"

I am trying to get a new robot up and running. Everything is fine but for some reason data published by the robot over topics are not making it to my remote computer. For example, when I do this:
rostopic info /odom

I see both a publisher and subscriber, but,
the problem is that rqt topic monitor shows /odom (and all other topics) to be with unknown values.
Note that I am enabling the checkbox in topic monitor for the topics. Also I verified that when I shutdown the Turtlebot all those topics disappeared off the list. So the topics are being published by the robot but for some reason the data is not showing up in topic montor
My configuration includes three computers:

The Turtlebot3
The computer running Roscore (Linux)
The computer I was doing these experiments on (Linux)

They were all three pointing to (2) as master. And they all three had localhost as their ros_name. In other words their rosname was not set to a specific IP address.
Also, when I used the teleop utility the robot didn’t move even though the cmd_vels were being published.
I dont think this matters, but we don't have the Lidar attached and during bringup there is an error but I was assuming this was not the cause. See the output of bringup:
roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_robot.launch

A:

And they all three had localhost as their ros_name. In other words their rosname was not set to a specific IP address.

I don't recognise the ros_name you mention, but if you're referring to either ROS_IP or ROS_HOSTNAME, then localhost is not a good value for either in a multi-machine setup.
At the very least, set ROS_IP on each computer to the IP address that they have been configured with. Without that, topics will show up, but none of your nodes will be able to connect to nodes on other machines (localhost always points to the local machine, for every machine, so that is a problem).

Also, when I used the teleop utility the robot didn’t move even though the cmd_vels were being published.

This is expected in a multi-machine setup which is misconfigured.

Edit: please see wiki/ROS/NetworkSetup and especially wiki/ROS/Tutorials/MultipleMachines for more information.
Note that those two pages work with hostnames intead of IP addresses. That will require a working DNS server or manually adding the correct information to /etc/hosts on all computers.

You got it right! IThis relates to the other question that I was asking that you, @gvdhoorn, had commented on. When it is ok to use localhost for ros_hostname. Well from this it would seem that the answer is "never" or at least, "only when there's only one computer involved! THANKS!

@gvdhoorn - a follow up.Can you explain exactly what was happening to cause the problem? In other words, it would seem that my Turtlebot3 (1) was subscribed to cmd_vel, and that my coding computer (3) knew that (because it appeared on the topic list) but still the actual messages were not picked up.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-07-27:
rostopic list communicates with the master, not with nodes. Your nodes were telling each other the wrong hostname/IP, causing them not be able to connect to each other.
