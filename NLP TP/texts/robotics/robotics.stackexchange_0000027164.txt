A:

In order to use the populations feature, you need to build sdformat (sdf_2.0 branch) and gazebo (default branch) from source, since we haven't yet released the code that uses those features.

Thanks a lot. It's quite helpful.

I tried this with SDF 2 and Gazebo 4.1.  The can tutorial worked great, but when I tried to insert a  model with a plugin into the same world with the cans, the client and server both exit.  I would include code but I was able to reproduce it with the model plugin model_push.cc tutorial code.
