Q:

Importing nodes in Eclipse

Hi,
I've been following a link to import my project directory.
I'm having a problem with importing node/directory which resides in the /opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/openni_kinect/. In particular, I'm skipping directly to step number 3 which is "Importing the project into Eclipse". I can reach up to the "File --> Import --> Existing projects into workspace" step, but I am stuck at clicking finish(it doesn't allow though..). The reason I jump straightaway to step 3 because I've already have galileo version of eclipse long time ago installed. Another thing is that, other nodes that reside in my home directory, are easily imported.
Any ideas?

A:

It seems that you're trying to import directories as though they were projects. You'll need to generate the .project files using the directions in step 2
Make sure you have your ros environment setup ( with the relevant ". setup" ) and issue a
    make eclipse-project

in the package directory (i.e. it won't work in a stack directory).
If you get an error it's likely that either

you're trying in the wrong directory
you don't have your environment set up and so cmake can't find the relevant rules supplied by ros to make the eclipse projects.

@Patrick: I hope you don't mind my edit to your answer.

So, am I right to say that it's doable with the apt-get installation instead of version control as "Asomerville" pointed out?
Comment by Asomerville on 2011-08-04:
@alfa, not sure, but it would be unrelated. If you can't resolve/keep having that issue, it would be appropriate to ask in a separate post.

Installing via svn, results in one error..huhu..error => svn co http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_kinect
svn: OPTIONS of 'http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_kinect': 200 OK (http://www.ros.org), what's that?

@Patrick, just delete the comments and put the info in your answer since it's relevant : ) @alfa looks like cmake cant find ros, make sure you have your ros environment setup since cmake will try to reach into ros to find rules to make eclipse-project.

.. (argh, comment limit!) .. you should be grabbing it from version control, not using the one installed by apt-get. End comment. :)

Silly comment limit.. Anyway I think you have another problem though; that directory is probably read-only (you installed openni_kinect via apt-get, right?). make eclipse-project will want to write a .project file in that directory and that won't work. If you actually want to hack on openni_kinect..

I'm not an expert on the Eclipse integration stuff but if I'm not mistaken you can only create an Eclipse project from a ROS package, not a ROS stack. The directory you mention in your question (/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/openni_kinect/) is a stack diretory..

In step 2, there is a command "make eclipse-project", but I got an error saying "make: *** No rule to make target `eclipse-project'.  Stop." Any thoughts?
