Q:

robot does not stops when key is released from keyboard with teleop_twist_keyboard

hello, I am navigating a P3AT with teleop_twist_keyboard.py node, it works fine but the problem is that as soon the key is pressed robot starts moving even if i release the key and i have to stop it by pressing the key again.
how can i stop the robot immediately after releasing the key from keyboard??

A:

It's just how teleop_twist_keyboard.py is currently written; It's convenient since the robot keeps moving in the same direction and/or orientation unless different command is sent.
Depending on how serious your usecase is, you could write a patch to maybe send pull request to teleop_twist_keyboard repository; e.g. a code that adds an option to stop the robot per each command. Shouldn't be any difficult.
