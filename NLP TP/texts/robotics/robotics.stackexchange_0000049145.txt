A:

That is weird. Here is what I have installed (output from aptitude search opencv|grep ^i:
Edit: The following is probably irrelevant, as the upper two seem to be relicts of my electric installation!
i A libopencv2.3-bin                - OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision)      
i A ros-electric-vision-opencv      - opencv                                    
i A ros-fuerte-opencv2              - OpenCV                                    
i A ros-fuerte-vision-opencv        - opencv         

If you lack any of those, try installing it.

thanks for help Felix . i have "libopencv2.3-bin" and "ros-electric-vision-opencv" missing . i hav tried installing it bt the packages are not available in ubuntu 12.04 i guess. do i have to downgrade from 12.04 to 11.10 to make it run?

No, I have it running on 12.04 and 12.10. These are probably relicts of my electric installation then.
