Q:

How to have ros1_bridge handle external package name change?

I would like to use ros1_bridge to handle bridging a topic which uses the gps_common/GPSFix message. In ROS2 the gps_common package was renamed to gps_msgs. With ros1_bridge you normally handle that with a rule.yaml file exported by the ROS2 package. However, since these packages are pulled in with apt I can't add the file directly to gps_msgs. Would I need to build these messages from source? Or is there a solution which doesn't require as much change to my dependency management?

A:

Well is seems the rule file is actually available as part of the gps_msgs distribution. https://github.com/swri-robotics/gps_umd/blob/dashing-devel/gps_msgs/ros1_ros2_mapping.yaml
It seems I missed it before. The failure to link must be caused by a separate issue. I will close this question.
