Q:

switching global planner

Hi,
In nav_core default global planner is navfn, but I want to change it to carrot planner or something else (in future it will be my global planner). What I have to change and where?

It was first thing I've done. Now it looks like this:
private_nh.param("base_global_planner", global_planner, std::string("carrot_planner/CarrotPlanner"));

A:

You'll have to change the base_global_planner parameter of move_base. See the move_base docs for more details.
