Q:

adding objects to household database

I am trying to add a custom item to the household objects database and am trying to follow the suggestions made here:
post
my question is about using insert_model.cpp as suggested in the comments.
it seems to read the model data fine, but then tries to copy to one of Matei's directories... "/u/matei/data/household_objects/"
Anyone know how to fix this?

A:

I found out that in the database there is a table called "variable" which has a key called "MODEL_ROOT" with the value "/u/matei/data/household_objects/".
I'm using pgmin3 to edit it and here you have screenshot i.imgur.com/mP0qZUo.png
(Before getting to this error I needed to change in insert_model.cpp the line:
  household_objects_database::ObjectsDatabase database("**localhost**", "5432", "willow", "willow", "household_objects");
