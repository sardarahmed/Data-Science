A:

can you include operating system commands [..] in a launch file?

Please see #q272267.

as superuser

yes, see #q165246 for instance. But, also see #q189457, as it's rarely really needed to run things as root. In almost all cases it can be solved with configuring the proper permissions for the user starting the ROS node.
Try to avoid it.
