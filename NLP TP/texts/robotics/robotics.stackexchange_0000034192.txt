Q:

Turtlebot Rviz "Status: Warning"

When I am trying to visualize data coming from my turtlebot kinect with a point cloud, there is a bar underneath it that says "Status:Waring" in yellow. What does this mean?

OK, I would think that would be the case yes. But, would you have a suggestion why a kinect wouldn't be publishing data?

No data is being published by the kinect

What does it mean if the topic is "No messages received"?
