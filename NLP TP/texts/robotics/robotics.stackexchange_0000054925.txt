Q:

Error using sound_play

What I want to do: I want to say any text :)
I try to use sound_play and say.py. I try to launch soundplay_node using
roslaunch sound_play soundplay_node.launch

And I have the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "/opt/ros/groovy/stacks/audio_common/sound_play/scripts/soundplay_node.py", line     43, in <module>
   from sound_play.msg import SoundRequest
ImportError: No module named sound_play.msg

What I shall do?

Hm, I did it once and forgot about the fact that I have a error with root access. Thank you, I built it again and now it works!
