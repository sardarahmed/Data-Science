A:

I would guess that the wget command failed to download the key file, perhaps due to a network problem.  Try doing it in two steps:
wget http://packages.ros.org/ros.key -O ros.key
sudo apt-key add ros.key

If there's a network problem, you should see it during the first step.  If you continue to have trouble with wget, try downloading that URI from a web browser.

As far as I know, fuerte is not supported in quantal (12.10), we'll have to migrate drcsim to depend on groovy for this to work.  We are currently testing ros functionalities for drcsim in groovy.
