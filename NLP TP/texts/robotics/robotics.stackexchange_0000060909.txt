Q:

Source Code Android APP

Hello,
i was working through the tutorials of RosJava and RosAndroid.
Unluckily the result wasn't what i expected. Since i am new to Ros and to Android i had some troubles.
My Goal is to have an Android app, that is displaying a message that is published by a ros node in my PC.
I was able to do the Java PubSub Tutorial, so i am able to publish a message.
Can someone provide me with the source code of an app, in which i can visualize this message?
The Master Uri for the Master Chooser can be coded directly into the APP, there is no need to have it set by the user.
I would love to have such a project that i can just import into my Eclipse and run on my device.
Best Thanks in advance
Stefan

Hi,
i think you will find some useful information here.
One of the tutorial apps is actually a publisher/subscriber and can be found here
I hope this gets you started.
