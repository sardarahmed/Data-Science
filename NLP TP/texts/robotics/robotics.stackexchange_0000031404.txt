Q:

Robot Arm Calibration for Schunk 7-DOF Arm

I am searching for a sophisticated way to calibrate a Schunk (Amtec) arm where some joints are not in zero position (when they should be).
Is there a ROS package for this purpose? Would it be possible/recommended to use the pr2_calibration stack?
Thanks for advice,
David

A:

There has been a similar question with excellent answers here. In summary: Theoretically, you should use the robot_calibration and/or pr2_calibration stacks, and there seems to be a lot of interest in that, but at the moment these stacks are not really portable. That means you will have to do some serious reconfiguration to get it going on your robot.
