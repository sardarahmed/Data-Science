Q:

Couldn't find executable named deployer-gnulinux

after i type rosrun ocl deployer-gnulinux -ldebug -s deploy.ops
i get above error. I have installed the orocos-toolchain properly and also sourced it. affter i type ros ocl and than press the tab key nothng comes. Can't i run deployment node from ros command now? i can clearly see that deployment-gnulinux is build in the the build directories. does Ros supports this anymore? Or i have to use deployment-gnulinux only?
i was looking this page.
