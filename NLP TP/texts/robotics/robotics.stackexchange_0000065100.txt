Q:

libg2o installation problem on ROS Hydro Raspbian Wheezy

I have complied RGBDSLAM v2's prerequisite to install ROS Hydro according to Installing ROS Hydro on Raspberry Pi and put felixendres-rgbdslam_v2-7450b20 in catkin_ws/src.
When i run
rosdep install  --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro hydro -y --os=debian:wheezy

i got
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved to system dependencies: 
rgbdslam: No definition of [libg2o] for OS [debian]

then i run
roslocate info libg2o

I got
Using ROS_DISTRO: hydro WARNING: Package "libg2o" does not follow the version conventions. It should not contain leading zeros (unless the number is 0).  
Not found via rosdistro - falling back to information provided by rosdoc. 
Missing VCS control information for package libg2o, requires vcs[] and vcs_uri[]

Can anyone helps with this problem?
I am trying to get RGBDSLAM running on Raspberrypi B+Wheezy(2014-12-24) with kinect.
Thank you!
