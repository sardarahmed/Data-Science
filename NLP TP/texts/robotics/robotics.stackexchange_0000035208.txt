A:

You won't be able to run this tutorial until we release later this week, but this should give you an idea: [Adding Virtual Objects](http://www.ros.org/wiki/arm_navigation/Tutorials/Planning Scene/Adding Virtual Objects to the Planning Scene). If you are using MoveArm you can also add virtual objects to the planning_scene_diff field in the MoveArmGoal and get your robot to plan and execute paths based on those virtual objects.
