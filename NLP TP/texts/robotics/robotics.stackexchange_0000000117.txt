Q:

What is the difference between 4-point and 8-point connectivity in graph based planning?

In graph-based planning (say, A*), states are connected to their neighbors.  How should one decide whether to connect to the 4 neighbors or the 8 neighbors?  What are the pros and cons of each approach?

A:

I believe it simply boils down to what your robot can do.
If you are for some reason restricted to moving only in 4 directions, then you connect each grid cell to 4.
If you can go in 8 directions, you connect each grid cell to 8.
If you can go in 6 directions, you use a honeycomb grid and connect each grid cell to 6.
There is no generic answer. If you plan to go diagonally with a robot that can't perform the action, that's bad planning. If you plan to only go horizontally and vertically while your robot can take shortcuts, that's also bad planning.
