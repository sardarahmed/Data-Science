Q:

turtlebot_apps and turtlebot-rviz-launchers package is not being located. What could be the reasons?

I installed ROS (jade) and tried navigate and gazebo WORLD. Both were working fine. Then, somehow I had to reinstall ubuntu and reinstalled ROS. Since then, I am facing the problem given below. I installed ROS using link text .
baban@baban-H81M-DS2:~$ sudo apt-get install ros-jade-turtlebot-apps ros-jade-turtlebot-rviz-launchers

[sudo] password for baban:

Please use the Preformatted Text button for console copy/pastes (the button with 101010 on it). Otherwise it's unreadable.

is it fine now? I have kept the console part separately.

I already did it for you :). My comment was meant for future questions.

A:

Your underlying problem is that you're missing some dependencies.  You should make sure that you have turned on universe and multiverse as defined in step 1.1 of the installation: http://wiki.ros.org/jade/Installation/Ubuntu
The other possibility is that you have a conflicting package installed for one of the dependencies.
If you use -o Debug::pkgProblemResolver=yes as an option to apt-get it will give you more information.

I checked the 'universe', restricted and 'multiverse', and all three are enabled. I am still unable to figure out the problem. Last time before I un-installed ROS the tutorial codes were working fine.

This answer doesn't make sense â€“ I thought Gazebo2 (Indigo) and Gazebo5 (Jade) couldn't be installed simultaneously? Tutlebot isn't ported to Jade yet (see @gvdhoorn's answer below) so you can't run the simulation at all
