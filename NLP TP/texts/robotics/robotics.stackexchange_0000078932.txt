Q:

xacro problem: kinectic 16.04 turtlebot2

Hi,
On a new install I have this message when launching "roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch"
xacro: Traditional processing is deprecated. Switch to --inorder processing!
To check for compatibility of your document, use option --check-order.
For more infos, see http://wiki.ros.org/xacro#Processing_Order
xacro.py is deprecated; please use xacro instead

It seems to work but I'm not sure. Can someone find a solution to this problem ?
Thanks
Goupil
PS: fresh install of Ubuntu 16.04, ros-kinetic-desktop-full, kinetic, turtlebot 2

A:

These are warnings, not errors.
They basically tell you that the turtlebot xacro does not adhere to the current best practices (--inorder) and that the launch file uses the 'old' xacro.py instead of the xacro script.
As they are only warnings everything should still work.

We don't close questions here on ROS Answers when they are answered. Ticking the checkmark is better.
