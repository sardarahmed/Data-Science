Q:

VSLAM ROS Source Down?

I am unable to go to download the VSLAM ROS source code found here:
https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/vslam/trunk
Has it been removed or is the site just temporarily down?

A:

code.ros.org has been off-line for a long time now.
Looks like contradict/ros-vslam is a fork of that.
