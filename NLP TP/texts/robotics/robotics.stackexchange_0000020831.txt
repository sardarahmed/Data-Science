Q:

Occupancy grid maps

Why do we take probabilistic approch to model the environment for robots in occupancy grid maps.The assumption is always taken that each cell on the grid map is either free or occupied.So why have probabilitic approch?

A:

As the wikipedia page of Occupancy grid mapping explains, the result of the mapping process is a binary 1 or 0, occupied or not, the decision itself may be based on noisy data, which involves the probabilistic assessment of prior information to infer the posterior probability of the occupancy.
