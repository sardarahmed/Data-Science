Q:

What micro controller should I use?

I am planning on building a robot with wheels (later legs, if possible), that can move around the room and analyze certain things, using a couple sensors.
In the later steps more functions such a grabbing are the things I want to add.
Could you recommend me a micro controller?
My concern about Arduino is that there aren't enough slots, Raspberry Pi seems like it constantly needs a screen for the user.
I am a complete amateur when it comes to robotics. However, I am quite familiar with the computer languages Java and Python. Since I wrote a fun app for Android for myself I would love the robot to be compatible with Android, too.

A:

Firstly, this is a stupid nit-picky thing, but neither the Arduino nor RPi are micro controllers. Anyways, to answer your question:
Neither of your concerns are really problems. Arduinos come in all kinds of sizes and ALL of them should have enough pins to do what you want. And the RPi can easily be run headless, and programs can be run at startup with methods such as cron or by adding it to rc.local.
To simplify things your sensors, I would suggest going with the Arduino, since most sensors use 5v like the arduino does, whereas the Pi uses 3.3v. However, since the Arduino's programmed in a C variant, you may want to use the RPi because it works with Python natively, and you could use Java if you really wanted.
But all in all it comes down to preference, both could get the job done.
