Q:

leading slash in namespace

Hello.
I'm studying hard about ROS and gazebo.
Now I'm very confused about namespace.
Is there any difference in between /p3dx/base_link and p3dx/base_link?

Names that start with a "/" are global -- they are considered fully resolved. Global names should be avoided as much as possible as they limit code portability.
