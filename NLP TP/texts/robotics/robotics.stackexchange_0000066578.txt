Q:

Buildfarm doesn't pick up packages' new release repositories after merge

Having a similar problem to this, however after 30-odd hours, the updated release repositories still haven't picked up by the buildfarm, and jenkins has been failing the sourcedeb build after pulling the wrong release repository.
My case is a little more unorthodox, so I may have broken something - I consolidated a number of packages into unified repositories (pull).
Is there any way I can correct this?

It might have something to do with renaming the repository in the distribution.yaml file. I'll have to defer to @Dirk Thomas or @tfoote

A:

Last night's indigo reconfigure job failed. It should reconfigure when it runs again tonight.
