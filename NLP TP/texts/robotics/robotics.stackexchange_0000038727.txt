Q:

remote(from another computer) turtlebot joystick teleoperation doesn't work

Hi. I have a problem with joystick teleoperation from another computer. I am running turtlebot_gazebo simulator. Tested on home wireless network. Joystick teleoperation works ok, but not from remote computer. Remote keyboard teleoperation works fine.
rostopic echo /joy prints joystick data, but there is no data at /cmd_vel
Whats the problem?

A:

This is probably a network configuration issue. Take a look Network Setup wiki page.
