Q:

When I tried to compile my packages not all are compiled

Hello!
I want to install the bb8 package from this link: bb8-package-ros.
The steps that i made are:

Clone the git link on the directory ~/git
Execute this command: ln -s ~/git/bb8/ ~/catkin_ws/src/
Go to rhe catkin directory: cd ~/catkin_ws
And compile the folder: catkin_make

At this point, i receive this error:
CMake Warning at /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:76 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "robot_controllers"
  with any of the following names:

    robot_controllersConfig.cmake
    robot_controllers-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "robot_controllers" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "robot_controllers_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "robot_controllers" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.

After I installed dependency: sudo apt install ros-<distro>-robot-controllers , I receive this error:

/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lgazebo_ros_utils
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

Makefile:138: recipe for target 'all' failed
make: *** [all] Error 2
Invoking "make -j8 -l8" failed

I think I made all thinks good... But I don`t know why it give me this error.
Have somebody any idea?

A:

It is just a missing dependency.
Just do:
sudo apt install ros-<distro>-robot-controllers
This should fix it.

This is a completely different problem now. I had a look at the git repos and in my opinion (could be wrong) the problem is in the CMakeLists.txt file of the code on git, since no gazebo_ros_utils is either find package'd nor declared as a library.
What happens if you simply leave it away? Meaning to delete the "Gazebo_ros_utils" keyword from the CMakeLists?
