Q:

How to solve pcl/kdtree/kdtree_ann.h not found?

I followed find_object.
I download:
 svn co https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/branches/trunk_cturtle/stacks/find_object
 svn co https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/branches/trunk_cturtle/stacks/point_cloud_perception_experimental/point_cloud_python

And I rosmake,it shows:
  In file included from /home/sam/code/ros/sam_perception/find_object/table_boundary_detector/src/table_boundary_node.cpp:1:
    /home/sam/code/ros/sam_perception/find_object/table_boundary_detector/include/table_boundary_node.hh:23: fatal error: pcl/kdtree/kdtree_ann.h: No such file or directory
    compilation terminated.

I try to install PCL,but not works:
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:v-launchpad-jochen-sprickerhof-de/pcl
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install libpcl-all

How to solve it?
Thank you~

A:

The package find_object is really old and I wouldn't expect it to work without investing quite some time fixing it. Your current problem seems to be that your PCL version is much more recent than what find_object expects. That means you'll have to fix find_object to work with the newer PCL version.

Is there any package to replace find_object? Or how to fix that problem? Thank you~
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-07-04:
I don't know about any other package that provides the same functionality in such an integrated way. But you have the source code of find_object so can try fixing it and upgrading it to the new PCL version.

Yeah, I post the original question because I don't know how to fix it. Is there any solutions? Thank you~
