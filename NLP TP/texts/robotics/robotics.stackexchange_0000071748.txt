Q:

openslam_gmapping or slam_gmapping?

Hi,
I am a beginner with ROS, i successfully installed ROS indigo on my Ubuntu laptop and now i want to install a slam solution to test with my robot. I was searching for gmapping and found out that there are two gmappping packages available to download out there. this may be a very newbie question but could somebody please tell me what is the difference between openslam_gmapping and slam_gmapping packages?
which one is better to download and install?
I really appreciate the answer.

A:

both is required. slam_gmapping is the package you are looking at but it relies on openslam_gmapping for dependencies.

How to install openslam_gmapping? I can't find the github repository for the ros package. I am on melodic.

You install openslam_gmapping in the same way as slam_gmapping installed: clone git and build the package.
Link for both packages: https://github.com/Project-MANAS/slam_gmapping
