Q:

capture only 360ยบ from velodyne HDL32E

I've followed the tutorial [Getting Started with the Velodyne HDL-32E] and I can get a video in real time from velodyne doing:

sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.3.100 <-- IP for my PC
sudo route add 192.168.18.108 eth0   <-- velodyne IP
roslaunch velodyne_pointcloud 32e_points.launch
calibration:=/home/vic/32db.yaml
rosrun rviz rviz -f velodyne >  configure as the tutorial said.

It works fine, but I need to process the data from a static 360ยบ scene, not from the video.
So I need a program which do:

capture a 360ยบ from velodyne
process the data
again capture a new 360ยบ scene

Which ROS command should I use?
Thanks in advance.

A:

Each message in the /velodyne_points topic contains all the data from a complete revolution of the device.
If you write a ROS node that subscribes to that topic, your subscription callback will be called each time a new message arrives. That happens at 10 Hz with the device spinning at the default 600 RPM rate.
Here is an example node that reads the point cloud for each revolution, looking for points within some grid cells that significantly differ in the Z axis.
You can figure out from that how to write your own subscriber node.
