A:

Follow the install instructions for installing from a PPA. You shouldn't have to compile anything.
For just taking screenshots, every screenshot application should work. I personally use ksnapshot. For recording videos, I normally use xvidcap which can be installed in Ubuntu using apt-get and it should just work.

You need to be in the directory where that file is installed to run it.
