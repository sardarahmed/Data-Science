Q:

eigen3 missing error during ROS installation

Hi
I'm trying to install ROS on my MAC suing homebrew.While installtion I got this message :

 CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:7 (find_package):

  By not providing "FindEigen3.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
 asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Eigen3", but
  CMake did not find one
 Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Eigen3" with any
 of the following names:
Eigen3Config.cmake
eigen3-config.cmake
 Add the installation prefix of "Eigen3" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
 "Eigen3_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Eigen3"
provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
installed.
-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

PCL Build on Mac seems to be broken. Try removing PCL packages and build it.

A:

Do you have eigen3 installed? I'm not familiar with MAC/homebrew, but in ubuntu you can install it with sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev.
According to this, it could be just eigen3 for Mac.
