Q:

7-8" Tablet for Turtlebot?

I'm looking to replace the bulky laptop on my roomba-based Turtlebot with a tablet that has a full-size USB port, so that I can do telepresence audio/video with the same machine that does all the mapping & bot/ROS logic. I've been fiddling with a TW700 that I got really cheap, and it's almost working, but it has a lot of landmines. Oh, and I might have just bricked it.
Any suggestions for tablets that will run Ubuntu, with good device support, and have a full USB port?

A:

I'm in the same boat as you--we need a lightweight tablet that can run Ubuntu 14.04.3 and ROS indigo and preferably a full-size USB port.
After doing a lot of research I think we have narrowed it down to used Microsoft Surface Pro 1 or 2 tablets or Dell's low-quality 2-in-1 Inspiron 11 3157 (that has terrific battery life and is Ubuntu-certified).
If you are willing to step up from 7-8" to 10" or 11.6", those may work for you. The Surface Pro 1 is actually fairly small. There is some word that the Dell Venue 8 Pro can run Ubuntu but I have not found the full foolproof instructions to do so.
