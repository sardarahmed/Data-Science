Q:

How to display the Kinect point cloud using image colours?

How can I display the point cloud created by the Kinect in colours obtained from the camera, rather than in artificial colours related to depth?  Both /camera/rgb/points and /camera/depth/points topics display using the artificial colouring.

Hi Jedi Hamster,
I believe you want the RGB8 setting in the Color Transformer pulldown in RViz under your Point Cloud display.  This option appears only when you are using /camera/rgb/points rather than /camera/depth/points.

P.S. May the Force be with you.

In the PointCloud2 display we can use the topic /camera/depth_registered/points and select RGB8 from the Color Transformer pulldown options.
