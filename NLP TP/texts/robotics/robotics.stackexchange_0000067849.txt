Q:

CMake Error for depending two custom packages

I have created a package called agv_msgs. I want to make this package contain my custom messages. I have built it with no problems. After that I have created another packege called agv_teleop and while creating this package I indicated agv_msgs, std_msgs, roscpp and rospy as its dependencies. I have modified the CMake list but when I try to catkin_make them I get the following error;
CMake Error at /home/emreay/catkin_ws/devel/share/agv_msgs/cmake/agv_msgsConfig.cmake:141 (message):
  Project 'agv_teleop' tried to find library 'agv_msgs'.  The library is
  neither a target nor built/installed properly.  Did you compile project
  'agv_msgs'? Did you find_package() it before the subdirectory containing
  its code is included?
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /opt/ros/groovy/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:75 (find_package)
  agv_teleop/CMakeLists.txt:7 (find_package)

-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
make: *** [cmake_check_build_system] Error 1
Invoking "make cmake_check_build_system" failed

I have done the catkin_make for agv_msgs before I create the agv_teleop package. I also included agv_teleop for find_package() in CMakeLists of agv_teleop. I cannot figure out what I was doing wrong.
My CMakeLists for agv_msgs;
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)
project(agv_msgs)

## To declare and build messages, services or actions from within this
## package, follow these steps:
## * Let MSG_DEP_SET be the set of packages whose message types you use in
##   your messages/services/actions (e.g. std_msgs, actionlib_msgs, ...).
## * In the file package.xml:
##   * add a build_depend and a run_depend tag for each package in MSG_DEP_SET
##   * If MSG_DEP_SET isn't empty the following dependencies might have been
##     pulled in transitively but can be declared for certainty nonetheless:
##     * add a build_depend tag for "message_generation"
##     * add a run_depend tag for "message_runtime"
## * In this file (CMakeLists.txt):
##   * add "message_generation" and every package in MSG_DEP_SET to
##     find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS ...)
##   * add "message_runtime" and every package in MSG_DEP_SET to
##     catkin_package(CATKIN_DEPENDS ...)
##   * uncomment the add_*_files sections below as needed
##     and list every .msg/.srv/.action file to be processed
##   * uncomment the generate_messages entry below
##   * add every package in MSG_DEP_SET to generate_messages(DEPENDENCIES ...)

## Generate messages in the 'msg' folder

Comment by Dirk Thomas on 2015-06-01:
Please post the CMake code of the agv_msgs package. It seems like you are exporting a library there which does not exist.
Comment by emreay on 2015-06-02:
Thank you, I have revised my question and added CMake code of agv_msgs.

A:

Comment the following lines in the catkin_package calls:
  LIBRARIES agv_msgs

and
   LIBRARIES agv_teleop

They are only required if you create a lib using add_library, which you don't...
