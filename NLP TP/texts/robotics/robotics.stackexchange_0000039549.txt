Q:

Building rosjava fails at task ':apache_xmlrpc_common:compileJava'

Hi,
I'm currently setting up an Ubuntu 11.10 with ROS Electric to use rosjava. The build tools are ant 1.8, maven 2.2 and rosws.
Installing rosjava as described link:here unfortunately fails at building the task ':apache_xmlrpc_common:compileJava' with error message:

Building > :apache_xmlrpc_common:compileJava > Resolving dependencies ':apache:apache_xmlrpc_common:compileJava
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':apache_xmlrpc_common:compileJava'.

java.lang.NullPointerException (no error message)

I've got no clue how to fix this; is there anything I missed?
Thanks in advance!
Best regards,
Andreas

A:

If you are using "openjdk-7-jdk" try reverting back to "openjdk-6-jdk".  This resolved the issue for me.

Removing openjdk-7 didn't work for me. Instead @SergioGutierrez's solution worked with this version of rosandroid
