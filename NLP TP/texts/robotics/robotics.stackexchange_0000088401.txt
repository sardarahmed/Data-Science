Q:

For frame [laser]: Frame [laser] does not exist

I am running ubuntu 14.4 indigo. I downloaded this line extraction packet..
I then roslaunch husky_gazebo husky_playpen.launch and  roslaunch husky_viz view_robot.launch to start a husky simulation. Then, I followed the line extraction package instruction and started roslaunch example.launch. I checked that both /line_segments   and /line_markers are giving me outputs by rostopic echo. Now, I am trying to make the line marker show up on rivz, but I am running into the following error when I added the marker For frame [laser]: Frame [laser] does not exist a picture is shown below:

anyone have suggestions on this? thank you.

A:

The line extraction node is trying to publish the markers in the laser frame, which doesn't exist because you probably haven't provided a transform. You should set the frame_id parameter (see package parameter definitions here) to a frame which is defined in your tf_tree.

Hi, I set the frame_id parameter but as soon as I add the marker display, Rviz crashes, what could it be due to?

did you solve this, there appear to have no more view_frames command in ros2
