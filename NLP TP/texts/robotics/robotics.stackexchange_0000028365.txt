Q:

Gazebo 7, Ambulance model (and other) Invalid mesh filename extension crash

Hello,
I installed Gazebo 7 and then downloaded models from https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo_models/downloads/and placed them inside ~/.gazebo/models/ (because gazebo refuses to automatically download any models).
Many of the models work just fine but there is a group of them that refuses to be placed in a world and will in result crash gazebo. In the gazebo log it looks like this:
ros@ros-U44SG:~$ gazebo --verbose

Qt has caught an exception thrown from an event handler. Throwing
exceptions from an event handler is not supported in Qt. You must
reimplement QApplication::notify() and catch all exceptions there.

A:

Those files use OBJ meshes, and support for that was added from Gazebo 7.4.0, as you can see on the Changelog.
Follow the instructions here to update to the latest Gazebo 7 release.
In any case, Gazebo shouldn't crash when trying to load unsupported mesh files, so I ticketed an issue about this.
