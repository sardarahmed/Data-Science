Q:

RosJava issue 70 fix problem

In the fix located here:
http://code.google.com/p/rosjava/issues/detail?id=70
The new Android.xml file doesn't have a name or as attribute, which causes me to generate this error when rosmake'ing android_gingerbread:
  BUILD FAILED
  /home/craig/ros_workspace/rosjava.android/android_gingerbread/build.xml:4: The following error occurred while executing this line:
  can't include build file file:/home/craig/ros_workspace/rosjava_core/rosjava_bootstrap/android.xml, no as attribute has been given and the project tag doesn't specify a name attribute

So trying to solve my own problem even though I have relatively no knowledge in this area I plugged in the name="android" and tried making it again. This caused me to receive:
  BUILD FAILED
  /home/craig/ros_workspace/rosjava.android/android_gingerbread/build.xml:4: The following error occurred while executing this line:
  /home/craig/ros_workspace/rosjava_core/rosjava_bootstrap/android.xml:64: taskdef class com.android.ant.NewSetupTask cannot be found
   using the classloader AntClassLoader[]

Sorry to be asking so many questions, I really am trying to get this working on my own. I'm just very inexperienced at this stuff and am having trouble figuring it all out.
Thanks.

A:

Look at the android_tutorial_pubsub/build.xml for an example of how your build.xml should look. Also, make sure you've installed the last Android SDK and ADT.

Updating and re-downloading files seems to have fixed this issue. I'm getting very close, thanks for your help, Damon.
