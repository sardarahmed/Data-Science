Q:

kinect + ubuntu 12.04 + fuerte

I recently installed ubuntu 12.04 and fuerte on it, I am using openni launch package
but it's giving me a lot of errors also there is no topic named /camera/depth/points because of which rviz is giving error when i am subscribing to pointCloud2.
also it seems that the IR projector of the kinect is not working, I tried this with other kinect but the same problem occurs.

Please read the Support Guidelines and add relevant information to your question: What exact steps (commands) reproduce your problem? What are the exact errors (copy&paste)?

Search through previous answers and you will find a lot of information. Are you by any chance using USB3.0 ports? There have been reports of problems with that. You might also have to use a patched version of OpenNI... I needed to do that on my 64 bit Ubuntu 12.04.

thanks for your reply, I am not using usb3.0 I read those questions and was able to fix those errors but still im not getting /camera/depth/points as one of the topics when I run openni_launch .

Also, you should probably post your console output when you run the openni launch file and when you run lsusb (to see if your hardware is detected by the OS).
