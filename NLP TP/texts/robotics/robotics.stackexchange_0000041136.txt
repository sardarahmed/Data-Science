Q:

Error "error: ‘Matrix3x3’ is not a member of ‘tf’" while building bosch-ros-pkg

I got errors while building some packages separately in bosch_shared_autonomy (pkgs are: safe_teleop_{ base, pr2, stage }). All errors look similar as the one below.
  :
  /home/user/link/bosch-ros-pkg-sourceforge/stacks/bosch_shared_autonomy/safe_teleop_base/src/safe_trajectory_planner.cpp:402: error: ‘Matrix3x3’ is not a member of ‘tf’
  /home/user/link/bosch-ros-pkg-sourceforge/stacks/bosch_shared_autonomy/safe_teleop_base/src/safe_trajectory_planner.cpp:402: error: expected ‘;’ before ‘matrix’
  /home/user/link/bosch-ros-pkg-sourceforge/stacks/bosch_shared_autonomy/safe_teleop_base/src/safe_trajectory_planner.cpp:403: error: ‘matrix’ was not declared in this scope
  :

I've seen a few questions that ask about similar/the same error message (e.g. this), but the solutions to those questions haven't been informative for my case since they seem to be case-dependent.
My machine has diamondback, electric and fuerte installed. $ROS_ROOT points to electric. Full error message is here http://pastebin.com/hv455D5Z
Any idea would be appreciated!

A:

See this announcement for details, but for Electric you have to use the Bullet library, and for Fuerte you have to use the tf library. You can either change the code to continue using Electric, or you can set your ROS installation to Fuerte. To do that, in your ~/.bashrc file use
source /opt/ros/fuerte/setup.bash

So it appears that the Bosch package has been built for Fuerte and is no longer backwards compatible with Electric. To get it working with Electric you would have to install and change their source code.
