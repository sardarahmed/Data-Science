Q:

Many to One Bluetooth Communication Link

I have an application that requires data to be streamed from multiple Bluetooth modules to one host controller. Somewhat like multiple Clients and one Server. 
The throughput i am looking at is around 1920-bits per second per module. 
The SPBT2632C2A.AT2 module only supports SPP profile in which i can have a single link (One Client One Server). My application needs multiple modules ( Max 5) to send information to one server.  
Is there a way to have One Receiving Station and have multiple transmitting module using SPP? (All modules being the SPBT2632C2A), or i need a Different higher end module on the server side which supports multiple SPP Links?
It advisable to look into a module like the BCM2070 and have a driver run system?

A:

BCM2070 with Microsoft Bluetooth Enumerator!
