Q:

Failed to load joint?_*_controller

Hello,
I have ROS Hydro on Ubuntu 12.04.4.
I have made
$ sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-desktop-full
$ sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-gazebo-ros-pkgs ros-hydro-gazebo-ros-control

and I have downloaded the gazebo_ros_demos into my
catkin_ws/src

I want to try http://gazebosim.org/tutorials/?tut=ros_control .
Until I type
   $ roslaunch rrbot_gazebo rrbot_world.launch

everything is fine.
But then, when I type
   $ roslaunch rrbot_control rrbot_control.launch

then it says
[ERROR] [WallTime: 1403516339.376075] [33.377000] Failed to load joint_state_controller
[ERROR] [WallTime: 1403516340.379782] [34.378000] Failed to load joint1_position_controller
[ERROR] [WallTime: 1403516341.383720] [35.379000] Failed to load joint2_position_controller

What have I made wrong? What can I do, so that it works?

A:

You need to install the ros-hydro-ros-controllers package.
I just fixed a broken link in the tutorial's installation instructions:
https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo_tutorials/pull-request/17/fix-broken-link/diff
If you feel that some part of the installation instructions is not clear enough, please consider contributing an additional documentation patch.
