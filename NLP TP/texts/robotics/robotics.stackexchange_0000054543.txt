Q:

Connect nodes from different ROS distributions

Hi,
I would like to use the newest version of MoveIt! (0.5.x) which is only available in Hydro to control my robot. The ros-wrapper for my robot driver is in groovy, so my question is:

Is it possible to make the communication work between nodes from different distributions?

Thank you

A:

There are cases where it may work, but in general, no. Message definitions can change slightly between distributions which makes it so nodes cannot communicate.

Thanks. But f the messages are the same it should be ok?

Yes, but I would strongly caution you against doing so. Only way to find out for sure is to try.

Ok, i'll give the old version moveit a try..

An important information is that while being sometimes not possible, it is safe to do so. I.e. if the messages changed the communication will fail (and your rxconsole may see a lot of error) but the nodes won't crash.
