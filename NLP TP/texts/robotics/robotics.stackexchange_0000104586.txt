Q:

Cannot locate rosdep definition, error on micro-ROS

I'm trying to set up micro-ROS on Ubuntu 20.04 using this website, and connect ESP32 to ROS 2. However, when executing the command ros2 run micro_ros_setup create_firmware_ws.sh freertos esp32, I get the following error:
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved

Is there any solution?
Incidentally, I implemented the following solution suggested by ChatGPT, but it didn't improve the situation.

Update ROS 2 dependencies. rosdep update
Install System Packages, which ROS2 packages or stacks depend on. rosdep install --from-paths /path/to/your/ros2/workspace --ignore-src --rosdistro <your_ros_distro>
Rebuild the ROS 2 workspace. colcon build

A:

Since you mention that you are using Ubuntu 20.04, you can not use the tutorial. It is written for Ubuntu 22.04  (https://micro.ros.org/docs/tutorials/core/first_application_rtos/freertos/#:~:text=Hawksbill%20on%20your-,Ubuntu%2022.04,-LTS%20computer.%20To)
I assume you are trying to use galactic, which is not supported any more (https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Releases.html)
