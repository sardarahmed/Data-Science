Q:

How to publish frontier locations from occupancy maps

Hello,
I'm trying to figure out how to publish either markers or other data representing unexplored frontiers to rviz or another node. By frontier, I mean the boundary between open and unexplored space in a 2D occupancy map. I know that hector_exploration_planner does this internally and generates a single goal, after which hector_exploration_controller moves the robot to the said goal. However, I would like to play an intermediary role in the goal-determination process and then manually move the vehicle to the goal I select. Does anyone have any recommendations for ros packages that determine and publish all frontiers, or alternatively, information on how to use hector_exploration_explorer to publish this information?
Much appreciated! Please let me know if any additional information would be useful.

A:

frontier_exploration publishes frontier locations as a pointcloud, but also only for visualization purposes. You would have to modify the explore_server state machine in order to make external frontier decisions.
