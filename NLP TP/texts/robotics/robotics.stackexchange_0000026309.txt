Q:

DRCSIM: Hand torque sensor - no X output

The X component from the torque sensor of the hand is buggy. Z and Y components of the torque sensor in the wrist are giving an output while X is not. Discovered that only when the joint limits from the r_arm_mwx joint are reach the X starts giving an output.
Hand torque sensor 1 shows how the Z component is performing well, while the X is giving an output only when it reaches the joint limit (2:40).
Hand torque sensor 2 shows how the X component gives output only in the joint limits (upper 0:31 and lower 3:20).
