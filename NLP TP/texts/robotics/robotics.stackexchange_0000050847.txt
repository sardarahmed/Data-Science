Q:

move_base robot movement wrong direction

Hallo @All,
I am using a custom robot. I want to use move_base, either with defining a goal by clicking in the map, ob by using a move_base_square.py script. In rviz I see the thin blue line, as the computed path, but the robot is moving in an other direction, with short flashing red line in different directions. When using
a nave-Square script or using the arbotixGUI the robot ist moving correct.
A screenshot of rviz you can find here: www.kunst-raum.de/files/screenshot.png Because I am very new to ROS I actually have no idea where to look to solve this problem.
I hope that somebody here may help me in this point.
Thanks a lot
Michael, Berlin, Germany

Hi Michael,
How many and what is the relationship of the coordinate frames are you using? Try adding a 'TF' tree to the view in RVIZ, and see if they are displaying as expected.
You can also look at section 2 here and see if that helps:

Hi Gavin, in the TF-Tree I see /base_link, /map, /odom all with transform ok. Changing fixed_frame in Global from map to something else didnt change the reaction. The real robot is moving forward for about one second then moves backward since it leaves the map. At this point I use no laser

Can you view the output to the motor (rostopic echo /cmd_vel) and see if it's giving you a positive x command?

Hi Gavin, first of all I would like to thank you for your friendly answers. I updated my question to respond to your question. Today I will try to rewrite our basecontroller_node, to see if something will change. btw. Nice Hackerspace you have.
