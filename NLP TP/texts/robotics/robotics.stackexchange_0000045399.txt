Q:

How to Roslaunch node in GDB?

this tutorial says it's possible to Roslauch nodes in gdb, but this doesn't apply to my case.
I launch the node in the following way:
  <node name="Multi_obj_qp_node" pkg="dumbo_Multi_obj_control" type="qp_multi_obj_control_node" cwd="node" respawn="false" output="screen"  launch-prefix="xterm -e gdb -d=$(find dumbo_Multi_obj_control)/ros/bin/ -e=qp_multi_obj_control_node" >
<rosparam command="load" file="$(find dumbo_Multi_obj_control)/config/Multi_obj_lp.yaml"/>

But I got the following error:

Exception AttributeError: AttributeError("'_DummyThread' object has no attribute '_Thread__block'",) in <module 'threading' from '/usr/lib/python2.7/threading.pyc'> ignored

Roslaunch got a 'No such file or directory' error while attempting to run:
`xterm -e gdb -d=/home/yuquan/myrepo/dam/ros/dumbo_apps/dumbo_Multi_obj_control/ros/bin/ -e=qp_multi_obj_control_node /home/yuquan/myrepo/dam/ros/dumbo_apps/dumbo_Multi_obj_control/ros/bin/qp_multi_obj_control_node __name:=Multi_obj_qp_node __log:=/home/yuquan/.ros/log/fa2d2a5c-2381-11e2-b6dc-0022150df8c3/Multi_obj_qp_node-5.log
Please make sure that all the executables in this command exist and have
executable permission. This is often caused by a bad launch-prefix.

One of my friends says gdb works with a single node just like a usual executable. But in my case I need to launch yaml together. Could any one give me some suggestions?

A:

Try:
<node name="Multi_obj_qp_node"
    pkg="dumbo_Multi_obj_control" 
    type="qp_multi_obj_control_node"
    respawn="false" output="screen" 
    launch-prefix="xterm -e gdb --args" >
    <rosparam command="load" file="$(find dumbo_Multi_obj_control)/config/Multi_obj_lp.yaml"/>
</node>

Also, you can ignore the "_DummyThread" error, it's an inconsequential error in Ubuntu's python distribution.
