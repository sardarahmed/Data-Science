Q:

Costmap does not change on movement

Hey there,
I do have a problem with my local costmap.
As I move with my robot, the map (slam gmapping) changes but the overlying costmap remains unchanged!!!
The launch files for the costmap work, since they are retrieved from move_base costmap. The costmap created under /move_base does change corresponding to the map! But as soon as I instantiate a costmap in my code, it does not update the costmap ...
Here is my rqt_graph:

Thanks for your contributions,
BR Daniel
