Q:

error with dimensions in Simulink

I am trying to simulate a cartesian regulator for a unicycle with Simulink and I am having some problems.
My simulink model is the following:

and when I run it I get the following error message:

so it seems I am doing something wrong with the dimensions.
I have added also some ToWorkspace blocks since I want to use the results to do some plots.
I have not very good at using Simulink, so I am having a lot of problem and I don't know how to solve the error message I get.
Cab somebody please help me?

A:

Split the output of the regulator into to seperate signals.
function [v_out, omega_out] = C_REG(q)
...
v_out = v;
omega_out = omega;

You are probably compounding the signals in a different way then Simulink is trying to demux it. You can use a Mux block if you really want just one signal path.
There is also a change that simply changing the last line to a row vector instead of a column vector could also help
inputs=[v,omega];
