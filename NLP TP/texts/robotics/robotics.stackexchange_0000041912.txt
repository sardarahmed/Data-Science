Q:

error in /opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros/stack.xml

Hi,
After updating ros fuerte today, I had the problem, that /opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros/stack.xml contained multiple "author" tags, which made roslaunch fail unconditional. Did anyone see this before?
Best Georg

There's a good description of how to cleanup easy_install pip installs at: http://answers.ros.org/question/49143/problems-with-rqt-groovy-ubuntu/?answer=49153#post-id-49153

Thanks for the hint, but what should one do now? How can i remove the "old" style install of rospkg?
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-07-03:
sudo pip install -U rospkg will fix it as the answers suggest. Currently, there is no other clean way. Doing a sudo pip uninstall rospkg works, too, but when you update rosdep using pip, it will be pulled in again.
