Q:

Spawning multiple Action Clients from one node

Hi All,
I am creating several action server nodes to cater to different kinds of Actions that I need to perform. However, I find it inefficient to create 'n' Action Clients for the 'n' # of Action Servers that I have. Though I still want to be able to timeout the Action after a duration x. The only way I see to do this is to sendGoal and wait for x seconds. The wait() will block my node though, preventing other goals to get sent. If I dont wait() I can send multiple goals to multiple servers, however will not be able to timeout of the Action after x seconds. Could someone suggest to me good ways to sendGoal and timeout, without blocking? Perhaps Threads?
