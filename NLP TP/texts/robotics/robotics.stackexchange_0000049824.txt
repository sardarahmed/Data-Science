Q:

liblapack3gf imoprt error with py when running arbotix example from ROSByExample

Ubuntu 1210
Groovy
When I run the very first example in ROSByExample (Fuerte) in Section 6.2 Testing the simulator, we call:
I get an error that seems to indicate that states "Import Error: liblapack.so.3gf: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory". But I am sure I have this lib in my computer. The complete console output is:

A:

The problem appears in the numpy/linalg/linalg.py module.
When I list the package using dpkg this is what i get:

 dpkg -l liblapack3gf 
Desired=Unknown/Install/Remove/Purge/Hold
| Status=Not/Inst/Conf-files/Unpacked/halF-conf/Half-inst/trig-aWait/Trig-pend
|/ Err?=(none)/Reinst-required (Status,Err: uppercase=bad)
||/ Name           Version      Architecture Description
+++-==============-============-============-=================================
ii  liblapack3gf   3.4.1-6      all          Transitional package for liblapac

I tried to reinstall the lib using sudo aptitude reinstall liblapack3gf but it did not work. I tried to do it for libblas3gf but also no effect.
I uninstalled libblas* and liblapack* and then reinstalled and that seemed to have helped. But the simulator in rviz still does not show properly...
