Q:

turtlebot_gazebo crashes when launched

Hi guys,
I'm having a problem in my laptop when launching turtlebot gazebo as follows (previously running roscore):
roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_empty_world.launch

All the initialization is right, but just when the interface is displayed, the following message is showed in the terminal:
Warning [parser.cc:356] No <sdf> element in file[data-string]
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
[gazebo-1] process has died [pid 31742, exit code 139, cmd /opt/ros/hydro/lib/gazebo_ros/gzserver /opt/ros/hydro/share/turtlebot_gazebo/worlds/empty.world __name:=gazebo __log:=/home/raul/.ros/log/f0a1a0a2-5428-11e3-899f-00234d4cde76/gazebo-1.log].

[gazebo_gui-2] process has died [pid 31747, exit code 139, cmd /opt/ros/hydro/lib/gazebo_ros/gzclient __name:=gazebo_gui __log:=/home/raul/.ros/log/f0a1a0a2-5428-11e3-899f-00234d4cde76/gazebo_gui-2.log].
log file: /home/raul/.ros/log/f0a1a0a2-5428-11e3-899f-00234d4cde76/gazebo_gui-2*.log

Unfortunately, the referred logs doesn't exist. My setup is:

Ubuntu 12.04
ros-hydro-full-desktop

I've not performed any modification to turtlebot and its config files.
Any idea about what could be happening? A clue would be very apreciated! I need to work with it.

Hi guys,
I tried unistalling the fglrx driver of my ATI Mobility Radeon HD 3450, and it works.
