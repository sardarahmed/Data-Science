What are you planning to do with it? There are separate branches for different Velodyne models.

A:

You might want to ask the author (Ji Zhang) why he removed the repository from his account.
In any case: a search on GitHub revealed that daobilige-su/loam_velodyne is apparently a fork of a fork of Ji Zhang's repository:

This is a LOAM (Lidar Odometry and Mapping) ROS package for Velodyne VLP-16 3D laser scanner. This package is a simple modified copy of loam_velodyne git repository from laboshinl, which is again a modified copy of the original one release by Ji Zhang.

He removed it because he started a company with it (http://www.kaarta.com/).

That's unfortunate then.
It does appear that the code was originally already BSD licensed, so no problem in continuing to use the forks then.
But @milyasmeo: the licensing aspect would be something for you to check.
