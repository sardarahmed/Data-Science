Q:

Can standard SLAM techniques be used in maritime environments, where waves and currents move the vessel even with no control input

I am trying to implement a functioning SLAM system for an autonomous surface vessel (ASV). I don't have any direct experience with SLAM, and I am therefore researching the topic before I try to implement anything.
I am trying to figure out, if a maritime environment will make this job much harder than if our vessel was in a more static environment.
From my readings, I am getting the impression that you need to have a fair estimate of your location over time, given your inputs. Usually SLAM techniques are described for robots that don't move, if you don't tell it to, and this puts a strong constraint on the possible error between estimated location and actual location.
For ASV's the position moves constantly, depending on waves and currents, both in xyz and in pitch, yaw and roll directions. Will this be a problem for standard SLAM techniques? If I have an IMU, can I potentially correct for these disturbances?
For reference, the ASV I'm working with has a GPS and an IMU, and a lidar and cameras for landmark detection.

A:

One of the central elements of SLAM is the map itself, build from sensor readings. There is a wide range of sensors which can be used, but they all have in common a capability of building a map (2D or 3D). In the case of an ASV, in a generic maritime environment, I doubt that there are features in the surrounding environment which can be picked up by a lidar/cameras and used to create a map. As the map element is unlikely, I would say that SLAM does not make sense. 
I am not familiar with sonar and the resolution/performance of sonars. It might be possible to use the ocean floor as a map and then SLAM would make sense (similar to upward facing cameras for robots in environments with ceilings.
Also, if you are near a coastline, which can be detected by sensors, than again, slam does make sense.
