A:

As stated in the setup instructions, ROS Indigo only has apt packages for Ubuntu 13.10 and 14.04: http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu
ROS Hydro (mentioning in your question title) is no longer supported, although the binaries may still install on Ubuntu 12.04: http://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Installation/Ubuntu
Ubuntu 15.04 is no longer supported, so it is no longer receiving updated apt packages of ROS.
Why these specific versions of ROS and Ubuntu? Do you have a particular project in mind?
