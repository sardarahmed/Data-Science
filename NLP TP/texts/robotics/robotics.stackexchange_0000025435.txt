Q:

how to set the rotate axis?

I import two links from solidworks, they are stl files, and I add coodinate system on a hole of the two links,now I want to make the second lind rotate around the setted X axis, but it can not ,how can I deal with it? the code as follow:
link:
0 1.0 0.0 0 0 0

.......link1.stl

 
        world
        link
        
          1 0 0

Can you clarify? I cant quite tell what you're asking.

I will use plugin animate a link rotate around a setting axis of a coordinate system attached on another link.

A:

I'm not sure I understand your question exactly, but I'll go by what I think you're asking.
The coordinate system transformations are based on the joints only. That is to say that the link transformations have no effect on where the next joint is placed, so your stl files and where you set their origins to are irrelevant.
Therefore you must place the next joint with respect to the previous one. In the code you pasted you do not set an origin, so it will likely default to 0, 0, 0 which would put it exactly on top of the last one.
