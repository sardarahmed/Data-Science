Q:

SICK Scanner PLS200-113

Hello all,
I'm currently trying to get the SICK PLS200 Laserscanner to work. Unfortunately I'm not able to do it.
The ROS provided sicktoolbox_wrapper does only support LMS200, LMS291 right?
Because I'm getting an error following the tutorial.
So my question is:
Does someone already worked with the SICK PLS200 under ROS and where can i find a working solution for it?
I would be happy about some help
Best Regards

A:

Here you go. Modified LMS drivers to support PLS range laser. https://github.com/hawesie/laser_drivers/tree/master/sicktoolbox_pls_wrapper. Haven't tried it yet, cuz I'm having troubles with rviz.
