Q:

ROSBag C++ API -- reading message Header

I am writing a C++ (*) program that reads in a bagfile, and needs to be able to access a message's header timestamp (not the one rosbag records itself), if it has one.
How can I do this using ROSBag's API?

I'm rewriting an existing Python script that's really slow.

Thank you, Lorenz -- I was afraid that that was the answer.
(I couldn't find the button to comment on an answer, so I'm doing it here).

A:

You can do that only if you know the type of the messages at compilation time. In that case, you can use the instantiate method of the class MessageInstance.
