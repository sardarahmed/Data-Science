Q:

ros_package_path

Hi,
Can you tell me the default ROS_PACKAGE_PATH please?
Also, is the faulty ROS_PACKAGE_PATH the reason why I continue receiving the error "No arguments could be parsed into valid package or stack names" while I'm trying to install the joy package?
Thank you!
Soe

A:

ROS_PACKAGE_PATH is documented on the wiki here
The first few beginner tutorials walk you through how to manage your path.
