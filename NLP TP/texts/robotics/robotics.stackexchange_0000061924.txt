Q:

Package installation issues

Hello all,
I am using ROS Fuerte and I want to get the Novint Falcon working as a joystick in ROS. I found this: https://wiki.qut.edu.au/display/cyphy/RosFalcon . I was able to download the files but I am unable to install them. I have a folder with the src folder and various other folders. How do I actually install this?

A:

On Fuerte and older versions of ROS, you install packages by adding them to your ROS_PACAKGE_PATH environment variable; either by adding them directly or by adding them to a folder that is already on your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.
In your case, you should have a rosfalcon directory which contains the source and build files, and you should add the full path to that directory to your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.
