This tutorial assumes you have created the 'beginner_tutorials' package in the preceding tutorial on Creating a ROS Package.

i have already created the package but the problem is still there kindly suggest some another answer.

Then you most likely don't have your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH set up correctly, so your 'beginner_tutorials' package is not found by ROS. Have a look at this guide: http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment
