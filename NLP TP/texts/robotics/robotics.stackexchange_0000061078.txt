Q:

A script to check out all the source codes required to compile some specific packages like rosdep?

Is there any tool to check out all the source codes required to compile some specific packages like rosdep?
rosdep install the packages via apt, however I'd like to compile them from source codes.

A:

Using rosinstall (http://wiki.ros.org/rosinstall) you can checkout a list of packages from different version control servers/systems (git, svn, hg etc...)....
And to select packages to install use the rosintall_generator
