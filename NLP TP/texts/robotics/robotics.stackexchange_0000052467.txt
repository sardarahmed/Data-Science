Q:

move_base start position is off the global costmap

Hi all,
after following this tutorial http://www.ros.org/wiki/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup#Global_Configuration and run rviz when I try to give a 2d nav goal in the map the shell output this error:

The robot's start position is off the
global costmap. Planning will always
fail, are you sure the robot has been
properly localized?

someone have any idea what I'm doing wrong?
thanks for your attention
EDIT 1: thanks @ayush_dewan for your answer, I checked my tf tree typing

rosrun rqt_tf_tree rqt_tf_tree

and the rqt_graph

I see that the map server is not connected with the main tree but it is in the tf tree.
I don't understand if is a map trouble (type of the map, resolution,...) or a tf issue.
Edit 2: Tryed the tf_echo command with the following output:
rosrun tf tf_echo /map /base_link
At time 1374093690.903
- Translation: [-0.002, 0.006, 0.000]
- Rotation: in Quaternion [0.000, 0.000, 0.003, 1.000]
            in RPY [0.000, -0.000, 0.005]

rosrun tf tf_echo /map /odom
At time 1374093829.437
- Translation: [-0.224, 0.066, 0.000]

rosrun tf tf_echo /odom /base_link
At time 1374093875.303
- Translation: [0.224, -0.051, 0.000]
- Rotation: in Quaternion [0.000, 0.000, 0.022, 1.000]
            in RPY [0.000, -0.000, 0.045]
- Rotation: in Quaternion [0.000, 0.000, -0.020, 1.000]
            in RPY [0.000, 0.000, -0.039]

it seems to me that all is going well, or better no error is coming out.
Could you please specify a little more where the issue could be?
Thanks
EDIT 3:thanks @ahendrix, this is my map.yalm code
image: map01.png
resolution: 0.02
origin: [-5.0, -5.0, 0.0]
negate: 0
occupied_thresh: 0.65
free_thresh: 0.196

and this the Rviz output

I hope this could be helpful.

Hello Daniel,
Did you solve this problem? I have an identical problem too

A:

Are you using rviz to command the navigation stack? If not, you may want to open rviz and set a starting pose for the robot that is on the map. Take a look at: http://www.ros.org/wiki/navigation/Tutorials/Using%20rviz%20with%20the%20Navigation%20Stack
If that doesn't work, can you post the size and resolution of your map?

I'm using Rviz, set the 2D pose estimete and when I try to set the 2D nav goal the error appears. I download a test map from somewhere, in the last edit of the question you will find the map.yalm code

How big is your robot's footprint?
Comment by danielq on 2013-07-18:
Something like 500 x 450 mm, I created the robot model in solidworks and exported in ros by passing and scaling in blender
Comment by ahendrix on 2013-07-18:
You may want to enable a display of your robot's footprint (add a Polygon display to rviz) and make sure the entire footprint fits on the map.
Comment by danielq on 2013-07-18:
Thanks for your answer, I added the display and all the footprint (a 50cm diameter circle) fits inside the map.
