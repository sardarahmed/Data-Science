Q:

The use of ros navigation stack in dynamic environment

Hello All,
I need to use the ROS navigation stack for the environment with moving objects. Does anybody know if this stack handles such condition? If not, is there any package for this purpose?
Any suggestion is appreciated.

A:

The teb_local_planner package has now support for dynamic obstacles based on a constant velocity model.
You can find two new tutorials on that topic in the tutorials section.
