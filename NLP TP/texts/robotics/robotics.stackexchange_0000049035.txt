A:

Please learn to format code and messages correctly, that way people will find it easier to read and possibly be more willing to help you.
Have you created the workspace with rosws?
The error is saying rosbuild can't find your package among the current ROS tree.
That's to say that in all the configured environment, there is nothing that points to your package.
Usually to solve such a problem you have to manually add the path:
$ rosws set /path/to/your/package

close and reopen the terminal and it should build.
In the future to check the paths in your workspace you can
$ rosws info

and to remove any
$ rosws remove
