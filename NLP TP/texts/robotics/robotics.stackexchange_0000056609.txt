Q:

Can you publish only obstacles from a costmap

I'm wondering if it is possible to publish only the cells (points) that are occupied in a given costmap_2d object using the newer layered costmap approach in Hydro? This was how the nav_msgs/GridCells worked on the /obstacles topic of old and it was a useful feature.
I suppose it would not be terribly difficult to write a node that subscribes to the /costmap topic now and converts the occupancy grid into a GridCells message of occupied cells, but I'm just curious if that functionality is built in to the current implementation of costmap_2d or not. Thanks!

A:

It is not currently built in. You are correct that you could write another node, since the information for the gridcells is a subset of the information in the costmap.
