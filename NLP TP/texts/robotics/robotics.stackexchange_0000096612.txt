A:

You appear to not have the GPG keys for packages.ros.org on your system. It looks like you missed a step earlier in the installation process which adds them. If you want more help you need to edit your posts to include more than just the error message. Enough information to fully reproduce the problem will let us do more than guess.

@ashin369 Rolling no longer targets 20.04 it now targets 22.04. https://discourse.ros.org/t/rolling-ridley-has-rolled-onto-ubuntu-jammy/24400

I had installed ros2 in ubuntu 22 and i had also ran gpg key installation as per the guide, still I face the same issue.

Please open a new question with a full description of everything that you did with the commands and the full console outputs. It should not be the same as the above as you're running on a different OS.
