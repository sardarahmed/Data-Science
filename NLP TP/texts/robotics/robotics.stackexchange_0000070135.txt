Q:

ROS Master Communciation Error - BeagleboneBlack

Our setup: Laptop running Ubuntu, serially connected to a BeagleboneBlack running Debian Wheezy.
From the laptop, SSH-ing serially into the BBB is successful. Roscore is running on latop.
However, when any ROS command is attempted while SSHed into the beaglebone, the following error occurs:
ERROR: Unable to communicate with master!

On the beaglebone:
echo $ROS_MASTER_URI
http://localhost:11311

where localhost is 192.168.0.105
On the laptop:
echo $ROS_MASTER_URI
http://localhost:11311

where localhost is once again 192.168.0.105 (the IP address of the laptop)
To debug, we try running roswtf on the BBB and receive the following error:
root@beaglebone:~/twf_catkin_ws# roswtf
Loaded plugin tf.tfwtf
No package or stack in context
================================================================================

Warnings are things that may be just fine, but are sometimes at fault

ERROR Not all paths in PYTHONPATH [/root/twf_catkin_ws/devel/lib/python2.7/dist-packages:/root/catkin_ws/devel/lib/python2.7/dist-packages:/opt/ros/hydro/lib/python2.7/dist-packages] point to a directory:
 * /root/catkin_ws/devel/lib/python2.7/dist-packages

================================================================================

ROS Master does not appear to be running.
Online graph checks will not be run.
ROS_MASTER_URI is [http://localhost:11311]

Being new to ROS, we are confused as to the relationship between the PythonPath and how the BBB communicates with master. I realize these two could be unrelated. Any help or suggestions is greatly appreciated!

Here's the wiki page that explains how to setup multiple machines for ROS.
