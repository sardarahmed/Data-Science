Q:

adding robot_description to parameter server

Hi there!
I'd like to add robot_description to parameter server and frankly speaking, after reading the tutorial about making urdf, I still have no idea, how to do that.
In my launch file I did:
<launch>

  <node pkg="robot_state_publisher" type="state_publisher" name="robot_state_publisher">
    **<remap from="robot_description" to="$(find museumGuide)/urdf_model/peoplebot.xml" />**

    <remap from="joint_state" to="joint_state"/>
    <param name="publish_frequency" type="double" value="15.0"/>
    <param name="tf_prefix" type="string" value=""/>
  </node>

</launch>

But apparently this line remap from="robot_description" to="$(find museumGuide)/urdf_model/peoplebot.xml" / is wrong, as I get error:
remap to [/home/peoplebot/fuerte_wrkspc/sandbox/museumGuide/urdf_model/peoplebot.xml] is not a valid ROS name

I'd be gratefull for your help!
Thanks in advance,
da-na

A:

The remap command is only used to "rename" parameters that are already loaded to the parameter server.  In your case, you want to load new data to the parameter server, so you'll need to do something different.
There are multiple ways to load URDF data from a file to the parameter server:

Use <param> with the command attribute, as shown in this URDF tutorial:

Use <param> with the <textfile> argument as shown here:

I think it is generally preferred to use option #2.  That's also the method that is used for packages generated by the internal ROS wizards for Arm Navigation and MoveIt.
Edit:
In response to Cerin's comment below, here's a 3rd option showing how to load an XACRO file to the parameter server:

Use <param> with the command attribute and the xacro script, as shown in the very first example on the XACRO Tutorial page:

How can we do this using 'rosparam load'?

How would you load a urdf xacro file/
