Q:

Error while launching launch file

I'm working on porting a driver from fuerte to indigo.  The driver I'm trying to launch is this one:
https://github.com/udmamrl/NovAtel_dgps_driver
I've been following this tutorial, http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/migrating_from_rosbuild and I think I've got most of them ready except I'm still encountering some issues. Every time I'm trying to launch a file, I get this error:
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [NovAtel_dgps_driver/NovAtel_dgps_driverV2.py]: NovAtel_dgps_driver
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/indigo/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/opt/ros/indigo/share
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/indigo/stacks

I'm still fairly new to ROS and I'm not sure what to do next
EDIT 1
Could you perhaps elaborate a bit more, what do you mean by setting up by work space correctly ?
EDIT 2
Yeah I've been working through them and I thought I had them down. This is the output of $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
/home//catkin_ws/src:/opt/ros/indigo/share:/opt/ros/indigo/stacks

have you followed all the steps in the tutorial at http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace?
Can you please post the output of echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH?

alright, so your path seems to be correct.
Do you have a link to the source code?
Otherwise, it will be hard to track the error down.
Other ideas (but just guesses): is the .py executable? does roscd ... bring you to the correct folder? is the name of the type and pkg in the launch file correct

A:

Have you set up your workspace layout correctly?
As you can see from your error message, the paths that ROS is trying to find the executable are all within /opt/ros/indigo. So if you have your driver somewhere else (e.g. in /home/<USERNAME>/catkin_ws/src, it will not be found.
To set up your workspace, follow this tutorial. And remember to source the <CATKIN_WS>/devel/setup.bash file in each terminal you want to use ROS in, or append it to your .bashrc.
Check if your path can be found by ROS by examining the output of echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.
