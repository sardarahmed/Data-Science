Q:

How to build a publisher to pass a string

Does anybody know how to pass string between different nodes?
msgs seems to only contain limited number of types, which a string is not included.
So when I do
transport::PublisherPtr statePub = node->Advertise<msgs::string>("~/sentence");

,it doesn't work.
Many thanks!
