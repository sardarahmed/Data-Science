Q:

Convert VelodyneScan to PointCloud2 from a rosbag file

Hi,
I would like to build a 3D map from velodyne_points (sensor_msgs/PointCloud2) in offline mode. In order to save some storage space, I am logging only velodyne_packets (velodyne_msgs/VelodyneScan) to a rosbag file using velodyne_driver. Later, I need to convert this VelodyneScan into PointCloud2 to build the map.
So my question is: How to convert VelodyneScan into PointCloud2 when the device is no connected? I was trying velodyne_pointcloud that works fine only when the sensor (Velodyne) is connected. Otherwise, it does not publish /velodyne_points.
Thank you.

In addition to this, I also need to run nodelet manager from velodyne_driver package.
