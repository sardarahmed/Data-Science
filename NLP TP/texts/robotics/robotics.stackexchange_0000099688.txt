Q:

Do we need to publish odom in tf if we are using robot_localization?

Hello,
My question could seem simple, however I didn't find clear answer for that. I have noticed that if I am using robot_localization pkg I don't need to provide more than 1 absolute source of robot position.
My question, do we need provide for example tf changes in the driver node, I mean odom->base_footprint, if I am using robot_localization. Because robot_localization providing odom->base_footprint as well.
Thank you!

A:

If your ros system uses odometry, you should make sure that only one node publishes transform odom->base_footprint, and only one node publishes transform map->odom. This is why the nodes in the robot_localization package usually have a parameter to enable/disable publishing to /tf.

@Mike Scheutzow so If robot_localization publish odom->base_footprint transformation, I shouldn't publish odom->base_footprint from driver?
Am I correct?

Correct. Some ros systems have multiple sources of odom->base_footprint, and in that case they must all be combined into a "best guess" before one node publishes the value.
