Q:

Implementation of AD* in ROS

is there an implementation of AD* algorithm in ROS? and is it clear from errors and well tested?
Also are there any path planning algorithms (A*, D* Lite, etc..) ?

A:

Check out SBPL for motion planning of vehicles and manipulators. It is highly-used in the ROS community. Check out the github page to learn about errors and unit tests (although high adoption rates implies some level of maturity). ARA* and AD* are implemented.
