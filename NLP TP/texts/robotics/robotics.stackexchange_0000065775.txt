Q:

ROS-Error why is it occurring?

I created a tread before in which i had problems roslaunch flir_ptu_driver package, but now i am able to do so.. The problem is now connection to the PTU itself.
This problems occurs when it runs.
 SUMMARY

[ERROR] [1423666096.226392784]: Could not initialize FLIR PTU on /dev/ttyS0

It seems like that the first error messages  end, so they seem to resolve somehow, but the last one freezes and never gets resolved.  How come?...

I'm having the same problem at this very moment. Thanks for asking

A:

I 've been debugging the code and can see that during the initializing phase,  RX receives  garbage values..  eg. write("px ") returns |n8 and not a 7311. pr therefore get the value -1, and automatically lead  the boolean initialize to false, which is why it freezes.
--- Edit
problem resolved  baudrate was incorrect.

Can you be a bit more specific? I'm currently having the exact same problem. Thanks in advance.
Comment by 215 on 2015-03-04:
The code is preset to run on a baud rate 9600. I changed that to one I had specified, and it worked.
Comment by kokirits on 2015-03-04:
Do you remember the baud rate you set ?
Comment by 215 on 2015-03-04:
´stty -F /dev/ttyXX´ will tell you what your baud rate should be

Thanks for answering.
Still having the same error though. My question at ros answers can be found here.
