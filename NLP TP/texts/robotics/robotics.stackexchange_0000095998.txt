Q:

service on different namespace

Hey guys
Quick question: I was wondering if it's possible to call services that are created on nodes with different namespaces? For instance, if I have node_1 on namespace node_1, can I call service_2 from node_2 with namespace node_2?
I am using ROS Noetic with Python 3.

A:

Yes, why wouldn't you be able to do that?
In the end, all namespaces do is prefix regular names with more characters.
As a service identifier is just a name, it doesn't matter whether there is a prefix prefixed or not.
