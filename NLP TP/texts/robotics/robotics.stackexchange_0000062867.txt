Q:

64 bit catkin/ boost issue

I have a new ubuntu 64 bit 14.04 upgrade and a project which used to build successfully with catkin_make.  Now I'm getting
make[2]: *** No rule to make target `/usr/lib/libboost_regex-mt.so', needed by ... < one of my source files>
I've re-installed ros/indigo
Any ideas?  (thanks in advance)

I know it may sounds obvious did you try to install the library
libboost-regex-dev

and its dependencies? Or alternatively:
libboost-all-dev

to install everything

Thanks - obvious is OK!   However :  apt-get install returned:
libboost-all-dev is already the newest version.

@blanke, I have various ideas

remove build and devel and try to recompile
check if you are including boost libraries properly in the cmake file of your project

A:

If you just upgraded you need to make sure that all generated and itermediate files are removed before recompiling. The build system cannot track changes to system libraries, you need to force it to refind them and remove all references to the old files. Typically this involves an rm -rf of build devel and install folders. Or the isolated versions if using isolated builds.
Edit:
The missing files are installed by libboost-regex1.54-dev on my system:
$ dpkg -L libboost-regex1.54-dev
/.
/usr
/usr/share
/usr/share/doc
/usr/share/doc/libboost-regex1.54-dev
/usr/share/doc/libboost-regex1.54-dev/copyright
/usr/lib
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libboost_regex.a
/usr/share/doc/libboost-regex1.54-dev/changelog.Debian.gz
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libboost_regex.so

You need to make sure that cmake can find boost correctly and invalidate any cmake caches if the version or location of boost has changed. (rm -rf of build and devel are the recommended way to make sure to invalidate those caches. If you're linking against other things compiled from source you will need to rebuild/link them as well.)

We had another upgrade pushed (by IT org) and this happened again (as you predicted!)  But, removing build and devel did not solve the problem.

Did anyone find a better solution yet? Same problem here!
