Q:

How to simulate Odometry Data in ROS?

I have a mobile robot. I want to simulate its movement between specific waypoints. Can anybody please tell me how I can simulate the Pose of the Robot in ROS?
Thanks

Do you want to simulate an actual robot including odometry or do you just want to send fake odometry data from somewhere?

I want to send some fake odometry data to the robot so that I can debug the robot's behaviour

To the robot or to the ROS system as if it came from the robot. The first thing sounds quite robot specific.

A:

If by simulate you mean visualizing your robot navigation, you can use rviz
