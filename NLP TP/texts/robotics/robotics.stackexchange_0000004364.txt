Q:

Denavit-Hartenberg parameters for SCARA manipulator

I'm going through the textbook Robot Modeling and Control, learning about the DH convention and working through some examples. 
I have an issue with the following example. Given below is an image of the problem, and the link parameter table which I tried filling out myself. I got the same answers, except I believe there should be a parameter d1 representing the link offset between frames 1 and 2. This would be analogous to the d4 parameter. 

If anyone could explain why I might be wrong, or confirm that I have it right, that would be great. I hate it when it's me against the textbook lol. 
Cheers.

A:

You are right he made a mistake there. 
This is probably one of many typos in this preprint of Mark Spong. You should rather turn to other good books, such as the mathematically more elegant book of Richard Murray,Zexiang Li and Sankar Sastry, A Mathematical Introduction to Robotics Manipulation (MLS94). The mathematics they use is consistent in other of their books such as Yi Ma, etal An Invitation to 3D-Vision. screw theory and Lie group theory instead of Denavit and Hartenberg's minimal approach are used in the book. It is much more superior than the D-H approach, and is widely adopted in the academia (the industry is another story). 
Finally, a bonus is that the book MLS94 is completely free to download (under an agreement with the publisher CRC press). It also did a terrific job in systematic treatment from kinematics to dynamics to control.

Edit: 
I shamelessly refer to one of our not-so-recent publication on robot kinematics calibration, in which you may find additional information on how one may switch between screw representation and DH parametrization of joint axes. The point is, one can easily deal with parametrization singularity of DH parameters if he/she looks at the problem from a geometric (differential geometry of Lie groups) aspect.
