Q:

ar drone usability out of the box

Hello,
I want to buy a UAV to play with computer vision applications, and I would like to have a robot that works with ROS more or less out of the box. For instance, I want to know the available nodes allow me easily to read the camera an move the robor without major tweaking?
Thanks,
Juan

A:

The ARDrone works out of the box with ROS using the ardrone_autonomy driver. I've been using it for some and haven't had any issues.
The node listens to standard Twist message (/cmd_vel) and it publishes camera information using the ROS standard camera interface.
