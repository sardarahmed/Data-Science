Q:

Plotting rosbag topics in a single plot

I have a (large) rosbag.
I want to plot a few of these topics (in the same plot).
I don't need any playback feature.
I can load the bag with rqt and plot topics, one topic per plot. But can I have more topics in the same plot?
Another disadvantage is, that it requires a running roscore.
Are there any other tools that allows me to extract selected topics from a rosbag and plot them?
Bonus points if I can have a tool that:

does not require a roscore running
runs on Windows as well

A:

It doesn't run on Windows (or at least, not bare Windows, perhaps WSL), but take a look at PlotJuggler.

There are other tools that support multiple plots btw, such as rqt_multiplot.

Indeed... PlotJuggler doesn't require roscore to load rosbags, but it is not currently supported on Windows
