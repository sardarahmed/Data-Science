Q:

relax a subset of PR2 controllers

After bringing up a PR2 robot, the controllers are all fixed. I wonder is there a way that I can relax one arm and  have other controllers still fixed. Anyone who knows how to do this?
Thanks a lot!

A:

You can stop arm controllers using:
rosrun pr2_controller_manager pr2_controler_manager stop l_arm_controller
A list of PR2's controller names can be show by
rosrun pr2_controller_manager pr2_controller_manager list
You can see how to use the controller manager by
rosrun pr2_controller_manager pr2_controller_manager
Cheers.
