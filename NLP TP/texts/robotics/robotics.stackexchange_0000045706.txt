Q:

IPC-Bridge: Matlab Invalid MEX-file error

I installed IPC successfully (i think), but when i try to run the Publisher/Subscriber examples i get the "Invalid MEX-file" error:
Invalid MEX-file
'/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/ipc_bridge_stack/ipc_geometry_msgs/bin/geometry_msgs_Twist.mexglx':
libipc.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
Error in example_subscriber (line 13)
pid=geometry_msgs_Twist('connect','subscriber','example_module','twist');
I don't understand what's wrong, can you help me out?
Thanks in advance.

It is probably a good idea to copy the relevant parts of the posting you are referring to into your answer, as a blog is dynamic (as in: it changes over time). Your answer would serve as a 'permanent' copy, so the information is never lost.
