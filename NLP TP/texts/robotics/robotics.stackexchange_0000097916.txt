Q:

rosdep doesn't install dependencies

I'm running ROS Noetic ros_comm on Raspian Buster, on a raspberry pi 4b. I've activated my catkin workspace, downloaded the navigation package, and extracted the package to catkin_ws/src
From /catkin_ws/, I ran
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y

pi@raspberrypi:~/catkin_ws $ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y

Why won't rosdep successfully install my dependencies? Is this possible to fix?
Thank you

@g-builds if @tfoote's answer answered your question, then please click on the check mark (âœ“) next to the answer instead of closing the question

A:

If you're running Rasbian Buster you're likely on an armhf build and noetic does not have packages built for buster on armhf http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation only amd64 and arm64.
You will either need to follow the compile from source instructions or use an Ubuntu based image for the Rasbperry Pi to use the binary packages for installation.
PS in the future please provide enough information to explain how you have setup your system. For example what installation instructions you followed, as well as what your apt sources are setup as and what the commands that you're running and previously have run to get into the current situation. My answer above is an informed guess based on knowleged about general systems and not much based on your description. If you want more help you will need to give more details.
