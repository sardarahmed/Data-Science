Q:

Error in catkin_make

Hi
I'm trying to use catkin _make in my catkin_workspace. I'm doing catkin_make in the root directory. But, I get the following error:
CMake Error: File /home/ashikmh/catkin_ws/src/package.xml does not exist.
CMake Error at /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/stamp.cmake:10 (configure_file):
  configure_file Problem configuring file

Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/catkin_package_xml.cmake:72 (stamp)
  /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/catkin_package_xml.cmake:50 (_catkin_package_xml)
  /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/catkin_package.cmake:99 (catkin_package_xml)
  CMakeLists.txt:8 (catkin_package)

CMake Error at /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/catkin_package.cmake:116 (message):

catkin_package() 'catkin' must be listed as a buildtool dependency in the
  package.xml
 Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/catkin_package.cmake:102 (_catkin_package)
  CMakeLists.txt:8 (catkin_package)

Why is the catkin_make searching for package.xml in the src directory of my workspace rather than my package? Is it any error in sourcing or any other issue. A good help is appreciated. Thanks

Welcome! Can you please update your question with a copy and paste of your package.xml?

Hi jayess, Thank you for taking interest in the question. Fortunately I solved the issue. Actually I had somehow messed up with the toplevel.cmake .Which caused this problem, I reverted it to the default state and all went well !.

A:

Regarding my question above, I had messed up with the toplevel.cmake somehow. Which is never to be done. This had caused my catkin_make to rather search for some unnecessary packages. Using a default toplevel.cmake from the web to replace the corrupted one can solve this issue. This has also been discussed in some earlier questions.
