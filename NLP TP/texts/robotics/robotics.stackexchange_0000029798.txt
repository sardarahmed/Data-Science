Q:

How to add additional compile flags

For the ARM build of the PCL_ROS package to work I need to add some additional compiler (gcc / g++) flags. What is the right way to do it?

A:

See the rosbuild/CmakeLists docs.
In particular, the rosbuild_add_compile_flags and rosbuild_remove_compile_flags macros are likely what you want.

Did you try -finline-limit=600?

I'm trying to add flag "-finline-limit 600" to the target pcl_ros_features in the package pcl_ros. So I added a line rosbuild_add_compile_flags(pcl_ros_features -finline-limit 600) in pcl_ros/CMakeLists.txt, but I keep getting errors. I've tried adding ", leaving space out but no success. Any clues?

@Eric: I rather like marking favorite answers myself in my own questions. But of course, thanks for the help.
