Q:

why do models vibrate when spawned into gazebo?

So many times as i've realized , why are the robots moving / vibrating themselfs inside gazebo? This is not good for a simulator... how can this be removed? For example right now i was watching this valkyrine robot in gazebo, and it is vibrating everything like it is afraid of something. so i asked right now.

A:

Piggybacking off @Raskkii's answer.
Some practical steps you can take to reduce/eliminate jitter:

Check that your inertia matrices are realistic.
Add damping to your links/joints.
Add a small mindDepth value (~0.001) to links.
Add a maxVel value.
If applicable, make sure joint motors/forces are realistic.

Hello. This is a very old question, and I came across it now. Could you please suggest how much damping to add? Approximately what order of magnitude? I dont seem to understand the concept well. I added random damping values, and my jitter did seem to stop, however, I feel like I just used a hack, without modeling the joints correctly. Is there any way for me to get it 'right'? Thanks
