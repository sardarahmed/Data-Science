Q:

Is there a way to avoid having to "colcon build" every time I edit Python code?

I am using Dashing of ROS2. I am using Python Code.
Every time I edit the python code in the node file, I do a "colcon build".
Is there a way to avoid having to "colcon build" every time, even when editing python code?

A:

Yes, use a symlinked install.
See #q371822 and Colcon - build - Build Packages:

--symlink-install
Use symlinks instead of copying files from the source and build directories where possible.
