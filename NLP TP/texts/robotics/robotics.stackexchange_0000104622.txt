Q:

Manually controlling the ROS driver from Python

What is the best approach to launch a ROS file? Do I need to check that roscore is running before running it?

A:

According to my understanding of your question, you can launch some files with roslaunch python API and ROSLaunch() call may fail when there's no running ROS Master node available.
Hope this helps.
