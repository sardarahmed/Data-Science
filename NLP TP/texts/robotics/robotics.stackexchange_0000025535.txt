Q:

launching urdf model from Gazebo1.7.6+ROS Fuerte

I am trying to spawn any models through Gazebo1.7.6+ROS Fuerte.
But gazebo does not spawn anything. Here is my sequence.

roscore
roslaunch gazebo_worlds empty_world.launch
rosrun gazebo spawn_model -file pwd/desk1.model -gazebo -z 1 -model box

From (3), just waiting with following message,
[INFO] [WallTime: 1356233674.397032] [0.000000] waiting for service /gazebo/spawn_gazebo_model

From (2), I got

As long as I comfirmed through rosservice list, '/gazebo/spawn_gazebo_model' service exists.
I also tried many other urdf files, but results are same.
I also followed http://www.ros.org/wiki/simulator_gazebo/Tutorials/SpawningObjectInSimulation, but it was also same.
Does anybody have idea?

A:

I believe the spawn_model script did not shown an appropriate error on failure. You are using a URDF (-urdf), but you have told the spawn_model script to expect a Gazebo SDF file (-gazebo). Try running:
rosrun gazebo spawn_model -file pwd/desk1.model -urdf -z 1 -model box

You can edit/update your original question in case this does not work.
