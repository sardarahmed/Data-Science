Q:

RViz - RobotModel -> base_link -> 'show trail' history

I'm trying to display the trail of my robot in RViz. I know that it's possible by publishing a visualization_msgs/Marker something like in this tutorial: Markers: Points and Lines (C++). However, at first I'd like to know if it's possible to do it easier way using display type RobotModel -> Links -> base_link -> show trail. Yes, it draws a path of my robot but only a small part of it - after a few seconds of driving the beginning is 'erased'. Is it possible to make the history/lifetime (not sure how to exactly call it) of my trail longer?

A:

There are a few options (such as implementing your own marker-based visualization or modifying the rviz plugin source to make the trail longer). However, I also required this functionality in the past, so I implemented the hector_trajectory_server package. It publishes the path of the robot as a nav_msgs/Path, which can be easily visualized using the corresponding rviz plugin.
The easiest way to get the package is to
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-hector-slam

(replace indigo with your ros distro if it's not indigo)
