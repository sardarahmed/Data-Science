Q:

rqt package segmentaion fault

Hey,
when I am trying to run any node from the rqt package I am getting a segmentation fault:
[15:54:27]~:

rosrun rqt_gui rqt_gui

Segmentation fault (core dumped)

[15:54:49]~:

rosrun rqt_graph rqt_graph

Segmentation fault (core dumped)

I am running ros kinetic on ubuntu 16.04
Thank you in advance for your help!
One Solution I found, for future reference:
I was able to call these functions by just calling

rqt

or

rqt_graph

Do you have a non-default version of Qt / sip installed?

No and thank you for trying to help, I actually was able to circumvent the problem by just calling

rqt_graph

which worked for me.

A:

Okay now I found the real problem! There seemed to be some python version issue. I also had anaconda installed, which I deleted since I dont need it anymore and reinstalled python and ros-kinetic, which solved the problem.
This also seems to be the reason for getting an error when trying to call

rospack depends1 [Packagename]
