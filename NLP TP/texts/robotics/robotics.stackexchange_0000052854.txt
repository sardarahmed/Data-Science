Q:

Suitable platform supported by ROS

As it can be seen in the figure below, I need a Robotic platform that can move this stage along X and Y in at least 50mm range and rotate it around Z axis in a range of +-10 degrees. A camera is going to be positioned under this stage to track the motion. Lowest possible height for the stage would be 500mm+ 100mm (for camera and its fixture). A precision of 0.02 mm is needed for the motion.
It would be great if anyone can suggest me about the simplest available platform supported by ROS that can be used for this purpose.
Thank you,
Nima

0.02mm?! Is that a typo or are you looking at industrial robots?

You may want to take a look at the hardware supported by ros-industrial: http://ros.org/wiki/Industrial/supported_hardware
