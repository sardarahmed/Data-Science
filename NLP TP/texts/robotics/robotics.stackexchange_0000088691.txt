Q:

Update package summary section in package wiki

I need to update some information in "Package Summary" section on my wiki page. I already changed the information in package.xml but anything happens.

A:

If your package is actually in Hydro (as your tags seem to show), then it won't get updated -- because there is no longer a build farm running for Hydro.

Thanks! In a more recent version, just need to update the package.xml file in git repository?

Yes, I'm not sure how often the indexer runs, so it might be a few days, but it will pick up changes for any still-supported distribution.
