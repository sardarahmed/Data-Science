Q:

Why does the nav2d_karto mapper.yaml have particles?

Hi,
I cannot figure out theoretically why does the Karto Mapper provided in the nav2d package uses also particles for mapping. From the basic SLAM theory I've studied, a graph-based SLAM algorithm does not need particles to maintain and compute the pose of the robot, so what are those particles intended for? Can someone quickly sketch me the main steps of this Karto algorithms used in this package?
Sorry for the quite simple question,
Regards

A:

It uses a MCL filter for localization, the particles are for that. Karto itself does not use particles, you're right on the money there. It's scan matching based.

Hi @smac, thanks for replying! So just for me to fully understand, the front end and back end of the Karto are only use for mapping right?

karto is for SLAM: localization and mapping. After you have a map built that you're localizing in, that's what the pf is for.
