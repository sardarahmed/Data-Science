Q:

Is it possible to build ros without python, only C++ support?

I want to build a minimal ros without having to install python. I use only native c++ nodes. The system has to run on a platform with minimal memory and should require as little space on the harddrive as possible.

A:

No; you cannot install ROS without python. Many of the ROS tools, such as rostopic, are written in python, along with parts of the build system, such as the message generators.
It may be possible to install ROS on a larger development machine and use a toolchain such as meta_ros to cross-compile for your embedded system.
