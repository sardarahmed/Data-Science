Q:

I cant get move_base source files

I tried following this answer, but with apt-get source I always get this on any package
Reading package lists... Done
E: Unable to find a source package for ros-kinetic-move-base

I found source files on github but I want to get them in package folder. How can I get move_base source files so I can edit them, or any files source files?
EDIT:
ok so i get the files with apt-get source, but how do i put them in move_base directory so i can edit them there and it gets saved and compiled??

Did you follow the instructions in #q12478 to setup the apt source repositories?

So what did you do in the end?
If you made a mistake, but then got things to work please post what you did as an answer so others can learn.

i followed answers from that question and after sudo apt-get update it worked

A:

You will need to clone and build the move_base package into your workspace. So:
Go to your workspace src space:
cd /path/to/your/catkin_ws/src

Put/clone here the package from the kinetic-devel branch:
git clone https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/tree/kinetic-devel

Once you do this you can compile the workspace. It should compile successful although there might be some dependencies missing that you will need to install.In that case navigate to your workspace:
cd /path/to/your/catkin_ws

and to install missing dependencies run:
rosdep install --from-paths src -ryi --rosdistro=kinetic

Next thing to do is source your setup.bash. Once again navigate to your workspace:
cd /path/to/your/catkin_ws

and run there:
source devel/setup.bash

and you should be able to use and edit the package.

ok, i did it but now i get this error when running movebase node without editing anything in the package.
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [move_base/move_base]: can't locate node [move_base] in package [move_base]

actually, you want only the move_base,  not the whole navigation stack so just clone the move_base package. You should still have the navigation stacked already installed via:
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-navigation

regarding the new error message, maybe this question can help.

I just reinstalled ROS and git cloned navigation files. Now everything is working
