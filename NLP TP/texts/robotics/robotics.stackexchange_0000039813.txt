Q:

install rosjava error

I have troubles installing rosjava_core.

hg clone https://code.google.com/p/rosjava rosjava_core
(this ran fine)
./gradlew gives me this error:

Building > :rosjava_actionlib:compileJava > Resolving dependencies ':rosjava_a:rosjava_actionlib:compileJava
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

What went wrong:
Could not resolve all dependencies for configuration ':rosjava_actionlib:compile'.

Could not find group:ros, module:message.actionlib_msgs, version:0.0.0-SNAPSHOT.
Required by:
ros.rosjava_core:rosjava_actionlib:0.0.0-SNAPSHOT

Then I tried this tutorial: http://docs.rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/rosjava_core/html/installing.html

sudo apt-get install python-setuptools (ran fine)
easy_install --prefix ~/.local -U rosinstall

error: can't create or remove files in install directory
The following error occurred while trying to add or remove files in the
installation directory:
[Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/katrijne/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/test-easy-install-4763.write-test'

The installation directory you specified (via --install-dir, --prefix, or
the distutils default setting) was:
/home/katrijne/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages

This directory does not currently exist.  Please create it and try again, or
choose a different installation directory (using the -d or --install-dir
option).

export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin
... (see the tutorial)
easy_install --prefix ~/.local -U pygments (gives the same error as the previous easy_install)
roscd rosjava_core
./gradlew install

Can you help me?

A:

The documentation for installing rosjava_core has been recently updated to use pip. Please follow the directions as described there (using rosws and pip).
