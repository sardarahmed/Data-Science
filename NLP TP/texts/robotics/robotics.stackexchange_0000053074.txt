A:

If you add a grid and click on with 2D Nav Goal or 2D Pose Estimate. The result is wrote in the terminal and in the topic /initialpose or /move_base_simple/goal. It's only a 2D select but it can be useful. I don't know if a better way exists.

more specifically, you can do this
rostopic echo /initialpose
OR
rostopic echo /move_base_simple/goal
