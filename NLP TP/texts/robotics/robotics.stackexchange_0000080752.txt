A:

Hokuyo's UTM30 series is generally quite good outdoors, and they're well supported by the urg_node package. I've had issues with the smaller URG-04LX outdoors.
I'm not as familiar with the SICK lidars, but I've heard they also work well outdoors.
If you want a multiline laser scanner, Velodyne's VLP-16 works well outdoors too, and has reasonable ROS support.
