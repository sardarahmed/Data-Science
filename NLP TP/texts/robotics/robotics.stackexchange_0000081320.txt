A:

Make sure, when following the install tutorial, you executed the command
echo "source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc

This sets up your shell to always add the correct ROS variables to the Linux environment. You should then be able to use rospack find roscpp correctly. If not, check the output of printenv | grep ROS includes the lines:
ROS_ROOT=/opt/ros/kinetic/share/ros
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/opt/ros/kinetic/share

If the output is correct, but rospack find isn't working, we have another problem.

What version of Linux do you have? Fuerte is 5 years old now and I highly recommend installing something more recent. Preferably Kinetic, but Indigo at least.

Anyway, your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH doesn't contain the path to the actual ros install. Type echo "source /opt/ros/fuerte/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc and restart your terminal.
