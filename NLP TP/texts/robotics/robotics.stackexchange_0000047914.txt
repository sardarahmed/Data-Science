Q:

How troubleshoot ERROR: toplevel: Undefined procedure?

Hello,
I Follow: Knowledge Processing For Autonomous Robot
I write a simple knowledge base as a test.pl in prolog file, in my package then I try to query it
prolog -f test.pl

and I get a top level error !
?- cup(cup0).
ERROR: toplevel: Undefined procedure: cup/1 (DWIM could not correct goal)

Edit
amal@amal-HP-G62-Notebook-PC:~$ prolog -f test.pl

?- cup(cup0).
ERROR: toplevel: Undefined procedure: cup/1 (DWIM could not correct goal)
?- 

and that is what in test.pl
cup(cup0).
dairyProduct(milk1).
meatProduct(ham2).
cupboard(cupboard3).
refrigerator(fridge4).
perishable(Prod)            :- dairyProduct(Prod), meatProduct(Prod).
storagePlaceFor(Loc, Item)  :- refrigerator(Loc), perishable(Item).
storagePlaceFor(Loc, Item)  :- cupboard(Loc), cup(Item).
searchForIn(Item,Loc)       :- storagePlaceFor(Loc, Item).

any suggestion ?!
Thanks.

A:

This is not related to KnowRob but a problem with Prolog or your test files. You'll need to check if test.pl contains the correct predicate definitions, no syntax errors (did you get any error messages when starting Prolog?) and if the lines with definitions of e.g. cup(cup0) start with :-
EDIT
When I just copy/paste your file and try it, it works for me. System configuration seems to be the same, maybe you need to check why the first output line seems to be missing in your case (..compiled...)
tenorth@lapradig6:~$ prolog -f test.pl
