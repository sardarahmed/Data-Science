Q:

Getting rid of hddtemp prompt

Is there any option to get rid of the hddtemp prompt or automate the response?
I followed the standard ROS hydro installation instructions and ran sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-desktop-full, and the hddtemp prompt comes up. Is there a standard way to automatically answer no to this question so that I don't have to 'babysit' every computer that I install ROS on?
Thanks,
Bart

This isn't really ros-related; that prompt is coming from the hdtemp package. You may want to consult the dpkg and apt manuals or ask on a Debian or Ubuntu forum.

That said, I remember being able to do this when I built the PR2 installer, but I don't remember the esoteric invocation that I needed to make it work properly, and I don't remember if it was something that I set in the preseed file or some other way.

A:

The answer (ironically) is on the ROS PR2 installation page. It is to do with the Ubuntu package installation. The command is:
echo "hddtemp hddtemp/daemon boolean false" | sudo debconf-set-selections
See the page for full context.
I am in two minds. It's not a ROS problem in the sense that it's not a ROS package that is interrupting the automated setup process, on the other hand it is a ROS problem because it affects a ROS.
