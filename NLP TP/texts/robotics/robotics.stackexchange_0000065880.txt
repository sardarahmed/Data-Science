As per the beginner tutorial 1, when i try this command (export | grep) in terminal I am getting the following in my terminal

siva@siva-Inspiron-N5110:~$ export | grep ROSdeclare -x ROSLISP_PACKAGE_DIRECTORIES=""
declare -x ROS_DISTRO="hydro"
declare -x ROS_ETC_DIR="/opt/ros/hydro/etc/ros"
declare -x ROS_MASTER_URI="http://localhost:11311"

It's not clear what your question is. What do you need a solution to?
Comment by SIVA on 2015-02-18:
declare -x ROSLISP_PACKAGE_DIRECTORIES=""
declare -x ROS_DISTRO="hydro"
declare -x ROS_ETC_DIR="/opt/ros/hydro/etc/ros"
When i execute export | grep i get the above statements displayed. Does this represent that all these paths are set or it is an error??
Does these

A:

There doesn't seem to be an error there that I can see.
Based on your comment, note that what you're seeing aren't necessarily paths. The capitalized items are environment variables, some of whose values are set to paths (e.g., ROS_ROOT is set to /opt/ros/hydro/share/ros), some set to other things (e.g., ROS_DISTRO is set to the string hydro and ROS_MASTER_URI is set to the URL http://localhost:11311).
All of export, grep, and | (called pipe) are command-line commands; to learn more, read the man pages (either google the terms or, from the command line, use the man command).
