Q:

Compressed image transfer syntax

Hi,
I have a point grey chamelon ieeee1394 camera. I'm  able to get the images with camera1394 node through image_transport method. I'm taking the raw image from /camera/image_color node inside class with standart image_transport subscribe.
 image_transport::ImageTransport it(nh);
 image_transport::Subscriber sub = it.subscribe("camera/image_color", 1, &ImageGate::readImage(), this );

Here readImage(const sensor_msgs::ImageConstPtr& msg) is defined.
But when I try to get the compressed image I did not make it. I tried something like:
image_transport::Subscriber sub = it.subscribe<sensor_msgs::CompressedImage>("camera/image_color", 1, &ImageGate::readImage(), this );

But it didn't work like this. Also I didn't find the way within compressed image tutorial.
Any ideas?

A:

I had a problem like that a while ago and it was because the compressed image plugin wasn't built. Maybe try:
rosmake compressed_image_transport
