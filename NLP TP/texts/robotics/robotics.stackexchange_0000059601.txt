Q:

How can I remap topic cloud_in to my sensor's PointCloud2?

Hi friends
I am new in ROS and I want do 3D map with my Kinect, I think a good option is with octomap_server, but I don't get it.
I think the easiest way would be using rviz but I can not get it. I think I must remap topic cloud_in to my sensor but I am not sure if it is going to run and I dont know the way to get it.
Does anybody know a tutorial? Help me please.

A:

you can remap "your pointCloud2 input" topic to cloud_in, by including following lines to your launch file,
e.g., if you are using this file:  octomap_mapping / octomap_server / launch / octomap_mapping.launch
write,
  <remap from="cloud_in" to="/(point cloud topic) />

under       
(RGBD slam is also a nice option for mapping using kinect.)
