Q:

How to install groovy-desktop-full on 12.04

Hi all,
I have problems installing groovy on my machine. I currently have fuerte installed. Without fuerte, it is the same situation. Is this a known situation?

A:

u can try this:
sudo apt-get purge ^ros*
sudo apt-get autoclean

these two commands will remove all the old version of ros.
then install groovy according to the tutorial.
Of course, reinstall ubuntu and install groovy is the last thing u can do~
good luck

It helped remove fuerte, but did not solve the problem. The trouble maker was qt. For some reason, qt was affecting install of some packages in groovy. After removal of qt, it was fine
