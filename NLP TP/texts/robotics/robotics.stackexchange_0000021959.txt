Q:

Docker - Dockerfile: /bin/bash: catkin_init_workspace / catkin_make: command not found

I follow the guide of kinetic - Installing from source and put the steps in a Dockerfile.
At this point, I get an error, although I follow exactly the guide, and although it works in the bash of the container created on the image before these lines, and although Catkin command not found shows the same - in bash, not in Docker, though.
RUN /bin/bash -c 'echo "source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc &&\
    source ~/.bashrc &&\
    mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src &&\
    cd ~/catkin_ws/src &&\
    catkin_init_workspace &&\
    cd ~/catkin_ws &&\
    catkin_make'

Commenting catkin_init_workspace out, it throws catkin_make: command not found, and keeping it, it throws catkin_init_workspace: command not found of course.

A:

In a Dockerfile, you cannot add the setup.bash to the .bashrc and then source the .bashrc. Instead, you want to source the setup.bash in one go:
RUN /bin/bash -c 'source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash &&\
    mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src &&\
    cd ~/catkin_ws/src &&\
    #catkin_init_workspace &&\
    cd ~/catkin_ws &&\
    catkin_make'

And the line
catkin_init_workspace 

can be removed, the container also works without it.
Half of the credits go to catkin_make command not found executing by a dockerfile.
