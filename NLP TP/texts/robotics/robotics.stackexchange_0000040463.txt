Q:

Problem compiling modular_cloud_matcher

Hi, I was installing modular_cloud_matcher following instructions on this page: modular_cloud_matcher. However there's an error which is as below:
[rosmake-0] Starting >>> libnabo [ make ]

[ rosmake ] Built 51 packages with 1 failures.    

Did I do something wrong or I forgot something important? I'm using Electric on Maverick. Thanks for answering!

A:

Not sure if you solved your problem by now but their are now deb packages to install the stack ethz_icp_mapping in which the node you're having problem to compile is.
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-ethzasl-icp-mapping

or
sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-ethzasl-icp-mapping

There is no support for electric any more.
Also, the node was modular_cloud_matcher was renamed ethzasl_icp_mapper.
I hope this help!
