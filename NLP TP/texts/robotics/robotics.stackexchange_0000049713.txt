Q:

Hokuyo URG-04LX-UG01 Measuring area

I am tying to use the Hokuyo node to get scan data from the Hokuyo laser URG-04LX-UG01.
When I visualized the laser scan in rviz, I only have a measuring area from -90° to 90°, and the measuring area of the laser should be 240°.
So I tried to change the parameters min_angle and max_angle of the hokuyo node but the maximum measuring area that I get is from -120° to +90°. Do you have any idea why I can't get data between 90° and 120° ?
Thanks for help,
Caroline

A:

What are the values you are setting as min- and max-angle? And are you setting them through dynamic reconfigure or in the launch file? Please provide some more information and the console output of the hokuyo_node.
Try setting them to some values slightly larger than the actual max-angles. Like -2.1 for min_angle and 2.1 for max_angle. If it is not too far off, the hokuyo_node should automatically set them to the maximum allowed values. (3 would be too much...)

+1 to this. The default behavior of hokuyo_node is to have min and max angles which are smaller than your scanner's field of view. You can either change the launch file or change them via dynamic reconfigure at runtime.

I put the values you said and it works now.
Thanks for help.
