Q:

Video editing tools used in Willow Garage videos

Hello,
With what tools did the WG folks make those nice PR2 demo videos? The videos are simple, yet slick, and we'd like to find the shortest path to similarly simple-but-slick videos for our robot.
Thanks,
Rick Armstrong

A:

I think they used Final Cut Pro and paid a professional to edit the PR2 videos.
Not really any magic there; just good software and hard work.

Ah, I think "paid" is the operative word. No wonder they look good. Thanks!
