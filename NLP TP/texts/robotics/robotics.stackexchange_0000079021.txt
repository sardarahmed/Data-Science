Q:

How to convert a sequence of registered RGB and depth images into a ROSBAG?

Hi,
I would like to use the rgbdslam_v2 package http://felixendres.github.io/rgbdslam_v2/ on my own RGB-D data.
My RGB-D data is supplied as a a pair of image sequences, one consisting of depth images and the other one containing the corresponding registered rgb data.
Does anybody please know how to convert this pair of image streams into a rosbag file that could be subsequently used by rgbdslam_v2? The depth camera intrinsics are known ...
Thanks a lot
David

@davnov134: take a look at #q233042 as well. Perhaps the script that @Martin GÃ¼nther wrote can help / provide some inspiration.
