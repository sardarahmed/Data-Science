A:

ROS does a lot of magic behind the scenes in the build system that makes searching for headers like this unnecessary.
Instead, you should add the proper dependency to your manifest, which will automatically set up the proper include and library compile flags.
In this case, I'm guessing that you need to add a dependency on roscpp.
