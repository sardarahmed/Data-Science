Q:

Adding ultrasonic sensor to the robot

Hello everyone. I am new to ROS and was using gazebo for simulation of Innok_Heros robot. Is it possible to add ultrasonic sensor to this robot, if yes can someone please hint me on the method to do the same.
Thank you.

A:

You can use the gazebo_ros_range plugin to simulate an ultrasonic (sonar) sensor. Look at lines 82 to 115 of this test world file to see how to add one to your own simulated robot.

Thank you for the reply, I am using urdf file. Will this work on that.

Yes, you can put the relevant information in your URDF file wrapped in a <gazebo> tag. See this tutorial on using URDF with Gazebo and this one on adding a laser scanner to the URDF.

Does this work for ROS2 ?

Look at ROS 2 Migration for the ported version of the range sensor plugin.
