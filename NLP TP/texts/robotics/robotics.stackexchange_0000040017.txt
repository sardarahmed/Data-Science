Q:

osx fuerte installation rosdep install fails

The instructions at http://www.ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Installation/OSX/Homebrew#Install_Homebrew fail for me on step 1.7 (build higher level tools).  Specifically, the rosdep install -a fails with:
{{{
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
python_qt_binding: No definition of [ros] for OS [osx]
pcl_ros: No definition of [pcl] for OS [osx]
}}}

A:

Not everything is working, please take a look at this for how to add homebrew packages so rosdep knows about them. Also have a look here.
I did get pcl_ros to compile but ended up messing things up trying to get some other things working, so I offer no guarantees ... good luck!
