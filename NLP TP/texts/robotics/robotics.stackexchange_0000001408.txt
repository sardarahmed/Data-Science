Q:

Pushing Buttons Remotely over Ethernet

So I want to program something that will simply push a button, but controllable over ethernet.  I'm new to robotics so I don't know where to start.  What's the best way to control an actuator over a network connection?

A:

One approach would be to use and Arduino with an ethernet shield. There are plenty of examples online for both of these devices. From there you would just need to create a GUI and the build your robot to push the button.

A:

First, let's consider what actuator you need to physically push a button. One straight forward solution is to use a RC-Servo motor. An RC-Servo motor is a high torque (DC motor with gearbox) actuator which can be instructed to rotate at a specific angle. It is controlled through a PWM signal. So you need to figure out the duty cycle of the PWM signal to do the desired movement and push the button you want.
Secondly we need a controller that:

is able to generate a PWM signal
communicate through the Internet

First thing that comes to my mind is to use a Raspberry Pi. Of course it is a huge overkill to use it just for pushing a button but in the process you will learn a lot of interesting things about setting up Raspberry Pi. You can setup a minimal web-server using python in less that 5 minutes.
Arduino with an Ethernet shield as DaemonMaker suggested is also a great setup.
