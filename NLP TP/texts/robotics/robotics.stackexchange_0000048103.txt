Q:

Capture image using gscam

Hello,
I can view a live streaming of my laptop camera in image_view. How can I capture the image using termianl? It can be done by right clicking the image_view window but I need a node to capture image from gscam.

A:

can't you just write a small node (10 min work) to take image from gscam and save it ?
