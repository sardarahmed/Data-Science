Q:

Roslaunch with Arguments

Is it possible to spawn a different URDF to the param server depending on the different configurations of my robot from a single launchfile. I will also launch controllers specific to that robot configuration etc. I would like to only write one controller launch script, rather than for all the different configurations of my robot.
I think this may best be achieved with an argument passed to the launch file.  Is this possible?? Something like:
roslaunch my_robot.launch 5_dof

Thanks!

A:

Yes, see the roslaunch arg reference.
In a nutshell, you would launch it like this:
roslaunch my_robot.launch dof:=5

Inside the launch file, add
<arg name="dof"/>

And to evaluate it,
$(arg dof)
