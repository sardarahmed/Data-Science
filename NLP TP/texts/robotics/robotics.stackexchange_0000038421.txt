A:

Sounds like a problem with your network configuration to me. Are you able to ping both systems from each other? Are you running your VM network as a NAT configuration?
If you are able to ping your systems in both directions you should set the ROS_IP variable on both sides to the values you were able to ping. This should make sure, that all nodes report an address that is reachable from the other system.
