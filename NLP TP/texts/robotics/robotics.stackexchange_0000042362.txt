Q:

Roscd can't find new packages in fuerte

Hi to all. I had ros electric but I need to get fuerte, so I removed electric and installed fuerte. All of my old packages are in ~/workspace/projects and if I type roscd I can navigate to them. But from now I'm not able to create packages and navigate into them.
I've done roscreate-pkg NAME inside my usual directory and then tried with roscd to navigate inside but I'm not able. Keep attention then all my others packages are in the same directory and roscd can see them

rospack profile

which will update the cache.
