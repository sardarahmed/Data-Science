Q:

extra dependencies listed for urdf_tutorials?

While listing out the dependencies of the package urdf_tutorials using sudo apt-cache depends ros-kinetic-urdf-tutorials, I am obtaining the list :
  Depends: ros-kinetic-joint-state-publisher
  Depends: ros-kinetic-pr2-description
  Depends: ros-kinetic-robot-state-publisher
  Depends: ros-kinetic-rviz
  Depends: ros-kinetic-urdf
  Depends: ros-kinetic-xacro

However, when I refer to the documentation (http://wiki.ros.org/urdf_tutorial), there are more dependencies listed. So, why aren't these extra ones displayed with sudo apt-cache depends. Also, cross checking with the package.xml file, I have noticed that this command is displaying only the runtime dependencies of a package. Is it the case?

A:

The current release of urdf_tutorial is 0.2.4
0.2.4 was released April 2015
Many of those extra dependencies came in June 2015.
So, all that is to say, we're due for a new release.
