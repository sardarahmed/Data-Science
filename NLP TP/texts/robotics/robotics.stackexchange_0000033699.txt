Q:

How can I find out the detailed API of messages?

How can I find out the detailed API of messages?
Point, I can only find the definition here http://www.ros.org/doc/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/Point.html . However, there are many methods such as push_back and so on which are not mention in ros-wiki or ros-api. I think ros must have been befined some iterators and containers. So where are the document of API or source code?
Any suggestion would be appreciate.
Best regards!

A:

Message generation uses standard C++/Boost data types and containers when creating messages for C++. Variable size arrays are represented by std::vector, fixed size arrays are represented by boost:array. For more information on how to use these, please have a look at your favorite C++ API reference and the boost documentation.
You can find a complete list of data type mappings used in message generation here.
