Q:

rgbdslam doesn't work if it has launched before

I am following the instructions and compile all the packages successfully. Then I excute
roslaunch rgbdslam kinect+rgbdslam.launch
It works just fine (a window pops out and show the RGB image and the depth image)
Then I close the window and shut down the terminal. But then when I open the terminal and redo the roslaunch again, it shows

openni_node: /usr/include/boost/smart_ptr/shared_ptr.hpp:412: boost::shared_ptr::reference boost::shared_ptr::operator*() const [with T = xn::NodeInfo, boost::shared_ptr::reference = xn::NodeInfo&]: Assertion `px != 0' failed.
[openni_node1-1] process has died [pid 2939, exit code -6].
log files: /home/chong/.ros/log/1ca4f8da-a515-11e1-be93-74e50b030cfa/openni_node1-1*.log

But this log file does not exit in the directory. I found another log file named roslaunch-ubuntu-3307.log and this is the part where the error possibly appears:
[roslaunch][INFO] 2012-05-23 16:28:44,034: ... successfully launched [rgbdslam-7]

[roslaunch.pmon][INFO] 2012-05-23 16:28:52,216: ProcessMonitor.unregister[openni_node1-2] complete
The interesting thing is, when I restart the system and try this again, it works the first time, but if I try roslaunch the second time, tthen the same error appears. Seems it only works at the first time after the system is booted. I guess I didn't shut down everything executed by the first time roslaunch but I don't know how to do it. Anybody knows how to solve this? I will appreciate any suggestions !
Edit:
after I type ^C in the window, it says

[rgbdslam-7] killing on exit
[kinect_base_link3-6] killing on exit
[kinect_base_link2-5] killing on exit
[kinect_base_link1-4] killing on exit
[kinect_base_link-3] killing on exit
[rosout-1] killing on exit
[master] killing on exit
shutting down processing monitor...
... shutting down processing monitor complete
done

What does roslaunch say after you type ^C in its window?
Comment by Chong on 2012-05-24:
Hi joq, I've posted the output in the "edit" part in my post above. Thanks !
Comment by joq on 2012-05-24:
Is ^C what you did when you "shut down the terminal"?
Comment by Chong on 2012-05-24:
yes. and by "close the window", i mean close the window showing up when i run the roslaunch command
Comment by Chong on 2012-05-28:

Provide more information on why openni_node died?

A:

the error :

It's an error because you would have to set the concurrent_xxxx_construction parameters to false when using the matcher_type "SIFTGPU". It's nota fatal error and all should still work, right? BTW, for my GPU it is faster to use SIFTGPU features with the FLANN matcher instead of the SIFTGPU matcher.
