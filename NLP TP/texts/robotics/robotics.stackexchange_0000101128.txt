Q:

How to visualize the laser scan data as a local/global map?

Hi, my robot in ros melodic has a lidar and I want to visualize the laser scan data.
Previously I used the local_costmap, but since it became more complicated and now it consists not only of the laser scan data, I am searching for an alternative how to come to a global map or at least as a previous step, to a local map of a fixed size, similar to what local_costmap would give with only one layer of laser scan data.
I guess this is something common, so there should be already a way of doing this, but my search hasn't led me far. I basically need a map (.png image / OccupancyGrid) of what rviz already could visualize (only laser scan). I would appreciate any help, thank you!

A:

I think the package gmappng can be applied.

Thank you, yes, gmapping is actually what I was looking for, but how can I do it from a script? I need an image of the global map with laser scan data so to say every two seconds, and I do not overwrite it, I collect them, so do you know how can I write this with python in a script and not from the terminal?

I think you can create a  node that keeps subscribing to the map topic and scan topic, and saves it every 2 seconds.
I think the content has changed from the original question, so if you want to continue, would you create another question?
