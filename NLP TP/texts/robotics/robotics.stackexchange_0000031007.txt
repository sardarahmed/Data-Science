Q:

Any microstrain imu driver supporting 3DM-GX3 protocol?

Until now, only the 3DM-GX2 protocol is supported for microstrain IMUs.
Is anybody working on the 3DM-GX3 procol?

if you supply a patch I can push it into the existing released ROS driver
Comment by William on 2011-04-14:
Was a solution ever found here?  If not I am going to write/modify an existing package to support the 3DM-GX3 series, specifically our new 3DM-GX3-25 unit.

A:

I have released the patch for the 3DM-GX3 protocol into diamondback and unstable under imu_drivers 1.2.4
