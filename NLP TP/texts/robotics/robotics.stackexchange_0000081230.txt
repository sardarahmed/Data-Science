Q:

Rosbag for sensor_msg/Imu

I'd really appreciate it if someone could give me a bagfile containing data published to the topic sensor_msgs/Imu.
I have a Sparkfun Razor IMU 14001 that I'm trying to use for odometry, but the razor_imu_9dof package doesn't support my version of the Razor IMU. So, I can't get real data being published on this topic to test my odometry code, which is why I'd really like to have a rosbag that I could use instead to test. Any IMU that publishes on this topic should work. Two examples are Razor IMU 10125 and Razor IMU 10736 (both have been retired by SparkFun).

The IMU is Polulu UM7
