Q:

Indigo Igloo install on non-pae

Hello,
I have MB that has non pae cpu. I tried to install Ubuntu 14.04 but it isnt possible. 12.04 works  but it is not supported by Indigo igloo. I tried forcepae and similiar things to install 14.04 but it wont start.
Can I install ROS Indigo Igloo on 12.04?
THank you.

A:

You could try a from source installation (ie: compile everything yourself), but it is a rather tedious process and more complicated.
See wiki/indigo/Installation/Source.
As Indigo is not supposed to run on Ubuntu Precise (see REP-0003), you could run into dependency issues. Those you will have to solve. Note that some dependencies might not be installable and / or compilable under Precise.
