Q:

ROS Electric Install "unable to locate package"

I'm trying to roll back to ROS Electric because of an error I'm receiving with Gazebo (as described here: http://answers.ros.org/question/37072/gazebo-sdf-has-no-gazebo-element/) ...or at least I think it's related to those two things.
But, in order to do that, I have to use the
sudo apt-get install ros-electric-desktop-full  command... however I'm receiving the "unable to locate package..." error.
Is Electric no longer available?

Try removing ros-electric-desktop-* (or via a search in synaptic).

Synaptic only has ros-fuerte listed and running ros-electric-desktop gives me the same error as above.

A:

Except for that's exactly the problem, Gazebo 1.0 is throwing the error listed above in the other thread, and I've not been able to figure out how to fix it...

You already got a (in my opinion) correct answer. Essentially your world file contains an error that you need to fix.
