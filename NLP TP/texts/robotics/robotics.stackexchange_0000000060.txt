Q:

Is it possible to both move and stabilize a two wheeled robot with no gyroscopes?

With two wheeled robot like this one, I have managed to stabilize it while keeping it stationary. This was done using a digital feedback control system by reading the position of the wheels to determine position, and the natural back electromotive force from the wheel motors was used in the feedback loop to determine velocity. It was kept stable with a PID controller, which was designed using a root locus algorithm to keep it stable and modulate the performance parameters (such as percent overshoot, settling time, etc.). I wanted to attempt to keep it stable while simultaneously propelling it forward, but I couldn't figure out how to go about designing a linear controller that could do that. Is it possible to both propel the robot forward and keep it stable using a feedback controller on the wheels, or is a gyroscope necessary?

A:

You could use other ways of measuring orientation, such as an accelerometer, optical tracking of markers, or a depth sensor pointed at the floor.
