Q:

Why do 3-axis accelerometers seemingly have a left-handed coordinate system?

Careful inspection of page 35 (figure 58) of the ADXL345 datasheet shows that under gravitational loading only, the chip uses a left-handed coordinate system.  My own experiments with this chip confirm this.  
I typically only use the chip to indicate the gravity vector.  So when using this chip, I simply negate the values to get a right handed coordinate system.  But this doesn't seem right.  I assume there is a logical and mathematical explanation for the left-handed coordinate system but i can't figure out what it might be. 

A:

The answer is that 3-axis accelerometers don't have a left handed coordinate system just for the gravity. In static condition (i.e. if the accelerometer is not accelerating with respect to any inertial frame) they measure the opposite of gravity acceleration, not the gravity acceleration itself. 
In more general terms, the accelerometers measure the difference between the actual acceleration of the sensor with respect to any inertial frame and the gravitational acceleration:
$$
a_{accelerometer} = a_{sensorFrame} - g 
$$
This "acceleration" measured by the accelerometer is sometimes called proper acceleration.
This can be easily verified by checking the measure of an accelerometer in free fall: as in that case the actual acceleration of the sensor will be equal to $g$, the accelerometer measure will be $0$.
