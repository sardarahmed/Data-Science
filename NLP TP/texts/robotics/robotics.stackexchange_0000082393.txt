Q:

Query rosparam for public/private status

Can the rosparam command line tool tell me whether a parameter is private or public? If so, how?

A:

"Private" parameters aren't really "private." The concept of private parameters is just useful for bookkeeping. The "private" namespace of a node is just the namespace that has the same path as the node. The parameter server doesn't hide private parameters from other nodes.
You could, perhaps, infer that a parameter is private if there exists a node whose ROS graph path is a prefix of the parameter. However, this would be prone to errors. For example, the following launch file is valid:
<launch>
<node name="my_node" pkg="my_pkg" type="my_exe" />
<group ns="my_node">
    <param name="my_private_param" value="foo"/>
    <node name="my_inception_node" pkg="my_pkg" type="my_other_exe">
        <param name="my_super_private_param" value="foo"/>
    </node>
</group>
<node name="another_node" pkg="my_pkg" type="yet_another_exe"/>
</launch>

The parameter /my_node/my_private_param is private to /my_node, but it's public to /my_node/my_inception_node. Even /another_node can see that parameter by querying the fully-qualified path, i.e. /my_node/my_private_param.

While there is no explicit hiding, I don't believe that you can say that:

parameter /my_node/my_private_param is private to /my_node, but it's public to /my_node/my_inception_node.

private parameters are private to the node by definition. The fact that my_inception_node lives in the ..

.. same namespace doesn't change that fact.
If you create a private NodeHandle in my_inception_node, it will (should) not be able to find my_private_param.
Comment by Ed Venator on 2017-08-19:
My point is that there is such a thing as a private NodeHandle, but no such thing as a private parameter. You can create a NodeHandle scoped to any namespace you like. A private NodeHandle is just a special case where you create a NodeHandle scoped to the path of the node.
Comment by Ed Venator on 2017-08-19:
You're correct that a private NodeHandle in my_inception_node can't find /my_node/my_private_param. That's what I meant when I called it "public" in that context.
