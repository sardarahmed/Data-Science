Q:

offline / batch processing?

Is it possible to run ROS in an offline mode in order to process every msg? For example, I just converted a .bag file with /camera/rgb/points to a sequence of .pcd files, but I had to run "rosbag play --pause " and then step through each frame by pressing 's' in order to catch every message, and get all 238 frames, instead of the ~20 frames it could do in realtime. So is there a general purpose offline processing mode that could do this automatically?

A:

You can use the rosbag API to get messages one at a time; if your code only grabs a new message every time it finishes with the previous one, you can't miss a frame.
A quicker, dirtier solution is to use the -r flag to rosbag to slow down the playback rate to something your code can handle.

The frame saver here is pcl_ros pointcloud_to_pcd; not sure if I can plug that in with your rosbag API suggestion. -r should do for now. offline_ros would be cool; step bag input frames and wait for everything to drain. I don't know how compatible this is with the ROS API.
