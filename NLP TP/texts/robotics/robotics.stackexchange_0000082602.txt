A:

Yes, multiple in fact.
Try: mirror-eu.wiki.ros.org.

It does appear that the only listing of mirrors of the wiki is actually on the wiki itself (wiki/Mirrors), which kind of defeats the purpose. That page is still accessible from the Google cache though.
It's also available on the mirrors: mirror-eu/wiki/Mirrors.
