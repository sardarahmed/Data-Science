A:

You can combine the joints. It will be technically 3 links connected by 2 elementary joints, not 2 links connected by 1 complex joint.
link1 --> joint1:prismatic --> link2(dummy link) --> joint2:revolute --> link3

You will have to think about how to set it (joints position, links dimension and inertial) so it made sense for your concrete application.
