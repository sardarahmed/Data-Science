Q:

Does urg_node work with Hokuyo's new UST-10LX?

Has anyone tested the urg_node to see if it works with Hokuyo's new UST-10LX?

A:

Yes it should. I've run urg_node with a UST-20LX with no problems.

I'm also trying to use UST-20LX, the interface is Ethernet you know. The urg node can't recognize the device. How do you make it ?
