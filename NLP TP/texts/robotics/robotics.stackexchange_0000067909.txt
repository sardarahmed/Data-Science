Q:

PTAM is not generating executables

I am running Ubuntu 14.04.2 with ROS Indigo. I have the catkinized version of ethzasl_ptam installed, and catkin_make runs with no errors. When I run roslaunch ptam ptam.launch I receive the following error message:
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [ptam/ptam]: can't locate node [ptam] in package [ptam]
When I search the ptam directory, I see that there are no executables. In the rosbuild version of ethzasl_ptam the executables could be found in the ptam/bin directory, but this does not exist either. Any ideas?

A:

catkin does out-of-source builds, so all binaries end up in the /path/to/workspace/devel/lib/pkg_name, not in a bin subdir of the source pkg.
Have you sourced the devel/setup.bash? Where does roscd ptam take you?
Also: how is your workspace setup?

Ahhh, roscd ptam takes me into the ptam directory. The binaries are right where you said they would be and, sourcing devel/setup.bash resulted in roslaunch working. Is there some command I can add to .bashrc, so I don't have to source devel/setup.bash every time?

Well you could add it to your .bashrc, see Environment Setup in the Jade installation tutorial fi.
