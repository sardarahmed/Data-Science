Q:

Ros topics not listed for steered_wheel_base_controller plugin

Hi,
I am using the steered_wheel_base_controller plugin for my application. When I am loading it in a node, everything compiles and the node launches without any errors. But on listing the topic, the topics relevant to the plugin are not listed. Am I missing something?
The following is the odom_publisher.cpp file:
int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    
  ros::init (argc, argv, "odom_publisher");
  ros::AsyncSpinner spinner(1);
  spinner.start();
        
  pluginlib::ClassLoader<controller_interface::ControllerBase> odom_publisher("steered_wheel_base_controller","controller_interface::ControllerBase");
  try
  {

   boost::shared_ptr<controller_interface::ControllerBase> odom = odom_publisher.createInstance("steered_wheel_base_controller/SteeredWheelBaseController");
  }
  catch(pluginlib::PluginlibException& ex)
  {
    ROS_ERROR("The plugin failed to load for some reason. Error: %s", ex.what());
  }
  return 0;
}

A:

Seeing as steered_wheel_base_controller is a ros_control plugin, I don't think you're supposed to load it like you do -- eg: directly using pluginlib.
You might want to take a look at the ros_control/Tutorials and the presentation of Adolfo at ROSCon14 last September on ros_control.
