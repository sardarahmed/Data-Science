Q:

Multiple visual entries in urdf

Is it possible to have multiple visual entries in an urdf link?
If yes, how? For me, it seems to only take the first entry.
The same would go for collision models and maybe inertia.

A:

There was a discussion about this on the mailing list in the past, with a ticket submitted and newer more general ticket. It seems like it is implemented in robot_model trunk (and waiting for release in e-turtle?).

The hacky/simple way is using the editor tool and then correcting the links in the source.

Ah thanks! I just can't get used to the syntax of the markdown here - thus the need to fall back to the editor tool.

I fixed the links for you. For some reason, the "add link" tool prepends an "http://" to things that start with "https://". You can see the error if you look at the actual markdown for the link. I usually just insert links as markdown and skip the GUI tool to avoid weirdness like that.

I can't seem to post these links correctly - they show up OK in the preview but look messed up in the answer?
