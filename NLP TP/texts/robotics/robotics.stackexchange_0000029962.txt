Q:

Diamondback install size

How big is the full installation? I currently have <5GB of free space on my root partition (the cturtle on my system is about 3.9GB). Is it safe to mount the /opt folder to another partition?

A:

There is no "full" installation of ROS as ROS supports many different types of robots.  It sounds like you installed the "pr2all" version of ROS C Turtle, which comes with many PR2-specific capabilities.
In Diamondback, we have tried to streamline the stacks that you get when you install.  The packages themselves are also about half their size in C Turtle.
The following are the sizes of some recommended installs:
442MB ros-diamondback-desktop
1.1GB ros-diamondback-desktop-full
NOTE: you have to install drivers separately.
If you need to use arm navigation, which is still experimental, it will add about 500MB to your installation.

Looks like a nodev option is fine. roscore is running fine and I have launched a couple of nodes.

What about mounting /opt to another partition? Is it safe (not running any ros commands)? I'm also not sure what my options should be on the fstab.

Yes, those are binary packages.

What I mean by "full" installation is really the desktop-full install, and btw I installed the cturtle-base. Is that 1.1GB already built?

If I interpret apt-get correctly, the download size is about 25%

How large is the download size compared to the unpacked size? Once in a while I run into problems where I cannot even download all of the updates at once because I have so little free space on the robot.
