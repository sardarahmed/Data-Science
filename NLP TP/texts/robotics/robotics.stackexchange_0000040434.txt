Q:

screenshots stageros

Hello.Like the title says I don't know how to save screenshots from stageros.I mean, I've tried from View->Save screenshots (one time to start recording and another time to stop like I read in Stage manual) but I can't find the saved file,if it saves something since it seems to me that it doesn't..also it doesn't ask me for a path to save files.
So how can I do this?
Thanks everyone

A:

I never used stage save screenshot. That said, if it is a punctual save, I suggest using the printscreen of your keyboard.
You may also record a video, using recordmydesktop
