Q:

[ROS2] Do these package.xml and CMakeLists.txt tags have alternatives in ament and colcon builds for ROS2?

Hello,
I am trying to port a package.xml and CMakeLists files from ros1 to ros2. I have this tag in the original XML file
<build_export_depend>roscpp</build_export_depend>
Is there an alternative for this in ros2 with rclcpp and ament?
Also, the CMakeLists.txt file has
SET_SOURCE_FILES_PROPERTIES(src/file.c PROPERTIES LANGUAGE CXX)
add_dependencies(<target> ${PROJECT_NAME}_gencfg ${catkin_EXPORTED_TARGETS})
I wanted to know if there are any alternatives in ROS2
Thanks!

This is in the package.xml and a tag of the format 2 version. According to the migration guide ROS2 support package.xmls of the format 2 and higher versions. So you should be good to go.
SET_SOURCE_FILES_PROPERTIES and add_dependencies are actually cmake functions and thus, there is no ROS2 alternative.
However, you can use ament_target_dependencies instead of the add_dependencies call, which is an easier way to handle that.
I suggest you thoroughly work through the migration guide linked above.

Thank you, I was referring to that site, but I didn't find some specific instructions. I'll go through them again
