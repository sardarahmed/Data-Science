Q:

Trying to publish to joint with python script

Here is my script
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import rospy
from std_msgs.msg import String

import rospy
from std_msgs.msg import Float64

def talker():
    pub = rospy.Publisher('/rx150/wrist_rotate_controller/command', Float64, queue_size=10)
    rospy.init_node('rx150_talker', anonymous=True)
    rate = rospy.Rate(10)
    while not rospy.is_shutdown():
        position = -1.0
        rospy.loginfo(position)
        pub.publish(position)
        rate.sleep()
        
if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        talker()
    except rospy.ROSInterruptException:
        pass

When executing this script the gazebo simulated robot doesn't respond to the joint command I give.
The simulated robot however does respond to this command when I type it in the terminal:
rostopic pub -1 /rx150/wrist_angle_controller/command std_msgs/Float64 "data: -1.0"

A:

Your ROS node talker uses different topic than your terminal command, in node you have /rx150/wrist_rotate_controller/command and in the rostopic you have /rx150/wrist_angle_controller/command.
You can check if you are publishing everything correctly with rostopic echo.
