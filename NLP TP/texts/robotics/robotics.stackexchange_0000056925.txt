Q:

export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH Does not seem to work. Even after setting the working directory, package not found

When I tried to find the rospack, get the following error.
[rospack] Error: stack/package set_Goals not found
I have pasted the ~/.bashrc file below.
source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash
source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash
source ~/ros_ws/devel/setup.bash
source ~/ros_ws/devel/setup.bash
source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash
source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash
source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash
source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/madhu/rosPractice:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

I seriously dont know where I have been going wrong.
