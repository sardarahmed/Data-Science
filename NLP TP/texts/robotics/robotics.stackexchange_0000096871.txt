Q:

How to use pcl_ros with ROS 2 Eloquent?

Hello everybody,
I am trying to port a ROS 1 object tracking package (https://github.com/praveen-palanisamy/multiple-object-tracking-lidar) to ROS 2 Eloquent. The package I need to port depends on pcl_ros package (from perception_pcl repo: https://index.ros.org/p/pcl_ros/github-ros-perception-perception_pcl/#Eloquent). However, I have read from the documentation that it has CATKIN as build type and this makes me a bit confused about its usage. In particular, I want to build it from source to make it available as dependancy but I don't know how to deal with it to make it work with ROS 2. As far as I know, ROS 2 uses AMENT_CMAKE and not CATKIN. Is there a way to use it with ROS 2? If yes, could you describe me how?
OS: Ubuntu 18.04
ROS 2 distro: Eloquent (from source)
Thank you in advance

A:

Pcl_ros has not been fully ported to ROS 2 yet. Onlt pcl_concersions have been completed. If you have need for pcl_ros, I could always use the help in helping porting it!

Is there a way to see where the porting process is at now? Thanks
