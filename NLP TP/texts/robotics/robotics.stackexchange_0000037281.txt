Pls update the question with the details for the launch file you are using and the complete error to get quick help

A:

I assume you're using electric (otherwise please update your question with the necessary information)?
Since electric, the "joy" msg is in sensor_msgs, so you need to change   from joystick.msg import joy into:
  from sensor_msgs.msg import joy

in the affected code.

For anyone using hydro joy ought to be capitalized:
from sensor_msgs.msg import Joy
