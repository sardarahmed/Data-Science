Q:

Dynamixel Control on Raspbian (ROS Groovy)

Hi everybody,
I have a project on which I want to control an RX-28 Dynamixel motor with a Raspberry which  has installed Raspbian with ROS groovy. The problem is that the Dynamixel packages are not yet available in the raspbian groovy repository mentioned here  /repos/rospbian/debbuild/groovy. So I think it would be possible to build the packages by myself and then use them.  I already downloaded the packages to my raspberry and put them in /opt/ros/groovy/share. but then when follow  the dynamixel_controllers/Tutorials/ConnectingToDynamixelBus tutorial.
I changed the baudrate to 57142 (which I know is correct for my motor I've checked  it in windows with Roboplus). After the roslaunch I get this
File "/opt/ros/groovy/share/dynamixel_motor-master/dynamixel_controllers/nodes/controller_manager.py", line 52, in 
from dynamixel_driver.dynamixel_serial_proxy import SerialProxy
ImportError: No module named dynamixel_driver.dynamixel_serial_proxy
I know it is maybe a stupid question but I have tried everything and I still cannot communicate with the motor.
Thanks!

A:

You shouldn't be manually installing things into /opt. There's a tutorial about how to setup a ROS workspace: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment
The port is not yet a problem you don't yet have your environment setup such that it can find all the required source files.
