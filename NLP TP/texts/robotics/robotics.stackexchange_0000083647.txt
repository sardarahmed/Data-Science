What code are you using? It's really hard to debug your problem if you don't post the code that caused it. Try uploading it to a gist.

A:

c++: internal compiler error: Killed (program cc1plus)

Most likely your compiler is running out of memory, which makes the OS kill it.
Try to enable some swap for your Pi. That should make it work.

@gvdhoorn is right. Also try to compile everything with -j2 option instead of default -j4.
