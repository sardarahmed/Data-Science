Q:

Depthimage-to-laser issue with scan output

I am using depthimage-to-laser. Running as simulation in gazebo with kinetic plug-in. I get the following error. Any thoughts on the nature of this error and if this is a parameter issue.
Would I be better off using: pointcloud-to-laserscan?
[ WARN] [1388168330.681229897, 962.989000000]: Laser has to be mounted planar! Z-coordinate has to be 1 or -1, but gave: 0.20080

A:

I am unfamiliar with this particular device but it sounds like "Laser has to be mounted planar" is telling you that you've managed to locate it in an "illegal" location.  It wants the scanner location somewhere in the z=1 or z=-1 plane and you've managed to simulate it elsewhere.  Any way you can adjust?
