Q:

Apply Joint Effort to Gazebo Model

Hello,
I am using Gazebo with ROS. I created a model in Gazebo that I was able to successfully send service calls to (to get a joint to spin for example). Specifically, I used the srv file gazebo_msgs/ApplyJointEffort (with a serviceClient node). What I'm trying to do now is get the nodes to be publisher/subscription-based to match another structure I am working with. Is it possible to create my own msg file based off of the gazebo_msgs/ApplyJointEffort srv in order to make a publisher node and still an effort on a joint? I tried doing just that and the publishing happens but there is no response to the model in gazebo. I'm obviously uncertain as to how the gazebo_ros package communication exactly works so any help would be appreciated.
Thank you

is this question more suited for the Gazebo forum?

A:

I think I found out from the Gazebo board that that service call did not use physics and so was not relevant to me. Instead I was advised to use a plugin so the ROS side of things would have to involve the plugin. Closing this out.
