Q:

streaming video from a ros topic to a client browser

I want to stream live data from my robot to the internet.
Right now I have a ROS node communicating with a webcam and publishing Image/CompressedImage data. The robot needs this data to follow lines/recognize obstacles. I'm trying to figure out how to have the data be sent to show up in a browser in realtime video. I'm not sure on the best way to go about this.
I could have the computer running ROS also be running a server, copying jpeg/png CompressedImage data to a file, then have a client connect to that server to periodically poll for the image and update its page to simulate video..
Is there a more common/better approach?

You are possibly interested in the mjpeg_server.
