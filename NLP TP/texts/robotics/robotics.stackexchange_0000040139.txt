Would love to know if there is an ETA or at least a promise of a release for the Shadow Robot stack specifically looking for the cyberglove package that is compatible with Fuerte.

Hi,
I now released the cyberglove package for Fuerte. It has been moved to a different stack called sr_teleop.
You can install it:
> sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-sr-teleop
