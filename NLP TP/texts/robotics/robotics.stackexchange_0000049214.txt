Q:

TurtleBot navigation package

(1) When I follow the tutorial to use the 2D Nav Goal in Rviz for TurtleBot, what navigation package is running (e.g. amcl_demo or move_base or what)?
(2) What is the most advanced autonomous navigation package for TurtleBot (e.g. avoid obstacles like PR2)?
Thank you very much.

A:

I assume you are following the Navigate In A Known Map tutorial.
If you look inside the launch file you start up, you'll quickly find that you are using components of the navigation stack, namely amcl for localization and move_base to control the movement and do obstacle avoidance. This is about as advanced as it gets.
