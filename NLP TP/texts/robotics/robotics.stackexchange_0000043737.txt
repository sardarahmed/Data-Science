Q:

knowing when a parameter is updated

From
http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Parameter%20Server%20API
or from the NodeHandle API (the getParamCached methods) we see that it is possible to have a parameter cached and updated locally on changes.
Does the API provide a way to attach a callback function to these updates?

This would be useful for me, too.

A:

I don't think so. You have to use getParamCached() each time you want to use the value (no messages are sent by that method).
Dynamic reconfigure provides an alternate API which does provide a callback. That may be better for your use case.
