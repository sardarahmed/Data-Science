Q:

How to build a map without controlling it "SLAM"

Hi ROS comunity.
I'm trying to make a 2D map using navigation stack, gmapping, teleop_twist_keyboard, dephtimage_to_laserscan and freenect_launch. I'm having some troubles by the moment with that, but I'm close to generate the map.
The thing is, I'd like afterwards make my robot drive itself through an unknown, indoors planar environment in order to building a map. What other packages should I use? or should I keep using the ones I'm currently using for that? Is it necessary use more sensors like ultrasonic sonars?
I hope you can guide me in that part.
Thanks

You should read this setup guide: http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup

Thanks, so I should try another method to make autonomous mapping? which one?

A:

I think you're looking for something like frontier_exploration.
Other packages that implement similar things exist, such as turtlebot_exploration_3d.

Thanks a lot gvdhoon for your reply. Once everything is working, I'll try to implement frontier_exploration. But, for SLAM itselft which other programs could be useful for reaching that?

that is a different question, so I'd advise you to open a new one.

If #q270227 was really about: "which SLAM component should I use?", then go ahead and undelete & re-open it. But do please update the question then as it was not clear to me what it was about.

Yes, I've uploaded the other question and marked this one as answered. But I haven't enough points to reopen that question, only for undelete.
