Q:

Practicality of using magnetometer inside AUV

I have an AUV with a 12 inch diameter, 29 inch long capsule. Inside the capsule sits an Intel NUC computer, an NVIDIA Jetson GPU, an Arduino Mega, a Sparton IMU (9 DOF) as well as a custom voltage regulator. Given the noise, would it be practical to attempt to use my magnetometer, even with calibration and filtering? If so, what should I keep in mind regarding the placement of my IMU in the AUV's capsule, given that I have already read this post?
I have tried moving it as far away from the sources of noise as possible but the noise persists. I looked into shielding, but that looks like it would block the Earth's magnetic data as well, which would render the shield pointless. 

A:

Mags are used in almost all UAVs. It will be useful and it will be a unique source of information.
Adding a some shielding between the mag and your computers and power lines will greatly reduced the noise. Noise can be further reduced by twisting all of the wires that carry significant current (wires to motors and ESCs).
Be aware that the measurement will still be noisy. It should be incorporated into your estimated state using a Kalman filter. Look into fusing measurements from the mag with measurements from an IMU . This will give far superior results compared to treating the measurements as your real state.
