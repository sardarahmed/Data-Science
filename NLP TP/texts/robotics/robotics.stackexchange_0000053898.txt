Q:

openni_camera/openni_launch fuerte repository access denial

Hi,
I cannot clone the ros openni_camera mercurial repository , authentication failure.
Even after I registered at : kforge.ros.org/openni/openni_camera
After I login via web, it shows:

Access Denied
Sorry, you do not have permission to
access that resource.
Requested resource:
/openni/openni_camera
If you think you need greater access
rights, please request support.

I cannot access the repo via terminal, after type in the username and password.
Is there a specific username/password for downloading the repository?
Any help is really appreciated!!
