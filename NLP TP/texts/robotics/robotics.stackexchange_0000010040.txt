Q:

Rotate 3d vector value into a single axis using a rotation quaternion

I want to rotate the whole value of a 3d vector into one axis using quaternion rotations.
The reason behind is that I want to align the X and Y Axis of my smartphone with the X and Y Axis of my vehicle in order to detect lateral and longitudinal acceleration separated on these two axis. Therefore I want to detect the first straight acceleration of the car and rotate the whole acceleration value into the heading axis (X-Axis) of the phone assuming a straight forward motion.
How do I achieve this?

A:

Use the average magnitude of X,Y as the acceleration vector.  
Get the angle between this vector and the (1,0).  
Create a quaternion with this vector that looks something like (cos(angle/2),0,0,-1)
Multiple all future acceleration results
