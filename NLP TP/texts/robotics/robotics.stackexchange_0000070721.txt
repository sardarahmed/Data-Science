Q:

How to increase the cell size in occupancy grid properly?

Hi,
I want to change the cell size in the occupancy grid. I changed the resolution from 0.1 to 0.5.
But after this, my exploration algorithm fails at first step only. Any idea why this is happening?
I want to increase the cell size in order to decrease the number of frontiers at each step.
Image of costmap:

Note: I made changes in mapper.yaml not in costmap

A:

It would be helpful if you could edit your question with a screenshot of the costmap you mention. With a 0.5 m cell size, there is a good chance that huge occupied cells prevent frontiers from being reachable.

Sorry for the delayed response. I have attached the screenshot of my costmap.yaml. But, I made the changes in mapper.yaml not in costmap. Do you think that can be the reason?

I mean a screenshot of the actual costmap visualized in rviz, not the settings. Also, in the screenshot the resolution is set to 0.05, not 0.5 as stated in your text.
