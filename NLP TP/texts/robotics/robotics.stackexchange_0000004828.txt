Q:

Is the nominal voltage of a motor the voltage to apply to the motor?

I have just sized the DC motors I want to use (corresponding to my robot and its intended applications - my figures include a 50% uncertainty factor to account for friction in reducers and other losses). Now I need to actually choose the exact motors I want to buy from the manufacturer (I am targeting maxon motors as I am not an expert and want no problem). I have a few down to earth questions about linking the mechanical needs to the electrical characteristics, among them:
Question #1:
Maxon (or the other manufacturers) states a "nominal voltage" in the characteristic sheets. Is that the voltage you should apply to the motor? This may be a dumb question but I have followed the full maxon e-learning course and read about other tutorials on the web and I could not find this information anywhere. Can anyone who knows about motors confirm?
I have followed some theoretical and practical courses on the web but I find it hard to find answers to my down to earth question...

A:

To control the power of a DC motor you control the voltage applied to it. So no, it's not the "only" voltage you can apply to the motor. The nominal value is a reference so we know what to what specs the motor was engineered. You can input more than the nominal voltage to get more power but it may for example get a bit hotter than it is supposed to, as it wasn't designed to work continuously at a higher voltage. You won't kill a 12V motor by making it work at 20V for 2 minutes, specially Maxon motors which are very well built.
