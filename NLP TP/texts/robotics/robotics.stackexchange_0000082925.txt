Q:

import error no module named srv

I am struggling to progress the error (below) which I have encountered when completing this part of the tutorial link text
I'm not sure why the script I have literally copied over won't work. I have spent an hour or so trying to figure it out but can't solve it..
The code message:
danny@danny:~/catkin_ws$  rosrun beginner_tutorials add_two_ints_server.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/danny/catkin_ws/src/beginner_tutorials/scripts/add_two_ints_server.py", line 3, in <module>
    from beginner_tutorials.srv import *
ImportError: No module named srv
danny@danny:~/catkin_ws$

After compile your package/service with catkin_make, try to source catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash and see if it works.

A:

We'll need more to go off of than what you've given us. Are you going through the tutorials in order? Did you go through the Creating a ROS msg and srv and Writing a Simple Service and Client (Python) tutorials before trying run that particular tutorial? If you didn't do both of those then you will get that error.

@CubeC, comments are an inappropriate place to solve problems like that. Please create a new question, it's easier to work on a problem and it will get more visibility than using comments
