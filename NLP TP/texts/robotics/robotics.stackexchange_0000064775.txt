Q:

Is it possible to extract gray scale images using image_view?

I have ros messages which contains imaged data of type 16UC1. But image_view seems to extract image of type RGB8 only. Is it possible to make it convert 8UC1 and 16UC1 types?

A:

I don't know how much effort it would be to modify image_view. But you could try rqt_image_view which as far as I remember has a conversion for that image encoding.
