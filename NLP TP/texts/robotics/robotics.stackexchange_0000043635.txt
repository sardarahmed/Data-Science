Q:

How to solve 'error: ‘geometric_shapes_msgs’ does not name a type'?

I followed tabletop_object_perception.
I use ROS electric and run:
  svn co https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/stacks/tabletop_object_perception/branches/0.4-branch/
  svn co https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/stacks/motion_planning_common/trunk/geometric_shapes_msgs
  cd geometric_shapes_msgs/
  rosmake
  cd ..
  cd 0.4-branch/
  cd tabletop_object_detector/

When I rosmake,it shows:
  sam@/home/sam/code/ros/recognition/0.4-branch/tabletop_object_detector$ rosmake
  [ rosmake ] No package specified.  Building ['tabletop_object_detector']                 
  [ rosmake ] Packages requested are: ['tabletop_object_detector']                         
  [ rosmake ] Logging to directory/home/sam/.ros/rosmake/rosmake_output-20120828-193717    
  [ rosmake ] Expanded args ['tabletop_object_detector'] to:

  [ rosmake ] Checking rosdeps compliance for packages tabletop_object_detector.  This may take a few seconds.

A:

Do not check out the packages from repositories but install from debian packages. Then you shouldn't need to compile anything but your own code.
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-pr2-object-manipulation
