Q:

problem creating directory: /opt/ros/kinetic

Hi, I am trying install ROS kinetic in my Raspberry Pi 3 and have this error when I execute this command
./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -  DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release --install-space /opt/ros/kinetic

I want say that is my first time that I working with RaspberryPi
-- catkin 0.7.4
-- Configuring done
-- Generating done
-- Build files have been written to: /home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/build_isolated/catkin
Install the project...
-- Install configuration: "Release"
CMake Error at cmake_install.cmake:38 (file):
  file problem creating directory: /opt/ros/kinetic

Makefile:66: recipe for target 'install' failed
make: *** [install] Error 1
<== Failed to process package 'catkin': 
  Command '['make', 'install']' returned non-zero exit status 2

Reproduce this error by running:
==> cd /home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/build_isolated/catkin && make install

Command failed, exiting.

Anyody can help me? please

A:

The error message mentions
problem creating directory: /opt/ros/kinetic

Do you have enough permissions to create that directory? Try with sudo:
sudo ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release --install-space /opt/ros/kinetic
