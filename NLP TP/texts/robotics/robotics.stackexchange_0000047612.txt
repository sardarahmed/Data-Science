Q:

URDF robot root joint

How do I specify in the URDF file format how the root link of a robot is connected to the world? The root link of the robot could either be free floating in the world or it could be fixed. E.g. for a PR2 the root link should be free floating as the robot should be able to move around. In contrast, a robot arm is usually bolted into something and thus the root link is fixed.
EDIT:
I'll try to make more clear what I am trying to achieve. I am not trying to implement anything in ROS. Thus, a publisher or node is not going to help me. I am trying to load a URDF model into our own simulator and I am trying to understand the URDF file format. A dynamics simulator needs to know whether a robot root link is attached rigidly to the world or free floating. I am not sure exactly how gazebo does this.

A:

There is no way to specify what a URDF model's relationship to the world is. You can
A) Include part of the world as part of the URDF, thus specifying the relationship with a joint, as you would any other part.
B) Add some custom field to the URDF to specify such, although such a feature would most likely not be natively supported by the URDF standard.
C) Specify the relationship some other way.
