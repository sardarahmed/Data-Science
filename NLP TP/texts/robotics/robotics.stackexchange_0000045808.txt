Q:

Problem loading cram_plan_library

I am using Fuerte on Ubuntu10.04X64, cram_highlevel is the latest clone from Github. It seems cram_plan_library uses some symbols which is not defined in cl_tf yet?

Thanks again @Lorenz

A:

After some refactoring of AT-LOCATION, cram_plan_library now needs the most recent development version of cl_tf. You need to check out the stack roslisp_common using svn from the following url: https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/roslisp_common/trunk
For instance, you can use the following rosinstall file:
-svn:
    local-name: roslisp_common
    uri: 'https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/roslisp_common/trunk'
