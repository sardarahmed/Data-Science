Q:

Changing rqt_plot x-axis while it plays in real-time

Hi, I'm new and just going through the turtlesim tutorials. When I probe the variables with rqt_plot and watch them change over time, I would really like to expand the x-axis from a 5 second window to an n-second window, in order to see larger patterns, but I don't know how even after some googling. Thoughts? One can pause the graph and change x-min and x-max in the Figure options, but that only works when the graph is paused. The change vanishes once you turn auto-scrolling back on.

Yep. This is a bug in the matplotlib backend of the current released version of rqt_plot. If you have pyqtgraph or qwtplot installed, those backends tend to do a better job at this. (Click the little gear icon in the widget's title bar to switch backends)
The latest version from source no longer has this bug, as of yesterday. See https://github.com/ros-visualization/rqt_common_plugins/pull/239 and https://github.com/ros-visualization/rqt_common_plugins/issues/235

Is there a way to change the parameters in the X and Y axis, as well as their names, etc?
I want to plot, for example, my robot's velocity vs Current instead of velocity vs time.

Sorry, no.
