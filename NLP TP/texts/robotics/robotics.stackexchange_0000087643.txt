Q:

How to adapt an old PKG, driver and ROS wrapper to a new ROS distribution?

Hello,
I have a Kuka youbot robot. The last updated version (by source) of the driver and ROS wrapper for this robot is Hydro. The most stable version of ROS is Kinetic. My question clearly is how I adapt the both hydro driver and ROS wrapper of this robot to Kinetic distribution? Is there any documentation for this purpose? I can not find any. Do I need to change CMakeLists.txt file?  I would appreciate it if you help me out.
Sincerely,

If you provide a link to the package, we can have a look and see how much work is likely to be necessary.

These are links to Youbot driver and its ROS wrapper. Thanks...

Latest stable ROS version is Melodic, not Kinetic

A:

How much adaptation is needed depends on how many of the ROS APIs that package uses that have changed since Hydro.
If the package is still using rosbuild, you will need to change it to use catkin instead. This will include changing the manifest.xml file to a package.xml file, which includes changing the content a little.
After that, just start compiling it and fix any errors that arise. You probably won't have that many and they are not likely to be difficult to fix for the ROS API errors. Most problems will probably be in using other ROS packages depended on by your package.
