Q:

rosdoc_lite issues

As rosdoc is deprecated, we've recently switched from rosdoc to rosdoc_lite for our private, internal documentation of not-ready-for-primetime packages.
But the web docs created by rosdoc_lite seem to ignore the (private) URLs in our manifest.xml files and just default to ros.org/wiki/ for all packages.
So, we are debating going back to dependable rosdoc, unless of course there are some undocumented tricks for rosdoc_lite that will help us out.

A:

I agree that rosdoc-lite should honor the URL specified, and not default to ros.org/wiki, even if that is the usual case.
I recommend opening a rsodoc_lite issue to get it fixed.
