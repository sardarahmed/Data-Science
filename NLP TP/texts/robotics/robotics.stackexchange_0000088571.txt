Q:

Installed ros-kinetic-turtlebot-gazebo but something weird

I think I am getting wrapped around the axle with respect to paths or apt-get so I thought I would ask this...
sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-turtlebot-gazebo
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

and still when I do
roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch 

I get an error because turtlebot_gazebo doesn't exist. roscd turtlebot_gazebo similarly doesn't work. Because I have turtlebot3 packages installed, I am able to see turtlebot3_gazebo but I believe that has nothing to do with anything. Can someone see where I am going wrong?
Updates (thanks @gvdhoorn)
I  did the following to try and troubleshoot:
sudo apt-get remove turtlebot_gazebo
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install turtlebot_gazebo

And thnings got better, but still weird. After that:
 dpkg -l | grep turtlebot

Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-08-19:\

sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get

upgrade sudo apt-get install

this is a bit jumbled up, I'm guessing this needs to be three separate lines?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-08-19:
As always when checking why pkgs can't be found / appear not to be installed:

pay attention to the output of apt-get: did it indicate successful installation?
what is the output of dpkg -l | grep turtlebot?
run rospack profile, then rospack find turtlebot_gazebo: does that work?

Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-08-19:\

Can someone see where I am going wrong?

I'm also assuming that you're sourceing your base ROS installation / workspace before trying to run roslaunch.
Comment by pitosalas on 2018-08-19:
Yes, and see updates above.Whoops. Seem to have exceeded allowed lengrh.
Comment by pitosalas on 2018-08-19:
Theories: 1) turtlebot_* packages are actually not compatible with Kinetic.2) I also have turtlebot3 packages installed and they are interfering.

A:

This looked like excellent advice from @gvdhorn:
"As always when checking why pkgs can't be found / appear not to be installed:"

pay attention to the output of apt-get: did it indicate successful installation?
what is the output of dpkg -l | grep turtlebot?
run rospack profile, then rospack find turtlebot_gazebo: does that work?

In the end these techniques didn't get to the bottom of it, but something must have been wrong with my installation or environment and sadly I had to uninstall and reinstall ROS. I wonder whether this is not an unusual situation because I do try to be quite careful when installing things.
