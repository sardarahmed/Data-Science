Q:

error during pcl_ros

Hi ,
I downloaded pcl and perception_pcl from pointclouds.org and did rosdep without any errors..
when I rosmake pcl_ros, its resulting the errors below.
mkdir -p bin
cd build && cmake -Wdev -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=rospack find rosbuild/rostoolchain.cmake  ..

A:

You should use the one provided with ROS, type in a terminal :
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-pcl* ros-fuerte-perception*

Unless you wanted to use some unstable ones ?
Bests reguards,
Steph
Ps :And next time, don't forget to precise : your distribution (Ubuntu xx.xx), your platform, and which ROS you use (I see from the error message you are using fuerte)

ubuntu 12.04 and fuerte, The registration library which i wanted to use is not up to date in ros-fuerte repository. So I downloaded from the trunk from pcl website which has ros wrappers but it isresulting in the above errors given in the question

OK... Yes, I tried to compiled pcl trunk also but a lot of things doesn't compile in it, thus needing to flag only the part you want to compile, and leave the rest out. You can go to PCL support forum, in which you may find more help (suscribe at http://pointclouds.org/mailman/listinfo/pcl-users)
