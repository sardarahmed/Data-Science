Q:

can't spawn 2 bins in gazebo

Hi all hope you al are fine.
I am using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and ROS Kinetic version. I am working on UR5 robot simulation in Gazebo for which I made a custom catkin space and my own pkg named "ur5_custom" in this pkg I made launch file "custom_initialize.launch file" in which I am using the following:
node name="bin" pkg="gazebo_ros" type="spawn_model" args="-file $(find ur5_notebook)/urdf/bin.urdf -urdf -model bin -y 0.8 -x -0.5 -z 0.05"
node name="bin1" pkg="gazebo_ros" type="spawn_model" args="-file $(find ur5_notebook)/urdf/bin1.urdf -urdf -model bin -y 1 -x -1.5 z 0.05"
This is to spawn 2 bin in gazebo but it is not working. I received the following error:
[ERROR] [1640883635.252745507, 0.321000000]: SpawnModel: Failure - model name bin already exists.
I have tried same name different names, same urdf files and different(duplicate) URDF files also but no success at all.
please tell me how to spawn 2 same objects at different positons in gazebo using a single URDF file.
Thanks

A:

This issue was resolved by adding a URDF directory in my workspace package and putting in box.urdf in it, where as it was in an other workspce in another package from which I was accessing it.  probably that was the problem. This is the piece of code I used instead of the above:
node name="bin" pkg="gazebo_ros" type="spawn_model" args="-file $(find ur5_notebook)/urdf/bin.urdf -urdf -model bin -y 0.8 -x -0.5 -z 0.05"
node name="bin1" pkg="gazebo_ros" type="spawn_model" args="-file $(find ur5_notebook)/urdf/bin.urdf -urdf -model bin1 -y 1 -x -1.5 -z 0.05"
node name is different also name just after -model before describing its coordinates.
