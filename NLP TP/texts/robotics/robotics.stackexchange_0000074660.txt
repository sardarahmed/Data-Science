Q:

run "rosdep install -r --from-paths ." error when I install iai_kinect2

When I was run rosdep install -r --from-paths ., some errors show me as following:
turtlebot@turtlebot-HP-ZBook-14-G2:~/catkin_ws/src/iai_kinect2$ rosdep install -r --from-paths .

ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved

to system dependencies:

kinect2_viewer: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [kinect2_bridge]

kinect2_calibration: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [kinect2_bridge]

kinect2_bridge: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [kinect2_registration]

Continuing to install resolvable dependencies...

All required rosdeps installed successfully

Some assistes show as following writing by author:
rosdep will output errors on not being able to locate [kinect2_bridge] and [depth_registration]. That is fine because they are all part of the iai_kinect2 package and rosdep does not know these packages.
what should I do, my rosdep can just know these packages.
Thank you very much!

Please don't post updates as answers. Only post answers if you are actually answering your own question. I've merged your answer as an update into your OP.

A:

I would think this is what --ignore-src is meant for.

Edit:

following you, Should I run the command which is " rosdep install --ignore-src" ?

No, the full command should be:
rosdep install --from-paths ~/catkin_ws/src/iai_kinect2 --ignore-src -r

That will make rosdep look for packages in the ~/catkin_ws/src/iai_kinect2 directory, gather all the dependencies, check which you have installed, which are missing, then subtract all packages that it finds in ~/catkin_ws/src/iai_kinect2 (because of --ignore-src), and then install everything that is still missing.

I am running, but terminal show some errors to me:

rosdep: error: no packages or stacks specified

Well, yes. You give it no path and no package name, so it can't do anything for you.
Please also check the output of rosdep --help.

I find that this errors can be ignore, however, OpenCL is not optional but integrant when install iai_kinect2.

This is a new question, unrelated to your earlier one. I advise you to open a new one.
Also (and for the last time): please don't post answers if you are not answering your question. ROS Answers is not a normal forum, but an askbot site. It works differently.

Hi, openCL is actually optional as you can choose to either use openGL, openCL or CPU. You may read the FAQs on https://github.com/code-iai/iai_kinect2#dependencies.
Check the website: If one of them works, try out the one that worked with kinect2_bridge:
