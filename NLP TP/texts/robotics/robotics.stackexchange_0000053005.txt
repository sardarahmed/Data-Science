Q:

Rosrun executable not found

I'm trying to run some code using rosrun on Fedora 19 (the same code works on Ubuntu). This is the error:
find: invalid mode ‘+111’
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named fitting below /home/andreas/catkin_ws/src/fitting
[rosrun] Found the following, but they're either not files,
[rosrun] or not executable:
[rosrun]   /home/andreas/catkin_ws/src/fitting

The executable is in /devel/lib, and echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH gives:
/home/andreas/catkin_ws/src:/home/andreas/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/share:/home/andreas/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/stacks

A:

You say that the executable is in /devel/lib - I assume that you mean /home/andreas/catkin_ws/devel/lib? Are you manually setting the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, or doing so by sourcing a catkin-generated setup file?
EDIT:
To address something that came up in the comments:
You shouldn't need to source both ~/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/setup.bash  and ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash. Assuming that you had sourced ~/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/setup.bash  when you first created the catkin workspace as indicated in the tutorial, in all subsequent terminals devel/setup.bash on its own is sufficient. See section 2.5 in the conceptual overview.

You are right about the file path. I sourced catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash. So, ROS_PACKAGE_PATH needs to point to devel/lib?

No it does need to point to catkin_ws/src

So, everything seems to be correct? Maybe I forgot to do sth in general ...
Comment by Lucile on 2013-07-24:
You did source both /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash and devel/setup.bash ? Can you do "ls -l" in fitting folder to check the rights you have and if you have the right to execute your programm. If you don't have them - it would be quite odd but not impossible - use chmod to set your file as executable.
Comment by atp on 2013-07-24:
Yes, I sourced both of them, although the 1st one is: source ~/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/setup.bash (see http://www.ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/Fedora#Building_the_catkin_Packages). ls -l within devel/lib/fitting gives: total 720

I just redid the installation to /opt/ros/groovy according to: http://www.jann.cc/2013/04/29/building_ros_on_fedora_19.html. And I get the same error again.

You might want to put this information back in the original question, rather than a really long comment chain =) (I'd include the information about the exact original invocation of rosrun, full paths to all files, your path/what you're sourcing, and the steps you followed to set up your catkin_ws)
