Q:

Order of called-back program when execute spinOnce

Hi there, it's my first time asking question, if  there is something I missed please inform me:)
So my question is like this.
I have one node, with two subscriber, linked to two different topic.
When I use the while+ros::spinOnce() procedure to replace spin, which subscriber's program would be called first when ros::spinOnce() is executed?

A:

that does not depend on the subscriber node, but on the topics being published to it.
the first topic to be published once you start your program will activate the callback of the correspondant subscriber.
