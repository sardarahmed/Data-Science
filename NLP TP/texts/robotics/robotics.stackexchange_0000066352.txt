Q:

costmap plugin question

Does placing plugin definitions under the namespace restrict them to those functions. Even if the parameters are specified in another file but under the same namespaces.  If I use the definitions below it does not complain but ignores  the parameters under the plugin namespaces, if I remove the plugin definitions and comment out the plugin name spaces then it sees the parameters.
global_costmap:
       plugins:
        - {name: footprint_layer, type: "costmap_2d::FootprintLayer"}
        - {name: static_map_layer, type: "costmap_2d::StaticLayer"}
        - {name: obstacle_layer,  type: "costmap_2d::VoxelLayer"}
        - {name: inflation_layer,   type: "costmap_2d::InflationLayer"}   
      footprint_layer:
          footprint:  []
      obstacle_layer:
               :
               :

local_costmap:
       plugins:
        - {name: footprint_layer, type: "costmap_2d::FootprintLayer"}
        - {name: obstacle_layer,  type: "costmap_2d::VoxelLayer"}
        - {name: inflation_layer,   type: "costmap_2d::InflationLayer"}
      footprint_layer:
          footprint:  []
               :
               :

A:

Yes, they are restricted. One solution is to use  tags to load a common plugin definition yaml file into both namespaces (along with other common parameters) See: https://github.com/husky/husky_navigation/blob/indigo-devel/launch/move_base.launch#L40

I'm not 100% sure on what your issue is, but check your whitespace above. plugin and *layer_ are not aligned. Yaml is whitespace-sensitive.
Comment by rnunziata on 2015-03-13:
yes...the above was cut and past..unaligned  will generate error in yaml.  Any way it seems to work if I just do not define a plugins or layer names spaces. So I am going to close this.
