Q:

TF broadcaster on robot , where to start?

Hey , i am new to ROS . Currently i am working on this robot(http://)(http://)(http://).
components

sabertooth 2x32 motor driver
18aH 12v battery
raspberry pi
Logitech USB camera
Line laser
2X 250watt ebike motors

The current configuration doesn't have a encoders . This is a big issue for determining the odom .
The bot is currently partially ROS enabled (Skid steer ) . I want to configure the bot with TF such that the camera and wheels are in the right perspective .
I am not able to figure out where to start , should i write a URDF/XACRO description of the robot and add the camera to it ?
If anyone knows some simple tutorials please point me towards that .

I've given you enough karma to attach images. Please edit your question to add the image in.

A:

We have somewhat of an expression in my lab:

If you're using ROS, but don't have a urdf, you're doing it wrong

that is of course grossly generalising, but there is some truth there.
Whether or not you have encoders, start creating a urdf modelling the structure of your robot.
Worry about adding other things later (such as "TF broadcasters": you'll know when you need them, right now, you don't yet).
Also note: encoders (ie: wheels) are not the only source of odometry. Visual odometry and IMUs are also good sources.

Thanks , you are right . I should leave everything and first focus on creating the URDF model . I am already on it .
