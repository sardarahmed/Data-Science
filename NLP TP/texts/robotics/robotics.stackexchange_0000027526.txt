Q:

installing gazbo_ros package

I have ubuntu 14.04 and am using ros_indigo. I am following tutorials from this link to connect gazebo to ros.
I have installled gazebo4 and when I am following the tutorials stated, it doesn't allow me to proceed. Apparently, it keeps forcing me to install gazebo2, which forces me to remove gazebo4.How can I have them both? For eg : I am using drcsim as well, which means I would atleast require gazebo4.

A:

If you want to use ros indigo with a gazebo version!=2.2 you should not install the meta package ros-indigo-desktop-full(I prefer ros-indigo-desktop instead). Otherwise removing gazebo2.2 will remove most of your ros installation. You will although need to install third Party packages from source instead of via apt...
If you want to use multiple versions in parallel; installing one version of ros in user space and only loading it on demand might be the way to go. But changing this might have side effects on ros packages. So you should always make sure to link against the right installation...

I am trying to use hector quad, in a new world I created. Do I need 2.2 for that or can I spawn hector in the new world 4 I created.?

I use this packages and it should work(I'm using gazebo5 at the moment..). you will have to compile them form source(Put them into your catkin workspace) But I don't see any reasons for them not to run...

they are running fine. My doubt was how to spawn the hector quad into a custom world I created using gazebo4 and use it there?

The hector_quadrotor_gazebo package has a set of launch files which you can use. If you need to specify a position you can with the provided command line args...
