A:

Please provide us with more information - in this case: a snippet that shows how you run your main loop.
Are you running your own while { ..; ros::spinOnce(); ..; } or are you using ros::spin()? If the former: be sure to add a ros::Rate::sleep() in there, or you basically have a busy-wait.

Can you tell us what the cause was? Did you have a busy-while-loop without a sleep?

Yes . I was using ros::spinOnce inside a while loop  , without rate.sleep() .
