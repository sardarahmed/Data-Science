Q:

ros_canopen homing simultaneously or one-by-one?

Hello,
this question has been addressed in these questions as well (Q1, Q2), however no answer arrived, therefore i'm asking as well.
It is not clear from the wiki of ros_canopen that how does the node execute the homing of multiple motors/joints?
Do the motors execute the homing simultaneously or one-by-one?
If one-by-one, than does it mean, that the execution of the next homing procedure is not started until the previous has not been finished?
Also, is it possible to change the order of the sequence? I mean, what if i want to execute the homing like, joint1-joint3-joint2-joint4-joint5? Should be enough just to change the order in the yaml config file?
Thank you in advance.

A:

One-by-one (canopen_motor_node, as-is).

If one-by-one, than does it mean, that the execution of the next homing procedure is not started until the previous has not been finished?

Exactly

Also, is it possible to change the order of the sequence? I mean, what if i want to execute the homing like, joint1-joint3-joint2-joint4-joint5?

Yes, just use list syntax to specify the overall order
