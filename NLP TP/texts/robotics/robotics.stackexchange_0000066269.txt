Q:

Cannot find controller

Hi,
I am having trouble simulating the shadow robot in the gazebo simulator.
I receive the following error:
[ERROR] [1425897239.729246960, 50.527000000]: Could not load controller 'r_arm_joint_trajectory_controller' because controller type 'robot_mechanism_controllers/JointSplineTrajectoryController' does not exist.

The controller r_arm_joint_trajectory_controler is defined in:
part of file: arm_controller.yaml
r_arm_cartesian_pose_controller:
  type: robot_mechanism_controllers/CartesianPoseController
  root_name: shadowarm_base
  tip_name: palm
  fb_trans:
    p: 20.0
    i: 0.5
    d: 0.0
    i_clamp: 1.0
  fb_rot:
    p: 0.5
    i: 0.1
    d: 0.0
    i_clamp: 0.2

r_arm_joint_trajectory_controller:
  type: robot_mechanism_controllers/JointSplineTrajectoryController
  joints:
    - ShoulderJRotate
    - ShoulderJSwing
    - ElbowJSwing
    - ElbowJRotate
    - WRJ2
    - WRJ1
  gains:
    ShoulderJRotate: {p: 140.0, d: 30.0}
    ShoulderJSwing: {p: 140.0, d: 30.0}
    ElbowJSwing: {p: 140.0, d: 30.0}
    ElbowJRotate: {p: 140.0, d: 30.0}
    WRJ2: {p: 140.0, d: 30.0}
    WRJ1: {p: 140.0, d: 30.0}

I have package ros-indigo-robot-mechanism-controllers installed. I am running ros indigo on ubuntu 14.04.2.

Dear Nikitas,
This controller is unfortunately deprecated and we haven't had time to update to the new Joint Trajectory Action Controller yet. I reported the issue here. Pull requests are always appreciated :).
It is still possible to use the simulated arm and hand using direct position targets through the relevant topics as is.
Cheers,
Ugo
