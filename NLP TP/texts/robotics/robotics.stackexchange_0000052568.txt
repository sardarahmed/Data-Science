Q:

Cannot launch node of type [joint_state_publisher/joint_state_publisher]

I have the latest beta version of hydro installed on Ubuntu 13.04 and encountered this error when going through the urdf_tutorials:
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [joint_state_publisher/joint_state_publisher]: can't locate node [joint_state_publisher] in package [joint_state_publisher]

I have installed joint_state_publisher, and checked again:
$ rosdep install joint_state_publisher
#All required rosdeps installed successfully

$ rosrun joint_state_publisher joint_state_publisher
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named joint_state_publisher below /opt/ros/hydro/share/joint_state_publisher
[rosrun] Found the following, but they're either not files,
[rosrun] or not executable:
[rosrun]   /opt/ros/hydro/share/joint_state_publisher

There is a folder in share for joint_state_publisher, but no executable code:
$ ls /opt/ros/hydro/share/joint_state_publisher/
cmake  package.xml

There is nothing in lib or include
$ ls /opt/ros/hydro/lib | grep joint_state_publisher
$ ls /opt/ros/hydro/include/ | grep joint_state_publisher

I'm not sure if this is where I should be publishing problems with pre-releases, so please direct me to the correct forum.

A:

This is a good place to report Hydro problems.
It's possible that joint_state_publisher was converted to catkin, but is not installing its files correctly.
