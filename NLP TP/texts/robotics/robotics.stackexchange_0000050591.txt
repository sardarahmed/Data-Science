Q:

Problem connecting RGBDSLAM + RViz

Hello, I'm having problems connecting RGBDSLAM + Rviz in ubuntu 12.04. The main problem is that I don't have the topic needed to visualize the map that I'm creating with RGBDSLAM, it is supposed that I need:
/rgbdslam/transformed_slowdown_cloud
and
/rgbdslam/batch_clouds
and my topics about RGBDSLAM are the following:
/rgbdslam/aggregate_clouds
/rgbdslam/batch_clouds
/rgbdslam/correspondence_marker
/rgbdslam/parameter_descriptions
/rgbdslam/parameter_updates
/rgbdslam/pose_graph_markers
I don't have the "transformed_slowdown_cloud" in my topics, how could I create it? Have I to send a command in RGBDSLAM to create the topic?
Otherwise, I also noticed that adding a "pointcloud2" display, in the topics only appears 2 topics referring to RGBDSLAM: /rgbdslam/aggregate_clouds and /rgbdslam/batch_clouds. Is that ok? Should I see the rest of the topics?
Thanx in advance for your help!

Why do you need the topic "/rgbdslam/transformed_slowdown_cloud"? I removed it some time ago.

I needed it because I was following a tutorial about how to use Rviz with RGBDSLAM and it says I need that topic in order to see the world created with RGBDSLAM in RViz:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni/Contests/ROS%203D/RGBD-6D-SLAM
what topic can I use to see the world of RGBDSLAM in RViz? Thx

I see...well I finally done it and now it is working! Thanx a lot!

A:

That is really old. You could use the batch_clouds topic and set the "decay time" high. I hope you use the version from ros.org/wiki/rgbdslam, not the one from the url you stated. The contest version is two years old.
