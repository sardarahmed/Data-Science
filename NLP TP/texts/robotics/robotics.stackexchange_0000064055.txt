Q:

When using rqt with Qt5, does not find  in ROS internal "plugin_bridge.h"

I am trying to build the C++ example from the RQT tutorial, with a CMakeList and structure taken from rqt_image_view. I use Qt5 on Ubuntu with Cmake 2.8.12.2
When I run catkin_make everything in my project seems to run fine, but then it throws the following error.
In file included from /opt/ros/indigo/include/qt_gui_cpp/plugin.h:36:0,
             from /opt/ros/indigo/include/rqt_gui_cpp/plugin.h:36,
             from my_catkin_ws/net_viz/include/net_viz/test.h:5
             from my_catkin_ws/net_viz/src/net_viz/test.cpp:1
/opt/ros/indigo/include/qt_gui_cpp/plugin_bridge.h:36:19: fatal error: QObject: No such file or directory
#include <QObject>
                  ^

It seems like it does not include Qt5 when linking with ros internal headers. Here is a gist of my CMakeLists.txt

This is a tarball of the full package.

I don't know how to fix this, I thought about including qt5 explicitly, but it does get found right? And I also would not know where I can include it with the plugin_bridge.h

A:

rqt currently only supports Qt 4.x.
