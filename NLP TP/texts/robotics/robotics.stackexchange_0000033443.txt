Q:

gmapping not updating map

So I am attempting to use gmapping to build a map using SLAM.  As far as I can tell I am passing it all the required transformations (odom->link and laser->link).  Also my laser scan looks correct when I display it in rviz as well as my robot odometry.  When I start up gmapping, rviz will display a map from the first scan.  As I move my robot around the  gmapping appears to be registering the new scans and it will update the position of my robot in the map which leads me to believe that gmapping is actually doing something useful.  However, no matter how much I drive the robot around the map will never update.  So all I get is whatever is seen in the first scan and none of the new scans are added to the map.  Is there some step I am missing in order to update the map?
I have three programs running:
1.) Gets laser scan data and publishes it as a sensor_msgs/LaserScan message
2.) Handles teleop of a pioneer robot and publishes odometry tf as well as the laser->link tf
3.) gmapping using default values.
Thanks.
