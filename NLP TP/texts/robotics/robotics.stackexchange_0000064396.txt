hey everybody:
I want to build a node to use keyboard or ps3 handshacker to control my turtlebot ( useing C++ or python )means use this node to send twist message to cmd_vel , cuz i think there must be someone done this thing already , so I'd like to ask if someone has code? and could you pass it to me ?

@Ahyan i just use the turtlesim_teleop node in  ROS WIKI tutorials ,and modify the "turtle vel/cmd" to "vel cmd" in its code , then it work well   - -|||

A:

There is already a teleop package for the turtlebot called turtlebot_teleop. You can use the tutorials to use the keyboard to teleoperate your turtlebot. Also there are tutorials for using joysticks, ps3 joystics and xbox360 game controller to teleop your robot.
To use the keyboard, open a new terminal and type
roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch 

The launch file is easy to understand.
