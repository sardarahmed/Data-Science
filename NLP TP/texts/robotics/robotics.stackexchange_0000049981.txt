Q:

Bumblebee pointclouds (.yaml) calibration files

Hi guys,
I am currently using the Bumblebee2 to extract pointclouds with the stereo_image_proc node on ROS. The problem is that i get very bad results on the disparity image, most of it is grey, even after playing with some parameters like the speckle filter...I used the calibration files (.yaml) that i could have with the stereo calibration node and as a consequence i get bad pointclouds. I would like to know if anyone succeded in having good pointclouds from the bumblebee2 using the calibration (.yaml) files and if it is possible to use the calibration files given by pointgrey or to publish directly the rectified images through ROS using triclops.
Thank you for your help

A:

In our lab we successfully calibrated two different kinds of Bumblebee2 stereo cameras (2.5 and 3.8 mm focal length) with the ROS stereo calibration tool. We used the -k 6 option to allow for more parameters in the distortion model.
We run the camera1394stereo driver for the camera and stereo_image_proc to generate rectified images and point clouds.
Regarding the parameters for stereo_image_proc we followed this tutorial. We had to increase the disparity_range to 128. The point clouds look quite nice (see the video on the viso2_ros wiki page).
Hope that helps!

Thank you very much Stephan, i will try this tomorrow and tell you about the results.
Ps : Your pointcloud is very good !
