Q:

p2os gazebo simulation example stopped working on electric

Hi,
I am trying to setup Pioneer 3dx simulation in gazeebo in electric. Following is the shell output:
nitin@nitin-desktop:/opt/ros/electric/stacks/p2os/p2os_urdf/launch$ roslaunch pioneer3dx.gazebo.launch 
... logging to /home/nitin/.ros/log/960257d8-6ea9-11e1-9c88-3cd92b6407b7/roslaunch-nitin-desktop-10724.log
Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.
Press Ctrl-C to interrupt
Done checking log file disk usage. Usage is <1GB.
