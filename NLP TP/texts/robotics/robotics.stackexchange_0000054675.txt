Q:

Unused argument problem when launching /etc/ros/openni_head.launch on PR2 Hydro

When I tried to launch the OpenNI Kinect driver on PR2, I do:
roslaunch /etc/ros/openni_head.launch

And then I got the following error message:
unused args [name] for include of [/opt/ros/hydro/share/openni_launch/launch/includes/manager.launch]

Nothing was started.
Here is the openni_head.launch file. I think that the problem is from line 47~50:
  <include file="$(find openni_launch)/launch/includes/manager.launch">
    <arg name="name" value="$(arg manager)" />
    <arg name="debug" value="$(arg debug)" />
  </include>

After I omitted the line "", I get another error:
[FATAL] [WallTime: 1381238959.313747] manager.launch has moved to rgbd_launch! Replace "$(find openni_launch)/launch/includes/manager.launch" with "$(find rgbd_launch)/launch/includes/manager.launch.xml". This notice will be removed in ROS Indigo

Initiating shutdown!
================================================================================

Then I followed the instruction and replace "$(find openni_launch)/launch/includes/manager.launch" with "$(find rgbd_launch)/launch/includes/manager.launch.xml".
Here's another error I got:
included file [/opt/ros/hydro/share/rgbd_launch/launch/includes/manager.launch.xml] requires the 'name' arg to be set

Okay...let's add it back again. And then I got another error:
included file [/opt/ros/hydro/share/rgbd_launch/launch/includes/manager.launch.xml] requires the 'num_worker_threads' arg to be set

Well...can anyone provide a workable launch file for running Kinect driver?
My PR2 is running on ROS Hydro. Thanks for any help~

Is there a reason you are not using "openni_launch openni.launch" similar to here: https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot/blob/hydro-devel/turtlebot_bringup/launch/3dsensor.launch

Good idea! I just tested the openni.launch in openni_launch package. There are some transform errors such that the PointCloud data can't be transformed to the base_link. After checking the doc website, I'll try to set some of the parameters to make the transform work. Thanks~

A:

Thanks to @jdorich. I've modified the launch file based on openni.launch in openni_launch package so that it can run on PR2 Hydro correctly.
In case that someone got the same problem, here is the file.
