Q:

how to use cereal_port in ros

Hello
I use "sudo apt-get ros-electric-serial-communication" to install serial-communication in my computer. And I use the example code
#include <ros/ros.h>
#include <cereal_port/CerealPort.h>

  ....

But the code can't be compiled, the error is: cereal_port/CerealPort.h:no such file or directory.
Can anyone help me with my problem? Thank you.

A:

The error is to be fixed in your CMakeLists.txt file and manifest.xml.
As the Page here says: http://ros.org/wiki/cereal_port
"make sure you have the serial_communication stack installed and don't forget to add cereal_port as a dependency on your package"
So install ros-fuerte-serial-communication unless you already have, then add
<depend package="cereal_port" />

to your manifest.xml. That should do the trick.
