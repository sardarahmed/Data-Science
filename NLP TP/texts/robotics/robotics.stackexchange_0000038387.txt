Q:

how to use the remapping syntax

From some of the other question I realized it is possible to remap the namespace of node on the command  line using rosrun. But it is not working for me..
The syntax i tried is ,
rosrun somepkg somenode:="new_namespace/somenode.py"

and many other variations of it.
Could someone please tell me what is the correct way to remap a node to another name space on the command line while using rosrun?

A:

You can only use remapping arguments (the := syntax) for parameters and topics. If you want to push a node into a namespace on the command-line, you would do it like so:
$ ROS_NAMESPACE=new_namespace rosrun somepkg somenode

This will force somenode to be in the new_namespace namespace.
