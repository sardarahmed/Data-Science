Q:

Moveit - fix a link with a virtual joint

Hi,
I am working on a robot-arm and I want to fix a link from my robot to the world.
I want to use the virtual joint option (and set a fixed joint) on the Moveit Setup wizard but afterwards, when I launch the demo.launch file and visualize my robot, the joint isnt working. It seems it is not taken into account at all,
I set the parent frame as ¨world¨ during the setup. Am I wrong?
Thanks,

A:

When you were working on the setup assistant, did you give the joint type as fixed?
If you give the joint as fixed, there will not be any visualization.

Sorry, I am confused as to what you mean by this.  If you do not set the virtual joint as fixed, what should it be set at?
I am working with a custom manipulator and can't figure out how to fix it to the gazebo world.  I have tried both the  gazebo tag, as well as fixing a dummy joint to the world via virtual joint, but no luck!
