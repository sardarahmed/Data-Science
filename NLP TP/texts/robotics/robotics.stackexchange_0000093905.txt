Q:

rviz zooming center

I am running a ROS project, publising topics, and viewing in rviz. But I can't seem to figure out how to make the zooming center coincide with the camera of the robot. That is, I would like to put myself into the robot's camera frame and view the pointcloud plot as the robot is moving.
The plot seems to rotate around this yellow point when I use left click on rviz. Using middle click doesn't seem to move or translate the plot as I expect. Using right click also zooms in and out from this yellow point.
Could you please point me out what is this yellow point? If this is the zooming center, how can I make this coincide with the robot's camera frame?

@gvdhoorn, Thanks for that. I found that using Shift + Left click seems to work fine, but I do not know why middle click doesn't work.

A:

It is called Focal Point, which can be set on the panel on the right side of rviz.
