Q:

Arduino sensor data recombined and published on master computer

I having trouble publishing LaserScan data directly from an Arduinio Mega 2560, is there an example where data is published to the Master in a simpler format and then recombined on the master into the standard Laserscan message type and republished?

Here is an example used for a Imu message. Not sure it will help you though.
