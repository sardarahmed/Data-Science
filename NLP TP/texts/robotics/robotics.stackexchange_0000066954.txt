Q:

Adding laser sensors to Gazebo

Greetings,
I have tried to add laser node to gazebo using the following code:
    <!-- BASE LASER ATTACHMENT -->
    <erratic_hokuyo_laser parent="base_link">
            <origin xyz="0.18 0 0.11" rpy="0 0 0" />
    </erratic_hokuyo_laser>

but I got the following error:
Invalid  tag: Cannot load command parameter [robot_description]: command [/opt/ros/indigo/share/xacro/xacro.py /home/nouf/catkin_ws/src/chapter5_tutorials/urdf/robot1_base_03.xacro] returned with code [1].
Param xml is 
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file
I found out that the erratic_description package doesn't work with indigo version (which I'm currently using).
Is there another package or another way to add a laser node to Gazebo ?
Thanks in advance.

A:

May be this gazebo tutorials will help I guess . There they mentions about adding lasers in URDf model.
<gazebo reference="your_link_name">
<plugin name="your_link_laser_controller" filename="libgazebo_ros_laser.so">
... plugin parameters ...
</plugin>
</gazebo>
