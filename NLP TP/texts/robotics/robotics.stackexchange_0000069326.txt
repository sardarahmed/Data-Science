A:

Are you using amcl or gmmaping??
To see something chose, base_footprint on fixed frame of global options, to see the robot.
If you using  amcl or gmmaping  you must had map on fixed frame.

what robot are you using? try to do the tutorials of turtlebot (but in gazebo, that is a simulator), I learn a lot about navigation (moving robot, planning a path) doing that tutorials.

instead of using the turtlebot_bringup packages use turtlebot_gazebo to launch the robot on simulator gazebo (ros already come with gazebo).
The mobile base of turtlebot is the kobuki base. Study how turtlebot and kobuki work, and you learn a lot.
