Q:

pelican model in gazebo

I'm trying out Gazebo to (maybe) build a quadrotor simulator and started with the pelican urdf model in the asctec_drivers stack. I manage to spawn the pelican.xml file in gazebo, but no model of the actual quadrotor is shown. Has anyone succesfully used this model in Gazebo already? If so, could you explain me how to use it?

A:

The pelican.xml file is not configured properly to launch in Gazebo. I've managed a quick fix that you can use. You must add  and  tags to the xml file so that Gazebo can provide the correct physics to the model. I've also added  tags to specify physics parameters and colors. I've included an example from my modified file. You can further modify it to improve upon it later, particularly the model dynamics and physics. I hope that this helps.
