As the Installation tutorial points out, there is a link with more information about this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu

OK! it works!
thanks a lot!

A:

I think the repository configuration has no need to change in the default settings, so you can start from tutorial 1.2 "Setting your sources.list".
If you have problems like, the package is not found, you should configure it as Javier points out.
