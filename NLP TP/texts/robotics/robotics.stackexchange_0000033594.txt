Q:

Visualization of odometry msgs

Hi,
my question is related to the code of odometry msgs at
http://www.ros.org/wiki/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup/Odom
How can I visualize a series of odometry msgs in rviz. How do I have to configure rviz to get a sequence of arrows illustrating path and velocity? If I start the small example together with rviz (fixed frame = /base_link) I see with target frame =  one stationary arrow?
Best wishes

A:

Try setting your fixed frame to /odom or /map (if you have a map).  In my setup, you won't see any movement of the arrow when the fixed frame is set to /base_link.  I've attached a snapshot from RViz after rotating the robot through 360 degrees.  Note that this is using the latest Diamondback debian packages.  The latest Electric seems to have a bug wherein the arrow points straight down instead of horizontally.

It does seem to be a bug.  I reported it here (https://code.ros.org/trac/ros-pkg/ticket/5120) and it has been confirmed by one other person (joq).

I am using elctric and I see the odometry arrow pointing straight down. It is really a bug or do I write wrong code ?
