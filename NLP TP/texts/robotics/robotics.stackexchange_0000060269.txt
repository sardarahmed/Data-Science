Q:

hHow to connect ROS Hydro Medusa with Gazebo 3.0 on Ubuntu 12.04?

I am beginner to ROS and gazebo and I have been  trying to connect my gazebo 3.0 to ROS Hydro, both of them have been installed on ubuntu 12.04. I tried to follow the instruction on the gazebo website, but it always says you have broken package or something similar to that. Thank you.

A:

Gazebo 3.0 is much newer and is not tested against ROS Hydro. Gazebo 1.9 is tested against Hydro according to http://gazebosim.org/#status
if you want to make this happen you will need to compile most things from source and it will be a lot of work to get things to work. And as this is not a supported combination expect to do most of the work yourself.
