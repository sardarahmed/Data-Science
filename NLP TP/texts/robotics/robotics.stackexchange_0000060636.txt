Q:

Manually modified node graph visualization?

Hello,
I am new to ROS and I would like to know whether it is possible to get the graph visualization of ROS nodes like in rqt_graph in a file format which can be further modified manually (nodes rearranged, etc.) and printed properly?
Thank you very much

EDIT: I simply want a graph file of my current running nodes in order to print the visualization on paper in a proper format. For that, I need some graph description file where i can visually move nodes in order to fit them on a A4-paper. (It also makes sense for documenting the "stack". I cannot influence the layout in rqt_graph.)
I do not want to change my actual running nodes/topics. It just would be nice to get a file describing the nodes-graph which can be postprocessed.

A:

rqt_graph has a button (in the upper right corner) to save to a file (specifically, a DOT graph file). The dot file is a text file that you can open with any editor and modify as you wish, then run through dot (part of graphviz software) to put it another format.
