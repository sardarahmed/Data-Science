Q:

Hello Every body ,
I am new in Ros and Python
I would like to use joint_angles  topic to control only on joint of NAO lets say HeadYaw
Id it possible to let me know the procedure?
I was running the following command but it does not work :
rostopic  pub   /joint_angles    nao_msgs/JointAnglesWithSpeed   '{seq: 1, stamp: now, frame_id: Head}'  '['[HeadYaw,HeadPitch]',[1,-1],2.0,0]'

Could you change the title to something more descriptive? Eg. 'Sending messages to nao_controller from rostopic_pub'. It'll make it easier for future users to find your question :)

A:

There are two issues with your command:

On ROS groovy the line is not being accepted, if you flatten your arrays and add -- for the negative numbers it works
The relative speed must be a value between 0 and 1

So if you type something like this...
rostopic pub /joint_angles nao_msgs/JointAnglesWithSpeed -- '[ 1, now, Head]' '[HeadYaw,HeadPitch]' '[1,-1]'  1.0  0

... it should work (at least on groovy with nao_controller up and running)
