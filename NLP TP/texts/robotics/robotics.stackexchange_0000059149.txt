Q:

turtlebot navigation hydro drifting orentation

Hi I am currenting trying the autonomous navigation tutorial for turtlebot. I am having issue having it move to my goal location. While observing rviz, the turtlebot seems to have issue localizing itself properly. Even when the robot its at rest, rivz show that the turtlebot's orientation is slowly turning. Anyone have any ideas what might be causing this ?
Thanks

I am not sure.The drifting issue seem to have disappeared though after loading another map though.

A:

Kobuki gyro is factory calibrated, so no need to re-calibrate again. The problem you report is a particularity of the installed gyro that hapen rarely. It's fixed on firmware version 1.1.4, so check your robot firmware version

And update it if it's older. Here's the how to.

We observed the same problem. As a quick fix: Shutting down the drivers and turning the robot off and on solved that. (So, yes, we tried turning it off and on again!)

Clearly is the gyro. Update the firmware will solve it so you don't need to switch off/on nevermore.

Thanks, we'll do that. I can confirm that it was the gyro. We've seen it directly in the diagnostics.

hi sorry for the late response. That seems to be the source of the problem, have updated the robot. Thanks
