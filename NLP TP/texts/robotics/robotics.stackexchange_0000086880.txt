Q:

Visual Odometry with Realsense Camera

I am trying to implement a visual odometry package with my Intel Realsense camera. Is there a way to implement stereo visual odometry with this camera since the depth is calculated with infrared sensors? I am using viso2_ros package and the realsense package.

A:

There are two very mature packages I'm aware of that implement both visual odometry and SLAM using depth cameras such as the realsense. Rtabmap and rgbdslam, both of these work with the 3D information that is produced by the realsense.
You don't need to perform your own stereopsis calculations with the Realsense, they calculate depth themselves in a different way.
