Q:

Moderating ROS-Users

Has there been any thought put into moderating ROS-Users such that emails that would get the reply "Try ROS Answers" don't have to go to everyone?

A:

It has not been discussed.  The volume is much lower than previously encountered.  And the effort required to moderate a list is significant.  Until we get a significant demand for it we probably won't change the way the list operates.
