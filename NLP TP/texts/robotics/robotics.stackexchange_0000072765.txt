Q:

Motion and Measurement Models for Turtlebot 2

Hi,
I am looking for the motion and measurement probabilistic models for the Turtlebot 2. I cannot seem to find anything online about them. I'd like to implement a basic EKF using the Turtlebot 2 so I would need these models in order to get started on that project. Where would I find these models or is there a reasonable way (not needing to know the Kobuki and Xtion internal code) to find the models myself?
