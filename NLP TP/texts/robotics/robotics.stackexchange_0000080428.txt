Q:

Where does RTABMAP_Cloud save the Downloaded map and graph from RVIZ?

Hi,
I used rtabmap on my turtlebot with RVIZ. From the left panel when I Download Map or Graph it does the downloads, but I cannot figure out to which path has the map and graph been downloaded to. I have checked rtabmap.db and it shows that it was updated 3 days ago even though I did the "Download" today.
Can someone point out where the map and graph from the RTABMAP is saved to when done through RVIZ?

Where in rViz are you selecting "Download Map or Graph"? Which launch files are you using? The rtabmap.db file will be from the date when you last put data into the mapping system.

A:

Hi, as Goeff pointed out, the data are stored in ~/.ros/rtabmap.db by default. When clicking on Download Map or Graph under rtabmap_ros/MapCloud rviz plugin, the map is download in RVIZ to be visualized. Data is not saved somewhere. If you want to save the 3D point cloud to a file (PCD, PLY), the easiest and most flexible way is to open the database with rtabmap standalone application, then do File->Export 3D clouds...
$ rtabmap ~/.ros/rtabmap.db

See Export cloud section on this page for more info.
cheers
