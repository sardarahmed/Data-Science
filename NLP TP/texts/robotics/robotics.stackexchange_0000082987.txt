Can you post the log file it refers to. it should be located in the .ros/logs folder in your home directory

Also, can you describe your setup more? What stereo camera are you using? Can you get the stereo camera to just publish images correctly? If you are using a rosbag, can you get that to play through the images correctly on its own?

Is it this tutorial?

hello matlabbe
yes that is!

A:

The rgbd argument error is a bug in the released launch files for Indigo (this is fixed in recent versions). I updated the launch file of the tutorial to be compatible with current Indigo release.
You may have better results with Kinetic/Lunar versions though, here is an example of results:

cheers,

Do you mean the 3D map viewport? You can zoom in/out with the mouse wheel.
