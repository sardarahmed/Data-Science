Q:

Copying files in devel folder - CMakeLists.txt

Hi
My application requires a configuration file and a resource folder placed in the same directory as the executable. Those are located at : ~/workspace/src/project/cfg/. I want to copy this file and this directory at ~/workspace/devel/lib/project/, where my executable is located.
What can I add to my CMakeLists.txt to achieve that? I have tried using ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_BIN_DESTINATION}, but it creates a lib subdirectory in build.
Thank you

A:

The CATKIN_PACKAGE_BIN_DESTINATION variable only contains a relative path. You need to additionally use CATKIN_DEVEL_PREFIX. So combined you want to install to:
"${CATKIN_DEVEL_PREFIX}/${CATKIN_PACKAGE_BIN_DESTINATION}`

which will be:
<develspace>/lib/${PROJECT_NAME}

I get something weird with  "${CATKIN_DEVEL_PREFIX}/${CATKIN_PACKAGE_BIN_DESTINATION}"
I am getting this:
/.private//lib/
I really would like to get:
/.private//lib/
