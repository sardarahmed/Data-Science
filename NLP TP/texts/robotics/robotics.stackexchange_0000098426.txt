Q:

How to create catkin_ws?

I installed ROS using conda environment. How can I find main directory of ROS? I used command "roscd", but I got following result:  C:\Users\Name\Anaconda3\envs\gz-postinstall\Library> Here "gz-postinstall" is environment created for gazebo installation, which I plan to use with ROS. My question is How to create catkin_ws and where?
OS Windows 10 x64
ROS noetic

A:

I did not know much about anaconda environment. But you should be able to create a ROS workspace anywhere except restricted files that are block by the system.
