Q:

Autoware : Unable to complete the demo

Hello.

Autoware version : 1.12.0
ROS Version : Melodic
Autoware installed from Docker
Docker version 19.03.2, build 6a30dfc

I am trying to run the demo of autoware  here : https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.ai/autoware/wikis/ROSBAG-Demo
But I am experiencing a lot of problems.
First of all, I download the files, create a .autoware in my personal home and extract the files there.
I start autoware by running the run.sh file, I am now connected with the autoware user 'in' the docker container.
But then the first instruction is to move to the directory autoware.ai which doesn't exist !
The right folder seems to be

/home/autoware/Autoware

Then I source the setup.bash file.
I start the runtime manager with

roslaunch runtime_manager runtime_manager.launch

Then I move to the simulation tab and try to load the bag file from ~/.autoware but the folder doesn't contain my files...
I am truly lost, and I can't see what I did wrong. Thanks for the help !

[Edit] I made it working by using ~/Autoware instead of ~/autoware.ai (In the docker machine)
Then I copied the ~/.autoware from the host to the docker machine and It's fine.
Do you think I did something wrong or the documentation maybe deserves a pull request ?

A:

It does look like the demo instructions need some updating. I will put that on my list and report back when they are updated. We are in the middle of the 1.13.0 release process right now so it may take a little while.
