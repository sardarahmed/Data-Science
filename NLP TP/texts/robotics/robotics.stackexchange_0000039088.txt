Q:

Topic that publishes Current Pose of TurtleBot

Is there a topic that publishes the current pose of the turtlebot?
robot_pose_ekf/odom doesn't give the pose relative to the global frame.
amcl_pose doesn't give the pose when the robot is stationary.
What should I do to get the robot pose when the robot is stationary? Should I get the value from robot_pose_ekf/odom and then use the transform from /odom to /map as given by the /tf topic???

A:

It would help us if you could also identify the goal of seeing this information. If you're trying to see this information in a terminal, you can use:
rosrun tf view_frames /map /odom

or
rosrun tf view_frames /map /base_link

If you're trying to do this in code, you can perform this lookup in code as well.
  // Look up transform between base link and the map frame.
  tf::StampedTransform xform;
  try
  {
    // The waypoint frame is the source frame
    tf_.lookupTransform("/map", "/base_link", ros::Time(0), xform);
  }
  catch (tf::TransformException ex)
  {
    ROS_ERROR("%s", ex.what());
  }
