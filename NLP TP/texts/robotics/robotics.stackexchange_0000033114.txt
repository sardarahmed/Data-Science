Q:

Slam gmapping tutorial troubleshooting

Hello, I'm following the map-building tutorial at http://www.ros.org/wiki/slam_gmapping/Tutorials/MappingFromLoggedData and I can get all the way through step 2 (hurray). Then when I enter:
 $ rosbag play aptLaserData.bag

which is the second part 1 of step 2, I get the error:
[ INFO] [1311128237.384522694]: Opening aptLaserData.bag

[FATAL] [1311128237.388682646]: Time is out of dual 32-bit range

My .bag file is indeed named aptLaserData.bag, but could you tell me what's causing the problem?
Thanks,
Khiya

Hi Brian, thanks for your patience! Please see my comment on Tim's post, below, for access to my aptLaserData.bag file.

PS, could this problem have to do with the fact that I'm using a virtual machine running Ubuntu 10.10 from a 32-bit Windows machine running Vista?

Brian, I can't find a way to upload a .bag file onto ROS answers. Unless you know of a better way to put my data online, I'm going to upload it to the repository for one of my other projects and make it available there.

Another user reported the same problem, using the bag supplied with the tutorial: http://answers.ros.org/question/248/slam_gmapping-mappingfromloggeddata-out-of-dual-32.  I wasn't able to reproduce it.  Can you post your bag somewhere that we can try playing it back?
