Q:

How to manage multiple projects in single wrokspace?

Hello,
How to manage multiple projects in a single catkin workspace?? Like if I have a project named project_1 then some packages in it and then another project named project_2 then some packages in it. Like tree given below.
catkin_ws/
  src/
    CMakeLists.txt
    project_1
      package_1/
        CMakeLists.txt
        package.xml
        ...
      package_n/
        CMakeLists.txt
        package.xml
    project_2
      package_1/
        CMakeLists.txt
        package.xml
        ...
      package_n/
        CMakeLists.txt
        package.xml
  build/
  devel/
  logs/

If we can make a structure like this, then how to build this?

A:

I like to use catkin tools to manage multiple packages in one workspace. To install catkin tools run, sudo apt-get install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-catkin python-catkin-tools
Quick example is, you can build specific package in your catkin_ws using catkin build <package-name> and you can clean the workspace with catkin clean to clean the workspace before building other package. It doesn't matter in which sub folder the package is inside the src/. You can also use Tab key for auto-completion of package name.
You can refer this for more information.

I also use catkin tools to manage multiple packages in my workspace. But my situation was like I have some packages in src/ folder, then build them after that I tried to put them in a subfolder inside the src/. That's an error right. So I got it like make a subfolder inside src/, and then create package inside that subfolder, after then build.
So thanks.

You can not have same package name twice in one workspace. You can create another workspace if you are doing this to keep backup of the code.

Yes, you are right.
