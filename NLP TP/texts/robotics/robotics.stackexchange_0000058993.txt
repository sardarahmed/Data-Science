Is there any dynamixel pro ROS code?

A:

Brian Axelrod wrote a dynamixel pro driver and controller. It isn't documented on the ROS wiki, but it is available on his github account, and it should be released into hydro as ros-hydro-dynamixel-pro-driver and ros-hydro-dynamixel-pro-controller.
I haven't used these drivers personally, so I can't help you use them, and I'm not sure how well they work.

Is there any explanation ffor the pro like the dynamixel installation posted in ROS at http://wiki.ros.org/dynamixel_motor? With that information, I can install and run it.
Thanks.

Has it worked for anyone yet? And does ROS Indigo also support these packages?
