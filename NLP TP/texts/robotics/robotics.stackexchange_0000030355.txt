Q:

Package/stack collisions in ROS Wiki index

I opted to use avr_bridge on one of the projects that I am working on, and choose to use it as a git submodule.
This essentially creates a second (sub) git repository nested inside of the first (main) repository.
A nasty side effect of this is that the wiki now believes that avr_bridge is part of my project.  If you visit the wiki page for avr_bridge, you will notice that it seems to be part of the au_automow_drivers stack, which is obviously incorrect.
First, is there any way to fix this?  And second, what can I do to prevent this from happening again?

A:

The indexer has to do "first one wins" as it's not possible to determine which is the authoritative source of a package.  One of the reasons we encourage external stack releases now is to more cleanly separate contributed software from development trees.
To deal with this, I have moved automow down in the index.

Does this hold true with "stackless" packages?  avr_bridge exists outside of a stack, so I'm not entirely sure how to fit it into my ROS setup.

I'll update my repositories to reflect that suggestion, thanks.

As convenient as submodule is, like svn externals it only works with the same VCS.  We recommend using rosinstall and setting up a standard rosinstall file to use for your project.  This will allow you to pull in any repo conveniently, without affecting others who want to checkout your versioned code.
