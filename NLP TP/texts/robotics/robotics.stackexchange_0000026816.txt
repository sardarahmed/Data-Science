Q:

Attach spotlights to robot links in Gazebo 1.9 + ROS Hydro?

Is it possible to do anything like attach a light to robot and then have it move around with the robot?
<gazebo reference="chassis">
  <light type="spot" name="front_spot">
    <pose>1 0 0 0 0 0</pose>
    <diffuse>0 1 0 1</diffuse>
    <attenuation>
      <range>10</range>
      <constant>0.2</constant>
      <linear>0.01</linear>
    </attenuation>
    <direction>1 0 0</direction>
  </light>
</gazebo>

(this is what I tried adding to my ros urdf file but I get this error I believe when the conversion to sdf is happening:
Error [parser.cc:697] XML Element[light], child of element[link] not defined in SDF. Ignoring.[link]

Update - one thing I've tried is use a texture projector, with a spotlight that fades from white to 100% transparent at the edges.  This doesn't work because the projected texture looks to be purely additive, it'll produce a spot but not reveal the texture in the model it is being projected on.
