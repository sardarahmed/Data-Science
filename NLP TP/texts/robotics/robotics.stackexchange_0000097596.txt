Q:

Unable to build turtlebot3 package from source using catkin build

I am currently running ROS-melodic on Ubuntu 18.04.
I cloned the repository (using the git clone command) from source to /home/catkin_ws/src directory. Then, from inside the catkin_ws directory, I ran the command catkin build turtlebot3.
This is the link to the error message.
This is the link to  build.cmake.001.log at home/skpro19/catkin_ws/logs/turtlebot3_bringup/build.cmake.001.log as mentioned in the above error message.
I understand that it has got something to do with the CMakeLists.txt file of some package. But I am not exactly able to figure out what it is?  I am not exactly clear about what CMakeLists.txt does in the first place.
