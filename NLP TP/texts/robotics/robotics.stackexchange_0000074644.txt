A:

Having experienced with both gazebo and v-rep for a small amount of time, I think that gazebo is by far the better choice in terms of ease of use, ros integration capabilities and documentation. v-rep has a vast variety of ready to use robots and has more options than gazebo (at least gazebo 5 that I have used) when it comes to simulations but apart from that integrating with ros is not considered to be a trivial task.
