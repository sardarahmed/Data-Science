Q:

rosinstall hack to use http:// instead of git://

I am currently connected to my institute's network, which is causing git clone to fail. But rosinstall tries to get packages with only git clone git://
Where should i change the default protocol to http:// instead of git://
Also, when i tried changing .rosisntall file for configuring it to use http instead of git, it over wrote the thing.

A:

Download the rosinstall file:
wget http://ros.org/rosinstalls/fuerte-ros-full.rosinstall
then replace all instances of "git://" with "https://" (http may work also), but do not replace the lines that say "- git".
Then when you go to install, use the local file:
rosinstall --catkin ~/ros-underlay ./fuerte-ros-full.rosinstall
This is how I have to install also
