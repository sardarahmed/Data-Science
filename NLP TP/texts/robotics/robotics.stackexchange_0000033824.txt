Q:

Indexer Schedule

How often does the repository indexer run? In other words, after a repository is added to the indexer, how long does it usually take for the <> information to be filled?

A:

Generally, repository maintainers should not expect index updates more than once a day.  We regularly prioritize other jobs over the indexer, and the indexer may take anywhere between 5-8 hours depending on how sourceforge and other sites are doing.
