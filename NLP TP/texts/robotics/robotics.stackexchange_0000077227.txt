Q:

E: Unable to locate package ros-diamondback-nxtall - installing on ubuntu 16.04 possible?

I am attempting to install ROS for NXT Diamondback on my Ubuntu 16.04. Is this even possible?
I am going through the following steps:
http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/NXT/diamondback
However, I encounter the following issues:
daniel@beepboop:~/Downloads$ sudo restart udev
restart: Unable to connect to Upstart: Failed to connect to socket /com/ubuntu/upstart: Connection refused

when I get to that stage. I rebooted my computer instead.
For step 1.4, I did the following instead:
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu xenial main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'

which appeared to work.
When I get to step 1.6, apt-get cannot find the package:
daniel@beepboop:~/Downloads$ sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-nxtall
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree

E: Unable to locate package ros-diamondback-nxtall

Do I have any options here other than installing another version of ROS?

No, unfortunately not (at least not the 'vanilla' version of the NXT packages).

When I get to step 1.6, apt-get cannot find the package:

daniel@beepboop:~/Downloads$ sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-nxtall

which makes sense, as only ROS Kinetic is supported on Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial).
The NXT stacks are rather old, and I remember various people making various efforts to port them to newer versions of ROS. Some related links:

Anyway to install ROS-NXT on Trusty?
Version of Ubuntu and ROS for NXT and Turtlebot2

There appear to be various forks of the original NXT packages on Github, perhaps some of those work on newer ROS versions. I have no personal experience with any of those, so you'll have to test them out.
