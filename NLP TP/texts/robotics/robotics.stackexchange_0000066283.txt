Q:

simple FIFO stack (queue) for MoveIt in ROS

Hi,
I want to use a simple queue (FIFO stack) to give a list of waypoints to MoveIt. I looked at the tutorial : Callbacks_and_Spinning and the class CallbackQueue but it looks like we can use it only with Publisher/Subscriber.
Is there any existing simple queue or must I create it from array?
Thanks

A:

You'd better use
std::queue
http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/queue/queue/
or
std::list
http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/list/list/
with push_front() and pop_back()
The problem with std::vector in this use case is that it will have to relocate your entire data every time you call  insert( name_vector.begin(),element)  in order for keeping its memory layout. This might be computationally expensive! For std::vector you can only efficiently insert / remove objects at the end of the vector.
