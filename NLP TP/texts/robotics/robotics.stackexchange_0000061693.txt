Q:

Communication between robots in gazebo

Hello,
I'm looking for a tool to establish a communication link between 2 or more robots in the Gazebo Simulator. I was thinking in a wireless module but I don't find anything like that.
Any help will be appreciated.
Thanks

Interesting question.  I think I'm interested in the answer too.

A:

Assuming that all the robots are using ROS Topics, they can communicate with each other through Topics that you set up in your onboard robot software.
