Thank you for your reply.
I resolve the problem by executing the following command.
mkdir -p ~/tmp
cd ~/tmp
wget http://files.djduff.net/Download/DepthSense/DepthSenseSDK-1.9.0-5-amd64-deb.run
chmod u+x DepthSenseSDK-1.9.0-5-amd64-deb.run
sudo ./DepthSenseSDK-1.9.0-5-amd64-deb.run # accept agreement

After that I can access the path /opt/softkinetic/DepthSenseSDK.

I deleted that file which I just put to share for a project - I don't think the creator would be happy with my hosting it. But there are versions of the SDK floating around online still.
