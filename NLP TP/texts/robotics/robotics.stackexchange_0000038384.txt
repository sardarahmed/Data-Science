Q:

Adding NaoQI API to PYTHONPATH (v1.12)

Hello, I am trying to set up ROS on my Nao robot.  I keep getting the error: "Please make sure that Aldebaran's NaoQI API is in your PYTHONPATH."  I found the answer below:
http://answers.ros.org/question/28814/adding-naoqi-to-the-pythonpath
and executed
PYTHONPATH=/my/path/to/naoqi-sdk-1.12-linux32/lib:${PYTHONPATH} ,
with "/my/path/to" being the path to the SDK in my system, but the error did not go away.  I am using naoqi-sdk-1.12-linux32, so is the path different for this newer version?

A:

Put this
export AL_DIR=/home/naokinect/nao1.12/naoqi-sdk-1.12-linux32
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$AL_DIR/lib
export PYTHONPATH=$AL_DIR/lib:$PYTHONPATH

into your bashrc. Path to the lib may differ to your path. Works for me.

Using NaoQI 1.12.3 this seems to be fixed and the Python API only needs to be in the PYTHONPATH, no more need for LD_LIBRARY_PATH
