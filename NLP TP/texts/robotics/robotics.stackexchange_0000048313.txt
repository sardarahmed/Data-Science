Q:

Package nao_remote depends on non-existent package move_base_msgs

Hello,
I'm currently using ROS to remotely control a NAO robot. This is done with the nao_robot and nao_common stacks.
Suddenly I could not run the pose_manager.py in nao_common/nao_remote/scripts. It simply fails saying

rospkg.common.ResourceNotFound: move_base_msgs

I ran this a couple of days ago without problems.
To solve my problem I tried to run

rosmake nao_remote

which fails saying

[rosbuild] Building package nao_remote

Failed to invoke /opt/ros/fuerte/bin/rospack deps-manifests nao_remote

[rospack] Error: package/stack nao_remote depends on non-existent package move_base_msgs

Any suggestions?
Thanks,
Isak

A:

I'm not aware of any recent changes in nao_remote. Did you change anything in your ROS installation, removing packages from your installation or your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH?
By checking the nao_remote wiki page, you will see that it depends on move_base_msgs which is in the navigation stack. Thus, you will need to install it with sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-navigation, just like any stack containing packages that are a prerequisite for nao_remote.

This did the trick! I did not change anything in my installation on purpose so I still find it a bit weird. Thanks anyway!

You probably did not need the move_base_msgs if you only used a few nodes from nao_remote that's why it did not become apparent before. It could be that rospkg or rospack (in rosmake) now simply check the dependencies more strictly.
