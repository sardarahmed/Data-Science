Q:

I have followed the steps for turtlebot create base, but still it is showing failed to connect to /dev/kobuki?

I use ROS indigo, I have followed the following steps for create base in turtlebot

export TURTLEBOT_BASE=create
export TURTLEBOT_STACKS=circles
export TURTLEBOT_3D_SENSOR=kinect

But still whenever I enter the roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch
it shows the error
"Failed to open port /dev/kobuki.  Please make sure the Create cable is plugged into the computer.
"
Please help

A:

Looks like there was an update in the turtlebot code: https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot/pull/112/files
Try setting TURTLEBOT_SERIAL_PORT to the device your create is listening to (probably /dev/ttyUSB0). I updated the hydro wiki page to reflect this.

The problem still persists with no change. is this specific to turtlebot in ros indigo ?

Hydro and indigo should be the same in this regard. Next step would be to check that there isn't a bug in the python create driver code. Add some printf's to make sure this parameter is getting through.
