Q:

Time taken by 'rosmake roboearth'

There were few issues during 'rosmake roboearth' for perception_pcl (ROS: Fuerte) due to which it failed earlier. I installed the patch and followed the workaround as suggested here:
http://answers.ros.org/question/64501/pcl-error-in-ros-fuerte/
And then issued 'rosmake roboearth' command but it's been making for the past 3 hours without prompting for any errors. What could be the issue ? Any suggestions please ?

A:

The process was waiting for failures in dependent packages to be rectified. Installed updated version of PCL and tried rosmake. It worked.
