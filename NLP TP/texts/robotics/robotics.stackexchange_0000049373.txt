Q:

robot_pose_ekf timing error

I am getting the error:
ERROR: filter time older than vo message buffer

when I run only the Kinect through openni_launch -> fovis -> robot_pose_ekf
I am aware that this issue is caused by "two sensor inputs have timestamps that are not synchronized" as referenced by
http://ros.org/wiki/robot_pose_ekf/Troubleshooting
My questions are:
1.) I am only using the vo message topic from fovis. Are the errors possibly because the depth and rgb cameras are out of sync?
2.) How can I correct this issue? I am aware of approximate and exact time message filters and fovis implements both.

Is everything running on the same machine? 1) seems very unlikely as both message should have been produced by the same driver.

yes, everything is running from the same machine.  I'm only feeding it Kinect data.

A:

Do you have another topic going into robot_pose_ekf?  (such as /odom?)  It requires at least two topics in order to function.  Otherwise, there's no need to filter only one topic.  :)
