Q:

OSX Fuerte rosdep install -a fails on pcl

I followed the Homebew OSX instruction till the rosdep install -a line.  Everything worked pretty well and many of the rosdep packages are successful.  But when it gets to pcl, it all fails and I can't figure out how to get around the errors.  This is the output:
executing command [brew install ros/fuerte/pcl]
==> Installing pcl dependency: catkin
Unsatisfied dependency: EmPy
Homebrew does not provide Python dependencies; install with:
easy_install EmPy
==> Cloning git://github.com/wg-debs/catkin.git
Updating /Library/Caches/Homebrew/catkin--git
fatal: remote error:
Repository not found.
Error: Failure while executing: git fetch -q origin
ERROR: the following rosdeps failed to install
homebrew: command [brew install ros/fuerte/pcl] failed
Even after I install EmPy using pip or easy_install, brew install catkin still fails to find that dependency.
And I have no idea why the git repo of catkin is failing.
Any help would be awesome.

I can comment out the offending EmPy dependency, but catkin still fails on the git fetch.  Not sure what to do about that.  I had similar problems in Electric with certain rviz dependencies not installing due to missing repos or similar.  I was hoping rviz new Qt dependency would help.

A:

So, this is a bit tricky, because EmPy is what the name of library is in pip, but when you use it in python you have to import em.  This makes trouble when defining it as a dependency in Homebrew.
There is a way around this, but it hasn't found its way into the repo yet.  One way around it is to edit /usr/local/Library/Taps/ros-fuerte/catkin.rb and comment out the line depends_on 'EmPy' => :python.  Then catkin should install.  You are likely to run into more problems though, as this is still sort of experimental.
Sorry I don't have a better answer, all I can say is that we are working on it as we find time.  If you are looking to get work done, I recommend Electric for the time being.  If you are just interested in Fuerte then we always appreciate some help.
