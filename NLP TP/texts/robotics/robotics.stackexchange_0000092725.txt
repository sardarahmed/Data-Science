Q:

pcd file failed

I have been trying to use Autoware to map a large area ( bag file of 5.3 GB). After the mapping has been done, i output the pcd map according to https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware/issues/1207?source=post_page---------------------------
After i output the map, when i tried using the .pcd file in the map tab, on the console it said "failed "Path_to_pcd_file"" and only map a part of the map that were supposed to be created. Has anybody had this problem before and if so how do i fix it?
I suspect that it is because the output map is quite large (253.MB), as i was trying to map with smaller maps before and autoware worked fine.
Thanks in advance

Update:
For the pcd file, you can find it here
I am using:

autoware 1.10.0
Ubuntu 16.04

I installed ros from source, following the instruction in this link and i am not using docker.

Would you please share a screenshot of the console showing the error?
And if possible, please share your .pcd file.

We also need to know which version of Autoware you are using, what version of Ubuntu, how you installed ROS (source or from apt), and whether or not you are using Docker.

Hi,
Thank you all for answering to my question. I am very new to this so excuse me for the newbie's mistake
For the pcd file, you can find it on https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mZaWlnoxCkZJBvKCnlMGvePOl3nCk2YU/view?usp=drivesdk

Unfortunately, i am not with my laptop at the moment and can not provide the console of the error.
I really do appreciate if anybody has any advices.

@hoang khac I've edited your question to include the information from your comment so that it's easier to find

A:

Thank you for sharing PCD.
It seems that the number of point clouds written in the header of the file is different.
Please open autowre-190725.pcd with an editor and rewrite WIDTH and POINTS from 35006911 to 8080162.
