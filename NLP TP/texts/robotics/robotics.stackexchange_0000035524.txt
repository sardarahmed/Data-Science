Q:

When should I send geometric information over a topic as opposed to TF?

Please help in writing up a ROS best practice.

A:

Some cases when tf is less suitable:

The coordinate frames naturally form a graph rather than a tree (e.g., a slam graph).
There is frequent reparenting of frames (e.g., a robot which is localized w.r.t. a changing local frame rather than a global one)
The transformations include additional information such as uncertainty estimates not present in the TF message type.
For efficiency, in situations where there are a large number of frames, most of which are only of interest to a few subscribers.
