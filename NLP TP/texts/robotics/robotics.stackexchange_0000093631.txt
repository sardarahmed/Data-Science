Q:

Is it possible to filter rostopic echo by node?

Lets suppose that node A and B are publishing to a topic T, is it possible to use rostopic echo to show only what node B is publishing?

Same trouble here t-t

A:

No, I don't believe that is currently supported (as of Kinetic/Melodic).
rostopic echo does support a --filter expression:
  --filter=FILTER-EXPRESSION
                        Python expression to filter messages that are printed.
                        Expression can use Python builtins as well as m (the
                        message) and topic (the topic name).

However I don't believe that has access to message metadata (as opposed to the message data itself) which is what you would need.
