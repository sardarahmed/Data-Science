Q:

Self Driving Robotics Project : ROS or Python

So, I am working on building a simple self driving tank (small) that needs to navigate a large hall.  I plan to use ultrasonics, LIDAR and a Kinect.  I am pretty happy with how I will build all of this.  My main question is would this be easier to do in ROS or write it in Python.  I have very basic knowledge of ROS but have been programming for many years (Java, Objective C etc).
I assume I will need to load in a basic map of static objects / floor plan.  Use SLAM etc (which I see is possible in Python).
Sorry if this is a vague question. My hoping is someone on here who has used ROS a lot will turn round and say its the way to go

A:

You can use both! ROS nodes can be written in python.
I'm doing a similar project and the reusability of ros code is a nice thing to have in mind. ROS also have many things already implemented (even that you want to build everything from scratch).
The message types of ROS will also provide an easier to integrate application, for future projects and expansions.
my advice is to use ROS AND Python
