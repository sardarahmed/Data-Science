Q:

stereo_image_proc error in hydro - error while loading shared libraries: libimage_proc.so

Hi, I'm using DRCSim on hydro and when roslaunching atlas.launch this error appears:
    opt/ros/hydro/lib/stereo_image_proc/stereo_image_proc: error while loading shared libraries: libimage_proc.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Did you build the image_proc package?
Comment by gustavo.velascoh on 2013-08-03:
No, I installed from apt-get

A:

Please try to install "ros-hydro-image-proc".
If that helps it looks like a missing run dependency in stereo_image_proc. I have filled a ticket for that: https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/39
