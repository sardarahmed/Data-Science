Q:

Can't subscribe and check the content on micro-ROS

I'm trying to set up micro-ROS on Ubuntu 22.04 following the steps on this website, and connect ESP32 to ROS2.
However, though the connection is established (Step8 on this website), it can't subscribe and check the content.
(When executing the command ros2 topic list, I can't see an additional topic /freertos_int32_publisher.)
Is there any solution?

A:

I solved it myself.
The reason why it couldn't subscribe and check the content was that ROS_DOMAIN_ID was set.
After I set ROS_DOMAIN_ID back to 0, it become able to subscribe and check the content. If you're faced with the same problem, please refer to this.
