Q:

move_group with 2DOF workpiece positioner and 6DOF robot

Hello all,
I am programming cell with 2DOF workpiece positioner and 6DOF robot in MoveIt! How many move_groups is better to do for synchro motions? One general move_group with 8 joints? Or may be two move_groups: 2DOF and 6DOF? Or may be move_group with two subgroups?
Something like that:

A:

I believe you mean to ask about "planning groups". The term "move group" is quite overloaded within MoveIt! and move_group usually refers to the ROS node.
You probably want to have two separate planning groups to be able to plan with just one of the two joint sets.
To actuate the whole set together, just create another group with the two "basic" groups as subgroups.
