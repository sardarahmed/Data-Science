Q:

How to set Z axis in RVIZ?

Hi all. I'm using a drone and to be display in RVIZ, I need to have a Z axis to see the height of the drone to ground.
However, my RVIZ got only the X and Y axis. Only views in 2D. My robot's frame does not go up or down, only can navigate around the 2D plane. Anyway I can set?
Thanks!

A:

Sounds like RVIZ view is set to TopDownOrtho. You want to change it to Orbit.
First make sure that the panel "Views" is visible. Next to "File" is menu called "Panels". Click "Panels" and click "Views" so that it has a check mark next to it.
Next on the view panel there is a drop down box labelled "Type:". Change it to "Orbit (rviz)".
