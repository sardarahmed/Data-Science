Q:

ROS2 message filters

I'm trying to figure out how to use message filters in ROS2 galactic in python. From this example https://github.com/ros2/message_filters/blob/rolling/test/test_approxsync.py I see that
import message_filters

should work, but I'm getting a error:
ModuleNotFoundError: No Module name 'message_filters'

Is there a ROS2 package I'm missing? Is there a different way I should be importing and using message filters in ROS2?

A:

I realized I was not using the correct path for sourcing setup.bash
