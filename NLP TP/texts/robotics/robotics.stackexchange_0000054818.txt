Q:

Problems installing Hydro

Trying to install Hydro i get the following problems.  When i try to install one by one and go deeper i find out that libpcl-1.7 has problems how can i solve this?
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 ros-hydro-desktop-full : Depends: ros-hydro-desktop but it is not going to be installed
                          Depends: ros-hydro-mobile but it is not going to be installed
                          Depends: ros-hydro-perception but it is not going to be installed
                          Depends: ros-hydro-simulators but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

I have fuerte working and i need it so i cant uninstall it, any ideas will be welcomed ;)
PD: Im installing hydro only to use the pcl-1.7 so if there is another way to use it and not install hydro that would work to

The error suggests that you have packages being 'held' by apt.  Try searching that error.
I found several potential solutions
