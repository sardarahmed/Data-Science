Q:

Problem including nav_msgs/msg/odometry

Hi everyone,
when using the message type nav_msgs/msg/odometry (https://docs.ros2.org/foxy/api/nav_msgs/msg/Odometry.html) I tried o include it using this piece of code:
#include <nav_msgs/msg/odometry.h>

In the CMakeList.txt I added find_package(nav_msgs REQUIRED) and in the package.xml I added <depend>nav_msgs</depend> so this should cause no problems. Even the command ros2 interface show nav_msgs/msg/Odometry
returnes the expected output.
When building the package in the same prompt it says fatal error: nav_msgs/msg/odometry.h: No such file or directory
Can anyone help me with this?
Regards s0nc

A:

The correct file to include is nav_msgs/msg/odometry.hpp.
