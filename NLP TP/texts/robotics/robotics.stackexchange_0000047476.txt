Q:

Does Turtlebot supported on groovy?

Hi.
I just finished installing ros-groovy on my Ubuntu.
Does Turtlebot supported in ros-groovy?
I found that no "ros-groovy-turtlebot-desktop" exist while I following tutorial below.

Btw, please use tags as much as possible! It makes it easier for others to find questions and answers about topics they are interested and/or skilled in. I added the turtlebot and groovy tag for you.

A:

Hi! Are you using Turtlebot 1 or 2? Groovy support for the T1 (Create and Roomba) is currently worked on. T2 (Kobuki) should already be running. We are targeting support of both with the 2.0 release. Please be patient - or even better - help the TurtleBot community and join the development! :-)
