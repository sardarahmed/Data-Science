Hi..got the answer from http://answers.ros.org/question/52811/unable-to-run-cameracalibratorpy/?comment=62676#comment-62676 by mhariharasudan
search for appoxsync in your camera_calibration package. Then place it in the same folder as your source file. Replace the line "from camera_calibration.approxsync" with "from approxsync" and this should work.
This worked like a magic.
