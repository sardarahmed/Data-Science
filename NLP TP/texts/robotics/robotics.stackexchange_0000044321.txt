Q:

About hokuyo_node's Transform

I can't find where the frame name is defined.
I launched hokuyo_node and rviz.
Floor Scan(Laser scan) data was visualized when Fixed Frame is set to "/laser".
Where the frame name "/laser" is defined ?
I checked through source codes in hokuyo_node package,
however I couldn't find where it is.
Thanks in advance.
