Q:

"save as" feature not saving light info into world file

I added a custom Point Light on Gazebo GUI and save it via save as but the resulted sdf file only contain sun with default setting. I can't either seem to save the default sun with modification. Is saving light info not possible yet?
Gazebo 2.2.3 on Ubuntu Trusty 64b
Thanks.

I am also running into same problem. Anyone know answer to this? None of the three light sources save. It might be because they are not technically 'models'?

It seems that this issue has been solved from Gazebo 4.0. I just tried it out on 4.0.2: added some lights with the GUI, changed their colours and poses, and saved the world. When I loaded the world everything was alright.

Do you know if its a seemless upgrade from gazebo 2.2 --> 4.x when involving ros plugins?

Here is our changelog and migration guide.

This is fixed in gazebo 4.0.0 (see this issue for details).
See this tutorial for info on using gazebo4 with ROS.
