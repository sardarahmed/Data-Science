This looks like you edited files in /usr/include, which you should never need to do!
Anyway, either you didn't install ros or you didn't specify to the compiler where to find it. There is no way to help you without more details about what you did.
However, since it looks like you don't know what you are doing in general (I am sorry if I am wrong here), I would recommend to have a look into basic tutorials for programming c++ with ros.
