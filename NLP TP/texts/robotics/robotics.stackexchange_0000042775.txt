Q:

rosbag file cannot be made // .bag.active

Hello, guys!
When I was using the rosbag tool to record the real data for our robot, I used the command :
rosbag record -a
when the whole mission was accomplished, there was no .bag file made in that folder. Instead, there was a .bag.active file was made in that folder. However, when I want to replay the data, the "rosbag play " command cannot read the .bag.active file, which made it impossible to analysis the data. I cannot find a proper answer from the pages, so I hope you guys can help me.
THX

The .bag.active file is big, about 3.5GB each round. I started the rosbag at the very beginning. @ Lorenz

And how did you stop it? Just by pressing Ctrl-C and waiting or by killing it (e.g. Ctrl-, or closing the window)?

I have the same issue. The mistake committed was that I closed the bag file using Ctrl+Z, instead of closing the bag file using Ctrl+C.

A:

I guess the rosbag process didn't shut down cleanly at the end. After recording, it might need to write an index so it must shut down cleanly.
How did you start rosbag? If you were using roslaunch and the bag file is big, it might happen that roslaunch kills rosbag after 10 seconds.
