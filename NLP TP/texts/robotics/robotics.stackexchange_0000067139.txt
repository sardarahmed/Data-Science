Q:

Error for running rosbridge_websocket.launch

Hi,
I compiled the rosbridge_suite package (develop branch). When I want to run roslaunch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket.launch, I encounter with the following error:
 File "/home/users/al/catkin_ws/src/rosbridge_suite/rosbridge_server/scripts/rosbridge_websocket", line 37, in <module>
    from rosauth.srv import Authentication
ImportError: No module named rosauth.srv
process[rosapi-3]: started with pid [23225]
[rosbridge_websocket-2] process has died [pid 23222, exit code 1, cmd /home/users/al/catkin_ws/src/rosbridge_suite/rosbridge_server/scripts/rosbridge_websocket __name:=rosbridge_websocket __log:=/home/users/al/.ros/log/d36deb7c-e84b-11e4-b7bd-001aa0cf0b47/rosbridge_websocket-2.log].
log file: /home/users/al/.ros/log/d36deb7c-e84b-11e4-b7bd-001aa0cf0b47/rosbridge_websocket-2*.log

Please let me know how to solve it.
Best

sudo apt install ros-kinetic-rosauth

Did you make sure to download and compile rosauth and all of rosbridge_server's other dependencies?
