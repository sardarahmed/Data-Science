Q:

After updating Gazebo to 1.3 under Groovy I get an Ogre Plugin error

Hi,
I am using ROS Groovy and I updated Gazebo to 1.3 (binary version), under Ubuntu 12.04.
For testing it I got a simple empty.world:
<?xml version ='1.0'?>
<sdf version ='1.3'>
  <world name='default'>
    <include>
      <uri>model://ground_plane</uri>
    </include>

    <include>
      <uri>model://sun</uri>
    </include>

  </world>
</sdf>

After I source:
/opt/ros/groovy/stacks/simulator_gazebo/gazebo/gazebo/share/gazebo-1.3/setup.sh
/opt/ros/groovy/stacks/simulator_gazebo/gazebo/setup.bash
and run gzserver:
rosrun gazebo gzserver ~/../worlds/empty.world
I got the following error msg:
Error [RenderEngine.cc:374] Unable to load Ogre Plugin[/opt/ros/groovy/stacks/visualization_common/ogre/ogre/lib/OGRE/RenderSystem_GL]. Rendering will not be possible.Make sure you have installed OGRE and Gazebo properly.
Error [Rendering.cc:37] Failed to load the Rendering engine subsystem
unable to find OpenGL rendering system. OGRE is probably installed incorrectly. Double check the OGRE cmake output, and make sure OpenGL is enabled.

Did something happen to the OpenGL libraries during the update, or is this a bug?
Thanks,
Andrei

A:

Solution: in  /opt/ros/groovy/stacks/simulator_gazebo/gazeb/setup.bash
 I had to change the OGRE_RESOURCE_PATH to:
 export OGRE_RESOURCE_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/OGRE-1.7.4

UPDATE: according to @Ryan:
on Ubuntu 11.10, change OGRE_RESOURCE_PATH to /usr/lib/OGRE in both
/opt/ros/groovy/stacks/simulator_gazebo/gazebo/setup.bash

and
/opt/ros/groovy/stacks/simulator_gazebo/gazebo/scripts/setup.sh
