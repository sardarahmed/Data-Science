Q:

Wheels look sliding instead of rotating

Hello,
I added a polaris ranger model and set the joint velocities, the car moves but the wheels look sliding instead of rotating. I'm a bit confused and I want to understand how the stuff work ?
Thanks!

Please check that you are using revolute joint not revolute2.

@skhan I checked the sdf file and the joint is of type revolute not revolute2.
My intuition says if we rotate a joint, the links attached to it will also rotate (and do so the visuals of the link, hence the link will look rotating, which is not the case here). This is confusig.

A:

This is fixed in gazebo 1.6. A pending pull-request for an updated polaris model will finalize the sliding wheels problem.
