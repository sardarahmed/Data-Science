Q:

joint_state_publisher zeros param

Hi all,
I have to set a default value in my launch file containing a joint_state_publisher. I saw in the documentation that there is a parameter "zeros" to do it but I can not figure how to use it. If I have two joints named "joint0" and "joint1" and my default value is 0.7 for both, how have I to write the launch file?
Thanks

If someone can point to me an example launch file I will check it, thanks.

A:

Specify the zeros dictionary at the root namespace, (I don't know why joint_state_publisher does not use the node's private one, but that's how it is). In yaml syntax, this should be (untested):
zeros:
  foo_joint: 1.0
  bar_joint: -1.0

If it doesn't work, ask the source.
