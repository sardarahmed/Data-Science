Q:

cMake Error and failed to invoke

while i was doing rosmake i got errors.
After running "rosmake roomba_500driver_meiji " i got errors below.
    mkdir -p bin
  cd build && cmake -Wdev -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/opt/ros/indigo/share/ros/core/rosbuild/rostoolchain.cmake  ..
  [rosbuild] Building package roomba_500driver_meiji

  [rospack] Error: package 'roomba_500driver_meiji' depends on non-existent package 'geometry_msgs' and rosdep claims that it is not a system dependency. Check the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH or try calling 'rosdep update'

    Aborting.  Please fix the broken dependency!

here is ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
/home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/src:/home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/src/ros_comm/rosbag:/opt/ros/indigo/share:/opt/ros/indigo/stacks

i also get this error by running rosdep keys geometry_msgs
    ERROR: Rosdep cannot find all required resources to answer your query
Missing resource geometry_msgs
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/indigo/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/src
ROS path [2]=/home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/src/ros_comm/rosbag
ROS path [3]=/opt/ros/indigo/share
ROS path [4]=/opt/ros/indigo/stacks

i thought these errors were coused by lack of ROS path but im not sure.
by the way the folder "geometry_msgs" is located at /home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/src/genmsg/test/files/geometry_msgs/msg
im using Raspberry pi, os is Jessie and i installed indigo.

You use rosbuild in Indigo? Is that even supported any more? Why not catkin_make?
Comment by Fredylucas on 2015-11-26:
I'm not sure, but I understand rosmake is a tool for compiling a single package, not all the packages in the workspace as when using catkin_make, and it also works in ROS Indigo.

A:

In the error message, it says geometry_msgs package is missing, are you sure you have this package? it says this missing package is necessary for compiling the roomba_500driver_meiji package.
