Q:

How to install joy package

I am new to ROS, forgive me if the question relates to fundamental knowledge I am not aware.
What I am trying to do is using joy stick to control A.R. drone 2.0 by ROS in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
I am following the instruction here:
http://robohub.org/up-and-flying-with-the-ar-drone-and-ros-getting-started/
$ sudo rosdep init
$ rosdep update
$ sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-joystick-drivers
$ rosdep install joy

I got stuck at $ sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-joystick-drivers. it gives error:
E: Unable to locate package ros-fuerte-joystick-drivers
Since I installed ROS indigo, so I changed it to $ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-joystick-drivers, it runs ok. However it stuck at the next command: $ rosdep install joy, it gives error:
ERROR: Rosdep cannot find all required resources to answer your query
Missing resource joy
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/jade/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/opt/ros/jade/share
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/jade/stacksenter code here

I runs:
     $rospack find joy
     [rospack] Error: package 'joy' not found

Somehow 'joy' package is not installed. How can I install joy package?
Thanks,
Haifei

A:

Unfortunately this robohub article is quite outdated. ROS Fuerte (and two next versions after it: Groovy and Hydro) are all end-of-lifed. It is also not possible to install ROS Fuerte on Ubuntu 14.04 AFIK. One of my colleagues is working on shipping a sample joystick teleop launch file with ardrone_autonomy. I will update this answer when those changes are tested and merged. The code form the robohub article uses rosbuild (the legacy ROS buildtool) which is not supported in ROS Indigo (Please check the comment by @gvdhoorn) . In order to use that code, someone needs to convert the build system to catkin.
To install joystick drivers and joy package on ROS Indigo you can run sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-joy ros-indigo-joystick-drivers in command line.
PS. Please check this documentation for installation instructions of ardrone_autonomy on ROS Indigo.

Just to clarify: you can still use rosbuild under Indigo (and even Jade). It's just that there are some restrictions when interacting with catkin workspaces, and you cannot release rosbuild packages anymore.
