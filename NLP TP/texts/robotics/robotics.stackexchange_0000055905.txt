Q:

Actionlib SimpleActionClient Connecting to SimpleActionServer

I am trying to implement a SimpleActionServer and SimpleActionClient, but the client seems to be getting hung up on the "wait_for_server" command.  Both the client and server just sit there producing no messages.
Just so I can get the basic concept down, how exactly do the server and client components get connected?  What class members enable a connection to get established between them?

A:

I think it is only the name of the action and the type of the action, the client and server get templated to.
