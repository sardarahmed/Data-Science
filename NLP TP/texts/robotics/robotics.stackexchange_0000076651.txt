Q:

How to use two VLP16 with just one computer at a same time

Hey,
I have two VPL16 velodyne laser scanners and I connected using a switch to my computer.
I fixed first VPL 16's IP to 192.168.1.201 and second VPL's IP to 192.168.1.202 using Web GUI
and then I ran the velodyne package; roslaunch velodyne_pointcloud VLP16_points2_2.launch
here is the code of VLP16_points2_2.launch
<arg name="device_ip" default="192.168.1.201" />

<arg name="model" value="VLP16"/>

<arg name="device_ip" value="$(arg device_ip)" />

<arg name="pcap" value="$(arg pcap)"/>

<arg name="calibration" value="$(arg calibration)"/>

<arg name="min_range" value="$(arg min_range)"/>

<arg name="max_range" value="$(arg max_range)"/>

<arg name="model" value="VLP16"/>

<arg name="device_ip" value="$(arg device_ip)" />

<arg name="pcap" value="$(arg pcap)"/>

<arg name="calibration" value="$(arg calibration)"/>

<arg name="min_range" value="$(arg min_range)"/>

<arg name="max_range" value="$(arg max_range)"/>

However, I just can get only one topic which has combined data of two sensors
Another topic is just empty
Is there anything that I gotta do to get both of data?
Thank you in a advance
I really appreciate your kind

A:

The older velodyne launch scripts did not handle multiple devices cleanly.
There is new code for issue #108 which should help.
