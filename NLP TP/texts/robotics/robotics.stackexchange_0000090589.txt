A:

a tilde character this character is not recognized properly and does not get converted to /home/username/.

the problem is that you're assuming this is a generic bit of functionality or behaviour ("in Linux"), but it's actually bash that substitutes /home/username for things like ~ and $HOME.
roslaunch does not do this, or at least not in the way you're currently using it.
You could consider using the env substitution arg for this specific case (with $HOME).

Thanks a lot for your answer i got that point. So here is the solution  <...args="$(env HOME)..." />

It should not be necessary to set HOME yourself.
In fact, from the documentation on env:

NOTE: Values set using the <env> tag will not be seen by $(env ...)
