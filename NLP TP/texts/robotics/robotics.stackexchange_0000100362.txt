Q:

KDL problem with cmake after complete removal

I have removed all the orocos-kdl files from ubuntu by sudo rm -rf $ (locate orocos-kdl),
then I have followed the installation instructions and installed orocos-kdl again,
and installed kdl-parser using sudo apt install ros-noetic-kdl-parser,
now I have the following error when I try to build my workspace (which includes industrial_trajectory_filters):
CMake Error at /opt/ros/noetic/share/kdl_parser/cmake/kdl_parserConfig.cmake:113 (message):
Project 'kdl_parser' specifies
'/usr/share/orocos_kdl/cmake/../../../include' as an include dir, which is
not found.  It does neither exist as an absolute directory nor in
'${{prefix}}//usr/share/orocos_kdl/cmake/../../../include'.  Check the issue
tracker 'https://github.com/ros/kdl_parser/issues' and consider creating a
ticket if the problem has not been reported yet.

why?
Doing this on a system with a package manager (I assume you're running Ubuntu, which uses apt) is a really bad idea.

@gvdhoorn indeed a bad idea, I did it because I was getting a warning while building my catkin space (KTH-RPL repo) about this library that CMake can't see it since it's hidden, so I have decided to delete everything and reinstall the library again, but instead of the gentle warning, I'm getting an error says:
CMake Error at /opt/ros/noetic/share/kdl_parser/cmake/kdl_parserConfig.cmake:113 (message):
  Project 'kdl_parser' specifies
  '/usr/share/orocos_kdl/cmake/../../../include' as an include dir, which is

A:

It's a bad idea to install the latest kdl from github source, because that is going to break your noetic packages. What you should do is 1) remove the new files you installed, 2) reinstall the development package from the ubuntu repository:
sudo apt-get install --reinstall liborocos-kdl-dev
