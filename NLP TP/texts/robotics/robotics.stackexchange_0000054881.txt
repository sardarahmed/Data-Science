Q:

Flickering laser scan data after static tf setup

My Gazebo model, written in Xacro, makes use of an Hokuyo laser scanner through the libgazebo_ros_laser.so plugin. Even though I specified a value for the frameName property, this plugin doesn't automatically publishes a transform from base_link to the frame I just specified. As the planar controller is automatically publishing the transformation of odom to base_link, I cannot understand why the laser scanner controller is not doing so.
I tried to manually specify a static transform publisher and everything seems to work, apart for the fact that when I try to visualize the scanner data in rviz, it flickers between the position it was in before I specified the transform and the one in which I transported it. They only differ a tiny little, but it is enough to notice, and I definitely don't think it is something healthy for my system.
I think it's something related to the difference in frequency between the transform publication and the laser data publication, but even setting both to 40ms nothing changes. I also cannot understand how rviz establishes how to display the laser data if I don't specify any transformation (because yes, it does).

I know this question is some month old, but I have a similar problem. I have also created an urdf model with a continuous joint and I want to rotate a link. Its working with an tf::TransformBroadcaster but like micpalmia said its flickering between its original pose and the pose set by the tf::TransformBroadcaster.
So has anybody any solution for this. It seems thats its just a little mistake we make, but I don't get it.
Best regards,
