Q:

Use pycharm for Flexbe

Hi folks,
I've followed the tutorials from http://wiki.ros.org/flexbe/Tutorials so that i could run the hello world behavior inside of the chrome app as well as running it in the console.
Then I started a console which has catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash sourced and run pycharm. I've added the folder that is created by calling rosrun flexbe_widget create_repo calibration_controller to pycharm.
But when I open the file calibration_controller_behaviors/calibration_controller_flexbe_states/src/calibration_controller_flexbe_states/example_action_state.py pycharm can't resolve the dependencies from flexbe_core import EventState, Logger or from flexbe_core.proxy import ProxyActionClient, but can resolve other ros dependencies like import rospy.
Why can't pycharm resolve flexbe imports?
I'm using Ubuntu 16.04 with ros kinetic.
Thanks,
Benny

You might want to edit this question to make it more generic to the use of PyCharm within the ROS workspace with Catkin and setup.py usage

A:

Thanks to flexbe devs on github, the following steps resolve the issue:

Open PyCharm's settings
Open your project on the left of the settings window
Open Project Structure
Select your [your_project_prefix]_flexbe_states project that is created when running rosrun flexbe_widget create_repo [your_project_prefix]
Click on Add Content Root
Select xenials_ws/src/flexbe_behavior_engine
Mark that folder as source
Mark the subdirectory flexbe_core as source
Mark the subdirectory flexbe_core/src as source
Click on OK and wait until PyCharm's triggers run and find the flexbe sources.
