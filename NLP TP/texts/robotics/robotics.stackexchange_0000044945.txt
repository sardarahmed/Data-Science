Q:

keyboard_teleop

Hola
Can someone explain me this code?:
def getKey():
tty.setraw(sys.stdin.fileno())

select.select([sys.stdin], [], [], 0)

key = sys.stdin.read(1)

termios.tcsetattr(sys.stdin, termios.TCSADRAIN, settings)

return key

A:

This isn't really ROS specific code -- basically, it is accessing the keyboard (stdin) using standard Python methods to get one keypress at a time. See http://docs.python.org/library/termios.html
