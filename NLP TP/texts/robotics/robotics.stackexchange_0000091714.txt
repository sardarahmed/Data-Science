Q:

Could not load the file sensor_msgs/JointState.h

Hi,
I have an error with the package robot_state_publisher when I'm try to catkin_make_isolated with ROS Melodic on Raspbian 9 (stretch).
Specifically, I get an error from the file robot_state_publisher/include/robot_state_publisher/joint_state_listener.h on line 43.
fatal error: sensor_msgs/JointState.h: No such file or directory
However, the dependency sensor_msgs is correctly loaded in the package.xml file and the searched file exists at the indicated path.
Could you help me ?
Best regards,
Robin Hède.

This would seem to be a cross-post of ros/robot_state_publisher#110.
Cross-posting is considered bad practice. Please try to refrain from it.

So do I understand your comment on ros/robot_state_publisher#110 correctly when I believe you had a Catkin workspace seeded with a .rosinstall file that you generated using rosinstall_generator but you specified ros_comm as the base package instead of any of the variants defined in REP-150? Then adding robot_state_publisher (again: from source) to that workspace failed to build as it could not find sensor_msgs/JointState?
If yes: did you not get CMake errors telling you that it could not find the sensor_msgs package in your workspace?

Yes, I used ROS-Comm because this variant is listed in the installation procedure.
With this package path, I did not have the robot_state_publisher dependency require to install the sick_tim package.
Then, the mistake that I made was to clone the git repository directly into the source directory (~/ros_catkin_ws/src) instead of installing it cleanly.
From now on, I install everything directly via the command rosinstall_generator robot sick_tim --rosdistro melodic --deps --tar > melodic-robot.rosinstall.
