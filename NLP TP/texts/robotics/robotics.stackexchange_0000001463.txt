Q:

Does more "Power" (W) means better motor?

If a motor has more Power (W) from another it means that it is better?

A:

The short answer is no.  The longer answer requires more information from you, regarding how the motor is to be used.
Since you have tagged your question with "quadcopter", I'm going to assume that you plan to put the motor on a UAV, in which case more power definitely does not mean "better".
More power (W) will draw more current (A) from the battery (meaning a larger battery and higher all-up-weight (AUW) of the craft).
You need to choose the correct motor and prop for your particular quadcopter frame.  There is no one-size-fits-all motor for quadcopters.  In general, you should be looking for a brushless outrunner motor with low kv, and pairing it with a slow-fly prop.
