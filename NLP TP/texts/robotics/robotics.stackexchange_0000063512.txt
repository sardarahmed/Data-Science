A:

You need to install the dependencies of the packages you cloned. You can either download the source code for those dependencies into your workspace and build them or if you are on Ubuntu you can install the dependencies from apt-get.
You can try this (on Ubuntu):
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ rosdep install --from-paths ./src --ignore-src --rosdistro indigo
$ source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
$ catkin_make

Now obviously you'll want to replace indigo with the ROS distro you are using, but the above should install all the dependencies you need.

Thx for your answering but I'm not going to replace indigo , I have already installed groovy, and i want to install the package under groovy but i failed
Comment by William on 2014-10-27:
@berry0511, you can use groovy, just replace indigo with groovy in the commands above.

Ooops I misunderstood , I have tried the method above but it doesn't work..maybe there's something I've ignored, thank you very much for your patience.
