Q:

export_csv.py script missing from install?

I'm running ros-kinetic on ubuntu xenial.
I installed the diagnostics package with apt-get and I want to use the export_csv.py script, however when I run "rosrun diagnostic_analysis export_csv.py ", I get an error saying that the "export_csv.py" file is not found. I searched for the file manually and I cannot find it anywhere in the filesystem (I was able to find the exporter.py file which is the basis for the export_csv file)
Did anyone ever encounter this problem? (or similar with other python scripts)
Is there some setting that I have to enable to receive the python scripts from a package?
Thanks in advance for the help!
Kind regards, Roel

A:

Try installing the package from source. The error you are describing seems to have been reported some time ago, and it apparently still isn't fixed.

Thanks for the quick answer.
I indeed installed it from source and that works, but I was wondering whether I had forgotten something or my installation had some problems. "Good" to hear that it is a general problem.

This is fixed in version 1.9.0 of diagnostics. I've released 1.9.0 to the build farm, and it should be available in binary form in a few weeks.
