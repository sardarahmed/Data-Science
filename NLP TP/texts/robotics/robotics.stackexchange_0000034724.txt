I am new at those calibration stuff.
I need to calibrate the accelerometer which is on imu.
Could you tell me step-by-step how to do it?

A:

It depends on the IMU that you're using. Each style of hardware has it's own calibration protocol. Often, manufacturers provide an executable file for calibrating their IMU. Sometimes, people have written their own versions. If you provide the IMU model you're using, I might be able to help you further.
