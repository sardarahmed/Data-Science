A:

In short, no. I couldn't do it.
What does the string (std_msgs/String) look like, "hello, ROS" or something else? I tried publishing via the terminal and then tried to use rqt_plot to "plot" the string and got nothing. This makes sense because plotting a string like "hello, ROS" is nonsense. I even published a number as a string and tried to plot that too and still got nothing.
Finally, when I published a std_msgs/Float32 message and tried plotting that, I succeeded.
By the way, I'm using Indigo on Ubuntu 14.04.
