Q:

Convert sensor_msgs/PointCloud2 to sensor_msgs/LaserScan

Hey,
I'd like to use the hector_slam package for mapping.
The package requires sensor_msgs/LaserScan data, while my sensor does a 3D scan, which is converted to sensor_msgs/PointCloud2 data.
As it looks, this is quite uncommon and usually people want to make 3D PCL2 scan from their 2D laser scans.
So, are there any packages which can do the conversion I seek?

A:

pointcloud_to_laserscan is probably the package you are looking for.
