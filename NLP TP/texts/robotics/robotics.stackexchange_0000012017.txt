Q:

gzclient: segmentation fault

I have archlinux indigo ros.
My probelm is that when I type in terminal:
$ gzclient
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

...  
$ roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch
    ... logging to /home/islam/.ros/log/0f56780c-18b0-11e7-966d-642737d9d3b9/roslaunch-CatchMe-11800.log

My GPU is intel HD3000 , core i5 INSPIRON N5110. I have noted that intel hd3000 works with gazebo
Thanks in advance.

A:

It seems that Gazebo 8 is based on Qt5 instead of Qt4. The dependencies should be updated and most importantly, we need to install qwt-qt5 instead of qwt, otherwise our executable is linked to both Qt4 and Qt5 which leads to segmentation fault at start.
Here is my PKGBUILD for Gazebo:
