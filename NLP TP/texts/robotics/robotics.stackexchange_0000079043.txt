A:

I think it would be rather easy to clone the PID package and replace the relevant parts of controller.cpp with whatever you need. If it works well, you could make a pull request to have it added.

Now that I look at it, the PID package has fancy features you wouldn't need. Maybe better to look at the less-popular lyap_control package. It's simpler and supports multiple inputs, multiple outputs. Again, replace everything except main() in controller.cp
