Q:

Rosbridge and roslibjs: Unable to load the manifest for package

Hello,
I'm trying the communication between javascript and Ros.
I use the example code of
"github.com/RobotWebTools/roslibjs/blob/develop/examples/simple.html "
with these changes:
var cmdVel = new ROSLIB.Topic({
    ros : ros,
    name : '/fromRos2Can',
    messageType : 'ackermann_msgs/AckermannDrive'    
  });

and
  var twist = new ROSLIB.Message({
    speed:1.0,
    acceleration:2.0,
    jerk:3.0,
    steering_angle:4.0,
    steering_angle_velocity:5.2
  });

and I receive these two error message:
[ERROR] [WallTime: 1404116229.210210] [Client 2] [id: advertise:/fromRos2Can:1] advertise: Unable to load the manifest for package ackermann_msgs. Caused by: ackermann_msgs

[ERROR] [WallTime: 1404116229.213060] [Client 2] [id: publish:/fromRos2Can:2] publish: Cannot infer topic type for topic /fromRos2Can as it is not yet advertised

My c++ program works with AckermannDrive.msg and a test with a std_msg/String works too.
Where is my mistake?
Thanks

Have you done source devel/setup.bash for you catkin_workspace in the terminal that rosbridge is running in?
What distro/ROS version are you running? Are they up to date?

A:

Yes I've done it, also because the test with the integer, instead AckermannDrive, works.
