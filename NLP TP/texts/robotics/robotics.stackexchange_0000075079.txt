Q:

Getting point cloud from turtlebot?

Hello, I am using the turtlebot simulator in gazebo and I want to get its pointcloud data and send it in real time to a mapping program (gmapping maybe?). Where can I find the pointcloud data?

A:

Run a rostopic list and see if you can see /scan topic. If you can, then that's the topic into which pointcloud data is published.
