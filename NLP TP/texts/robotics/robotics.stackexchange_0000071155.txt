Q:

Using 2D Lidar SLAM and Build Path to the controller

Hello ROS users,
I have a 2D Lidar laser scanner(Sick TiM-561) works on the ubuntu 14.04LTS with ROS jade PC, and I have a computer
which is embedded program controller for the vehicle.
Now I want to use Lidar to scan the environment and use ROS PC to build the map and then build a path to feed the embedded program controller to control the steering wheel for following the path.
So here I need to mapping and a path signal for the controller, and then the controller just follow the path to the goal place.
My case is when Lidar scans a parallel parking space and ROS PC build a map, then if I want to pull my car into that
parking space, the ROS will build a path for the controller to track it.
I saw this link but this is for the specified robot of ROS, but the robot which I want to contnot a ROS robot.  Could someone can give me some directions? Thanks in advanced.

A:

The Tim has an Ethernet Interface so you can communicate direct with the Sensor from the ROS PC.
So Ros Can Generatate the Map.
The you need a Kinematic description of you vehicle (Differentialdrive, Akermann, Mecanum, Omi...):
Asume you have an :
And now Is you Turn to Code: For the Embedded PC you write a simple Programm which sends the Encoder values and receives wheel velocities comands.
On the Ros PC you program the counterpart ROS-Node (Read Encode Write Position) and with the  Kinematic description you can Publish "Odom MSGs" and Subscribe the "cmd_val"  Topic and send the content to your Embedded PC
