Q:

Where is my ~/.bashrc file in ROS?

Hello everyone, I am wanting to work with a package called articulation_tutorials, I download but when I try to use Rosmake it appears that it a package is missing.
WARNING: The following args could not be parsed as stacks or packages: ['articulation_tutorials'] [ rosmake ] ERROR: No arguments could be parsed into valid package or stack names.

Looking more in this page I saw that I need to add into my ~/.bashrc the command
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/path/to/articulation_tutorials:${ROS_PACKAGE_PATH}
However I don't know where my ~/.bashrc file appears (and actually I also need it in order to stop writing source devel/setup.bash every time -> If you guys could tell me how I should write this and if I need to do additional steps in order to stop doing it, I would be very thankful also). Could you guys please tell me where is it?
And by the way, I haven't created any additional workspace since I just need to run a .launch demo file like this:
roslaunch webcam_demo-1cm-4x6-4x5.launch
Thanks again.

A:

 cd ~/catkin_ws
vim ~/.bashrc;

You can replace catkin_ws with your workspace. If you didn't install vim use command gedit instead

Thank you. Now could you please tell me where should I put the "source devel/setup.bash" code? I saw in the end of the file this:
source "/home/diego/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash"
I tried just source devel/setup.bash below this line and also to change this one, however I still need the source dev...

For me , I have two.
One is for set up ROS, soucre /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
Another one is set up for my workspace catkin_ws
it's like : source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
