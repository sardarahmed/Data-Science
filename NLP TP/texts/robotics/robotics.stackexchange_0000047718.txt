Q:

Adding dependencies without rosdep

I do not have root access on a system that I am trying to install ROS on.  I've had some success so far using a python virtualenv, but that has not allowed me to run rosdep.  Currently, my catkin build stops while building roslib, saying "Project 'roslib' tried to find library 'tinyxml'".  I tried installing tinyxml on my own and manually adding it to my LD_LIBRARY_PATH, but that does not seem to work.  Any tips?

A:

You need to add tinyxml to your PKG_CONFIG_PATH, because tinyxml is found using pkg-config.  You'll know that your environment is setup correctly when you can run pkg-config --libs tinyxml and get reasonable output.

I tried this, but when running the pkg-config command it tells me it can't find the library and that it is looking for a tinyxml.pc file.  When I built tinyxml it made no such file.  Any tips on that?
