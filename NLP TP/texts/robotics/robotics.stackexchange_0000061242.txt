Q:

ROS Navigation Stack, Global Planner, Waypoints

The tutorial on Global Planner says:
"The global planner is responsible for generating a high level plan for the navigation stack to follow. Given a goal that is arbitrarily far away from the robot, the global planner will create a series of waypoints for the local planner to achieve. "
How are these waypoints represented? Are they (x,y) coordinates? and How can I retrieve the waypoints when Global Planner is planning a path from the start to the goal point? Are they published on a topic?
Thanks

A:

The are x,y coordinates, generally without orientation, except the last point. The planner publishes the path as a nav_msgs::Path on the topic (global_planner_namespace)/plan
