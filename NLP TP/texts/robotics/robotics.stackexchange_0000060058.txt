Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: node not found

Dear Ros-users,
I downloaded package youbot_navigation for ros-hydro. I compiled it with catkin_make without error but when I try to run the lowpass_filter get
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [youbot_navigation_common/lowpass_filter]: can't locate node [lowpass_filter] in package [youbot_navigation_common]
even if the node is correctly compiled with catkin_make:
[ 15%] Built target lowpass_filter
the launch file is: roslaunch youbot_navigation_local move_base_local.launch
The complete output of catkin_make is:

Hi Rahndall, can you edit your post to give us the complete output of catkin_make?
And which launch command are you using?

A:

HI
try
# In your catkin workspace
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ source ./devel/setup.bash

and then run your program.
