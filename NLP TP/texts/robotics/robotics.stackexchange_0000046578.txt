Q:

Use regular ROS subscriptions on arduino (not rosserial_arduino)

Hi,
I am wondering if there is any way to use 'regular' ROS subscriptions on an arduino, rather than the 'special' rosserial_arduino ones. There are some functions on the regular subscription classes that I want to use that are not available on the arduino ones.
Thanks!

A:

No. The roscpp library does not work on the Arduino for several reasons. The Arduino is (still) a very limited platform with an Atmel 8 bit controller and no ethernet connector. rosserial is basically just some kind of proxy that sends all messages the Arduino subscribed to through a serial line using a special protocol and the other way around. That's why its interface sort of looks like roscpp, but it actually is something completely different.
