Q:

bug in launch file vision_visp stack

Hi,
I'm debugging and trying to run a launch file in vision_visp stack which is tutorial.launch
  <node pkg="visp_tracker" type="client" name="tracker_mbt_client">
    <param name="model_path" value="package://visp_tracker/models" />
    <param name="model_name" value="laas-box" />

in parameter "model_path" value is "package://something" -> what's this syntax?? I've replaced with the full path but still didn't work
I believe this is the problem, because from the output:
process[tf_localization-6]: started with pid [18717]
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'
  what():  Failed to load the model /home/airlab/SONLE/stacks/vision_visp/visp_tracker/models/laas-box/laas-box.wrl
Do you use resource_retriever syntax?
I.e. replace /my/model/path by file:///my/model/path

I've already fixed one bug in this launch file
 <node pkg="rosbag" type="rosbag" name="rosbag" args="play --clock -l
  $(find visp_tracker)/bag/tutorial-static-box.bag"/>

where type="rosbag" is not correct, there's no rosbag executable in the package but "play" => changed to:
<node pkg="rosbag" type="play" name="rosbag_routine" args=" --clock -l
      $(find visp_tracker)/bag/tutorial-static-box.bag"/>

A:

So what exactly is your question?
Changing package:// to a full path is always a bad idea. If you want roslaunch to put in the path to a package, use $(find package). URIs of the form package:// are normally resolved using resource_retriever inside the node.
If you have bug reports or patches, it's normally best to file a ticket at the package's bug tracker.

"package://something -> what's this syntax" -> I mean this question. Is this the correct syntax?? from where? resource_retriever?

I think I've just seen the syntax in resource_retriever page of ROS. Thank you!!
