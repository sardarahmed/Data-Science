Q:

How to link headerfile and sourcefile by C++

Hello,
I would like to divide programs into source files and header files in src folder.
What do I need to link the some code ? Do I need to edit CMakeLists.txt?
For example :ekf_localization
https://github.com/cra-ros-pkg/robot_localization/tree/kinetic-devel/src
There are many programs in src folder and they are capable of linking one another.
What do I need to link to some proglams such as them?
Please let me know.

A:

For source code to find header files, the CMakeLists.txt needs to be changed.
For example if your package formate is
dummy_pkg/
   src/
   include/
   CmakeLists.txt
   package.xml

Then in your CMakeLists.txt, you need to add
include_directories(
  include
)

will include header files in the include/ directory. If you are looking for headers in other ros packages then also add ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS} inside those brackets.
