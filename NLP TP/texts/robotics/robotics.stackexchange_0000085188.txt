Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: publish a path

Hello,
I want to publish a path, but with this code I can publish only one point at a time:
geometry_msgs::Point msg;
What can I do to publish the path?
This page should work, but I don't know exactly how to write the code for it.
http://docs.ros.org/api/nav_msgs/html/msg/Path.html
Can you help me out?
Thank you

A:

To fill that kind of messages, create a geometry_msgs/PoseStamped and then insert it in the vector poses in the nav_msgs/Path message.
Note that in C++, an variable length array is a std::vector.
So it should look like:
nav_msgs::Path path;

geometry_msgs::PoseStamped pose;

pose.header.stamp = ...;
pose.header.frame_id = ...;
pose.pose.position.x = ...;
[...]

path.header.stamp = ...;
path.header.frame_id = ...;
path.poses.push_back(pose);

once you publish a path, how do you make a robot follow the published path in rviz?
I am using this package to publish predefined paths
but my robot wont move along the path...

@aarontan It is a complex subject.
Maybe you can start here: http://wiki.ros.org/navigation
