Q:

Modelling of own Package dependencies in ROS environment

Hi!
suppose I have a method in path_planning package (my own package) and its output must be made available to a method that reside in another package called "Navigation package" (my own package).
How to correctly model this scenario in ROS environment using nodes, topics etc.
I am new to ROS; please help.
Many thanks.

A:

Publish the output into a message on a topic and subscribe this topic in your other package passing the message into that function.
