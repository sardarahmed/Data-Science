Q:

Release specific version of a package

I have the feeling that the wrong version of my package gets released when running bloom-release: 1.1.0-6 instead of 1.3.1., where the second number is in both the changelog.rst and the package.xml files. So, is there a way to make bloom-release use version 1.3.1? (I was assuming that it always takes the most recent version.)

Edit:
I did what William suggested. Can it be that Jenkins is having connection trouble? I got 46 messages in my email saying  this:
See <http://jenkins.ros.org/job/ros-indigo-handle-detector_sourcedeb/46/>

I suspect this is caused by having skipped a step and / or incorrect content of some of the involved files. Could you provide links to the relevant (release) repositories?
Comment by atp on 2015-06-16:
I guess that these are the relevant repositories:
https://github.com/atenpas/handle_detector/tree/indigo
https://github.com/atenpas/handle_detector-release/tree/debian/indigo/handle_detector
The changelogs, e.g., are different.

Ping @William?

A:

Based on https://github.com/atenpas/handle_detector, it looks like your default branch is master, which contains a package.xml for version 1.1.0. Looking at your release settings: https://github.com/atenpas/handle_detector-release/blob/master/tracks.yaml#L33 , you are using the "default" branch. You need to run bloom-release with the additional argument --edit. That will prompt you to update your configuration before trying to release. Then for the development branch setting you should put indigo since that is branch you'd like to release from on your upstream repository.
