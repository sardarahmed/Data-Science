Q:

Rosnode ping rosout does not work on remote machine

I have two PCs, PC1 is the robot computer, which is the master, PC2 is my workstation. Both uses ubuntu 14.4 indigo.
On PC2, I am connected to the network and able to do
rostopic list

but when I do rosnode ping rosout it gave me an error:
rosnode: node is [/rosout]
pinging /rosout with a timeout of 3.0s
ERROR: Unknown host [dhcp-59-208] for node [/rosout]

when I run rosnode info i get the following
$ rosnode info /rosout
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Node [/rosout]
Publications: 
 * /rosout_agg [rosgraph_msgs/Log]

    Subscriptions: 
     * /rosout [rosgraph_msgs/Log]
    
Services: 
 * /rosout/set_logger_level
 * /rosout/get_loggers

contacting node http://dhcp-59-208:47096/ ...
ERROR: Communication with node[http://dhcp-59-208:47096/] failed!

So on my PC2 I have the following environments:
ROS_IP=192.168.1.100
ROS_HOSTNAME=192.168.1.100
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.1.11:11311

PC1:
ROS_IP=192.168.1.100
ROS_HOSTNAME=192.168.100
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311

192.168.100 is my wlan0 ip address, which is the network that pc1 and pc2 are on.
I also found someone who had the same exact issue (https://answers.ros.org/question/225097/rosnode-ping-rosout-does-not-work-on-remote-machine/ ), I am not sure what OP meant by "Using ip-addresses everywhere solved it."

Can you clarify why you deleted the question?

I figured it out soon after, turns out, i needed to add the hostname and IP addressf the robot to my pc's etc/hosts file. Should I reopen it and answer it myself?

Yes, that would be nice.

i needed to add the hostname and IP addressf the robot to my pc's etc/hosts file.

As I only see IP addresses in both ROS_IP and ROS_HOSTNAME in your question text this is a really strange solution.

A:

So, I figured out my problem by having export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.1.11:11311.
Also, I added ROS_IP and ROS_HOSTNAME of my PC1 to etc/hosts file on my PC2.
It seems like once I've done this, then it can translate the unknown host to an actually ip adress.
