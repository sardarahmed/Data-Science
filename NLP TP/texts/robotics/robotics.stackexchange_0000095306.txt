Q:

Moveit_assistant just can't define a new pose?

When I use moveit_assistant to generate the configuration file, I just cant drag to define new pose ?
As the picture shown below, and I can't use the interactive marker to drag the model in rviz to set the goal eitheer?
Is there some thing wrong with my urdf file?

As the picture shown below

there is no image shown.
In fact, you couldn't attach one, as you didn't have sufficient karma.
I've rectified that, so please attach it again.

I 'm very glad to receive your answer, I've attach it.  The reason I can't move it is that I didn't know the safe controller in URDF file can cause this problem. My  URDF file is directly generate from sw2urdf. Still thanks

I was just curious whether there would already be support for that robot in ros-industrial/kuka_experimental. Seems there isn't.

A:

I see. The reason I can't move it is that
If the “soft_lower_limit” and the “soft_upper_limit” in the safety_controller are set to 0.0, your joint will be unable to move. MoveIt! relies on you to specify the correct robot model.
