Q:

CAD, Point Cloud Matching

Hi,
I have ROS fuerte on my ubuntu 11.10 O.S. .. I have created a point cloud for an object using RoboEarth detector and I want my robot " with a kinect on it " to be able to try matching this point cloud with a CAD Model of the same object or similar, which can be stored in TOD database that is uploaded on (http://www.3d-net.org)
How could I make my robot make this matching ??

A:

You can have a look at Point Cloud Librairy, which does it. Have a look at this tutorial for example.
EDIT : also this package blort_ros in ROS
Bests,
