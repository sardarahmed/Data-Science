Q:

ImportError when building ROS2 Bouncy Bolson on Ubuntu 16.04 from source

When building ROS2 BB from source I get the following ImportError:
--- stderr: uncrustify_vendor                                         
ImportError: 'from ament_package import parse_package_string' failed: cannot import name 'parse_package_string'
Make sure that you have installed 'ament_package', it is up to date and on the PYTHONPATH.

Is there missing something in the wiki.ros2.org install from source instructions? Or is this related to another problem specific to my OS setup?

A:

It looks like you are using an outdated version of the code.
There are no package in Bouncy that still uses ament_package to parse package.xml files. Now the package parsing is done using catkin_pkg. As a consequence the parse_package_string function has been removed from ament_package
Can you make sure to download the Bouncy version of the code for all repositories?
I recommend doing it in an empty workspace to make sure you don't have any legacy Ardent repositories in your workspace.
You can do so by running:
mkdir -p bouncy_ws/src
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros2/ros2/release-latest/ros2.repos
vcs import src < ros2.repos

Thx for letting me know. I have setup ROS2 Bouncy on Ubuntu 18.04 via deb packages yesterday which seems to be the best fit for playing around with both, ROS2 Bouncy and ROS1 Melodic. I will not try out the "install from source" variant again but I guess the solution would have fix the issue.
