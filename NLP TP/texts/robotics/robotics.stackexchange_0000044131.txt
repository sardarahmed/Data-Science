Q:

Will Ubuntu/ROS recognize my R/C plane simulator joystick?

I have a Phoenix aircraft simulator package which uses a USB adapter to allow my Toshiba R/C transmitter to be used as a joystick.
Will Ubuntu/ROS be able to find and use it?
Thanks,
Alan

A:

That depends on how it works on the hardware side. If it is a standard joystick device the joy package should work out of the box. You can just try it.
For more info please post some more details, e.g. the output of dmesg and lsusb after you plug the device.
