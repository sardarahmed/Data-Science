Q:

Does svn repo for 'release' tree have new auth requirement?

I'm trying to release a new version of a previously released stack. I need to change an entry in release/distros/fuerte.rosdistro and distros/groovy.rosdistro to correct a git branch specification.
I UPed the latest 'release' tree from trunk, made the changes, and tried to commit. I think this used to just work, but I haven't done it in while: svn won't let me commit:
svn commit -m "Modified groovy.rosdistro and fuerte.rosdistro to pull different branches from robhum_utils repo."
Password for 'default' GNOME keyring:
svn: Commit failed (details follow):
svn: MKACTIVITY of '/svn/release/!svn/act/bc7f360e-85e6-4d8a-b8da-2df6487a8432': authorization failed: Could not authenticate to server: rejected Basic challenge (https://code.ros.org)
Was there always a pwd/rsa auth, or is this new?
thanks,
Andreas

Thanks, Tully, I'll try to get past the authentication barrier again, in the old place.

A:

There has been an announcement on the ros-release mailing list. I can't point to the archive since that is not yet available after the migeation to the OSUOSL.
We are continuing our migration of ROS services.  Today the release repository for dry packages has been moved from code.ros.org to Google code (https://code.google.com/p/ros-dry-releases/).

The new repository location requires every maintainer who wants to release dry packages in the future to re-do the setup instructions (http://www.ros.org/wiki/release/Setup/Machine):

* update the installed Debian package "python-rosrelease" to version >= 0.2.11

* get a fresh checkout of the release tools from their new location

* request to join the ros-dry-releases project by sending an email to ros-release@code.ros.org with your Googlecode login

If you are releasing ROS packages you might want to sign up for that mailing list since important release information like this is posted there.
