Q:

Is editing anything in /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks acceptable?

I followed this tutorial(The tutorial mentions that it's currently failure, but my question seems irrelevant to the failure), I downloaded the package to my own ros directory.
hg clone https://kforge.ros.org/collvoid/collvoid

However, in the tutorial it mentions patching amcl by
roscd collvoid
mv amcl.patch ../navigation
roscd navigation
patch -p1 < amcl.patch

It moves amcl.patch to navigation package like they are in same directory, for which is in /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks. In my understanding, I should not change anything in /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks, so move amcl.patch to navigation and patch it seems weird to me.
Is there anything wrong with my understanding?
Thanks.

They may be assuming that you have your local copy of the stack.

A:

(The official answer is) no.
Use Overlays.
The premise is that you get the source, and modify that in a controlled manner.

Not only the "official answer", but also the correct answer. Don't do it. Use overlays.
