Q:

Gazebo 1.9 fails to load URDF (which works in RVIZ and is validate by urdfdom)

Hi,
I have this irritating issue that I can not spawn my URDF model in gazebo. The model has been verified with urdfdom, and I can successfully use it in RVIZ.
When I try to do so I get the following error:
Warning [parser_urdf.cc:1010] multiple inconsistent <self_collide> exists due to fixed joint reduction overwriting previous value [false] with [true].
Error [parser.cc:697] XML Element[sensor:ray], child of element[link] not defined in SDF. Ignoring.[link]
Error [parser.cc:688] Error reading element <link>
Error [parser.cc:688] Error reading element <model>
Error [parser.cc:348] Unable to read element <sdf>
Error [parser.cc:299] parse as old deprecated model file failed.
Error [World.cc:1469] Unable to read sdf string [..entire urdf model here]

The actual urdf model is here:

This code block was moved to the following github gist:

I do not know what I could/should do to fix this.
Hope someone can help.

A:

The xml used inside your  elements are from pre-gazebo 1.0 days. They are no longer supported. You'll have to switch over to using SDF inside your  elements.
SDF Specification
YouBot in SDF

What about the controller:gazebo_ros_power_monitor and the gazebo_ros_controller_manager? Those seem not to present in the sdf anymore. The last one is replaced by the gazebo_ros_control I think but the power monitor?

Ahh, ok so now the issue is located. Thank you. I have update and deleted ad now it actually works. Only issue is that my .dea files apparently not are valid anymore. When i use all the "*_convex.dea" files i can see the robot, but it is not as expected. I'll post a new question about this.
