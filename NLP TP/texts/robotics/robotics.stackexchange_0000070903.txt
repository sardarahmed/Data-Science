A:

This is normal for some cameras. Is the driver publishing images?

no it is not publishing images.But the camera led on laptop does glow but no images are shown.Also all the required topic and nodes do get published.

What do you mean by "no images are shown"? Are messages published on the driver's image_raw topic?
Comment by kaygudo on 2015-12-16:
no image window gets popped and the terminal's last 2 lines  are "Setting auto_focus is not supported
Setting focus_absolute is not supported" .Yup all the required topics and nodes do get shown as mentioned in uvc_camera package.

The uvc driver only publishes image messages; it doesn't open up a window. If you want to view the published images, you should use image_view.
