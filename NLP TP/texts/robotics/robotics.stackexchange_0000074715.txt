Q:

move_base action server doesn't come up with a real robot

Hello !
I try to run the move_base node on a real robot. When I run it in simulation (with another robot), it works successfully.
But, when I try to bring up the navigation stack on a real robot, the move_base action server doesn't come up.
Indeed, when I launch the move_base node, I get continuously the unexpected following warning:
[ WARN] [1466504490.216963462]: Costmap2DROS transform timeout. Current time: 1466504490.2169, global_pose stamp: 1466504032.8989, tolerance: 0.3000

Moreover, when I run my own C++ node in order to send a goal command, the program stays blocked inside the waitForServer loop, this loop is as follows:
while(!ac.waitForServer(ros::Duration(5.0)))
{
    ROS_INFO("Waiting for the move_base action server to come up");
}

I don't understand why it doesn't work and why when I run the move_base node the move_base action server doesn't come up.
If anyone can help me, I would be very grateful,
lfr

Look to your tf (rosrun rqt_tf_tree rqt_tf_tree ) and node graph (rosrun rqt_graph rqt_graph). Which topics/nodes are unconnected? What's the differences between simulation's graph and real robot's graph? Also you can use roswtf command for looking whats going on.

I updated the question, thanks for your help

I think there is a problem with your pose estimation node, In a simulation, gazebo publishes odometry and transformation between odom and base_link. I think your problem is in your Publissh_odom_TF node (or mugiro_node).

Ok, could you tell me what kind of problem may appear with these nodes because I still don't understand why it doesn't work.
Comment by Orhan on 2016-06-23:
It may be message type (stamped or not stamped) or publishing with wrong frame. Your screenshots are from real robot. Compare them with simulation's graph and tf tree. I think you should publish odom transformation from /mugiro_node directly. Why you using /Publish_odom_TF?

Ah ok, thanks. But didn't write these nodes, I got the robot and these nodes from other ones. My task is to bring up the navigation stack in order to do some tests with the planner (that I have chosen). I will see about tf, I think this is the problem too. Thank you for your help.

You're welcome.

A:

The problem was the clocks of my computer and the robot was not synchronized. The difference was about 500 sec (this is why even setting the transform_tolerance value to 10 sec -> the max value, it didn't change anything). After synchronizing it, it worked properly.
Thanks to Orhangazi44 for helping me,
