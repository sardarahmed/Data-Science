Q:

Transform from rosbuild package to catkin package

My OS is ubuntu12.10 and ros groovy.
I want to transform pr2_controllers_msgs package.
command:catkinize pr2_controllers_msgs 1.0.0

error message:
ira@ira:~/code/ros_groovy/src$ catkinize pr2_controllers_msgs 1.0.0
Traceback (most recent call last):

    path)
ValueError: Path is not a rosbuild stack, missing stack.xml at pr2_controllers_msgs

How to solve it?

Comment by Dirk Thomas on 2013-08-13:
You might want to consider to use Hydro since pr2_controllers_msgs has already been catkinized for that ROS version.

A:

There is a guide to converting rosbuild to catkin packages here: http://www.ros.org/wiki/catkin/migrating_from_rosbuild
However I do not recommend you do so for this package.  It's already been done for the hydro version. If you're using catkin the Hydro version will probably provide you with more packages already catkinized as well.  You can also attempt to use the hydro version inside groovy but your effectiveness will vary.
