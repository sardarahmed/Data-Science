Q:

AprilTag vs Aruco markers

AprilTag and Aruco are both popular methods for vision-based fiducial marker pose estimation.
What are the pros and cons of each fiducial marker pose estimation systems?

A:

Aruco (as implemented in OpenCV)

pros

Easy to set up (with readily available aruco marker generator, opencv & ros implementation, etc.)
fewer false detection (with default parameters)

cons

Newer versions of aruco is GPL licensed, hence opencv is stuck on an old implementation of aruco when it was still BSD.
More susceptible to rotational ambiguity at medium to long ranges
More tuning parameters
More computationally intensive

AprilTag (as implemented in apriltag_ros)

pros

BSD license
Fewer tuning parameters
Works fairly well even at long range
Used by NASA
More flexible marker design (e.g. markers not necessarily square)
Less computationally intensive
Native support for tag bundles where multiple tags are combined to form 1 tag (using multiple tags at different orientations effectively eliminates the rotational ambiguity problem)

cons

less straight forward to setup (no opencv implementation AFAIK, only ros implementation, slightly more steps to obtain markers)
more false detection (with default parameters)
