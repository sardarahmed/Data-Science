Q:

Contact sensor: 6 axis force/torque sensing

It would be nice to extend the contact sensing tutorial to show how to add up all contact forces on a body to get an aggregate JointWrench (3 forces and 3 torques). This would allow the contact sensor to simulate a six axis force/torque sensor on the foot or wrist.
Even if the DRCSIM robot does not have such a sensor, this simulated sensor would be useful for debugging.
Thanks,
Chris

A:

See example in drcsim for summing up contact forces.

There is also a new force torque sensor in gazebo: https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/pull-request/557/sonar-and-force-torque-sensors
