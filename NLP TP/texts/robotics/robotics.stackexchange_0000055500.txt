Q:

Using Moveit with Real Robot (UR5)

Hello ROS Users,
I am interested to know if anyone has tried using Moveit with a Real Robot, UR5 to be more specific. If yes, what changes have to be done to the launch file/s generated by running the below command:
$ roslaunch planning_environment planning_description_configuration_wizard.launch urdf_package:=<robot package> urdf_path:=<urdf path relative to package>

I am using ROS groovy, running on Ubuntu 12.04.Also, As I understand, The launch files are generated for ROS fuerte and for groovy the process is not automated. Anyone who has worked on this, please share the details.
Regards,
Murali

A:

The latest source version of the UR5 (groovy and hydro) has moveit support.  It can be found here.
This package is not set up by default to communicate with the hardware.  This can be added by following this tutorial.
NOTE: The UR driver supports the joint trajectory action directly, so the steps in section 4.1 Required Topics/Services are a little different.  You will still need to create a launch file that launches the UR driver node (with the appropriate IP address).
EDIT
Apparently the correct launch file already exists in the latest versions.  Simply run:
roslaunch ur5_moveit_config moveit_planning_execution.launch sim:=false robot_ip:=IP_OF_THE_ROBOT
