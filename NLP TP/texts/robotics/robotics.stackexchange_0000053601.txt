Q:

The face recognition package not have package.xml file

Hi,
I got face recognition tutorial on ros wiki page:
www.ros.org/wiki/face_recognition
and the SVN link for the face recognition package:
github.com/procrob/procrob_functional/tree/master/face_recognition
I tried to build the workspace using catkin_make command on groovy. But it not building the face recognition package. I had noticed that the package.xml file not exist in the face recognition package.
How I can run this node in groovy?
Thank You.

A:

It has a stack.xml -- so it is still a rosmake package. You should build it using rosmake instead of catkin. For details on mixing rosmake and catkin workspaces see: http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0128.html#mixing-catkin-and-rosbuild-workspaces
