Q:

Problems Connecting to SICK LMS 291 Via USB Port

Hello.
When trying to connect the SICK LMS 291 camera to the computer using the navigation stack launch file:
it hangs at:
*** Attempting to initialize the Sick LMS...
Attempting to open device @ /dev/ttyUSB0
for around ten seconds then responds with:
ERROR: I/O exception - SickLMS::_setupConnection: - Unable to open serial port
ERROR: I/O exception - SickLMS::_setupConnection: - Unable to open serial port
[ERROR] [1304122217.282315542]: Initialize failed! are you using the correct device path?
[sicklms-1] process has died [pid 11826, exit code 2].
log files: /home/jason/.ros/log/2c3bbec6-72be-11e0-b96b-0016ea7abacc/sicklms-1*.log
or using the sicktoolbox_wrapper tutorial- http://www.ros.org/wiki/sicktoolbox_wrapper/Tutorials/UsingTheSicklms - it just hangs at:
*** Attempting to initialize the Sick LMS...
Attempting to open device @ /dev/ttyUSB0

indefinitely. I was wondering if anyone had an idea of what I was doing wrong? I am connected via a serial to usb connector and am running ubuntu 10.10. Also when I open the C: drive it doesn't show that the SICK is connected, and I'm not sure if it is supposed to or not before I correctly run the commands I'm trying to run above. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks,
Jason

Are you talking about editing the code? If so then what I did was copy the sicklmswrapper over to my robot_2dnav package and edit that code as mentioned but I'm not sure that it called to that package or the unwritable one in the ros stack. Any ideas of if I should do that differently?
