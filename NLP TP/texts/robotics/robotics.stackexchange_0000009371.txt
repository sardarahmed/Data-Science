Q:

Reliably establishing communication and OI mode with Create 2

I've started tinkering with a Create 2, but I'm having issues reliably getting it to accept my commands.  I can occasionally get it right, but sometimes, it just seems to ignore me.  I'm guessing my cleanup code isn't getting the state fully reset or something.  Is there a good pattern to follow for fail-safe initialization code?
Here's what I'm doing right now:

Pulse BRC low for 1 second
Wait 1 second
Send 16x 0 bytes (to make sure if it's waiting for the rest of a command, this completes it - seemed to help a bit when I added this)
Send 7 (reset)
Wait 10 seconds
Send 128 (start)
Wait 2 seconds
Send 149 35 (ask for the current OI state)
Wait 1 second
Send 131 (safe mode)

Sometimes I'm then able to issue 137 (drive) commands and have it work.  Most times it doesn't.  The times when it doesn't, I'm seeing a lot of data coming from the Create 2 that I'm not expecting, that looks something like this (hex bytes):
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 3f 2a ff 73 21 09 cc 0a 88 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 3f 2a ff 73 21 09 cc 0a

There's more, but my logging cut it off.  I get the same pattern a couple of times, and it seems to be at least partially repeating.  I thought maybe it's the 16 0-bytes I sent followed by 003f 2aff 7321 09cc 0a88, but I still don't know how to interpret that.
Sometimes it will make some noise for the reset command, but usually ignores the start/safe mode commands completely (I can tell because the green light stays on).

A:

I figured out my problem - the '149 35' I was sending to ask for the current OI state (so I could confirm communication) was wrong. I should be sending '149 1 35'. From then on, it was all confused about what I was sending it, because it was expecting 35 sensor-id bytes.
Short version: make sure you follow the protocol right :(
