Q:

What does the endpoint.pose() command mean in the Baxter SDK

In the Baxter SDK there is a command  endpoint_pose() when I execute it with the a specified limb I get a reuslt like
{'position': Point(x=0.14484562211109325, y=0.6912815563308439, z=-0.45768906596768155), 'orientation': Quaternion(x=-0.5946265621165651, y=0.8034360301238139, z=0.029333852671252516, w=-0.007022977415755815)}
Does anyone know what this result  mean.

A:

This function returns the pose of the limb's endpoint with respect to the /base frame. I believe that the endpoint is considered to be the <left|right>_gripper frame. The "position" key is the position of the endpoint frame, and the "orientation" key is the orientation expressed as a quaternion. This is described here:

@jarvisschultz thank you for your answer I also want to ask if you know what the difference between the position and orientation is.
Comment by jarvisschultz on 2017-04-08:
The position represents the location in x-y-z Cartesian coordinates of the gripper frame relative to the base frame. The orientation represents the rotations that exist between the gripper frame and the base frame. This could be expressed many ways (Euler angles, SO(3), or quaternions)
Comment by jarvisschultz on 2017-04-08:
Quaternions are a convenient way of describing rotations. They are used often in ROS (and many other areas)
