A:

robotino_drivers was an old stack is no longer supported. I would recommend you to try out the new robotino stack. The new stack is based on the new RobotinoAPI2 which is more efficient and is packed with new features. The API2 is currently undergoing its final stages of development but you can already install it on your Robotino.
If you have more questions regarding the RobotinoAPI2 then please post them on the openrobotino forum.
