Q:

compiling errors for rgbdslam hydro for kinect

Hi,
    Currently I am testing the rgbdslam version 2 following the procedures on this webpage: http://felixendres.github.io/rgbdslam_v2/

   As I reinstalled Ubuntu12.04 and hydro. It works well therefore I don't think there is problem on ubuntu and hydro. 

   Everything goes well after $ rosdep install rgbdslam  as it displays #All required rosdeps installed successfully!

   Then I would like to build the rgbdslamv2 and went to my catkine workspace and execute "catkin_make"
   It displayed the following:

   ####

Running command: "make cmake_check_build_system" in "/home/lili/catkin_ws/build"

Running command: "make -j4 -l4" in "/home/lili/catkin_ws/build"

make: *** [all] Error 2
make: INTERNAL: Exiting with 5 jobserver tokens available; should be 4!
Invoking "make" failed
What's the problem? Thank you so much for your advice!

This code is not compiling. When doing catkin_make I get the following error:
/tmp/ccyMrTtU.s: Assembler messages: /tmp/ccyMrTtU.s:16629: Error: no such instruction: `vfmadd312ss 88(%rsp),%xmm1,%xmm2'
/tmp/ccyMrTtU.s:16639: Error: no such instruction: `vfmadd312ss 96(%rsp),%xmm3,%xmm1'
Any ideas?

A:

Download OpenGL extension wrapper library.
Here is the link:- http://glew.sourceforge.net/install.html
Go into the directory of downloaded package glew
do "sudo make install"
And then again try catkin_make RGBDSLAM. It should work out
