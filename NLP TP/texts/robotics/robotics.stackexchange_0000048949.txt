Q:

Navigation by goal with Hector Quadrotor

Hi!
I'm making a ROS enable quadrotor. And I'm learning a little with Hector Quadrotor in Gazebo.
I can use pr2_teleop to control the quadrotor, but I don't know how navigate by goals or paths. I found a launch file in

hector/hector_navigation/hector_exploration_node/launch/exploration_planner.launch

that sould works to this purpose. But when I try to launch it I receive the next error:
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [hector_exploration_node/exploration_planner_node]: can't locate node [exploration_planner_node] in package [hector_exploration_node]

Are there any way to launch that file? Are there any way in that package to navigate by key point or to a goal?
Thank you so much!

A:

This indicates that the node hasn't been built yet. A
rosmake hector_exploration_node

should fix that error.
/edit: In response to your comment: There was a compile error in hector_exploration_planner from Feb 12th to Feb 16th, but it should be fixed now. If you update your repo and try again, it should work.

I have already tried that, but it returns a failure.
[rosmake-6] Finished <<< hector_exploration_planner [FAIL] [ 3.98 seconds ]
[ rosmake ] Halting due to failure in package hector_exploration_planner.
[ rosmake ] Waiting for other threads to complete.

Oh ok, I see. See my edit above.

Ok, it works. Thank you!
But now it returns a message "Still waiting on map". So I try using "indoor_slam_gazebo.launch" as map. And then there are a lot of errors.
Because of that I would like change the question, do you know a simple rosrun file to say to the robot, "go from 0,0,0 to 1,1,1"?
