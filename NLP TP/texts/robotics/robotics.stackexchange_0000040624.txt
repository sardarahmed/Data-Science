Q:

rosjava test failed to pass

Hi,
I followed the instruction on this page
http://docs.rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/rosjava_core/html/index.html
tried to install and build rosjava. Everything went well until the test step. I executed the command "./gradlew test" and got the following failing message:
Test org.ros.internal.message.MessageSerializationTest FAILED
131 tests completed, 16 failures

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':rosjava:test'.
> There were failing tests. See the report at /home/iratao/my_workspace/rosjava_core/rosjava/build/reports/tests.

* Try:
Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace. Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.

BUILD FAILED

Does anyone has an idea about this failure?

same problem here. It seems that the path to /std_msgs/msg/ is not know. At least the report says that 16 messages could not be found.

Could you add which tests are failing to your post?

A:

I pushed a fix for this yesterday. Please pull and try again.

Hi Damon. I am still getting two failure cases for
DefaultNodeTest.testCreatePublic  and  NtpTimeProviderTest.testNtpUbuntuCom. for both I am getting java.lang.AssertionError
Comment by damonkohler on 2012-05-26:
That's expected if you don't have internet access.

I am also failing on org.ros.time.NtpTimeProviderTest, and I definitely have internet access.  Suggestions?
Comment by damonkohler on 2012-05-29:
It's probably just timing out. It's safe to ignore. The test should be rewritten anyway.
Comment by jarvisschultz on 2012-05-29:
It seems you are right, everything appears to be working even with this test failure.
