Q:

I cannot install ROS Kinetic desktop following the tutorial

No way to install ROS Kinetic with OpenCV in RPi4, I followed the official guide, from a fresh install, with swap, with -j1,-j2...
Did somebody get install Kinetic with openCV?
i got install OpenCV 4.1 sucessfully, but I cannot with the Kinetic version. To ROS Kinetic recognize OpenCV 4.1 or any standalone version is crezy difficult get it if you are not mastered in Linux and there is not a specific guide for RPi4 or 3 at least I couldnt find it.
^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
make[2]: *** [modules/python3/CMakeFiles/opencv_python3.dir/build.make:63: modules/python3/CMakeFiles/opencv_python3.dir/__/src2/cv2.cpp.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/Makefile2:8425: modules/python3/CMakeFiles/opencv_python3.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [Makefile:163: all] Error 2
<== Failed to process package 'opencv3': 
Command '['/opt/ros/kinetic/env.sh', 'make', '-j1']' returned non-zero exit status 2

Reproduce this error by running:
==> cd /home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/build_isolated/opencv3 && /opt/ros/kinetic/env.sh make -j1

Command failed, exiting.

in some place I read a similar issue by lack of memory, my rpi4 is 4Gb plus 4Gb partition in a SSD and I even built with -j1

Edit: thank you by the advice, Im new in all this.
I tried install ROS robot to avoid OpenCV installation but either received another error.

You've copied only the final summary of the errors, but not the error message itself.
Without the actual error message, there is no way anyone here can help you.
And as always with C/C++ errors: copy the first error. The rest is almost always unimportant.

I changed the version of libboost1.x to one older I dont know if it will work
Comment by FPSychotic on 2019-07-12:
alright, I tested with a older version of libboost and error again
So there is two big issues that make impossible install ROS in RPi4,

Did you try to install melodic? why do you need kinetic?

A:

So there is two big issues that make impossible install ROS in RPi4,

I believe the issue is more that you're trying to build a version of ROS on a platform that is not officially supported, with versions of dependencies that are not supported (by Kinetic at least).
ros/rospack#92 seems to be your exact issue.
The problem appears to be that you are attempting to build ROS Kinetic on an unsupported platform. Kinetic is only supported on (from REP 3: Target Platforms - Kinetic Kame (May 2016 - May 2021)):

Required Support for:

Ubuntu Wily (15.10)
Ubuntu Xenial (16.04)

Recommended Support for:

Debian Jessie

And with Boost version 1.55. Anything else is not explicitly supported.
The comments on ros/rospack#92 seem to suggest that the Kinetic version of rospack (and probably other packages) depend on the tr1 headers. Newer versions no longer require them (ros/rospack#80).
If you have the option, I would suggest you try to build Melodic from source, as that should be compatible with Boost 1.65.
There is still no guarantee though, as Melodic is not officially supported on Raspbian.
