Q:

Moveit! and URDF problem

Hello Dear Community!
I have a problem that I can't resolve during already a few days. I have created simple test robot arm in SolidWorks. I followed instructions on setting the axis correctly for all joints (X-forward, Z-up). I have exported URDF model from SolidWorks. I have created Moveit! config for this URDF model with Moveit! wizard.
Models successfully loads into rviz. I can control it with robot_state_publisher GUI panel.
But I can't set the Goal State with Interactive Marker either with the code. I always get  "Fail: ABORTED: No motion plan found. No execution attempted.".
I have uploaded to GoogleDrive two tars:

drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx529USSkqSbd0k0djE0aEVKYTg/edit?usp=sharing (model exported from SolidWorks: URDF, meshes)
drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx529USSkqSbbGRjckp5bVRNbjQ/edit?usp=sharing
(generated Moveit! config)

Could you please be so kind and review this packages, and tell me what I'm doing wrong!
I really need help with this!
Great thanks ahead!

An arm for Moveit! shall be strictly 6DOF? Or could have less DOF?

Try to set the logger levels of move_arm and ompl_ros to DEBUG using rxconsole. That could give some extra debug info.

A:

I have set the
position_only_ik: True
in kinematics.yaml file and this has solved the problem.
