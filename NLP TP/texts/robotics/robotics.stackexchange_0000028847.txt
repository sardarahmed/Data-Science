Q:

my collision is not working

Hello everyone,
I am new to gazebo, so I am not very familiar with gazebo.
My problem is about collision.
I have put on  tag in my urdf-file ( a hand model ), but the little finger still can run into my Palm.
The following is my code, and the bottom is the video.
 is my palm,  is the little finger's first part,  is the little finger's second part.

         -->
      
    

    
         
      
        
         -->

A:

You can try specifying the self collide property inside gazebo tags
<gazebo reference="link_name">
    <selfCollide>true</selfCollide>
    ...
</gazebo>
