If you want the message like the ones you defined, geometry_msgs/Point already does that.

A:

I assume that you have all packages in one single repository and both computers have it checked out. Then the following should work:
B could either use A's message definition or A could use B's message definition. However, it is pretty common in ROS to create a separate package C that only contains the message and no code. All you need to do is to create that package C, put the message file into the msg/ sub-directory and update your CMakeLists.txt to build that message. Then edit A's manifest and let it depend on C, edit B's manifest respectively. In A and B, instead of including A/Position.h or B/Position.h, include C/Position.h.
