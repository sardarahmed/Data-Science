Q:

How to catkin_make designated package in the same workspace?

Ubuntu: 12.04
ROS: Hydro
Hey, everyone~  I am a freshman to ROS.
The problem occurred when I want to catkin_make only one package in the my workspace.
There are 2 packages, chapter2_tutorials and dynamic_tutorials in my workspace.
I want to catkin_make one of my packages,
after I run catkin_make chapter2_tutorials ,
The terminal shows:
+++ processing catkin package: 'chapter2_tutorials'
+++ processing catkin package: 'dynamic_tutorials'

I think it obviously shows that it catkin_make both of the packages.
So what should I do to make it?
Thank you~
