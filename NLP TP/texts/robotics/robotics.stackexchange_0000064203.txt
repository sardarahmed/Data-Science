Q:

ROS hydro xsens_driver for MTi

Does the xsens_driver (http://wiki.ros.org/xsens_driver ) support hydro? As there is no files under the hydro version.
Thanks in advance!

A:

The master branch cannot work directly for ROS hydro version.
But we could install the ros-hydro-gps-common from the Synaptic Package Manager.
And then $git clone https://github.com/ethz-asl/ethzasl_xsens_driver.git 
$catkin_make
After that, it should work
To use the xsens_driver, the USB access shall be changed to the administrator
$sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0
Then the xsens_driver could be launched and the imu data could be viewed by the following command.
$roslaunch xsens_driver xsens_driver.launch
$rostopic echo /imu/data
