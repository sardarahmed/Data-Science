Please post the link to the repository of this package. I can't find it on GitHub.

A:

The folder doesn't contain a stack.xml so it is not recognized as a ROS meta-package (stack).
So you will have to rosmake individual packages inside that folder.
Please note that rosmake will soon be obsolete. This means a catkin package is much better than a rosmake package.
I would suggest that you use @fivef 's JacoROS. It is very stable. I just tried it and seems to work very fine! There is also a fork that I have created with certain added features.
Please see:

Have a nice day.
