Q:

point cloud "box" filtering

I just wanted to know if a package doing a "box" filtering already exists. I'd just like to limit the field of view of the Kinect, by removing everything that's not in a given box. I googled a bit and couldn't find an already implemented solution.
If it doesn't exist, I guess I can create a node and use the passthrough filter, but I thought it would already be implemented.

Ok, I finally found the answer: I just needed to start a passthrough nodelet with the correct parameters. Here is a working launch file:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<launch>
  <group ns="/pcl_filters">
    <!-- PCL Manager -->
    <node pkg="nodelet" type="nodelet" name="box_filter_pcl_manager" args="manager" output="screen"/>

    <!-- Run a passthrough filter to delimit in x direction -->
    <node pkg="nodelet" type="nodelet" name="psx" args="load pcl/PassThrough box_filter_pcl_manager" output="screen">
      <remap from="~input" to="/camera/depth/points" />
      <rosparam>
        filter_field_name: x
        filter_limit_min: -.8
        filter_limit_max: 0.5
      </rosparam>
    </node>

    <!-- Run a passthrough filter to delimit in y direction -->
    <node pkg="nodelet" type="nodelet" name="psy" args="load pcl/PassThrough box_filter_pcl_manager" output="screen">
      <remap from="~input" to="psx/output" />
      <rosparam>
        filter_field_name: y
        filter_limit_min: -1.
        filter_limit_max: .3
      </rosparam>
    </node>

    <!-- Run a passthrough filter to delimit in z direction -->
    <node pkg="nodelet" type="nodelet" name="psz" args="load pcl/PassThrough box_filter_pcl_manager" output="screen">
      <remap from="~input" to="psy/output" />
      <rosparam>
        filter_field_name: z
        filter_limit_min: 0.0
        filter_limit_max: 2.0
      </rosparam>
    </node>
  </group>
</launch>

I think you mean @dejanpan's solution :)

Ok, it didn't work with one filter, I just pasted Erik's solution here to have the answer directly accessible. Thanks.

Hm, to be honest I haven't really tested it, I just subscribed to the output point cloud and saw that I had a smaller point cloud. I'll have to check this.

Don't the later rosparam blocks overwrite the earlier ones?
