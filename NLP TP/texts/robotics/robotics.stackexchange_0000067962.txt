Q:

Scan message must contain angles from -x to x

I follow the tutorial turtlebot_simulator to make a map in a simulated world.But when I run

roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo gmapping_demo.launch

a error that scan message must contain angles from -x to x occurs, as show below. How to deal with it.
[ERROR] [1433813576.466253926, 24.270000000]: Scan message must contain angles from -x to x, i.e. angle_min = -angle_max

I have the same problem. This is the new behaviour in the latest ros-indigo-gmapping-1.3.7 package. CHANGELOG.rst says:
....

Added cfloat include
Change arbitrary constant to FLT_EPSILON
Added check that scan goes from -x to x
.......

A:

Hi all, thank you for sharing the data. A fix was merged upstream in 1.3.8: it just reached shadow fixed so please test. The fix centers the scan before sending them to gmapping, whether they're slightly / completely off-centered or even upside-down.
