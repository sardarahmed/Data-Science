Q:

Unable to install libopenni2-dev

Hi, I am using Odroid XU3(Arm Processor), Ubuntu 12.04(Precise) and ROS(Hydro).
When I try to build my OpenNI2_camera, I got these error
-- checking for module 'libopenni2'
--   package 'libopenni2' not found
-- checking for module 'openni2'
--   package 'openni2' not found
Than I found out that installing libopenni2-dev will solve the problem, but when I try to apt-get install, I get these error
Package libopenni2-dev is not available, but is referred to by another package.
This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
is only available from another source
E: Package 'libopenni2-dev' has no installation candidate
I am new these programs, can anyone help me with this problem, Thanks.

I think I need a PPA to source for libopenni2-dev for Arm processor.

Did you get this working? Im having the same error?

A:

Not sure about the history, but I found the binary repositories of libopenni2-dev has been migrated from ros.org to ubuntu.com.
On my Trusty
$ apt-cache policy libopenni2-dev
libopenni2-dev:
  Installed: 2.2.0.33+dfsg-1~ubuntu14.04.1
  Candidate: 2.2.0.33+dfsg-1~ubuntu14.04.1
  Version table:
 *** 2.2.0.33+dfsg-1~ubuntu14.04.1 0
        500 http://packages.ros.org/ros-shadow-fixed/ubuntu/ trusty/main amd64 Packages
        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status

Xenial
$ apt-cache policy libopenni2-dev
libopenni2-dev:
  Installed: 2.2.0.33+dfsg-6
  Candidate: 2.2.0.33+dfsg-6
  Version table:
 *** 2.2.0.33+dfsg-6 500
        500 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial/universe amd64 Packages
        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status

Thus, OP was on Hydro then, make sure you specify ros.org as a source list, something like this for your distro.
Also OP was on ARM. I doubt there was a binary build for openni2* packages for ARM on Hydro. In ROS Indigo there is (and going onward I assume).
