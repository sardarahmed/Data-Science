Q:

catkin_make toplevel.cmake in Yocto

Hi guys,
I am trying to install ROS into an embedded device (imx8m-mini variscite dart) using Yocto. I have added required ROS packages into the Yocto environment and generated a root file system. I have sourced the setup.bash script in my bash environment and then when I do "catkin_make" I get an error like this,
 **Creating the toplevel cmake file failed: Could neither find file "toplevel.cmake" in any workspace nor relative, checked the following paths:**
/home/root/catkin_ws/src/catkin/cmake/toplevel.cmake 
/opt/ros/melodic/catkin/cmake/toplevel.cmake
/opt/ros/melodic/lib/python2.7/cmake/toplevel.cmake
/opt/ros/melodic/share/catkin/cmake/toplevel.cmake
/opt/ros/melodic/lib/share/catkin/cmake/toplevel.cmake

As a result, the directories  build, devel, and src are empty.
Do you have any idea to solve this problem?
Thanks.
