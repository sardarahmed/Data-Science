I'm not sure that this is the appropriate site for this question as it's not a ROS question.

This is not a ROS-specific question. You should ask your question of the EmPy developers instead.

A:

The are plugins for some editors which are able to highlight EmPy templates as well as the respective language the expanded templates generate:

Atom language-empy
VSCode vscode-empy
