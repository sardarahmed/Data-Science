A:

ROS can run on anything from a Raspberry Pi to a high-end Intel Xeon server.
The message-passing layer in ROS has fairly minimal requirements and can run on pretty much anything that can run Linux, but many of the more complex mapping and motion-planning packages may require significantly more resources.
If you describe the application that you're trying to run or the type of robot that you're trying to create you'll probably get a better answer.
