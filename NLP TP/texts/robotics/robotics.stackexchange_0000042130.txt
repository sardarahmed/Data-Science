Q:

failed to drive pr2 robot on multi_level_map_demo gazebo

I followed pr2_simulator/Tutorials/MultiLeveMapWithRamps.
I use ROS electric to run
  roslaunch pr2_gazebo_wg multi_level_map_demo.launch
  rosrun pr2_teleop teleop_pr2_keyboard

But I can't move pr2 on teleop_pr2_keyboard node.
How to solve it?
Thank you~
