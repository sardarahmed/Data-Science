Q:

rosrun warning error

i  created a simple package for listner.cpp and talker.cpp. i already build my package. when i run "rosrun firstpack talker", it run successfully and print "hello world". when i open new tab and run my listener node it give me error .
chhonkar@chhonkar-pc:~/Desktop/catkin$ rosrun firs[rospack] Warning: error while crawling /home/chhonkar: boost::filesystem::status: Permission denied: "/home/chhonkar/.gvfs"
tpack listner
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named listner below /home/chhonkar/Desktop/catkin/src/firstpack
Both node run successfully when i run it alone. but when i run another node, it return error.
my questions are
Q1- " what is this error?"
Q2 - "why my node run alone but when i execute one after another, it fails and return above error"?

A:

I see two separate issues here:

You have a permissions problem with your ~/.gvfs directory. I suspect you see this warning when you try to tab-complete your package name. I haven't seen this before; you'll probably want to search the Ubuntu forums or just try rebooting.
Your environment isn't set up properly in your new terminal. Are you sure you're sourcing the setup.bash for your workspace properly? (Note that with catkin, setting the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH manually is no longer sufficient to tell ROS where your workspace is).
