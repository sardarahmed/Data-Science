Q:

simple way to view a depth image topic from command line?

image_view pukes when you try to view a depth image (typically 16 bit single channel):
$ rosrun image_view image_view image:=/hsrb/head_rgbd_sensor/depth_registered/image_raw
[ INFO] [1439901837.964462440]: Using transport "raw"
[ERROR] [1439901838.243159831]: Unable to convert '16UC1' image to bgr8: '[16UC1] is not a color format. but [bgr8] is. The conversion does not make sense'
all of the rqt stuff works, but it all seems to require you to launch a gui and use the mouse to mess around with widgets to view any given topic.
Is there something that ships with ROS that I can just run from the command line to view a depth image topic?

Note, I can and did hack together my own crappy version of image_view, but there has to be a better way.

Have you tried rqt_image_view?

Hi Dirk, I haven't figured out how to launch rqt_image_view from the command line so that it just displays what I want;  always have to use the mouse.  I am caring less and less, though; I spend so much time debugging ros connections that it is better to use the mouse and leave rqt open. Thanks!

A:

The latest code of rqt_image_view allows passing a command line argument with the topic name (https://github.com/ros-visualization/rqt_common_plugins/commit/13f3fee3ee0ff0769ef8dde72cea6def370f7aed). This change has not been released yet but will likely be released in the next couple of weeks.

Should rqt_image_view /image_raw or similar work now?  It doesn't for me in Ubuntu 14.04 Jade
