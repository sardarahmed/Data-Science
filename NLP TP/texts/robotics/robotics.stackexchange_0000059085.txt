Q:

Gazebo installation in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

When I try to install Gazebo on my Ubuntu 14.04 LTS I am facing the below problem
admin@admin:~$ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-simulator-gazebo
[sudo] password for admin: 
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-indigo-simulator-gazebo

Is there any problem with the code I am executing? or is it the problem of Ubuntu version?

You can check if any package is available with apt-cache search ros-indigo.

A:

simulator_gazebo is no longer a ROS package as of Hydro, so also not in Indigo:

You probably want the ros-indigo-gazebo-ros-pkgs package. A list of all Indigo packages, filter on gazebo in their name, can be found here:
