Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Xn source code

In ROS files, such as XnCppWrapper.h, many functions return functions beginning with xn. For instance:
inline XnStatus AddNeededNode(ProductionNode& needed)
{
        return xnAddNeededNode(m_hNode, needed.m_hNode);
}

or
inline XnStatus RemoveNeededNode(ProductionNode& needed)
{
        return xnRemoveNeededNode(m_hNode, needed.m_hNode);
}

The ROS documentation sites, such as http://www.ros.org/doc/api/nao_openni/html/XnCppWrapper_8h_source.html do not provide code for the functions beginning with xn. The OpenNI section on git also has functions that call these xn functions. I am unable to find the definition of any of these functions on the OpenNI section however. Does anyone know where I can find the function definitions? Or are parts of OpenNI closed source?

A:

The xn code is not part of ROS. Xn sounds like it's part of OpenNI, so surely the code you are looking for is there.

Not all documentation includes source code. If theirs doesn't, either download the source code from their website, or find their svn/git/mg browser and view on-line.

Do you know where I can find this code? Otherwise, is there an answer site like this for OpenNI where I can ask about it? The documentation page on http://www.openni.org/documentation does not contain the source code for many of these functions.
