Q:

Launching Objects in Gazebo with ROS Fuerte

So I've been able to load objects in the past by using the following example code,
<!-- Blue Bar Cylinder -->
<model:physical name="cyl_model">
    <xyz>.6 0.4 1</xyz>
    <rpy>0 0 0</rpy>
    <static>true</static> 
    <body:cylinder name="cyl_body">
      <xyz>0 0 0</xyz>
      <rpy>0 90 90</rpy>
      <geom:cylinder name="cyl_geom">
        <xyz>0 0 0</xyz>
        <size>0 0</size>           
        <mass>1</mass>
        <visual>
          <size>0.03 0.03 .2</size>
          <material>Gazebo/Blue</material>
          <mesh>unit_cylinder</mesh>
        </visual>
      </geom:cylinder>
    </body:cylinder>
  </model:physical>

Although now this doesn't work with ROS fuerte... I also tried the example in the Gazebo tutorials http://ros.org/wiki/simulator_gazebo/Tutorials/SpawningObjectInSimulation
What am I missing here?  I'm not sure what has changed with loading objects into the gazebo simulator.

I just updated the gazebo setup instructions to install from released debians (http://ros.org/wiki/simulator_gazebo/Tutorials/StartingGazebo), please give that a try and see if it works.

A:

Found a solution to this.  I was able to load the object if I spawned it in my world.launch file with the following code,
  <param name="sphere" command="$(find xacro)/xacro.py '/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/simulator_gazebo/gazebo_worlds/objects/simple_sphere.xacro'" /> 
  <node name="sphere_model" pkg="gazebo" type="spawn_model" args="-urdf -param sphere -model sphere1 -paused=true -x -.5 -y -.5 -z 1 " respawn="false" output="screen" />
