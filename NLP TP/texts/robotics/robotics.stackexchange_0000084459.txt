Q:

QXcb Connection

Hello!I'm learning ROS for a college project and I'm running Ubuntu 16.04 off WSL as I'm not allowed to dual-boot my laptop. I don't have a spare machine lying around atm, so I'm running it like this.
Now the problem is that when I run rqt, I'm getting an error stating:

QXcbConnection: Could not connect to display :0

On running

sudo apt-get install ros-lunar-rqt

I am getting:

Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree Reading
state information... Done
ros-lunar-rqt is already the newest
version
(0.5.0-0xenial-20171120-112204-0800). 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to
remove and 127 not upgraded.

Any help to get it running would be appreciated!
P.S. I'm running Xming as the X-Server.

A:

before you run that command, initialise Xming, then on Ubuntu type:
export DISPLAY=:0

and then run the command.
