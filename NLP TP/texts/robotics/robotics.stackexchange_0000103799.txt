Q:

ImportError: cannot import name 'GazeboRosPaths' from 'scripts'

I am trying to run ros2 launch gazebo_ros gazebo.launch.py on ROS 2 Foxy. Unfortunately, I came across the following error:
[INFO] [launch]: All log files can be found below /home/mubashir/.ros/log/2023-08-30-13-25-29-406060-mubashir-7514
