Q:

ROS install from src fails to find rosinstall script

Hey,
It seems like something got deleted from http://packages.ros.org/
The installation from source tutorials are saying to execute the command :
wstool init -j8 src http://packages.ros.org/web/rosinstall/generate/raw/groovy/desktop-full

However http://packages.ros.org/web no longer exists and thus this command fails.
Is there a backup I can use somewhere?
