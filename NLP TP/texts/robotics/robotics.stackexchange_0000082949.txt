Q:

Install ROS lunar on fedora

I am trying install ROS on Fedora
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro lunar -y

but i got this error
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
gazebo_dev: No definition of [libgazebo7-dev] for OS version [26]

I try this command
[ahmedadel@192 ros_catkin_ws]$ rosdep install -ay --os=fedora:26

and got this result
#All required rosdeps installed successfully

sudo dnf install --skip-broken python-empy console-bridge console-bridge-devel poco-devel boost boost-devel eigen3-devel pyqt4 qt-devel gcc gcc-c++ python-devel sip sip-devel tinyxml tinyxml-devel qt-devel qt5-devel python-qt5-devel sip sip-devel python3-sip python3-sip-devel qconf curl curl-devel gtest gtest-devel lz4-devel urdfdom-devel assimp-devel qhull-devel qhull uuid uuid-devel uuid-c++ uuid-c++-devel libuuid libuuid-devel gazebo gazebo-devel collada-dom collada-dom-devel yaml-cpp yaml-cpp-devel python2-defusedxml python-netifaces pyparsing pydot python-pyqtgraph python2-matplotlib 

This tends to install everything needed to build ROS on Fedora

It would be really great if you could contribute some rules to the database so we can use rosdep to manage dependencies on Fedora again.
