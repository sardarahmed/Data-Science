Q:

Is it possible to get the frequency a specific node publishes to a topic?

I know rostopic hz /topic gives the total frequency, but can I get the frequency a particular node publishes to a topic?

Look into the topic statistics functionality. But note it does have its disadvantages / inaccuracies.

what disadvantages the topic statistics have exactly?

A:

Not ideal, but you could replace that single publisher with a DiagnosedPublisher which publishes some statistics on a separate topic.
