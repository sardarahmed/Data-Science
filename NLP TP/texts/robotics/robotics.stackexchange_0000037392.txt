Q:

full <-> full-desktop without reinstalling

Hi!
I am working the a Natty 10.04 ubuntu on a PANDABOARD.
I had trouble installing the desktop-full version and installed the full version instead
Now I see there are a LOT of stacks missing and as I understand - navigation (SLAM?) packages will be missing as well?
I do not want to go over the installation again

can I manually install missing stacks that exist in the "desktop-full" and not in the "full"?

is that the only difference between the two - missing stacks?
thanks in advance!

A:

It sounds like you are installing from the Natty Ubuntu Debian package repository.
Yes, you should be able to install additional missing stacks without affecting those you already have. Each Debian package contains a ROS stack.
