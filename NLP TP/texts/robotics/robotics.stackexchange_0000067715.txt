Q:

ccny_rgbd_tools-0.1.1 compilation issue with ROS-hydro

Hello,
I am trying to use the ccny_rgbd_tools SLAM package, I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 and ROS-hydro (rosbuild / hydro_workspace, primarily).
Since I was running into libg2o issues, so when I cloned the repository, I had tried the groovy , hydro , and master branches of ccny_rgbd_tools, but to no luck. After facing a lot of issues with libg2o (whether or not I have libg2o installed - I've tried both), I shifted to the ccny_rgbd_tools-0.1.1 package from Ivan Dryanovski's github  https://github.com/ccny-ros-pkg/ccny_rgbd_tools/releases/tag/0.1.1, since it is updated to ONLY the ccny_g2o system rather than the rgbd g2o lib.
I also modified my libg2o file by adding http://www.dropbox.com/s/l0q4oc7yuk00t92/if_g2o_is_missed.zip
This seems to have sorted out the g2o errors.
Now when I compile the package, this is the error it is throwing up.
ccny_rgbd_tools-0.1.1/ccny_rgbd/src/structures/rgbd_frame.cpp:308:18: error: no match for ‘operator=’ in ‘cloud.pcl::PointCloud<pcl::PointXYZRGB>::header = ((const ccny_rgbd::RGBDFrame*)this)->ccny_rgbd::RGBDFrame::header’

I assume the error above is due to incompatibilty of the PCL system used (probably for groovy and earlier), when I am running ROS-hydro. I have used PCL elsewhere without issues - I even tried manually migrating the ccny_rgbd_tools package to the standalone PCL system, but it is ridiculously complicated,
How do I use the "hydro compatible" ccny_rgbd_tools system, and also utilize the ccny_g2o format of the 0.1.1 edition? I've gone through every other issue / answers posted on the forum about ccny_rgbd, and all compilation errors (for their respective distros) have supposedly been solved by migrating to the 0.1.1 edition, but I haven't been able to solve this. I'd be grateful if anyone could help me out with building this package.

Hello everyone,
My assumption that the errors were stemming from the distro issues and PCL compatibility were right - ccny_rgbd_tools-0.1.1 is NOT a Hydro release. I switched to the Hydro release (you could also use 0.2.0 or the master branch), and sort out G2O / Suiteparse errors to make this work.
