Q:

Screw based Jacobian

I am working on kinematics of 5-DOF robot. I already derived geometric Jacobian for position and orientation control. 
But for singularity analysis, I require a simplified jacobian. And that can be obtained on base of screw theory called Screw Based Jacobian.
But I am not able to find the method to obtain screw based jacobian matrix; which completely explain the method to derive screw based jacobian.
Any advice on where I can get it? Please help me out.

A:

The geometric Jacobian provides all the information you need for singularity or manipulability analysis.  Linearly dependent columns correspond to joints with parallel axes.  More information about Jacobians for under-actuated manipulators (as is your case) can be found in my book Robotics, Vision & Control" section 8.4.1.
For information about computing the "screw based Jacobian" check out the book Modern Robotics by Park&Lynch.
