I am sure that i follow the instructions well, and i have install the empy package.

A:

Try these instuctions, I think they are more up to date. I followed them and have gotten pretty far in the installation.  Make sure your python path is correct too.
I am getting stuck with PCL (compiling pcl_ros actually). I have also forked rosdistro and am trying to get the homebrew stuff working correctly for pcl, openni, and ps-engine ... but still having issues.
