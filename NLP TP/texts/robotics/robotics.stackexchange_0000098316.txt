I have tried to update my system with sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade but it gives me that all packages are up to date.
I found this question but this did not update my python packages.
How can i update these packages or or do I have to wait for a new Foxy update.

A:

The current versions of the ROS2 packages will sync monthly to the rosdistro Repo. After that a update with apt update can be done.
See the latest sync and status on ROS Discourse
