Q:

ImportError : No module named xxxx.msg

Hello everyone.
I migrate an installation from one computer to another, switching from Ubuntu 12.04 to 16.04 and from indigo ros to kinetic
When I run my installation that has about 30 packages most of the things seem to start well except for a package that fails to make an import
I specify that I do not have this error on the computer of the previous configuration, or everything is identical in my programs, except the denomination of indigo and kinetic
The error is as follows:
From my_folder_msgs.msg import my_file as My_fileMsg   
ImportError : No module named my_folder_msgs.msg 

Of course, my_folder_msgs.msg  exists and appears when I call: rosmsg list.
Would anyone have an idea?

Hi,
Make sure you got the "#!/usr/bin/env python" line at top of your python file, also make sure that youre customs messages are built. You can check with rosmsgs list | grep your_custom_msgs

A:

Hi @pibauer,
when we use our custom messages, even if they are listed with rosmsg list, they only can be used by our nodes after they be compiled.
I have created a video (https://youtu.be/NKeebwRNvv8) that answers exactly this question.
The steps explained in the video are basically the following:

You have to compile your message. For that, you have to touch the package.xml and CMakeLists.txt according to the instructions found on CMakeLists.txt. After prepare the package.xml and CMakeLists.txt, you run catkin_make on your catkin_ws

After the message is compiled, you have to source the setup.bash like: source catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

Now you can import your messages without any problem.

That is it. If you still have any questions, just ask here or watch the video aforementioned.

Thanks this helped me too!  Just remember to load a new terminal or resource the setup script after compilation.
