Q:

how to install p2os in ros (groovy version) in ubuntu 12.10

Hi all,
I've installed groovey version in my os (ubuntu 12.10), i want to test my navigation algorithm for my project in a mobile robot, so i select gazebo simulator and pioneer3dx, but when i want to use this command for groovy(sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-p2os) i got this error (E: Unable to locate package ros-groovy-p2os), what should i do?! i think this stack is not available for groovy version, is it correct ?
Thank you so much for your help.

Use the new p2os repository for Groovy!
git clone https://github.com/allenh1/p2os
