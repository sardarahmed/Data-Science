Q:

move_base pointcloud data format

Hi I'm getting the error
[ERROR] [1545413307.824637530]: Client [/move_base] wants topic /mmWaveDataHdl/RScan to have datatype/md5sum [sensor_msgs/PointCloud/d8e9c3f5afbdd8a130fd1d2763945fca], but our version has [sensor_msgs/PointCloud2/1158d486dd51d683ce2f1be655c3c181]. Dropping connection.

My costmap_common_params.yaml has:
observation_sources: mmwave_radar

mmwave_radar: {sensor_frame: base_radar_link, data_type: PointCloud2, topic: /mmWaveDataHdl/RScan
, marking: true, clearing: true}

I submitted an issue to the github page and got told that it accepts PointCloud2 by default and the issue was closed.
When I search for this issue I find people saying it's not compatible and having to use an old EOL conversion package.
They can't both be true. Can anyone help?

Just to confirm, what datatype is /mmWaveDataHdl/RSCan?

Yeah it's definitely pointcloud2. I left it over weekend, started it up just now to double-check before answering - it mysteriously works! I now have costmaps! I swear I didn't touch my launch files or anything. Sorry to waste your time.

False alarm - it's working
