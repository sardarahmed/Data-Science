Q:

Remapping all topics of a machine to a namespace

Hi guys,
I have to machines, one of them configured as the ROS_MASTER.
Both of them are essentially running the same code, but I want both machines to publish messages to different topics, hence I thougt it would be good to put one of the machines into a different namespace.
I did that via export ROS_NAMESPACE=xyz
The code base is quite large, and sadly a lot of people used only global topic names during development, which causes ros to NOT prefix those topics ( /topic1 stays /topic1 while topic2 becomes /xyz/topic2).
Is there any other way (for example with the help of remapping) that would allow me to put all of the topics published by a single physical machine to a different namespace?
Thank you!

A:

I don't know the answer, but you might be interested to know, essentially this feature was requested some time ago (to great acclaim). See HERE. I can't tell that it has been implemented.
