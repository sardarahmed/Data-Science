Q:

hydro tf::Transform misses .asBt() methods?

I'm moving from fuerte to hydro. As I'm interfacing with bullet directly for physical simulations I regularly used tf::Transform::asBt() which seems to be missing in the tf implementation for hydro. I see that bullet in hydro is now also a system dependency, does is make sense to extend the tf_conversions package with tf_bullet conversion routines or am I overlooking something? Would migrating to tf2 work better in this use case?

A:

In Hydro you should use the tf2::convert method to convert datatypes between formats such as tf and bullet.
There's a tutorial here: http://www.ros.org/wiki/tf2/Tutorials/Migration/DataConversions
