Q:

Flickering of map in rviz (gmapping)

link text I am doing navigation on ROS, while in gmapping the map which is published is also flickering. Please check the given link so you will get rough idea. Is there any TF issue?

A:

It looks like you have multiple nodes publishing conflicting transforms between the odometry and map frames. You should run roswtf and rosrun tf view_frames , and see if either tool complains about multiple publishers for the same transform.
