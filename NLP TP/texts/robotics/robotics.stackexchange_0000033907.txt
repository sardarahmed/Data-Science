Q:

rviz shows the robot's location differently from gazebo

I've been learning how to use simulation tools, and now trying to use both gazebo and rviz together.
In the tutorial "Simulating the 2dnav Stack", it seems gazebo and rviz work as expected when I use pr2-armless-wg-fake_localization.launch, however, when pr2-wg-amcl.launch is in use, rviz shows the robot at the corner of the entire field even though the robot is located at the center on gazebo.
My guess is that localization is not working properly since other launch files in the same tutorial folder with fake_localization in their file names work, whereas other amcl files don't either. I'm looking into each launch file but if someone could give direct solutions, that'd be great.
Env) Ubuntu 10.10, diamondback
Thank you.

A:

Just as in the real world, when using amcl, you need to localize the robot first by giving it an initial pose.  Also take a look at the amcl localization notes.

@hsu thanks. Once I figure out how to run the tutorial above, I'll mark your answer, and also update the wiki page.
