Q:

Can't find service header files

I can build my project and running rosservice show benchmark_suite/status will reveal it has indeed been declared. But I cannot for the life of me find the header fine. The devel/include directory doesn't exist and inserting a #include "benchmark_suite/status.h" line in my .cpp file shows a "not found error" when building.
CMakeList.txt excerpts:
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
  roscpp
  rosmsg
  std_msgs
  message_generation
)
...
add_service_files(
  FILES
  status.srv
)
...
add_executable(cubic src/cubic.cpp)
target_link_libraries(cubic ${catkin_LIBRARIES})

package.xml excerpts
...
<build_depend>message_generation</build_depend>
<exec_depend>message_runtime</exec_depend>
...

A:

If that is really all you have in your CMakeLists.txt, then I believe you're missing a generate_messages(DEPENDENCIES std_msgs).
See Building messages, services or actions in the Catkin documentation.

That was it, thank you. I missed that step in the wiki
