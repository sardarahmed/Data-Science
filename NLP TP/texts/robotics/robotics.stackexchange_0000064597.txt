Q:

Bagfile (containing depth and RGB data) to picture frames

When I convert a bagfile (containing depth and RGB data) to picture frames, I get different number of picture frames each time I launch the code given in the tutorial given below and the subsequent video I compile is totally wayward.

Please guide me through this

A:

If the number of frames is different all the time probably your computer is not fast enough to save (and jpeg compress) all images with the same frequency they are coming out of the bag file.... Consider using the rosbag play -r (rate) option to slow down the message frequency (e. g. -r 0.2 to run at 20% of the original rate). Your computer should then be able to save all images without missing some. If therefore in the end your video looks kind of slow-mow you can speed it up using any common video processing program....
Edit example launch:
<launch>
  <node pkg="rosbag" type="play" name="rosbag" args="-r 0.2 -d 2 $(find image_view)/test.bag"/>
  <node name="extract" pkg="image_view" type="extract_images" respawn="false" output="screen" cwd="ROS_HOME">
    <remap from="image" to="/camera/image_raw"/>
  </node>
</launch>

Sorry if I ask anything silly. But I am new to ROS. I convert the rosbag to frames using the roslaunch file created in the tutorial. I never use the rosbag play command while doing this. So how and where should I change it? Thanks in advance

I edited the answer; See where I added the -r 0.2 in the launch sample of the tutorial you linked....
