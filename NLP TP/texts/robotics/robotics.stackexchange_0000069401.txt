Q:

rostopic list return topics, but not able to echo topic

Hello,
My configuration looks like:
Beaglebone black with GPS + laptop. Both running Ubuntu 14.04 and ROS indigo.
I would like to run roscore at laptop and node gpsd_client at beaglebone.
I set following variables:
At laptop (ip 192.168.7.1):
export ROS_IP=192.168.7.1
export ROS_HOSTNAME=192.168.7.1
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.7.1:11311

At beaglebone (ip 192.168.7.2):
export ROS_IP=192.168.7.2
export ROS_HOSTNAME=192.168.7.1
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.7.1:11311

I'm able to ping each other.
I'm able to do rostopic list from both.
But I'm not able to do rostopic echo fix.
roswtf give following error msg:
Loaded plugin tf.tfwtf

 * service [/gpsd_client/set_logger_level] appears to be malfunctioning: Unable to communicate with service [/gpsd_client/set_logger_level], address [rosrpc://192.168.7.1:58483]

I see error
ERROR The following nodes should be connected but aren't:
 * /gpsd_client->/rosout (/rosout)

but unfortunately I don't now how should I fix it.
I tried another configuration, when roscore was running at beaglebone with gpsd_client, and do echo from laptop - this is working without any problem. Just problem apear when I run roscore at one machine and node in another.
I hope that my problem is trivial to fix and I'm just missing some setting.

A:

At laptop (ip 192.168.7.1):

export ROS_IP=192.168.7.1

export ROS_HOSTNAME=192.168.7.1
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.7.1:11311

At beaglebone (ip 192.168.7.2):

export ROS_IP=192.168.7.2

export ROS_HOSTNAME=192.168.7.1
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.7.1:11311

Is that an actual copy/paste? Because you have ROS_HOSTNAME set to the same IP on both machines, which is not what you want I guess.
Also, you should not / don't need to set both ROS_IP and ROS_HOSTNAME at the same time. Just setting ROS_IP should be enough (but make sure to set it to the correct IP). From the wiki/ROS/EnvironmentVariables - ROS_IP/ROS_HOSTNAME page:

[..] The options are mutually exclusive, if both are set ROS_HOSTNAME will take precedence. Use ROS_IP if you are specifying an IP address, and ROS_HOSTNAME if you are specifying a host name. [..]

If you then have ROS_HOSTNAME set to an incorrect IP, things will probably not work.
