Q:

Cannot install ros-noetic-moveit-visual-tools on Ubuntu 20.04, WSL2

Whilst setting up a machine to control a kuka arm, I've run into a problem setting up ROS noetic with moveit.
This system is being built on WSL2 with Ubuntu 20.04 installed. After installing ros-noetic-desktop-full and ros-noetic-moveit without issue, trying to install ros-noetic-moveit-visual-tools fails because the package cannot be found.
executing command [sudo -H apt-get install -y ros-noetic-moveit-visual-tools]
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-noetic-moveit-visual-tools
ERROR: the following rosdeps failed to install
  apt: command [sudo -H apt-get install -y ros-noetic-moveit-visual-tools] failed

This seems odd since it's a standard part of the other distros I've used, and is still referenced in the current tutorials.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

It's actually "just a package", not really anything standard.
Please see #q320046 for the extended version, but in short: according to status_page/ros_noetic_default.html?q=moveit_visual, that package is currently only available in the testing repository (note the red square saying main: none on hover).
It's probably been released only recently into Noetic, and until a "sync" is performed for Noetic, it will not be available from the main repositories.

Okay, Thanks. I'll include it in the package directly in that case.

Switching to the testing repository is a 5 min affair. I'd avoid building from source if at all possible.
