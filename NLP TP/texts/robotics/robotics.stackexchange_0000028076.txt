Q:

Connect SDF model to ROS

Hello, since I'm a newbie in ROS and Gazebo I'm having trouble to find some tutorial or someone who could explain how to connect a robot SDF model to ROS so that I could acquire sensor data. Is there any tutorial or something that could give me a hint or some plugin which can connect a SDF model to ROS like a URDF model? Thanks!

Hello, there are a few resources that can be useful for you:

gazebo_ros_pkg contains a set of ROS packages to communicate Gazebo and your ROS code. I recommend to read the wiki to get a high level overview.
More specifically, take a look at the "Using a URDF in Gazebo" and the follow-up tutorial, where you can learn how to load a plugin (libgazebo_ros_camera.so) that will publish images via a ROS topic and how to visualize them in rviz.
Additionally, you can take a look at the Gazebo intermediate guided tutorials. It's composed by six tutorials where the process of customizing a model in Gazebo is explained. The tutorial number #6 contains instructions for receiving ROS messages and modify your simulation (in this case, spinning a Velodyne sensor).
