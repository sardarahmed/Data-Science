Q:

Rainbowduino 3.0 - Arduino IDE fails to upload

OK, not really robotics, but has anyone been able to upload to a Rainboduino v3.0 using the Arduino IDE? I can't seem to figure it out, and there is virutally no documentation online. I followed this blog entry, but got no connection to the board. 
If anyone can give me some suggestions, I would appreciate it! 

A:

It looks like the Rainbowduino 3.0 uses an ATmega328, so first be sure to choose a board that's using that.
If that doesn't solve the problem, try looking at this wiki article about the Rainboduino v3.0.
