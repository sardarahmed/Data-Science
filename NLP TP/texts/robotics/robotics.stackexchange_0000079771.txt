Q:

catkin_make -j2

Hi,
Me and a fellow student is working on an Autonomous boat project, and while building catkin folders, we struggled with normal use of catkin_make. Tutorials referred to the option -j2 as argument. What does this actually do? we are using a raspberry pi 3b with ubuntu mate.
Thanks

Andreas

A:

With the -j option, you specify the number of threads to use when compiling. See here.
