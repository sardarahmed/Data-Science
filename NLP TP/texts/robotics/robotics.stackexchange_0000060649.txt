Q:

ROS Icon: Network ID (QR CODE)

hi everyone.
i'm running on Ubuntu 12.04, ROS Hydro.
i've been searching for quite a few days already on how to get the ROS icon on turtlebot's computer.
I'm working on Android-Turtlebot kind of thing and I'm experimenting on various WIFI networks and android devices. For convenience and time reduction, I can't afford to key in Turtlebot's IP address manually or scan it under local network every time in my android device...
On turtlebot's laptop, by right clicking the ROS icon and selecting "Network ID", I know it can actually generate a QR code that contains its IP Address so i can just scan it using my android device, capture it and get the connection done. But, I'm unsure on how to get the icon up on turtlebot's laptop in the first place.
This is what i'm talking about:
-image 1-
-image 2-
I read somewhere that it has to do with Zxing.
Help please guys. Thanks

A:

The "Icon" is part of some external debian packages.

Also, you could reinstall Ubuntu from the TurtleBot ISO image.
