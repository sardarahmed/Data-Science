Q:

Can anyone help me solve the error related to robot_description on parameter server?

The error exactly is
[ERROR] [1546860953.191408064]: Could not find parameter robot_description on parameter server
[rob_st_pub-6] process has died [pid 2696, exit code 255, cmd /opt/ros/kinetic/lib/robot_state_publisher/robot_state_publisher robot_description:=spider_robot_description /joint_states:=/spider_joint_states __name:=rob_st_pub __log:=/home/microbot/.ros/log/63188c6c-1270-11e9-929e-2c6e85b13edd/rob_st_pub-6.log].
log file: /home/microbot/.ros/log/63188c6c-1270-11e9-929e-2c6e85b13edd/rob_st_pub-6*.log

I am beginner, from what  I have understood, I believe the error is caused because robot_state_publisher node can not fetch the robot_description in order to work with. But when I checked the parameter list using  command I could see the robot_description parameter in the list and also I could see the xml file created from xacro when I checked with  command. Now I am unsure about the reason behind this error. Here I am also attaching my control launch file,
<launch>

  <!-- Load joint controller configurations from YAML file to parameter server -->
  <rosparam file="$(find spider_control)/config/spider_control.yaml" command="load"/>

  <!-- load the controllers -->

</launch>

Please help me find the reason behind this error. Thanks in advance.

when i try to publish the joint angle using rostopic pub and position controllers, it returns saying publishing and latching for 3 seconds but I could not see any change with that particular joint on gazebo, is this related to the previous error aswell ? thank you

Thanks, I have solved that error. It is caused because in my control launch file I remapped the robot_description to spider_robot_description for my robot_state_publisher but when googled I came to know that robot_state_publisher by default looks for robot_description in parameter server.

So if you happen to remap your robot_description for the node, then make sure your node searches for the same.
