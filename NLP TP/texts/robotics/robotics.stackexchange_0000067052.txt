Q:

raspberry pi 2 model B can not connect to the network

Dear friends:
I am a newer to raspberry pi and to ubuntu.I install ubuntu in raspberry pi 2 model B.The ubuntu is downloaded from the website link text.
I find that the ubuntu is minimal ubuntu-standard version without GUI. I should connect to the network to use the apt-get method to install lxde.But I find that LAN is without driver.Whether  people who use raspberry pi 2 model B with ubuntu face this network problem? And how do you solve it? Please tell me.
Thanks a lot.
