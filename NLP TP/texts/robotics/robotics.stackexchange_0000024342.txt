Q:

Gazebo Plugin not found

I am trying to simulate wind on gazebo garden on ubuntu 22.04. So, I found this plugin libgz-sim-wind-effects-system.so in my plugins path and included it as follows:
<plugin name="gz::sim::v7::systems::WindEffects" filename="libgz-sim-wind-effects-system.so">
                <direction>0</direction>
                <speed>100000</speed>
                <turbulence>0.5</turbulence>
            </plugin>

However, I keep getting this error
`Failed to load plugin [libgz-sim-wind-effects-system.so] : couldn't find shared library.`

But the file exists in the same path as other plugins I'm using in the same file and I added the path of the file to the environment variable as such
export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/

So, any idea what is the problem here? Also, is this the correct plugin and should I be another plugin to simulate wind.

A:

The correct syntax is
    <plugin
      filename="gz-sim-wind-effects-system"
      name="gz::sim::systems::WindEffects">

So you'd need to remove lib from the filename. Also, it's not necessary to include the anonymous namespace v7.
You can also run the wind.sdf example and see if that works for you:
