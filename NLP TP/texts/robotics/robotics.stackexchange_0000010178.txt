Q:

Switch activated by a microcontroller

I'm working on a project where I'm using a voltage that is higher than what most microcontrollers can handle. I'm looking for a kind of switch that will connect a power source to an electromagnet and all of this controlled by my microcontroller. I also thought about using a potentiometer to control the speed of two high voltage DC motors via my microcontroller so please tell me if this is a good idea aswell. 
Thanks for your time

A:

You can use a relay for the switch. Relays typically have 4 pins: 2 are the switch, and the other 2 control the switch. For reed relays, the switch is a small metal reed (normally closed) that makes contact when an internal electromagnetic coil is powered. 
You have to pick the right relay so that your microcontroller can supply sufficient current to controlling pins of the relay. You also need to make sure that the switch of the relay can handle the current flowing from your power source to the electromagnet.
For the motors, consider getting a separate motor control board, which will isolate your microcontroller from the motors and allow you to control their velocity with PWM--you can then use the potentiometer to set the specific PWM duty cycle to control the motors.
