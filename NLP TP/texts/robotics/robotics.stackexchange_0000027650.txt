Q:

Is gazebo ros packages available for Gazebo7 and ROS Jade now?

My Ubuntu version is 15.04 with ROS Jade. Initially there is Gazebo 5 but I just wonder whether I should install Gazebo 7 or not. On one hand, I want to take advantage of the new features of Gazebo 7. On the other hand I am not sure if a gazebo-ros packages for ROS Jade and Gazebo 7 is available because the integration of Gazebo and ROS is of great importance to me. And help is appreciated.

A:

Yes, it is. Just type these commands in the terminal to install gazebo7-related packages with ROS Jade:
sudo apt-get install ros-jade-gazebo7-msgs
sudo apt-get install ros-jade-gazebo7-ros
sudo apt-get install ros-jade-gazebo7-plugins
sudo apt-get install ros-jade-gazebo7-ros-pkgs

Note that the ros-jade-gazebo7-ros-pkgs package is a meta-package that will install the other three. Also remember to setup the packages.osrfoundation.org repo in order to use them. Full information is available in the tutorial: http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_wrapper_versions&cat=connect_ros
