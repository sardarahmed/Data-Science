Q:

several catkin workspaces

Hi all,
Is it possible to have several catkin workspaces and to source them sequentially in the .bashrc without conflict or may we experience issues with that?
source /ws1/devel/setup.bash
source /ws2/devel/setup.bash
source /ws3/devel/setup.bash
# ...

Thanks

Effectively the last line will "overwrite" all previously sources workspaces. You should chain your workspaces on top of each other as described in the answer from @joq and only source the leaf workspace.

A:

For people having packages coming from different git/subversion repositories with their own file hierarchy not catkin-compliant and wanted to create several catkin workspaces because of these, I suggest to create a unique "central" catkin workspaces with symbolic links pointing to your git/svn repos, by this way you don't break the file hierarchy of your repos.
