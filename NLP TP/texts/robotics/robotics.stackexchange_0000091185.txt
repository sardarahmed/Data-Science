Q:

How was the "ROS Package by License" generated?

There is an interesting page titled ROS Package by License still hosted on docs.ros.org, although there's no newer version than for ROS Diamondback.
This was probably output by some script running on "the old" ROS buildfarm (or perhaps even by hand?), but I've not been able to find something similar so I was wondering if that script would still be around somewhere.

A:

Hello,
I found this script : https://github.com/ros/documentation/blob/electric/rosdoc/src/rosdoc/licenseindex.py
It's used in this script : https://github.com/ros/documentation/blob/electric/rosdoc/src/rosdoc/init.py
To populate the template at : https://github.com/ros/documentation/blob/electric/rosdoc/templates/license-index.html
Everything is still on the electric tag and diamondback tag in rosdoc : https://github.com/ros/documentation/tree/electric
But it need a lot of refreshing (The license name are hardcoded), it has been deleted by kwc here : https://github.com/ros/documentation/commit/cb6b713636b774cfa1c2bd7bdb94a20c0a16e6af#diff-23aa12dcb58c651d407414f40b5f8afd

Thanks. That seems to be the code indeed.
