Q:

Why are my comments on ROS Answers disappearing?

This is more of a meta question, but: when I try to comment on an answer to one of my questions, then hit "add comment", the comment appears below the answer. But then when I refresh the page, the comment is gone like it didn't save or something. This makes it impossible to ask follow-up questions. Any ideas as to why this is happening to me?
Reading the FAQ, it says that the karma requirement for adding comments is 1, and I have more than that.
