Q:

gazebo-1.4 with player example - errors

Hi,
I'm trying to get player to work with gazebo to control a pioneer robot.  I used the example provided with gazebo-1.4 in the examples/player/position2d folder.  Here are the problems I encountered:

The .world was in the old sdf format, so I tried using gzsdf to convert it.  gzsdf failed because the filename did not end with .sdf.  So after the renaming the world file, it worked.

Player was able to connect to gazebo and playerv opened its window, but when I tried to subscribe to position2d it gave the following error:
GazeboDriver::GazeboDriver
Gazebo Plugin driver creating 1 device
6665.4.0 is  a position2d interface.

Hi,  I installed from mercurial today and ran the test again.  It works - I can control the robot using player, but I still get error messages such as:
libprotobuf ERROR google/protobuf/message_lite.cc:123] Can't parse message of type "gazebo.msgs.Pose" because it is missing required fields: position, orientation
