Q:

array of strings as param tag in launch file

Hi,
I'm trying to read an array of strings into my ros node. Here is the line in my launch file
<param name="string_list" value="[this, is, a, string, array]"/>
And here is the nh.getParam() call in my node

ros::NodeHandle nh("~");`

std::vectorstd::string string_list;

nh.getParam("string_list", string_list);

I know that the param is there when I do a rosparam list. And i know the namespaces are correct since it works with a simple int param. But in this case with a vector of strings, when I read the string_list after the getParam() call, it is of 0 length
What am I doing wrong?
Thank you

<arg name="string_list" default="[this, is, list]"/>
<rosparam param="string_list" subst_value="True">$(arg string_list)</rosparam>
This shows the following error: requires the 'string_list' arg to be set
