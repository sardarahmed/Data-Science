Q:

Indigo on Trusty

Hey,
So I wanted to go ahead of time and install indigo on ubuntu trusty (14.04), but found out the binaries are incomplete? ros-indigo-desktop* doesn't exist at least. Many binaries do seem to exist, I thought maybe I could install all of them and have a working ROS, but alas, no catkin_make even.
Is this a matter of waiting? Or can I do something? (preferably without going towards installing from source)
Best regards,
Hans
edit: Just tried to build from source as well, the rosinstall_generator fails with :
The following not released packages/stacks will be ignored: desktop-full
No packages/stacks left after ignoring not released

Hi.
Did you manage to sort out this problem?
It is now well past may, and i still can't get this installed on ubuntu 14.04.03.
Cheers

You have a different problem and are not running 14.04.3 but 15.04: http://answers.ros.org/question/217485/ros-indigo-on-ubuntu-140403-e-unable-to-locate-package-ros-indigo-desktop-full/

A:

Not all packages for desktop-full have been released into Indigo yet. As you mention you can get a lot of packages already but indigo is still in pre-release stage.
Indigo's target release date is in May. http://wiki.ros.org/indigo

Thank you for your reply. I got a long way compiling ros_comm and installing the rest.

I still get this problem. Has indigo not yet been released for trusty, or what is the deal?

No, it's been out for a long time. Please ask a new question with full details of what you're doing and what's failing if you're still having trouble.
