Q:

Reem Gazebo launch error

Env: Ubuntu 12.04, ROS Hydro,
Followed the instructions on Launching a REEM Gazebo simulation.
Installation went fine, but met with error while roslaunch
ResourceNotFound: imu_sensor_controller

Did
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-imu-sensor-controller

which solved that probem.
Later continued with Reem simulation
roslaunch reem_gazebo reem_empty_world.launch

An empty gazebo launches but without the REEM robot, and there is no file named 'gazebo-2*.log'

A:

terminate called after throwing an instance of 'Ogre::InvalidParametersException'

  what():  OGRE EXCEPTION(2:InvalidParametersException): Framebuffer incomplete or other FBO status error in GLFrameBufferObject::initialise at /build/buildd/ogre-1.7.4/RenderSystems/GL/src/OgreGLFrameBufferObject.cpp (line 280)

That points to issues with your graphic card (drivers). Gazebo is quite an intensive application.
What kind of system are you trying to run this on? Have you installed the correct drivers?

Edit: see also Error in launching turtlebot fi.
