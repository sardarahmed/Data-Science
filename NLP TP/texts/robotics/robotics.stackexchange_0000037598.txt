Q:

Transforming PointCloud2

I would like to know if somebody knows what is the substitute for the function of transformPointCloud() for PointCloud2 data type as in this question. I've tried to go to the link provided but it seems to be deprecated(I guess) as I cannot find in my autocompletion mode.
Thanks in advance.

A:

You had found the correct answer: pcl_ros::transformPointCloud() is the function to call.
The generated documentation link may have changed. Try looking for it starting with the  main pcl_ros API page.

Last time, i just included "#include <pcl_ros/point_cloud.h>", but this one doesn't suffice.

I see, thanks a lot for the clarification.

I never heard it was deprecated. For Fuerte, the big PCL library will become a rosdep, but pcl_ros still exists.

Thanks a lot. That worked! By the way, why someone said that pcl_ros is deprecated already, but when I go to the API doc, it is still someone actively committing codes last few days?

Did you #include <pcl_ros/transforms.h> ?

Why can't I use it? I've already included pcl_ros in the manifest.xml
