Q:

rosmake does not respect ROS_PARALLEL_JOBS or --pjobs

rosmake in ROS fuerte does not seem to respect the ROS_PARALLEL_JOBS=-jN environment variable nor the --pjobs=N command line option for compiling with N+1 processes.
Instead, the number of rosmake instances spawned is always equal to the number of cores detected (regardless of whether or not that is more or fewer than the number specified via ROS_PARALLEL_JOBS or --pjobs).
The ROS wiki page on environment variables says setting ROS_PARALLEL_JOBS should work, but I have multiple installations of ROS that display this behavior.
Has anyone else had this problem?

A:

That bug is known:
https://code.ros.org/trac/ros/ticket/4036
https://github.com/ros/ros/issues/4
and a fix will be soon be released for fuerte and later.
In the meantime a workaround is using this (for experts):
export MAKEFLAGS="-j8"
