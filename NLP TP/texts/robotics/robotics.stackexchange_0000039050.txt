Q:

ImportError: No module named msg

Hey, I'm a new ROS user and tried to use actionlib. I created a new package 'tuck_arms_server' and defined the message in .action file. After compiling the package, the msg folder is automatically created. But then my python code, I wanted to do this: "import from tuck_arms_server.msg import *", but I got the error: ImportError: No module named msg.
some relevant lines in my code:
import roslib; roslib.load_manifest('tuck_arms_server');
in CMakeLists.txt:(just followed the tutorial)
rosbuild_find_ros_package(actionlib_msgs)
include(${actionlib_msgs_PACKAGE_PATH}/cmake/actionbuild.cmake)
genaction()

also added this line to the manifest file:
<depend package="actionlib_msgs"/>

So why cant it recognize msg in my package tuck_arms_server ? Thanks in advance.:-)

You wrote "import from tuck_arms_server import *", which is not valid Python. Is that what you meant? (If not, you should probably edit the question)

A:

@Mac is right: Your import syntax is incorrect.  Please see the rospy tutorials  for correct syntax.
