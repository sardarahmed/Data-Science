Q:

How to find mathematical model of a wheeled robot (to compute robot's trajectory at given time steps) including its kinematic

I would like to learn, how to find proper kinematic model of robot in mathematical form.
For example:
I would like to create a model of a car, from which I could compute its position and rotation at given time steps.
Assume Ackerman steering system and knowns l, w (see picture)
Inputs are:

constant speed of wheels's rolling
variable velocity of wheels's steering

I found similar problem here path-of-a-simple-turning-car. I think principal is the same, but my question is what are the steps to find proper model. I understand the equations in the link, but I would not be able to make them on my own and slight change in geometry of robot  would confuse me.

This lecture from Georgia Tech's Control of Mobile Robot's Coursera class derives the bicycle model; https://youtu.be/cQWhYCrK06M
