Q:

Controlling a system with delayed measurements

Assume I have a rather simple system I want to control, but all sensor measurements exhibit considerable time delay, i.e.:
$z_t = h(x_{(t-d)}) \neq h(x_t)$ 
With my limited knowledge about control, I could imagine the following setup:

One observer estimates the delayed state $x_{(t-d)}$ using control input and (delayed) measurements.
A second observer uses the delayed observer's estimate and predicts the current state $x_t$ using the last control inputs between delayed measurement and current time.
The second observer's estimate is used to control the system.

Can I do any better than that? What is the standard approch to this problem? And is there any literature or research about this topic?

A:

Delayed measurements are a very common occurrence in LBL sonar positioning, commonly used by AUVs.  Modified Kalman filters are a common solution.  I searched for "LBL", "delay", and "EKF".  Here are a few reasonable papers:

Delayed-state sigma point Kalman filters for underwater navigation
Contributions to Automated Realtime Underwater Navigation
Self Consistent Bathymetric Mapping from Robotic Vehicles
in the Deep Ocean

The discussion of Navigation Filters (section 17) in the MOOS manual
