Q:

ROS2 components tutorial fails to launch

https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Tutorials/Composition/
I tried to follow the composition tutorial for ROS2 using the official docker images but it fails to load even the sample components. Is this a bug or did I mess something up?
Terminal #1:
$ docker run --name fox --rm -it osrf/ros:foxy-desktop
root@a32781ba07af:/# ros2 run rclcpp_components component_container
[INFO] [1607722128.302447462] [ComponentManager]: Load Library: /opt/ros/foxy/lib/libtalker_component.so

Terminal #2:
$ docker exec -it fox /ros_entrypoint.sh bash

A:

Using osrf/ros2:nightly-rmw works as expected.
It looks like ros:foxy-desktop has not been updated in a few months. Is this a bug and if so, where should it be reported.

You can report it here:
https://github.com/osrf/docker_images
The osrf/ros repo still isn't as automated as the official library/ros image builds, given DockerHub deprecated triggering automated builds from official library images a year or so ago.
https://github.com/osrf/docker_images/issues/362
I'd recommend using the official repo for most uptodate images:
https://hub.docker.com/_/ros
