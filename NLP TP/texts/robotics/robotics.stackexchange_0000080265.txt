Q:

How can I perform loop closure in graph SLAM?

Hi,
I am trying to implement graph based SLAM and I am using g2o for backend. So far I have

Constructed a graph using laser data i.e pose-pose graph
I dont have any odometry source so I used Scan_matcher to estimate pose constraints

Now I dont understand how to add and loop closures in my graph. I read some papers but the implementation details are naive to me. I would be thankful if someone could point me in the right direction
Thanks

A:

You can use slam_karto_g2o. It uses open_karto for the front-end and g2o for the backend. Other options are slam_karto and nav2d, both of which use sparse_bundle_adjustment for the backend.
