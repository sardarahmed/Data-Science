Q:

Installing Indigo on Mac OS X Maverick boost cannot be found cpp_common

When installing Indigo on Mac. I get an error stating that Boost cannot be found while compiling cpp_common. Did anyone have the same problem?
Im compiling using:
  ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

Error:

A:

I have added the following code in "./src/roscpp_core/cpp_common/CMakeLists.txt" and it seems that it has to have compiled correctly:
SET(CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH ${CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH} "/usr/local/include/")
SET(CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH ${CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH} "/usr/local/include/")
FIND_PACKAGE(Boost)
IF (Boost_FOUND)
   INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${Boost_INCLUDE_DIR})
   ADD_DEFINITIONS( "-DHAS_BOOST" )
ENDIF()

It is strange that you would have to do this. Can you edit your question with more details about your environment (OS X verison etc) and what steps you followed to install indigo?
