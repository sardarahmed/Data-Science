Q:

Types of input for get_logger in ros2 RCLCPP_INFO

Hi,
I was trying to find what types of input can be provided for

RCLCPP_INFO(get_logger(), "data: %*", data)

I had used %s for string kind of output but was wondering if it can take any other types of data. While looking over some codes I saw the use of %g not sure what it represents.
Thanks in advance.

A:

The second argument in the logging macros is a format specification, i.e. a pointer to a null-terminated multibyte string specifying how to interpret the data. As such, you can use any standard format specifier accepted by printf. Here's a small reference list: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/c/fprintf
Also, from the same link: %g converts floating-point number to decimal or decimal exponent notation depending on the value and the precision.

Can I know which second argument you are talking about?

In RCLCPP_INFO(get_logger(), "data: %s", "message") the "data: %s" const character buffer would correspond to the second argument.
