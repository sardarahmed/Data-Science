Q:

ICP scan matching failure

Hello, ROS people.
I am using ROS laser_scan_matcher but faced this ICP failure.
Please have a look the following video.

Is there anyone who encountered this and any recommendations?
Cheers.

Not sure about ICP, but you could also try hector_mapping and see if it works better. We normally get good results with the Hokuyo UTM-30LX scanner and similar scenarios like that shown in your video.
/edit: Updated results with hector_mapping. I found that increasing the scan queue size from 5 to 25 gets rid of all errors, resulting in nice map without inconsistencies. It's a interesting question why that is though, considering that it takes only 4-8% of CPU (probably idling waiting for transforms). Map looks like this:

The results can be reproduced using this launch file. Similar to this tutorial, just start the launch file in one terminal:
roslaunch hector_slam_launch postproc_qut_logs.launch

and then play back your bagfile in another terminal:
rosbag play 2.5D_bag02.bag --clock

Thank you for reply. I tried to run with hector_mapping but it keeps complaining "lookupTransform base_footprint to laser timed out. Could not transform laser scan into base_frame." I might need time to run it with. If you could run it with the linked bag file, it would be great to see  results.

The bag file link is https://dl.dropbox.com/u/12446150/2.5D_bag02.bag
Thank you.
