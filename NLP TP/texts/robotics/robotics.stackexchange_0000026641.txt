Q:

Error using DRCSim (Gazebo) on hydro - Unable to read file[.../atlas.urdf]

Hi, I'm using DRCSim 2.6.6 and gazebo 1.8 on ROS Hydro. When I roslaunch atlas.launch this error appears:
failed to start local process: /opt/ros/hydro/lib/stereo_image_proc/stereo_image_proc __name:=stereo_proc __log:=/home/gustavo/.ros/log/eca8b864-fb95-11e2-b1fd-001e65d8adfa/multisense_sl-camera-stereo_proc-6.log
local launch of stereo_image_proc/stereo_image_proc failed
[multisense_sl/camera/stereo_proc-6] process has died [pid -1, exit code 127, cmd /opt/ros/hydro/lib/stereo_image_proc/stereo_image_proc __name:=stereo_proc __log:=/home/gustavo/.ros/log/eca8b864-fb95-11e2-b1fd-001e65d8adfa/multisense_sl-camera-stereo_proc-6.log].
log file: /home/gustavo/.ros/log/eca8b864-fb95-11e2-b1fd-001e65d8adfa/multisense_sl-camera-stereo_proc-6*.log

Error [parser.cc:636] Unable to read file[/usr/local/share/drcsim-2.6/gazebo_models/atlas_description/atlas/atlas.urdf]

Error [Server.cc:284] Unable to read sdf file[atlas.world]
Error [ConnectionManager.cc:123] Connection Manager is not running
[gazebo-2] process has finished cleanly

This appears after a stereo_image_proc error. so, Is this only gazebo issue or is related with the previous error?

A:

I rebuild gazebo and DRCSim and now it works, but this warning keeps showing:
Warning: The notion of a group name for collision tags is not supported by URDF.

You can ignore that warning message.
