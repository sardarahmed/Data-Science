Q:

Could not find the controller_interface package

This was working, I have just realized that  it is failing:
roslaunch rrobt__gazebo rrbot.launch
[FATAL] [1378739384.640356370, 0.219000000]: Failed to create robot simulation interface loader: rospack could not find the controller_interface package containing controller_interface::ControllerBase
Using Ubuntu 12.04, ros_hydro from deb, and gazebo-1.9.1 from source.
Any idea?
