Q:

dynamixel_control no motor found /dynamixel mx-64AR, usb2dynamixel

Hi guys,
I am trying to use the new robotis servo: dynamixel MX-64AR, but I cannot find the servo both in win8 and ubuntu 14.04.
in win8, I tried to use RoboPlus Wizard to search all the bps, nothing found...
in Ros, I run: roslaunch my_dynamixel_tutorial controller_manager.launch,
and I got:

[FATAL] [WallTime: 1427898248.149759] pan_tilt_port: No motors found.

and I am sure of this :
ls -l /dev/ttyUSB0 

crw-rw-rw- 1 root dialout 188, 0  4æœˆ  1 22:51 /dev/ttyUSB0 ....

About the HW, I use usb2dynamixel, RS485 -4p interface, and the switcher is in the middle.
the power support is a takasago ex-375l, I set output as 12.5 v, 0.4A, the motor led flashed when it's powered  on.
And I had checked the 4p cable, all the four lines are good.
About the ros version;
rosversion dynamixel_controllers

0.4.0

$ dpkg -p ros-indigo-dynamixel-controllers | grep Ver

Version: 0.4.0-0trusty-20150305-1931-+0000

about the bps in the launch file, the parameter of the servo is link:here, the default bps of mx-64ar should be 57142.... I had tried 57142, 57143, 57142.9 and 1000000, no one works.
I am really screwed here.......................
HEEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLLLLLPPPPPPP!

What version of dynamixel package are you using? Add to your original question the following command result for the future refenrence:
$ rosversion dynamixel_controllers
0.4.0
$ dpkg -p ros-indigo-dynamixel-controllers | grep Ver
Version: 0.4.0-0trusty-20150327-0507-+0000

Hi guys, finally, I went to the Robotis Shop, and they test my motor and a new mx-64ar and an AX series motor, however, only the AX motor can work. So it seems like that this batch of mx-64ar productions have a lot defectives.
What's a bad luck, a defective pesters me 5 days....................

one more thing just for reminding the followers, with the new mx-64ar I exchanged from the shop, everything works well, but the default baud of this motor is 57143.....if you want to ping it  through "controller_manager.launch". note that 57142 doesn't work here, although it works in RoboPlus.
