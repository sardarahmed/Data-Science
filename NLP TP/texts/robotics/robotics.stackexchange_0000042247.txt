Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: notice wall

hello,
i am trying to program my robot so that he drives straight ahead until he is close to a wall or so, and then he should turn right or so... just drive ahead in a other way.
So my question is, if i get my data from my sensors and make a map out of them, is there any way how i can use that information,or are there some packages at ros.org, to notice wehen i am to close to a wall? I am using a Hokuyu laser

A:

hello,
you better start reading navigation tutorials
if you need something that simple you can write your own code. just subscribe your laser scan messages, put  a threshold value (i.e 50 cm close to an object ) then send velocity commands or position commands to your robot's motor drivers. if you are not familiar with ros, you can start from here
hope this helps you out
