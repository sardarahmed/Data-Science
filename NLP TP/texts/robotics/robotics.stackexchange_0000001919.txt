Q:

How can we manage stepper motor cables?

I need to actuate 3 or 4 Cnc-like Nema 23 (~1N.m torque) stepper motors, I would like some cable solution to connect easily the motor to the motor driver. 
I have not yet bought anything, I have searched various robotic stores and ebay, but did not yet found a triple (motor, cables, driver) which would be "plug and play". 
As stepper motors usually have 4 to 6 cables, and there are multiple motors, manual soldering everything would be too time consuming, error prone and messy.
Is there a standard way to deal with cables for stepper motors ?

A:

Don't worry about the cables; plan to make them yourself.  I recommend using one of the wide variety of crimp-on connectors available to you, depending on what you can find for your ESC and steppers connections.
Here are a handful of connectors representing part of what we stock in our lab:

The white connector is the Molex Minifit, the black one to its right is the Molex Microfit, and the 1/8" miniplug is for scale.  Using these connectors can involve either soldering them to a board, or using a crimp tool and crimp-on terminations which are then snapped into the plug body.
This allows the cables to be run much more precisely than they would be if you just made solder connections in the middle of the cable length.
