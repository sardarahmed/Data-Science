Q:

Turtlebot wheel tf jumping

I see TF from base_footprint to wheel links are slightly jumping when it is moving while sending Twist message( (-)0.5 x vel)) using teleop_twist_keyboard.
Has anyone seen this problem?

We are using Precise + Groovy here.

We also have tested with different robot_state_publisher publish_frequency. But it was not a slow update issue.

A:

This looks like different timing.  rviz by default renders the latest information about every link.  There's an experimental button you could try at the bottom right (in the time bar) to see if it "fixes" it?
