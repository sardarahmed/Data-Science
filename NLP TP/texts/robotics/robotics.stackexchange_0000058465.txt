Q:

Porting visp release to trusty/indigo

I'm porting visp to indigo. According to http://www.ros.org/debbuild/indigo.html?q=visp it fails for trusty with the followin error (see http://jenkins.ros.org/view/IbinT32/job/ros-indigo-visp_binarydeb_trusty_i386/lastBuild/console):
package ros-indigo-visp does not have dependency [ffmpeg]
Dependencies not satisfied for packages: ['ffmpeg']
Process leaked file descriptors. See http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Spawning+processes+from+build for more information
Build step 'Execute shell' marked build as failure
Build step 'Groovy Postbuild' marked build as failure
Build step 'Groovy Postbuild' marked build as failure

In https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/blob/master/rosdep/base.yaml, ffmpeg dependency is now specific for trusty. We have:
ffmpeg:
  ubuntu:
     trusty: [libavcodec-dev, libavformat-dev, libavutil-dev, libswscale-dev]

I can't understand wy I get this error "Dependencies not satisfied for packages: ['ffmpeg']". It should not happen as ffmpeg is not a dep for trusty. I'm wrong. Is there a problem with the build farm.
Moreover I'm also surprised with the last lines of the log:
Build step 'Groovy Postbuild' marked build as failure

The build is for indigo. Wy does it mention groovy ?

A:

You need to re bloom the package now that the rosdep rules have been updated. The debian metadata is generated by bloom using the rosdep rules. You can just rerun bloom to generate (no upstream release required) new sourcedeb with the updated rosdep mappings.
