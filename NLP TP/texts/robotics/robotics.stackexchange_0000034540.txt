Q:

Can't manage to install teleop_base package

Hey guys,
I'm new to ROS and I recently finished the documentation's tutorial. My next step would be to try some ROS functionalities in a simulator before putting them to practice with a real robot.
I tried to follow the 'stage' tutorial (here), but I can't get past the step after 'rosmake stage'. I don't know how to 'install' the teleop_base package. I get that with svn you check the version and in the link there are the files, but... is there a simple command to do this or do I download everything and include its path in $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH?
Here's what pops up when I try 'rosmake teleop_base'

'[ rosmake ] Packages requested are:
['teleop_base']
[ rosmake ] Logging to
directory/home/alonsoj1/.ros/rosmake/rosmake_output-20110928-154556
[ rosmake ] Expanded args
['teleop_base'] to: []
[ rosmake ] WARNING: The following
args could not be parsed as stacks or
packages: ['teleop_base']
[ rosmake ] ERROR: No arguments could
be parsed into valid package or stack
names.

What does this mean? I just would like to be able to control the robot with the keyboard.
Thanks!

A:

You need to include the new directory in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. I do this by adding the following to my .bashrc:
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/myuser/mypackagesdirectory:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

or
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/myuser/mypackagesdirectory:/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks

(Don't forget to source your .bashrc after adding this line)
