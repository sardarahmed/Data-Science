Q:

Can Gazebo be made repeatable?

Hi,
For testing purposes I would like to ensure that my world is in exactly the same state at each time tick every time I launch the simulation.  I found the --seed flag but I'm still seeing randomness.  Is it possible to make a repeatable simulation in Gazebo?
Thanks.

A:

I had an asynchronous process call.  Using the seed flag does in fact make repeatable results for gazebo.
