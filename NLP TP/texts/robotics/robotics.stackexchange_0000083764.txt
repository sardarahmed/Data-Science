Q:

GUI based control in ROS

I am trying to develop an application, which has a robot having multiple tasks. For example task 1 can be "move left arm", task 2 can be "move both the arms", task 3 can be "start recording from the camera" etc. I have written the code for doing all these tasks in ROS using c++ and python.
At present, I can visualize robot and camera output inside RViz. However, I want to create some GUI elements such as Buttons. Button 1 can be  "move left arm", similarly button 2 can be "move both the arms" etc.
I am not able to find out the documentation in order to add GUI elements in RViz. I am looking for suggestions and references. Thank you very much.

A:

You are going to need to create a custom rviz plugin. There are several tutorials
I think you'll likely want to first look at the New Dockable Panel which shows how to make a TeleopPanel as an example: http://docs.ros.org/lunar/api/rviz_plugin_tutorials/html/panel_plugin_tutorial.html

Thank you very much. Meanwhile, I shifted to RQT and developed a custom plugin. It was quite easy as it was based on QT on python. I will surely check your suggestion too.
