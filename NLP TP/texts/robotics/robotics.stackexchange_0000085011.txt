Q:

Human tracking path planning method

Hi,
I have started a human tracking project.  I have already the position of the Target Person to follow (by LIDAR and Radio). Now,I am searching the "best" way to generate a trajectory (or a velocity command). As far as I understood the Artificial Potential Field could be a logic candidate and I do not need to use the nav stack. I am searching a simple and easy to implement method which has certain robustness level too.
I would appreciate your thoughts about this. Do you propose another method?
Thanks,

Sorry for the noise but I wonder what you are using for Lidar & Radio tracking of a person.

You can start with the leg_detector package.

A:

We really need to know what sort of environment this will be operated in and what type of platform will be following the human in order to help you with this. It is a UAV flying through a jungle or a turtle bot driving through an office for example?

Thanks a lot @PeteBlackerThe3rd for your answer.
Our platform is a Differential Wheeled Robot. We would like that the robot follows the operator in outdoor environment (for example an agriculture field).

Okay, I've got a good idea now. The route planning is the easy part of this, the hard part is perceiving the terrain so you can determine were is safe/dangerous/impossible for your robot. Next question, how are you mapping your environment?
