Q:

How to refresh automatically global costmap in Rviz

Hello! I'm wondering how to automatically refresh the global costmap visualization on Rviz. The problem is: I have an initial global costmap and I add an obstacle in gazebo. At this point the global costmap in Rviz should update, but it doesn't. Is there any refresh option? I'm sure that at low level the global costmap is updating since if I disable and then enable the global costmap button, Rviz visualize the new costmap.

It should be updating then. I'm not sure what the error is.

The error is that in Rviz it's not updating the global costmap but ramains the old one. If I disable and enable angain the costmap in Rviz it visualize. I don't want to do this trick every time but I want that Rviz does it automatically

The costmap_2d has a parameter called publish_frequency (default: 0.0)

yes! There was the default value! I simply changed it to 5.0 and it works! Thanks a lot :)
