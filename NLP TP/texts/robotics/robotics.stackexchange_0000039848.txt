Q:

Ultrasonic range sensors in gazebo

Hi, I've been trying to find a robot with at least one ultrasonic range sensor that is already simulated in Gazebo so I can see how it is programmed, but I can't find any, and I see that there isn't a question about this (or I can't find it, of course...)
Thanks in advance!
Miguel.

A:

Take a look at the reem_common and reem_plugins stacks (they work with ROS Electric). They respectively contain examples of a URDF model with sonars/IRs, and plugins for simulating such sensors in gazebo. HTH.

Thanks Adolfo, I'll look into it but it seems to be exactly what I wanted :)

could you compile the package reem_plugins with rosmake in fuerte? It gives me problems with the includes path like gazebo/Sonar.hh, gazebo / Global.hh etc.
I find Sensor.hh but I but not Global.hh Where must I looking for this header?

The package has no fuerte support. In fact, it will probably never have, but rather jump to Groovy. Feel free to send a patch to our github issue tracker if you ever migrate it to Fuerte.
