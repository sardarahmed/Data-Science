Q:

Any idea to obtain object distance or size from Velodyne point cloud?

Hi,
I am working on VLP 16 velodyne data and I would like to detect the size of an object from the point cloud. I can calculate the size of the object if I obtain the distance and vice versa using simple trigonometry (since angular resolution is known). Since, lidars are laser beams, I am curious if ROS provides access to ToF values of the laser beams so that I can calculate distance from it? Or is there any better way to detect the size of an object or its distance from the lidar point cloud?

A:

The velodyne_points point cloud is a 3D representation in units of meters (the ROS standard). The trigonometry is been done by the velodyne_pointcloud package.
