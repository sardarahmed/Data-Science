Q:

catkin_make fails

Hi,
I get an
ImportError: "from catkin_pkg.package import parse_package" failed: No module named workspaces Make sure that you have installed "catkin_pkg", it is up to date and on the PYTHONPATH. 

The same package compiles on another computer. The suggestions from [0] didn't work for me, any ideas?
PYTHONPATH: /opt/ros/groovy/lib/python2.7/dist-packages

$ dpkg -L python-catkin-pkg
    /.
    /usr
    /usr/bin
    /usr/bin/catkin_create_pkg
    /usr/share
    /usr/share/python-support
    /usr/share/python-support/python-catkin-pkg.public
    /usr/share/pyshared
    /usr/share/pyshared/catkin_pkg
    /usr/share/pyshared/catkin_pkg/package.py
    /usr/share/pyshared/catkin_pkg/packages.py
    /usr/share/pyshared/catkin_pkg/package_templates.py
    /usr/share/pyshared/catkin_pkg/__init__.py
    /usr/share/pyshared/catkin_pkg/topological_order.py
    /usr/share/pyshared/catkin_pkg-0.1.4.egg-info
    /usr/share/doc
    /usr/share/doc/python-catkin-pkg
    /usr/share/doc/python-catkin-pkg/changelog.Debian.gz

$ python -c 'import catkin_pkg; print(catkin_pkg.__file__)'
/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/catkin_pkg/__init__.pyc

Many thanks!

A:

This is a common problem where you have catkin_pkg from pip located at /usr/local/lib... which is out-of-date and overriding the up-to-date catkin_pkg from apt. The answer in the referenced question should work for you, but here is another answer which describes the same problem and a similar solution, maybe it will work for you:
