Q:

catkin_make error in Groovy

I recently installed groovy and I am trying to configure my installation, I have sourced the setup.bash file however when trying to configure my catkin workspace gives me error. When I try catkin_make inside catkin_ws, I get the following error;
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/groovy/bin/catkin_make", line 19, in <module>
    from catkin.init_workspace import init_workspace
ImportError: No module named init_workspace

Any help folks ? If rosbuild was available on groovy - I guess I would have gladly used that.

By the way a lot of packages are still using rosbuild in groovy.

@Dirk Thomas So ! catkin is not essential for groovy -- I CAN use rosbuild ?
Comment by joq on 2013-01-03:
Yes, rosbuild works fine with groovy.

@joq Thank you !

A:

You have likely another version of catkin on your PYTHONPATH i.e. from Fuerte. You should retry it from a "clean" shell without sourcing Fuerte before (or in your bashrc).

@Dirk Thomas YES ! You are right -- I had sourced Morse into my ROS Fuerte using another PYTHONPATH -- I have rectified my .bashrc -- everything is cool now !!!!
