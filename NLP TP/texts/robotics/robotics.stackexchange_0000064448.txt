Q:

attach a polygon to show tf in rviz

hi everyone
I want to show a footprint of my robot in rviz. I have my tf like /laser, /base_link, /odom and /map in rviz and i can see them and track my robot movement. But i want to attach a polygon to my tf. Should i use a urdf or it is really more simpler than this????
thanks:)))

A:

simple way is to publish a marker in /base_link frame,  Marker of  cube type with length,width and height as size of your robot looks fine.
