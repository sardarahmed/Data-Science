Q:

MoveIt keeps repeating planned path trajectory

I made a MoveIt configuration package for my robot setup (UR5, Robotiq 2F-85 and workcell).
When launching demo.launch to bring up the robot in RViz I have an issue with trajectory planning.
Everytime I am planning a new trajectory the preview robot (ghosted) keeps repeating its path.
Is there some sort of setting avaiable to limit the amount of planned trajectory iterations?
It makes me kind of dizzy after a while.
I am running ROS Kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial.

That is a visualisation setting. Dig into the settings in RViz:

MotionPlanning

Planned path

Loop animation

Thank you, I think I was scrolling too fast through the settings. This is what I was looking for.
