Q:

Warning about TF to MSG

When I run viso2 mono_odometer I get warnings like
TF to MSG: Quaternion Not Properly Normalized.
I find no translation happens when I move the camera tf are all zeros. Is that because of this warning, which prevent the node to publish tf to odom itself?

Please at least copy and paste the warnings so we can help you.  www.ros.org/wiki/Support Also specific instructions about how to reproduce your problem would be helpful.

sry, I did paste the warning but it didn't show. Now it should be fine.

Hi Jia! Can you show the last pose messages before that warning?

Hi Jia, did you find an answer for this issue? I am having the same problem, even though my system does not present any of the direct limitations of viso2_ros (ie, it is moving forward, contains a ground plane, etc). Thanks for any hints!

A:

With a deep investigation into the source code of viso2, my colleague and I finally solved this issue by calling a service called resetPose. So basically, as soon as the node mono_odometer has been brought up, open a new terminal and type "rosservice call /mono_odometer/reset_pose". For more information, please refer to the reset_pose service callback function which is in odometer_pose.h file. Hope this answer will help those who have the same issue as stated above.
