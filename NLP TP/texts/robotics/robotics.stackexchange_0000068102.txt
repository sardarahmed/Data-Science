Q:

How to use Moveit for planning circular path with a robotic arm

I want to draw a circle or other geometric object with a robotic arm ,but MoveIt seems only supports the path constraints designed to  from point A to point B.
How to use MoveIt to solve it? Or is there any other package of ROS to solve this problom? 
Any advice?

A:

I think this should be possible using the available tools within move_group and using them in the appropriate order.

Compute a circular cartesian path as
a vector of poses
Compute    corresponding joint space cartesian path using the
cartesian path service capability
Send the path off to MoveIt!  to execute

It sounds like this might be problematic because of missing time parametrization of the trajectory.
As stated by @paul-jurczak, another option is looking at the Cartesian Path Planner Plug-In for MoveIt!
For DRC, we implemented our own pipeline for generating cartesian motion based on a Action request that specifies the rotation center pose and then rotates the given endeffector around it. Relevant pieces of code:

Generate waypoint
poses
Use of function inside Action
callback

This likely is a bit heavyweight if you're just interested in doing  a circular motion, but might serve for inspiration.

Update: The Pilz Industrial Motion Planner offers CIRC motions. It was added to MoveIt in 2020
