Hi. How to do the same with ROS2?
Comment by Youssef_Lah on 2021-05-18:
In case somebody need it:
ros2 run xacro xacro -o robot.urdf robot.urdf.xacro
robot.urdf  is the output file and robot.urdf.xacro is the file you want to convert

A:

Better use the command as intendet:
rosrun xacro xacro --inorder -o model.urdf model.urdf.xacro

A proper xml will be generated with a banner saying that the file was auto generated and should not be edited.
