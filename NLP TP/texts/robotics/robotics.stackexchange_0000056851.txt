Q:

rviz Failing: Symbol Lookup Error

I had rviz running fine under Hydro a few days ago but something has gone wrong to cause the following error.  What is this and how do I fix it?
user@computer$ rosrun rviz rviz
QGtkStyle was unable to detect the current GTK+ theme.
[ INFO] [1390871921.858315604]: rviz version 1.10.10

Appears that some system updates inadvertently got crossed.
