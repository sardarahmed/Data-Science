Q:

how to enable SIFT_GPU, GICP_BIN, and GICP_CODE

Forgive my ignorance if this is a silly question. I set these to =1 in CMakesList.txt and ran
rosmake --rosdep-install rgbdslam and get the following error:
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:69 (FILE):
file COPY cannot find
"/home/lab/ros_workspace/rgbdslam/external/siftgpu/linux/bin/libsiftgpu.so".
Am I forgetting a simple step...? CUDA is up and running.

Just wondering if there is a quick way to enable/install siftgpu and gicp for rgbdslam...? These do not seem to be ros packages. Or do I have to hunt them and their dependencies down on the internet...? If install instructions were added to the rgbdslam ros wiki that would be great.

A:

Siftgpu should be built automatically from the sources included in the rgbdslam package. If it doesn't, I am not sure why (it works for me). You can try and call "make" manually in /home/lab/ros_workspace/rgbdslam/external/siftgpu/linux
