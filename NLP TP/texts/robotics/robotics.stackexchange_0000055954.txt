Q:

Dont see source code in Eclipse Debug

I configurate Eclipse Kepler like in this tutorial:
http://wiki.ros.org/IDEs#Running_and_debugging_your_executables_within_Eclipse
When I try debug code, I see only disassembled code.
Can I see c++ source code of my project?

A:

You need to compile your package with debug symbols.
catkin_make --pkg <package_name> --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

Or for all packages:
catkin_make --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

Thanks a lot! I had the same problem with Eclipse 2018-09 (4.9.0) and ROS Kinetic under Ubuntu 16.04. I did, what the wiki page demanded (using the catkin-y approach) which helped to run and build the package from within eclipse, but debugging wasn't working. Got "No source available for main()" as error. Your suggestion solved my problem.
