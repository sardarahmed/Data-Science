What do you mean exactly? From what you say, it seems that you must read again the tutorials
Comment by Emilien on 2016-04-28:
i subscribe to a std_msgs/Float64 variable all is ok.
now, i want to use this variable on my code like x = this variable, but i don't know how to convert it.
have you any solution?

A:

x = variable.data
For more details about the type itself check this
In your case, variable has the type std_msgs::Float64 . variable.data would be just a double. declare x as double.

If you ask this question I guess you are using C++?
Comment by Emilien on 2016-04-28:
yes, i use C++.
I try to use std_msgs::Float64 x;
x=variable.data;
but it doesn't work

variable has the type std_msgs::Float64 . variable.data would be just a double. declare x as double. And put a code example in your question, including the declaration of the subscriber and of the callback function, that would help.
