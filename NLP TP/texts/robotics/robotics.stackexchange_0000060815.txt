Q:

Broken message runtime dependencies

Hey guys,
I accidentally deleted something out of my apt/sources.list and I didn't see the name before it got deleted.
Now whenever I try to use apt-get install I get this message:

The following packages have unmet
dependencies:
ros-hydro-message-runtime : Depends:
ros-hydro-cpp-common but it is not
going to be installed
Depends: ros-hydro-roscpp-serialization but it
is not going to be installed
Depends: ros-hydro-roscpp-traits but it is not
going to be installed
Depends: ros-hydro-rostime but it is not going
to be installed E: Error,
pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated
breaks, this may be caused by held
packages.

How do I fix this?

A:

I used sudo apt-get purge ros-hydro-message-runtime and then sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-desktop-full and it seems to have worked.
