Q:

rgdslam linking error

Hi all,
I'm trying to build rgbdslam under ubuntu 11.10 and ros electric.
I'm following these instructions (point 2).
However it fails with the following error:
[100%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/rgbdslam.dir/src/moc_ros_service_ui.o
Linking CXX executable ../bin/rgbdslam
/usr/bin/ld: CMakeFiles/rgbdslam.dir/src/graph_manager.o: undefined reference to symbol 'g2o::MatrixStructure::~MatrixStructure()'
/usr/bin/ld: note: 'g2o::MatrixStructure::~MatrixStructure()' is defined in DSO /home/serl-3d/Software/ros-stacks/g2o/lib//libg2o_core.so so try adding it to the linker command line

make[1]: *** [all] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/serl-3d/Software/ros-stacks/rgbdslam/build'

How can I fix it?
Thanks

Hi,
something changed in ubuntu 11.10 s.t. new library-dependencies are required. I am currently updating the our google code subversion repository. I haven' tested it thoroughly, but feel free to give it a try.
