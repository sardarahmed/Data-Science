Q:

Error When running tutorial on moveit

Hello,
I just install moveit for melodic from that tutorial:
http://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/moveit_tutorials/html/doc/getting_started/getting_started.html
When I run the demo example, I get that error:
roslaunch panda_moveit_config demo.launch

Error:
[ INFO] [1621332924.648205185]: Loading robot model 'panda'...
[ INFO] [1621332925.050765019]: Loading robot model 'panda'...
[ERROR] [1621332925.103988618]: Group 'hand' is not a chain
[ERROR] [1621332925.104022297]: Kinematics solver of type 'kdl_kinematics_plugin/KDLKinematicsPlugin' could not be initialized for group 'hand'
[ERROR] [1621332925.104066937]: Kinematics solver could not be instantiated for joint group hand.

And then I want to run the move group tutorial:
roslaunch moveit_tutorials move_group_interface_tutorial.launch

And I get that error:
process[move_group_interface_tutorial-1]: started with pid [14504]
[ INFO] [1621332944.240649978]: Loading robot model 'panda'...
[ERROR] [1621332944.313543425]: Group 'hand' is not a chain

[ERROR] [1621332944.313611102]: Kinematics solver could not be instantiated for joint group hand.

I see the robot arm in Rviz but I can't interact with rviz gui.
What did I made wrong?

could not be initialized for group 'hand'

I think you have to check your group it should be set to arm, not hand. Over here the word hand means that you are solving the kinematics of your gripper, not your panda arm.
In short, change the planning group to panda arm instead of hand. I think t this may be the issue if is not working feel free to drop a comment.

Ok thank you, it works properly now

Thanks! @fvd. I have to repost to answer as I did right?
