Q:

Creating depth generator failed. Fedora, Kinect

I'm trying run Kinect with OpenNI drivers on Fedora 15 and ROS Diamondback.
So, using tutorial ( this one ), I compile drivers without errors:
rosmake openni_camera

Next, I export this parameters:
ROS_HOSTNAME="localhost"
ROS_MASTER_URI="http://localhost:11311"

But, when I try to launch Kinect, I got next messages:

During this, process XnSensorServer is active.
Thanks for any help!

Same problem with Ubuntu 11.10 (oneiric), using ros-electric from natty (11.04), since it's not available in oneiric.

A:

I think, that found problem. On fedora, when you compile driver openni_kinect, there some missing packages:
Failed to find rosdep openni-dev for package openni_camera on OS:fedora version:15
Failed to find rosdep libusb1.0 for package openni_camera on OS:fedora version:15
Failed to find rosdep ps-engine for package openni_camera on OS:fedora version:15
WARNING: Rosdeps [u'openni-dev', u'libusb1.0', u'ps-engine'] could not be resolved
