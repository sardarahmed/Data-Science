A:

I don't know of any packages that specifically support this kind of device, but afaik, most presentation devices are actually just USB HID input devices (keyboards with just a few keys). I can imagine updating teleop_twist_keyboard (or just remapping keys) would do the trick.
There are multiple ways under Linux to determine which particular keycodes / keys a device sends, see Extra keyboard keys on the Arch wiki for some possible options.
