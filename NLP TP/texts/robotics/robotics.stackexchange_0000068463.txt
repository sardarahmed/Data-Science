Q:

ROS Jade Installation Issues

Hi,
I attempted to install ROS jade following the standard installation instructions.
When trying to run  sudo apt-get update I encountered the following error with the key signing:
W: An error occurred during the signature verification. The repository is not updated and the previous index files will be used. GPG error: http://packages.osrfoundation.org trusty InRelease: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 67170598AF249743

W: Failed to fetch http://packages.osrfoundation.org/drc/ubuntu/dists/trusty/InRelease

Also, after trying to run sudo apt-get install ros-jade-desktop-full I got the following error:
Err http://packages.osrfoundation.org/drc/ubuntu/ trusty/main gazebo5-common all 5.1.0-1~trusty
  404  Not Found
E: Failed to fetch http://packages.osrfoundation.org/drc/ubuntu/pool/main/g/gazebo5/gazebo5-common_5.1.0-1~trusty_all.deb  404  Not Found

I am running Ubuntu 14.04.2 and currently have Indigo installed.
Thanks for the help.

A:

Have you imported the key (Section 1.3 - Set up your keys)? And did that complete successfully?

Edit: looking at Install Gazebo using Ubuntu packages - Step-by-step Install, the OSRF Gazebo package repositories have their own key, so you probably need to also run
wget http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -

before trying to install Gazebo 5.

Edit 2:

Know that currently installing both Indigo and Jade on the same system will result in some difficulty, see Gazebo version collides between Indigo and Jade, especially when trying to install Gazebo 5.

The key setup did work properly. The repo which was causing errors was an old DRC repository. I removed it from /etc/apt/sources.list.d and resolved the error.
After rebooting my machine and running apt-get autoremove and apt-get autoclean I was able to successfully install ros-jade-desktop-full.
