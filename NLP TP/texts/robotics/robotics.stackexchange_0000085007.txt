Q:

GSCAM Error in ROS

Hello everyone.
I have some questions about using gscam in ROS environment and i using NVIDIA Jetson TX2 board, gstreamer-1.0
first, i tried cmd
gst-launch-1.0 v4l2src device="/dev/vodep0" ! "video/x-raw, width=1280, height=800, framerate=30/1 format=(string)UYVY ! nvvidconv flip-method=2 ! "video/x-raw(memory::NVMM), width=1280, height=800, framerate=30/1, format=(string)I420" ! nvegltransform ! nveglglessink

it's very well.
but i tried roslaunch gscam gscam, i have some errors.
path\to\ros\catkin\src\gscam\src\gscam.cpp::167:bool gscam::GSCam::init_stream() assetion failed" (outpad)

so, i had modified v4l.launch file to correct pipeline.
and have too same error.
what can i do for next step?
Thank you advise for me. everyone!

A:

You can ask gstreamer to explain an error using GST_DEBUG environment variable:
# GST_DEBUG=4 roslaunch gscam gscam

I'm sure that problem is in incorrect gstreamer pipeline config. Could you post your .launch file here?
