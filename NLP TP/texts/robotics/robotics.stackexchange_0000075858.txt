Q:

ROS Consolor Color Print

Folks,
Is there a way to change the color of what I print with ROS_INFO(), etc.?
I want to leave red and yellow for real errors and real warnings.

A:

It looks like the colors are #defined here:
https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/blob/98aa98e565ea623aae61c02f54ecb06c7ee190dd/tools/rosconsole/src/rosconsole/rosconsole.cpp#L103
I took just a brief glance and did not see any option for runtime configuration. Time to fork? :p
Or you could pipe the output to sed and replace the colors with a clever regex.
