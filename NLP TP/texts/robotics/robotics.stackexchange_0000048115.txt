Q:

Problem Using Roscore and Roslaunch in Groovy

I am relatively new to ROS. Recently I installed Groovy on my Linux machine and some new packages only to be given the error:
WARNING: unable to configure logging. No log files will be generated
Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.
Press Ctrl-C to interrupt
Done checking log file disk usage. Usage is <1GB.
Cannot locate [roslaunch]Invalid  tag: Cannot load command parameter [rosversion]: command [rosversion roslaunch] returned with code [1].
Param xml is param command="rosversion roslaunch" name="rosversion"/
Furthermore, I get the same error message when trying to use roscore.
I have seen this error in other threads; however, I have already followed the instructions given and gotten no results.
Is there a way to direct rosversion to the location of roslaunch to get rid of this error?

A:

We've seen this error when roslaunch is not in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.  Make sure that it is in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.  For more information see  the wiki page for envionrment variables and filesystem tutorials
