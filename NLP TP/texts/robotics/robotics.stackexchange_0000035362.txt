Q:

ROS autostart with daemontools

Hello community,
I'd like to start ros directly after ubuntu system start...
Is anybody using daemontools ?

A:

I don't know if you're only looking to use daemontools, but here is what I use to start ROS automatically. I've commented the code to explain what I'm doing.
Copy this script to /etc/init.d and then execute the following command:
sudo update-rc.d script-name defaults 99

ROS will now boot on startup into a seperate screen. The only catch is that it boots as the root user. Thus, to access it, you must use the command:
sudo screen -r

and it will bring you to the terminal containing the ROS graph.

I tried your script but it didn't work for me. The source path is definitely right but the output of the console when booting is
/etc/rc2.d/S99panda_cam_startup: 45: source: not found
Found
/etc/rc2.d/S99panda_cam_startup: 45: bc: not found
/etc/rc2.d/S99panda_cam_startup: 45: screen: not found
