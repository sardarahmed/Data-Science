Q:

Output update of robot position coordiantes

Hi all,
I did a mapping of my static area with hector_slam using RP-Lidar 2D scanner and then i finished path planning using husky_slam, now i'm about to make my robot navigate through the map.
The issue is, i need to find a way that makes an output that gives me updates of my rebot positon in relation of the goal point each time it moves throught the path it planned already.
I searched the net for days without any luck.
What are your suggestions to fulfill my lack of need?
