Q:

How to create a custom msg for arduino?

I am trying to create the custom msg for Arduino. I refer the rosserial_client package to generate the custom msg.
I created the package simbha_msg for msgs. Package contains the msg file  simbha_imu.msg
    Header header
    float64 roll
    float64 pitch
    float64 yaw

I run the command rosrun rosserial_client make_libraries /home/simmu/Desktop/ simbha_msgs/ but its not working as expected.
I tried with cpp node as well but that is also not working. It wont give any error or warnings.

Ohk, I have solved the problem by myself. The problem was to make the changing in CmakeLists.txt.
I cleaned the build directory and rebuild it, that's solved my problem. :)
