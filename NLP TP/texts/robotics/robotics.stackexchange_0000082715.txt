Q:

Automatically back to command line after roslaunch

Hi,
I want to run roslaunch sequentially with shell script.
I set roslaunch parameter "required = true". It kills roslaunch, but it just shows message "Done!" and does not go back to commandline. So next command cannot be sent.
How can I do this?

Why are you using a shell script to launch different launch files instead of includeing the launch files in another launch file?

@mix345: could you please tell us what you actually are trying to accomplish? @jayess comment makes sense: roslaunch can already start multiple launchfiles by itself, so using a shellscript as you (seem to) describe should not be necessary.

Hi,
What I want to do is run one roslaunch file for multiple times, with different argument.
It is like
roslaunch a.launch _arg:=1
roslaunch a.launch _arg:=2
roslaunch a.launch _arg:=3
......
So I want to kill the roslaunch after a node finishes and execute next command automatically.

hello @mix345, have you managed to solve this? Am currently running into the same issue.
Or did u go about another method rather then using a python shell script??

A:

Roslaunch will return to command Line as soon as all lauched processes are done. This means all nodes have to stop die roslaunch to Terminate itself, Not just one of the launched nodes. Further, the first roslaunch may open a roscore, which will never terminate by itself so make sure roscore ist already running before starting roslaunch...
