Q:

Sending variables from one nodes to another

Hello all !
I am using Hydro version of ROS. I have created a node in which I made a variable and store the value in it. Now I have to pass that variable value to another node. So that it can access it.
Can any body tell me how I can do the above thing. I am working on python so it would be nice if anybody tells me in python
Thanks
Looking forward for answers !

A:

There are many ways how to pass data from one node to another.
You could publish your variable in a topic: Tutorial Understanding Topics
You could use a Setter like service: Tutorial Understanding Services
And some more advanced ways to do it.
