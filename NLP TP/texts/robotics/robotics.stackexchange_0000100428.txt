If you're not against running things in containers, you could just use the Docker images. You would want to make sure your exact cpu arch is supported though (I don't remember whether RPi3 is armhf or arm64).

A:

It's possible to install ROS Noetic on Rpi 3 but you will be limited to Server or Core version as per Canonical

Minimum Requirements: A Raspberry Pi

2, 3, 4 or CM3 A microSD card An

Ubuntu Core image A monitor with an

HDMI interface An HDMI cable A USB

keyboard

For ROS Noetic desktop you will need RPi 4.
