ROS electric installed from source - ROS-Base: (Bare Bones) ROS package

What version of ROS is this?

A:

I suspect you are mixing the Electric common_rosdeps with the Diamondback geometry stack.
It is fine to have both installed on your machine, but stick to one distribution at a time in your $ROS_ROOT and $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.

Thanks a lot! you was right!

try "roslocate info XXX --distro=electric" to make sure that you are pulling in the desired version. Or, just follow the ROS installation instructions for "ROS Desktop" which already provide you all of the same libraries in a coherent version.

and i havent any over ROS on board.
Comment by noonv on 2011-10-20:
yes - but i  install it via roslocate info XXX and rosinstall XXX - could it be from over branch? O_o
Comment by kwc on 2011-10-20:
ROS Base does not come with geometry or common_rosdeps, so I think joq's advice is correct.  Whereever those came from, they came from incompatible branches.
