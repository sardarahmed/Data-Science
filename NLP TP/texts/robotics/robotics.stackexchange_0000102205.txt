Q:

Calibration / Tuning Tool Support

Hi,
I've some years of experience in running ROS1 applications and tuning a limited number of scalar and vector parameters by means of rosparam.
For future tasks I'd like to move an existing larger scale embedded application to ROS. As this application has a high number of parameters, I'm interested in more convenient (graphical) tools for tuning the ROS node.
Could you please give me a hint on that? This questions refers to ros1 and ros2.
Thanks

A:

The canonical answer to this would likely be: rqt_reconfigure (which also exists for ROS 2):

Whether that would fit your requirements only you can decide of course.
Your post confuses me somewhat though:

I've some years of experience in running ROS1 applications and tuning a limited number of scalar and vector parameters by means of rosparam.

did you have to restart the node(s) for which you changed those parameters? Nodes re-reading their ROS parameters at runtime is a known anti-pattern, but that would be the only way to "tune" parameters while things are running.
dynamic_reconfigure would be the infrastructure to use for runtime updating of parameters, but if you were already using that, I'd expect rqt_reconfigure to be a known tool.

Thanks, That's looking exactly as the one I was searching for. I'll investigate this further.
I didn't restart nodes during parameter tuning.  It was relasted to controller tuning or enabling / disabling specific functions.

I didn't restart nodes during parameter tuning.

sounds like those nodes implemented the anti-pattern then.
