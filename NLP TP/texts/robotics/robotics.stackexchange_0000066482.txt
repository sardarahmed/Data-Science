A:

Old question, but it still comes up on Google so I'll mention that this is officially supported by Snapcraft, the tool for building .snaps for Ubuntu Core: https://docs.snapcraft.io/ros-applications/7822 .

@Kyle: can you say something about your experiences with snaps and ROS? What level of granularity have you used / do you believe makes the most sense? Single snap per node? Any thoughts on the filesize overhead?

I work at Canonical (the company behind Ubuntu) on this, so I'm biased, but I've used it quite a bit. Splitting nodes between snaps is complex since they're isolated, but snaps are an excellent way to ship/update an entire ROS product at once. Regarding size, updates are all done with deltas.
