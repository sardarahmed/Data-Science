Q:

rosjava_android+opencv=Fuerte?

Hi,
I'm hoping to use opencv in a rosjava android environment. I've had a hard time building these packages together, and/or integrating their pre-compiled versions into an eclipse project I can code/build against. Not surprising, as I've been pulling from unreleased/experimental source repos :)
Anyway, is there an ETA for when a semi-stable version of these packages will be released? Maybe alongside Fuerte? :)
Thanks,
-Nick

A:

As for rosjava_core and android_core (I was not aware of the wiki page rosjava_android until now, deleted it, see android_core instead) I'm working toward a stable release before ROSCon. However, time is running short...
As for opencv, I have no idea. But, I'd love to see that happen. Maybe something like SimpleCV for Android.

Thanks for the info, Damon. As per the pre-release docs, should I expect that maven/gradle will be the new build environment? (i.e., rosmake/eclipse projects are not supported?)

rosmake is not supported (replaced by gradle), but Eclipse is.
