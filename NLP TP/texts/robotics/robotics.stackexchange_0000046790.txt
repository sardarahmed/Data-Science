Q:

Kinect calibration "Unknown OpenCV format yuv422"

Hi all,
I would like to intrinsically calibrate my asus sensor. Therefore I used the "openni_launch/Tutorials/IntrinsicCalibration" page. I calibrated the IR without problems. Now I want to calibrate the RGB sensor but get the following error message.
Unknown OpenCV format yuv422

I use following command (nothing special therefore I dont think that it is a false usage from my side)
$rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py image:=/camera/rgb/image_raw camera:=/camera/rgb --size 8x6 --square 0.025

My machine is a fresh install Ubunutu 12.4 and ROS Fuerte.

A:

Just use the image_mono stream instead:
$rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py image:=/camera/rgb/image_mono camera:=/camera/rgb --size 8x6 --square 0.025

This is the correct answer for camera calibration since it's just going to convert it into mono anyway.  For other applications, you can subscribe to a more compatible image stream on /camera/rgb/image_color
