Q:

Message sent to turtlesim does not execute

I am sending a velocity command message to turtlesim from a C++ program.  If I put the message in my main(), it does not appear to execute even though it shows up as a rostopic.  If I put the the message in a 'for' or 'while' loop for some number of iterations, it will execute.  I thought that (according to the tutorials) that turtlesim executed each velocity command for one second.  Can anyone tell me why a single command does not execute for the one second interval?
Running lucid, electric.
Thanks.
