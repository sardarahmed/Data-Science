Q:

Is there a way to modify Frontier_exploration such that it can work autonomously?

Hi.
I am trying to implement a robot that will map and navigate an environment on its own. I have searched a lot about existing ros packages and I THINK FRONTIER_EXPLORATION would do this for me. However, frontier_exploration requires manual instructions in terms of making the polygon etc. so i was wondering is there a way i can run frontier exploration and the robot just maps and navigate the environment on its own?
Or is there any other package that does this?

A:

If you ask frontier_exploration to explore an empty polygon, it will explore indefinitely. Either that, you can write your own high-level controller to generate polygons and areas to explore.
