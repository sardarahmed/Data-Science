A:

I recommend segbot package to you. Segbot package includes both hokuyo laser and kinect. I think that It is useful for you. At first, you will try next command on terminal and check packages.

apt-cache search ros-hydro-segbot

If you use distribution except for hydro, you please change a part of hydro into your distribution.
In case of hydro, you will find 8 packages.

ros-hydro-segbot
ros-hydro-segbot-apps
ros-hydro-segbot-bringup
ros-hydro-segbot-description
ros-hydro-segbot-gazebo
ros-hydro-segbot-navigation
ros-hydro-segbot-sensors
ros-hydro-segbot-simulator

After installing them, you will launch segbot with next command.

roslaunch segbot_gazebo segbot_navigation.launch
