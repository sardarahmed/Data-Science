Q:

Using odometry from hector_mapping for move_base (Nav stack)

Hi,
To run move_base (part of the Navigation stack), I need to provide an odom topic which move_base can subscribe to.
I use hector_mapping for odometry on my robot, and have set the pub_map_odom_transform option of my hector_mapping node to true to publish a tf between the map & the odom frames.
Is it possible to output odom as a topic from hector_mapping? If not, how should I go about constructing odom messages from hector_mapping topics? (I have a hunch that this is possible seeing as a tf from map to odom is available..)
Thank you in advance,
Ernest
Edit: Alternatively, is there a way in move_base to use the incoming map->odom tf for odometry (as opposed to the odom topic) ?

A:

Actually I've figured it out.
It turns out that move_base doesn't need the odom topic, it can get odometry information from the tf that is being published by hector_mapping!

Hi @Ernest, i wonder how did you configure the launch file to get odom tf out from hector_mapping and use it for move_base.
