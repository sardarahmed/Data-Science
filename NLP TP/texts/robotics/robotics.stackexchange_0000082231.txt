Q:

print works but rospy.loginfo doesn't

Hi,
I have this code and print would work but rospy.loginfo

 import rospy

from std_msgs.msg import String
messageToRos = Queue.Queue()

def writeMessageToRos(messageToRos):
    pub = rospy.Publisher('chatter', String, queue_size=10)
    rate = rospy.Rate(10) # 10hz
    while not rospy.is_shutdown():
        msg = messageToRos.get()
        print 'new messageToRos: ', msg
        rospy.loginfo('new messageToRos: ', msg)
        pub.publish(msg)
        rate.sleep()

even the publisher works fine. How would I correctly do a loginfo or debuginfo for msg ?

Are you running this from rosrun or roslaunch?

A:

Hi @vKuehn,
I made a video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCLcftHHrEs) that answers exactly this question.
In summary, in order to make rospy.loginfo print on the screen, if you are running the node with roslaunch, you must use the parameter --screen when calling roslaunch, or add the output="screen" on your launch file.
For example:
1 - roslaunch your_package your_launchfile.launch --screen
or
2 - <node pkg="your_package" type="your_file.py" name="your_file" output="screen"/>
On the video I explain step by step.

You're Welcome.
Well, I've never done this using directly the pytyon file.
But with the steps mentioned on the answer (and explained on the video) works perfectly ;)

Why not explain step-by-step here? The problem with linking to a video for more steps is that now part of the answer is external and this answer is not self-contained. What if the video gets taken down?

The "step-by-step" is already on the answer.
