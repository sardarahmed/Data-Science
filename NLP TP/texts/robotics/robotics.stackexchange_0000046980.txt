Q:

Error "unknown address family 10" in roslaunch's ProcessMonitor

Hi all,
I wanted to switch from fuerte to groovy on my virtual machine.
After I have successfully compiled all ros_comm packages, I started roscore, but it terminates at startup with the error message:
unknown address family 10
in the roslaunch/pymon.py.
The system is a custom Linux system (compiled with openembedded) and Python 2.7.3.
NB: As it a custom Linux system, I did not use rosdep to resolve the system dependencies, but tried to resolve it manually.
Googling for the error above did not give a valuable hint what I am doing wrong.
Does anyone have a clue?
The full logfile is at http://pastebin.com/mxNkHBHS.

A:

ROS Groovy seems to require python with IPv6 support in constrast to the previous versions (fuerte, electric, ...).
After installing python with IPv6 support (--enable-ipv6), the issue was resolved.
