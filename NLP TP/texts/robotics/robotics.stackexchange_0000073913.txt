Q:

How to display a cube on rviz?

I was using a PCD Visualizer, but, I changed to rviz, I was using the following command:
viewer.addCube(min_pt.x, max_pt.x, min_pt.y, max_pt.y, min_pt.z, max_pt.z, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, "Door1");

To add a cube to the visualization, but, I don't know how to perform this on rviz, since the fact that I don't use PCD Visualizer anymore, could you guys give some help to me?
