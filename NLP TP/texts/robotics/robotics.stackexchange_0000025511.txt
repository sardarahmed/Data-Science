Q:

controlling drc simulator from external program

I am wondering where I might find example code on controlling and reading sensor data in the drc simulator from an external program controller? Every piece of documentation I found merely discusses controlling the gazebo from within a plugin that gazebo will itself load. I found a black page on ros that is title about controlling gazebo from ros, but as I said, the page is blank and therefore useless. So, where might find examples of using this with an external program controller and NOT a plugin? And how about examples on reading the sensor data from something other an XML type file that the simulator loads?
Thanks

Can you include links to the content that you found inadequate?

The link on controlling gazebo from ROS entitled "Creating a Gazebo plugin that talks to ROS" is blank. The link I went to that I found inadequate was the following:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/simulator_gazebo/Tutorials/Write%20a%20Gazebo%20Plugin%20that%20Talks%20to%20ROS

A:

Use the tutorials from the gazebo tutorial page.
As part of DRC you're using the "standalone" gazebo 1.3 and not the gazebo that's within ROS.
For controlling the robot from an external node you probably want the drc specific tutorials.
