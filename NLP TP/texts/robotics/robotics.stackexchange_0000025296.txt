Q:

just a suggestion about links on this website

Hi,
Just a suggestion: it would be useful to have links to the gazebo web site and wiki on this web site as well.  Quite often I want to go to one of the other sites and I have to use my bookmarks.  This is not really much of a bother, but I thought it would be useful to have links between the sites.
Thanks.

Good idea.  We've added links to the top left of the page.
