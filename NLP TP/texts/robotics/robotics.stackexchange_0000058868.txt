Q:

Is gazebo a good simulator? Or are there any better ones?

I found gazebo when I was roaming around and trying to learn how ROS runs. I came across gazebo and it seemed pretty cool. I want to learn if it is a good simulator or can you suggest any other?
Can i use gazebo for drones such as AR.Drone2.0? Or do you suggest anyother simulators or programs?
P.S:Beginner

A:

Yes, you can use gazebo for drones. Take a look:

You have to create model and simple controller for your model. Take a look here for some examples:

I use standalone gazebo for my tasks.
Don't know, if V-Rep is better than gazebo or not. Will try V-Rep in near future.
