Q:

URDF and Mesh for Pioneer 3AT

I need to model several Pioneer 3AT robots for a project, so I was hoping to find existing urdf and mesh files to use with gazebo. However, my search hasn't turned up anything and I'm not sure what to do next. Does anyone know where I can find what I'm looking for, or good places for me to look?

A:

The p2os_urdf package seems to contain urdf, meshes and Blender files for the Pioneer 3AT. You can directly grab them from svn:
https://usc-ros-pkg.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/usc-ros-pkg/trunk/p2os/p2os_urdf/
(Check out the 'defs','meshes' and 'models' directories)
