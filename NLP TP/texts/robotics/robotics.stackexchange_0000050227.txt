Q:

how to create a stack in fuerte?

Hi all,
I would like to create a stack and am currently using ros fuerte. Since roscreate-stack is no longer supported, I would like to forward these questions from the ros-release mailing list here:

The Fuerte migration page says roscreate-stack is no longer supported.
Maintaining stack.xml dependencies by hand is tedious and error-prone.
What scripts or tools are available to facilitate those dependency calculations?
As more ROS stacks resemble system
dependencies, the developer is now
responsible for knowing what system
dependencies their code use and
properly declare them. With more ROS
stacks installing as system
dependencies, more and more dependency
information will be hidden within
CMake declarations. For example, you
can now compile against common_msgs
without declaring any  tags.
Thus, a roscreate-stack-like tool is
essentially unmaintainable in the
future, unless it attempted to parse
build files.

What are the steps to properly create a stack in fuerte?

A:

Simply create a directory named like your stack, put a stack.xml file in it and create packages as subdirectories of you stack dir.

Thanks, I needed to be sure of that :). And I suppose that 'make'-ing the stack is simply through 'rosmake *'?

You can simply run rosmake stack-name once you've created the stack.xml file.
