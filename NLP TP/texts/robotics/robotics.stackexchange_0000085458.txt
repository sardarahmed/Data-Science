Q:

Providing PointCloud2 data from ZED camera

I am trying to run a program that requires PointCloud2 data using only the ZED camera, no LASER. Depthcloud to Laserscan is said to work well with ZED, so could I combine this with the Laserscan to Pointcloud routine in one node, would that work? It appears that the latter code isn't really a ROS node but a routine to be included in
another program, correct? The ZED can make Pointcloud output itself but it is too slow, like 2 Hz.

Can you please provide a bit more detail? Where are the LaserScans coming from? A ZED is not a laser scanner, so that confuses me.

the package provides a library, yes, but there are stand-alone nodes as well.
But again: I'm not sure how those could help with what you are asking.

Sorry that I wasn't clear. I'm talking about the depthimage_to_laserscan node. This takes the Zed output and converts it to laserscan data. Now I'm wanting to convert this laserscan data to PointCloud2 data. You say there is a node for this? I haven't found it, but did find laser_geometry.

Would depth_image_proc not be a more direct route?

That looks good, I'll study it soon, thanks!

A:

I have found good information on the rtabmap sites! There are tutorials about setup and launch files and video streams.

I feel sure that I'll be successful with that depth_image_proc and help from rtabmap sites. The abundance of tutorials is very helpful. Thanks to all that have contributed so much to this resource!

Stereolabs also has a nodelet on their zed_ros_wrapper repo that runs faster than the node. They also have sample launch files to use them.
