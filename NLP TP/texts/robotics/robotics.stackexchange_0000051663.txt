Q:

How to proceed with using Moveit if you're not working on a PR2?

I just started looking into Moveit while using Kinova's robotic arms (Jaco Research edition). Will the steps described in the tutorial be similar for them?
If not, what points should I keep in mind when I start working on this?

A:

Yes, just go through the whole tutorial.
After you have finished the assistant you have to manually create some yaml and launch files.
See my config for reference: jaco_moveit_copy
