Q:

rosmake dont know std?

Hi everyone,
I got an issue compiling my node with rosmake.
it didn't find std :
 error: ‘to_string’ is not a member of ‘std’ 

Did I miss something ?

A:

to_string() is a C++11 feature (see here). Thus, you need to configure the CMakeLists.txt accordingly.
Also, you should consider switching to catkin ;-)
For catkin and with CMake >= 2.8.12 and a suitable g++ version (from Ubuntu 14.04 onward? I'm not quite sure) best use:
target_compile_options(<TARGET> PRIVATE -std=c++11)

I know catkin rooks but it's too complicate for the basic node I developped.
Here is what I put in my makefile :
if(CMAKE_COMPILER_IS_GNUCXX)
    add_definitions(-std=gnu++0x)
endif()
