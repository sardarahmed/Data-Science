Q:

Unable to locate package ros-melodic-desktop-full

Hey, I am trying to install the BETA version of ROS Melodic on Ubuntu 18.04 by following stanard installation instructions but end up with:
Unable to locate package ros-melodic-desktop-full
It looks like everything is online and there's just no desktop-full on the repo. Is there any other way to currently install and test ros-melodic without building from source?
EDIT:
Building from source also did not work for me:
$ rosinstall_generator desktop_full --rosdistro melodic --deps --tar > melodic-desktop-full.rosinstall
The following not released packages/stacks will be ignored: desktop_full
No packages/stacks left after ignoring not released

$ wstool init -j8 src melodic-desktop-full.rosinstall 
Using initial elements from: melodic-desktop-full.rosinstall
WARNING: Not using any element from melodic-desktop-full.rosinstall
Writing /home/arek/ros_catkin_ws/src/.rosinstall

update complete.

$ ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
bash: ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated: No such file or directory

Anyone know what's wrong?

Anyone know what's wrong?

Nothing is really "wrong": there just isn't a version of desktop_full released for Melodic. The fact that the installation instructions won't work yet is also clearly stated at the top of the ROS Melodic installation instructions page:

CAUTION: Release of this distribution is pending.

ROS Melodic Morenia has not been fully released yet, so these instructions will not entirely work.

Trying to build this from source is not going to change it: rosinstall_generator won't be able to find a desktop_full package (as it can only build packages that have been released).
To install Melodic packages, you can check status_page/ros_melodic_default.html to see which packages have been released (this page is also linked from the Melodic install page, under section Build farm status). See status_page/blocked_releases_melodic.html to see why something hasn't/can't be released into Melodic yet.

Is there any other way to currently install and test ros-melodic without building from source?

Yes: install individual packages for now.

Oh, I get it. According to Melodic Planning there's no beta yet, my mistake. Thank you for your answer.

So it's 2020 and this still doesn't work, even though it has been released.

Do you expect any assistance?
Because if you do, then:

you should post a new question
provide much more information

That message is no longer on that page. Melodic full IS now released.
