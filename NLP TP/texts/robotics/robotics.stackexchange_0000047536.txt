Q:

[groovy] collada parser source incomplete

I'm installing groovy from source.
$ sudo wstool init src -j8 http:/packages.ros.org/web/rosinstall/generate/raw/groovy/robot

$ sudo ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install --install-space /opt/ros/groovy

Compilation fails at collada_parser because of missing dae.h
Looking at the Fuerte install on my laptop, colladadom includes contain a host of different files missing from the groovy raw.
Copying dae.h prompts for another missing file: dom/domCOLLADA.h.
Now there are two possibilities: either copying the dom folder inside the 1.4 subfolder, or the one inside 1.5.
The one in 1.4 causes make to output a three pages long series of errors.
The one in 1.5 fails because of a missing namespace 'ColladaDOM150'.
Commenting out this line (number 75 of the single source file) compilation proceedes succesfully for this package.
Next is collada_urdf which suffers from the same missing includes and wrong namespace.
So I copied both dae and dom the same way I did before, but this time make outputs lots of undefined references to collada functions.
I think this is a bug, but I couldn't find how to submit to the tracker (no ticket link on the package's page).

Thanks, doesn't accept my code.ros.org login though...

Try reloading after entering the credentials and waiting a bit.  The website is very sluggish at the moment.  That's why we're migrating off of it.

A:

you will need to install collada-dom separately
$ wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/collada-dom/files/latest/download
$ tar -xf download
$ cd collada-dom-2.4.0
$ cmake . && make install

thanks, I'll try that on the Panda.
I tried on my x64 machines, but I get errors on some zip64 functions.

for your x64 machine, I would recommend using the prebuilt binaries

Installing this from source does not solve the problem. At least, not on my Beagle Board xM. I still get a compilation error with dae.h missing. If I had a copy of dae.h, where would I place it?
Comment by kalectro on 2013-03-10:
just copying dae.h will not solve your problem. You need to make sure collada-dom is found by collada_parser. Have a look at this guide on how to install it http://www.ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/Linaro/Source

if anyone has still dae.h missing errors, try this: https://github.com/ros/robot_model/issues/72
