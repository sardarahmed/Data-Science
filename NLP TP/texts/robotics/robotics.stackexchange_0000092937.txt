Q:

costmap2d: obstacle layer

i want to configure my costmap_common_params.yaml
i look up for the parameters in this wiki page: http://wiki.ros.org/costmap_2d/hydro/obstacles
but i am using ros-kinetic not ros-hydro
Is there everything allright? Can i freely use all the parameters described there?

A:

You can check an example costmap configuration from here. Otherwise as far as I can see not much has change and you should be able to use the parameters from the link you shared. Hydro and later releases use plugins for all costmap_2d layers.
Also you can always check existing costmap configuration like the husky_navigation one.
