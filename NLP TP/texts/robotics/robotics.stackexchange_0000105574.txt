Q:

Error fetching dependencies from Git repo

I have cloned this repo:https://github.com/ClemensElflein/open_mower_ros
however when fetching the dependencies with:
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --default-yes

I get the following error:
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved  to system dependencies: 
mower_utils: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [xbot_msgs] 
mower_msgs: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [xesc_msgs] 
mower_simulation: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [xbot_positioning]
mower_comms: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [xesc_msgs] 
mower_map: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [xbot_msgs] 
open_mower: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [ftc_local_planner] 
mower_logic: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [xbot_positioning]

I have tried many things, but nothing works. I am working on ros-noetic. Any tip?

A:

It looks like you didn't get the openmower submodules (the readme should be changed to mention those prominently)
cd open_mower_ros
git submodule update --init --recursive

There may be some other packages to git clone manually that aren't in the submodules and can't be installed through rosdep (like the above comment suggests).
