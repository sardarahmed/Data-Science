Q:

Problem with interactive markers example in turtlebot3

I am following robotis tutorial for turtlebot3 from http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/basic_examples/
(turtlebot3)
$roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_robot.launch  

(Remote PC)
$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_remote.launch
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_example interactive_markers.launch
$ rosrun rviz rviz -d `rospack find turtlebot3_example`/rviz/turtlebot3_interactive.rviz

This is a screenshot from rviz:

There are no interactive markers that I can use to move the robot. I am running ubuntu 16.04 from a VM, ros kinetic and followed the installation instructions from robotis.

A:

This problem occurs when turtlebot3 is not connected to the the remote PC or Using VM.
I recommend installing ubuntu from USB. Then, make sure remote PC's and turtlebot3's IP. This link is will help you.
