Q:

Dynamic Reconfigure to camera.yaml file?

Hello,
I'd like to use the Dynamic Reconfigure GUI to configure my camera (bayer settings, etc.) and then publish that information to a camera.yaml file.  I don't see anything about how to do this in either the camera_drivers or dynamic_reconfigure tutorials, and I don't really know how to get started.  Any ideas?

Hi Bradley,
Once you have the settings the way you want, go to another terminal window, move to the directory where you want to save your camera.yaml file (e.g. roscd my_package/params), then issue the command:
$ rosrun dynamic_reconfigure dynparam dump /camera_node_name camera.yaml
where /camera_node_name is the name of the node you are configuring in dynamic_reconfigure.
To load this file from a launch file at a later time, add the following to the launch file:
<node name="dynamic_reconfigure_load" pkg="dynamic_reconfigure" type="dynparam" args="load /camera_node_name $(find my_package)/params/camera.yaml" />

where of course you need to make the appropriate substitutions for /camera_node_name and the package location of your camera.yaml file.
