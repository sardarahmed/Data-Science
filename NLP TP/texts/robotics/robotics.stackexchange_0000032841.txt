From @arebgun below: Are you using ROS Diamondback? How did you install it? I just created a small test packages that depends on opencv2 and roscpp packages these includes work fine.  Remember to try to post enough for others to reproduce your problem.  http://www.ros.org/wiki/Support#Guidelines_for_asking_a_question

A:

Whenever you want to use code from packages other than the one you are developing in, you need to add dependency on that package to your manifest.xml (see manifest documentation for full description). And to answer your question adding <depend package="opencv2"/> to the manifest should solve the problem. Also your slashes are wrong, change all \ to /:
#include <opencv2/opencv.hpp>
#include <opencv2/highgui/highgui.hpp>
#include <opencv2/imgproc/imgproc.hpp>
