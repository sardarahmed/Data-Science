Q:

"sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-joystick_drivers" doesn't work

Hi there. I have installing problems.
"sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-actionlib" works fine, but
"sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-joystick_drivers" don't.
I just get:
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-groovy-joystick_drivers
Any Idea why?
I am working with Ubuntu 12.04.
Thanks.

A:

Underscores are replaced by hyphens in the Ubuntu packages. That means you have to run
sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-joystick-drivers

Hint: You can use tab-completion while typing: hit "tab" while completing the package name.

Note you could also use apt-cache to search for packages e.g. apt-cache search ros.*joystick shows the name of the package you were trying to install.  As well as a small description of the package.
