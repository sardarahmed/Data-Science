Q:

cannot svn camera_info_manager package from source

Does anyone can svn camera_info_manager package from source? I need electric version for Gumstix Overo. I tried this link https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/image_common/tags/image_common-1.6.1 , but it seems not exist.
Anyone can help me? Thanks in advance!

A:

The entire image_common stack has moved to github, including old release branches.
There are currently problems with the wiki Releases page, which make it hard to find the correct previous source versions.
Assuming that 1.6.1 is the release you want, you should be able to check out this version.
