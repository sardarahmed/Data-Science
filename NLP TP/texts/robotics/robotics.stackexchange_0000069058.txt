Q:

husky bringup on an ARM platform

Hello everybody,
i am currently trying to get my husky indigo setup working on an arm machine.
My problem is the husky_node of the husky_base package. Running it, i get the following error:
EXCEPTION: TransportException 3: Unacknowledged send
[ERROR] [1438708451.166274559]: Error configuring velocity and accel limits: Unacknowledged send

The port is set correctly and also the port permission are r+w.
Thank you for your help.
