Q:

Can rgbdslam_electric run on OS:10.04 with electric?

I did as the following website:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/rgbdslam_electric
After I had run this command:"rosmake --rosdep-install rgbdslam",it shows as below:
...
[ rosmake ] Output from build of package eigen written to:
[ rosmake ]    /home/sven/.ros/rosmake/rosmake_output-20121211-095817/eigen/build_output.log

Éªs there any problems with the package or this package can not run on Ubuntu 10.04 with electric?

A:

That looks like you are having issues with access to the svn server not an issue with your OS.
