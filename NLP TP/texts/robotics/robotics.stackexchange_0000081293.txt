Q:

fatal error: rqt_gui_cpp/plugin.h: No such file or directory

Hello,
I'm trying to build PTAM on ROS : http://wiki.ros.org/ethzasl_ptam but I'm getting the following error:
remote_ptam.h:38:32: fatal error: rqt_gui_cpp/plugin.h: No such file or directory
I checked and rqt_gui_cpp/plugin.h does exist under /opt/ros/kinetic/include.
I'm working with Ros Kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04.
QMake version 2.01a
Using Qt version 4.8.7 in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
Does anyone know what's wrong?

A:

It was mostly missing some package dependencies,
I updated it to build with kinetic and made a pr.
You can try it out (I don't know if it works, I just made it build):
git clone -b kineticbuild https://github.com/lucasw/ethzasl_ptam.git

The changes are probably compatible with jade as well.
