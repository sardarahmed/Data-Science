Q:

how to programmatically add/remove displays in rviz

I was wondering if there is a way to programmatically add and remove Displays in rviz? I would think that if the feature existed it would come in the form of a topic or service that a node can publish to or call to add or remove a Display of a certain DisplayType.

A:

rviz does not have an API to do that currently.  I suggest that you file a feature request ticket.
