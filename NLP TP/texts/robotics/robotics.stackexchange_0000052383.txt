Q:

Installing PCL 1.7 (trunk) on ROS Groovy

Hi,
i tried do install the current PCL trunk for the last 2 day without success. I know that there are some solutions to do this in this forum and elsewhere, but no one works for me.
I have to say that i'm quiet new to ROS und PCL and also not a Linux expert. So i can build the PCL trunk and PCL_ROS, but it doesn't exist as ROS package then.
I need this for a university project, it would be great if somebody could help me out there and discribe how to get it run in simple words. Thanks!

Did you follow the description at http://www.ros.org/wiki/pcl17 ? If so, can you give any error messages or similar?

A:

clone https://github.com/ros-perception/perception_pcl.git in your catkin workspace.
Then use catkin_make_isolated.

I followed your instructions but it gives such error during cmake(after cloning pcl17-trunk):
CMake Error at cmake/pcl_targets.cmake:103 (add_library):
Cannot find source file:
include/pcl/ModelCoefficients.h

Any suggestions?
