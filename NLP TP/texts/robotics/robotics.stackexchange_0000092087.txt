Q:

In which version of Autoware the Gazebo Catvehicle simulation is supported?

Before 1.10.0 version I can see Gazebo Catvehicle packages in Autoware/ros/src/simulation/ folder, but I tried hard to bring it up in the docker. Either the compiling was not successful or the Gazebo crashed. I guess I was not using the right version of Autoware to replicate it, since the official Catvehicle package is only supported in ROS Indigo.
Can anyone give me any suggestions to help me gothrough it? Can I continue to work on it uder ROS Kinetic and Gazebo 7?
Thank you

A:

Currently, Catvehicle is not used in autoware gazebo simulatior.
autoware gazebo had not been supported with kinetic for a while, but recently I support gazebo simulator from Autoware 1.11 (ROS kinetic and gazebo7).
