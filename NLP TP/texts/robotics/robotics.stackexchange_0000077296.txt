Q:

Rostopic new terminal

Okay, I am trying to learn ROS, and have just started.
After installing ROS Indigo and Gazebo7.
I tried running the turtlesim as given in the ROS wiki tutorial:
The tutorial says that in new terminal  run: rosrun turtlesim turtle_teleop_key
When I open a new terminal window and run this command I get the error message rosrun: command not found
Am I missing something? What?

A:

You probably need to source the setup.bash in your new terminal.
Sourcing the setup.bash for ROS only affects the terminal that you run it in, so you need to source the setup.bash for ROS in each new terminal (or add it to your bashrc).
