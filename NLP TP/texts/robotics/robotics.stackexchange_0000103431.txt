Q:

How far is the open source software stack from real AMR product?

Hi I can see open source robot solution (e.g., ros,opentcs...) and can search the chipset for demo robot, but I am doing industry mobile robot and thinking how far such kind of software from real-life product ?
Thanks

A:

There are hundreds of robotics companies using this open source stack for their products. Look no further than the sponsors of ROSCon, folks on navigation.ros.org's robot's using page, or any number of other documents.
