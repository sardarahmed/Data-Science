Q:

Accessibility distribution of three vector fields

I have to study the controllability of the kinematic model of a Cycab:

$\dot{q}=g_1(q)v+g_2(q)\omega_R+g_3(q)\omega_L$
where 
$\dot{q}=\begin{bmatrix}\dot{x}\\\dot{y}\\\dot{\theta}\\\dot{\gamma}\\\dot{\phi}\end{bmatrix}$ $g_1(q)=\begin{bmatrix}cos(\theta+\gamma)\\sin(\theta+\gamma)\\\frac{sin(\phi-\gamma)}{lcos(\phi)}\\0\\0\end{bmatrix}$  $g_2(q)=\begin{bmatrix}0\\0\\0\\1\\0\end{bmatrix}$  $g_3(q)=\begin{bmatrix}0\\0\\0\\0\\1\end{bmatrix}$
with $x$ and $y$ the Cartesian coordinates of the midpoint of the rear segment joining the two rear wheels and $\theta$ the direction of the midpoints of the two segments joining the wheels centers with respect to the axis $x$. So, I have to study the accessibility distribution $\{g_1,g_2,g_3.[g_1,g_2],[g_2,[g_1,g_2]],...\}$ so I computed
$[g_1,g_2]=\begin{bmatrix}sin(\theta+\gamma)\\-cos(\theta+\gamma)\\\frac{cos(\phi-\gamma)}{lcos(\phi)}\\0\\0\end{bmatrix}$   $[g_2,[g_1,g_2]]=\begin{bmatrix}-cos(\theta+\gamma)\\-sin(\theta+\gamma)\\\frac{-sin(\phi-\gamma)}{lcos(\phi)}\\0\\0\end{bmatrix}$
so the rank of $[g_1,g_2,g_3,[g_1,g_2],[g_2,[g_1,g_2]]]$ is equal to 5 so we can say that the system is controllable.
Now, is it correct to study the accessibility distribution without using the vector field $g_3$, so is it correct to say that the system is controllable without using the vector field $g_3$?

A:

Chow's Theorem states that:

The driftless system $$\dot q=g_1(q)u_1+...+g_m(q)u_m$$ is locally controllable at $q_0\in\mathbb{R}^n$ if $\text{rank}\bar\Delta(q_0)=n.$

Here, $\bar\Delta$ is the involutive closure of the distribution $\Delta=\text{span}\{g_1,...,g_m\}$ (i.e. the smallest involutive distribution containing $\Delta$). $\bar\Delta,$ also known as the Control Lie Algebra, is found by forming successively larger distributions by repeated computation of the Lie Brackets until an involutive distribution is found. 
To answer your question, there is nothing about $\bar \Delta$ that requires the use of $g_3$ as long as $\bar \Delta$ contains $\Delta,$ so we can make statements about the local controllability without including $g_3$ in the distribution. Because this is a local result, you will have to prove that the system is controllable to any point in $\mathbb{R}^n$ in order to say that the system is controllable.
