Hey, the ROS tutorials say its roswtf is started in the ros::stack. However when I start roswtf, it read  "No package or stack in context" just likes yours. Does it matters?

A:

this means that your ROS_IP or ROS_HOSTNAME is different from your computer IP.
Please follow the network setup tutorials for TurtleBot.
