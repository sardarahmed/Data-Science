Q:

How can I see images from usb_cam?

Good afternoon.
I have usb_camera installed on my groovy raspbian.
I have done : rosparam set usb_cam/pixel_format yuyv and after that I wrote : rosrun usb_cam usb_cam_node
I´m being given :

usb_cam video_device set to [/dev/video0]

       usb_cam io_method set to [mmap]

       usb_cam image_width set to [640]

       usb_cam image_height set to [480]

       usb_cam pixel_format set to [yuyv]

       usb_cam auto_focus set to [0]

      10 frames/sec at 1353855178.185472348

      10 frames/sec at 1353855178.314173063

      9 frames/sec at 1353855178.849589157

      10 frames/sec at 1353855179.782349046

       ...

My rostopic list is the next :
/rosout
/rosout_agg
/usb_cam/camera_info
/usb_cam/image_raw
/usb_cam/image_raw/compressed
/usb_cam/image_raw/compressed/parameter_descriptions
/usb_cam/image_raw/compressedDepth
/usb_cam/image_raw/compressedDepth/parameter_updates
/usb_cam/image_raw/compressedDepth/parameter_descriptions
/usb_cam/image_raw/theora
/usb_cam/image_raw/theora/parameter_descriptions
/usb_cam/image_raw/theora/parameter_updates
What´s the next I have to do to be able to see captured images?
Thanks you so much

A:

If you have a screen connected (and graphical interface) it is easy:
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/usb_cam/image_raw

Otherwise you have to have to look at the multiple machines page:

Thanks for your answer.
I´m getting a poor frame rate this time I don´t know why : only 1 or 2 frames/sec.
I did it but with this message
Xlib: extension "RANDR" missing on display 10.1" What does it mean?
Here is the result : https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11829245/IMG_20140219_235421.jpg

@4LV4R0 It should be a problem of Raspberry Pi instead of ROS. check this: http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=13773&p=205968

I was using xdrp with a remote desktop on windows. I think the missing message was because it. I get 15, 16 frames/sec but I can´t see the image correctly. Can it be because of the pixel_format wich may could not be supported? With mjpeg it´s horrible: only a few frames, not continous, black screen
