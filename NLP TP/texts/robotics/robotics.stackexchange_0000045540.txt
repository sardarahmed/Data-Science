Q:

Pioneer3-Navigation-tf-/odom /map problem

Hello,
I have some problems with a rebuild pioneer3-dx. The rebuild is with a construction(nearby 4kg weight and a Sick LMS 200). Right now I use the navigation stack ( AMCL and the Move_Base) and the p2os-stack(dashboard, motor, driver, joystick). While the robot runs with this configuration, the odom frame drifts farther and farther from the map-frame(the odom rotates around the base_link) see Scheme. After 3 rotations it lose its orientation of the map.
The problem is when I send the target vectors to move_base_client  direct, the zero coordinates change from map(as start point) to odom. At this situation the starting point is now at a new position in the wall. I tried to manipulate the values from navfn and amcl(odom-values) to compress the failure without success. Has anyone knowledge about this problems??  Thanks in anticipate.

What do you men with "the zero coordinates change from map to odom"?
Comment by keron on 2012-11-06:
I mean the origin frame, if I start the robot. This pose is at the frame /map. Normally, during the robot is active /odom should have always the same position nearby the /map. But if I use a joystick or the move_base_client ,the frame /odom drift away.

A:

This is not a problem, but the correct behaviour. The /odom frame naturally has drift and thus will not coincide with /map when running localization. If you want to address coordinates in a globally consistent frame, use /map, not /odom.
