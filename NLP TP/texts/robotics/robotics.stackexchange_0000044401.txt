Q:

rospy: Approximate sync

Is there an approximate synchronisation in rospy? I can't found anything in the documentation. Only here http://www.ros.org/wiki/message_filters section 8.1 speaks about python but it seems as copy paste from section 5.1.

A:

There's a version that was implemented in image_pipeline/camera_calibration here:
https://code.ros.org/trac/ros-pkg/browser/stacks/image_pipeline/trunk/camera_calibration/src/camera_calibration/approxsync.py
I think there's a ticket to migrate it to rospy, but I don't know the status of that.
