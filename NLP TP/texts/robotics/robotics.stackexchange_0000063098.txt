I think we need more information in order to help you. Have you tried running it with --disableShaders ?, Issue started after an update of kernel / drivers ?, if the crash is at starting uwsim, it usually means a graphics/driver problem.

I tried with --disableShaders  but it didnt work. I did not update kernel but i think i updated drivers. Is that the reason?Actually i reinstalled xserver-xorg and then reconfigured it .. Also i upgraded the packages.

It seems the crash happens at window initialization, and if it started with a xserver reinstall I would say it is a drivers issue. Make sure you have 3d support and check your graphic drivers are working as they should.
