Q:

Network unstable between Turtlebot and workstation

Hello, i have a problem with the wireless connection between Turtlebot and my workstation (Dell XPS with Intel Centrino Wireless 6230, ROS-electric).
If i launch the turtlebot_teleop on my workstation the network is stable but if i try to launch something like rviz or image_view the network falls.
Initially the bit-rate was 2 Mbit/s while now is about 40 kbit/s without modify nothing. However, the network is always falling.
I have tried to change workstation with a old acer and the network was slowly but stable!
How can i solve this problem?

A:

It's not hard to saturate your network connection when streaming things like raw images and point clouds (which you may be visualizing with image_view or rviz). There are a few things you could try:

When subscribing to images, use one of the compressed transports (compressed or theora)
Try throttling point clouds on the machine that publishes them. According to my back of the envelope calculation, the point cloud from a kinect creates about 140MB/s of data, which on its own could saturate a 802.11n link. You can throttle topics with topic_tools/throttle.
