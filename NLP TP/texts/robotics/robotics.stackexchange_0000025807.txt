Q:

ROS gazebo sometimes crashing at launch (Groovy)

Two out of three times, it crashes at launch. So eventually I can launch gazebo after few tries but still not a desirable experience. Can someone take a look and check there is some bug/race condition? Or, is this known problem?

This code block was moved to the following github gist:

A:

Thanks for the backtrace. The problem is known, and the best solution is to use the stand-alone version of Gazebo. The version shipped in Groovy is out of date.
You can install Gazebo with these instructions: http://gazebosim.org/wiki/1.4/install
