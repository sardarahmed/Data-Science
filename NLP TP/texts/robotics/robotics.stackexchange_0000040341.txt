Q:

Talk to PC from ROSJava/Android using USB?

Is it possible to connect a Android Phone using ROSJava and a PC running the ROS Core via USB? I'm hoping to not use Wifi. Or alternatively, has anyone seen any projects that attempted this?

Follow up, if your phone supports tethering this appears to be really easy. My phone was locked down by Verizon. However using a custom ROM was an acceptable solution.

A:

Yes, this is possible if your phone supports USB tethering.  See my question here.
