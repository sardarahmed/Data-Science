Q:

tcp implentation in ROS

I am defining TCP/IP servers in the ROS node.
At the same time I want to subscribe to topic also.
What I am finding is, once enabled subscribing of topic, I am not able to send/receive data on the sockets I am using.
I am using 6001 and 6002 socket numbers for my own sockets.

A:

Are you error checking your sockets? Is this threaded? You might check here for inspiration:

I did this a while back.
