Q:

Testing with rosmake -a -t fails because a test did not run. What's wrong?

Running 'rosmake -a -t' I get some test failures attributed to 'test did not run. Expected results in xxx.xml'. How can I determine what's wrong and fix it?
An abbreviated example:

ERRORS/FAILURES:
[test_tf2.test_convert/test_ran][FAILURE]---------------------------------------   Unable to find test results for
TEST-test_convert.xml, test did not
run. Expected results in
/home/teh/.ros/test_results/test_tf2/TEST-test_convert.xml
  PACKAGES:

test_tf2
SUMMARY

RESULT: FAIL
TESTS: 5
ERRORS: 0
FAILURES: 5

A:

I suggest going into the directory and trying to execute the tests manually to get more information.
