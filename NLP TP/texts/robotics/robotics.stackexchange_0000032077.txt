Q:

How to simulate a simple light sensor in Gazebo?

What is the best way to simulate a simple Lego NXT light sensor in Gazebo? Is there already some existing photodetector Gazebo plugin? If not, what rough steps would you propose?

A:

I don't know if this is overkill, or if there is something simpler, but I'd modify the camera sensor code, and either adjust it to a single pixel, or do averaging over many, and publish intensity instead of an image.
