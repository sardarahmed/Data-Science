It would be helpful if you provide the link the the tutorial. I suppose it is the one accessible  http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/Tutorials here

A:

If you are new to ROS I assume you did not compile ROS from source. This means you can skip the rosmake step and try

rosrun urdfdom check_urdf my_robot.urdf

I am guessing you installed groovy?
