A:

This question is unclear. What exactly are you looking for? Could you give us an example perhaps? ROS itself is nothing more than C++ and Python libraries and applications, so no special ROS IDE is required to develop code that uses ROS libraries.
If you'd like to use an IDE for ROS development, see the ROS IDEs page for details on configuring IDEs such as Eclipse or Netbeans for doing development within ROS.

Can't edit the answer. The correct URL for IDEs is http://wiki.ros.org/IDEs
