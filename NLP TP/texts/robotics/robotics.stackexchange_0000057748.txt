Q:

catkin_add_env_hooks cross-platform?

What are implications of catkin_add_env_hooks and Windows? Do they just get ignored, with the intent that they're mainly there to provide window-dressing stuff like tab completion?

A:

Environment hooks are not only available on Linux. And they don't only provide stuff like tab completion.
It is perfectly valid and encouraged to not only have sh/bash environment hooks but also bat equivalents. E.g. the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH must be available on all platforms and is also defined in an environment hook:

Okay, that's helpful, thanks. My specific interest is detecting hardware at setup time, for example to optionally launch drivers depending on paths present in /dev (or equivalent detecting schemes on other platforms).
