Also: please tell us how you installed ROS (which tutorial(s) did you follow, if any) and which version it is.

From:

-- The CXX compiler identification is unknown

and:

CMake Error: your CXX compiler: "CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER-NOTFOUND" was not found.   Please set CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER to a valid compiler path or name. 

I would say you don't have any C++ compiler installed.
can you try something like which g++ and append the output to your original question?
