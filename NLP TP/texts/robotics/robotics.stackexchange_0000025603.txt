Q:

Boost filesystem3 not found when building Gazebo from source

I am building Gazebo 1.3.1 on Ubuntu 12.04 and have all the dependencies needed for the build in place. I am using Boost library version 1.52. The build process has no problems through configuring using cmake, but during linking the gazebo executable file, I run into the message
common/libgazebo_common.so.1.3.1: undefined reference to boost::filesystem3::detail::status(boost::filesystem3::path const&, boost::system::error_code*)'`,
along with other errors in finding Boost filesystem3 calls.
I have applied the patch from here but it still does not fix the filesystem3 compatibility issue.
Has anyone compiled Gazebo using Boost library 1.52, and resolved the filesystem3 conflicts?

A:

This problem was a result of having multiple installations of lib Boost.
