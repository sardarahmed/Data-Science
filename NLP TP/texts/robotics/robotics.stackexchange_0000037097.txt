Q:

Using services from Node

hi all,
I need to call a service from node. I was trying to find something to write in .cpp file for calling the service.
I found something in the API, but i don't understand how to use it.
I have to call the service "gazebo/apply_body_wrench" described in Gazebo Tutorial.
