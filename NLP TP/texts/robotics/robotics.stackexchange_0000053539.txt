Q:

RosJava Android rosparam files

Hi
Is there anyway using rosjava on android to be able to load rosparam files from a config file like normal ROS? because it had to be associated in a launch file and android doesn't have that

A:

Take a look at ParameterLoaderNode. You can send it a list of YAML files, each one with a list of (parameter, value) entries; they will be loaded to the parameter server when the node starts.
