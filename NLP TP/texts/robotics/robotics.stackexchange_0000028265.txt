Q:

Help! Have I dreamed that?

Hi all,
Less than three months ago, I came to know that there was a simulator feature that was really what I needed. A sensor plugin to simulate a "virtual camera" that tells you which object is currently seen. I absolutely can't remember where I read this stuff and in the list of available plugins (http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_gzplugins) there's no such thing.
Can you please tell me if there's such a functionality in gazebo and how to find it?
Thanks.

A:

Sounds like you're talking about the logical camera. Here is a world that uses it. I don't see any tutorials for it, but if you figure it out a contribution of a tutorial would be very welcome here.
Looks like there is a message logical_camera_image.proto.There may be a topic publishing that message. The logical_camera_sensor integration test should show howto read the camera output.

I've launched logical_camera.world, but how am I supposed to read the camera output?

I updated the answer with a link to a message and the tests for the logical camera sensor. I haven't used this sensor myself, but if I needed to use it those links are where I would start.
