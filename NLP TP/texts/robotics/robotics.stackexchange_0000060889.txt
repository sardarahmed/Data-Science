Q:

how to prohibit global planning through unknown area?

Hi, All,
occasionally, I found my navigational stack (move_base) plans a route through unknown space.
how do I prohibit such behaviour?
I noticed there's a parameter
allow_unknown: false

for this purpose, But where should it be set?
Regards
Ray

A:

Hi Ray,
You can create a configuration file named base_global_planner_param.yaml on your navigation package (assuming that the package name is my_robot_2dnav and that you are using the default global planner NavfnROS) with the following contents:
NavfnROS:
  allow_unknown: false

And then load it when you launch the move_base node:
<launch>
...
  <node pkg="move_base" type="move_base" name="move_base">
    ...
    <rosparam file="$(find my_robot_2dnav)/base_global_planner_param.yaml" command="load"/>
    ...
  </node>
...
</launch>

Good luck!
