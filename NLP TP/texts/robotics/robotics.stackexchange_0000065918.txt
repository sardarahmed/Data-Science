Q:

Is it possible to specify an npm package as a catkin dependency?

Specifically, I'm creating a package that uses yeoman, bower, and grunt. So I'd like for anyone to be able to run rosdep install mypackage and not only get nodejs, but also have something like npm install -g yo bower grunt-cli be run automatically.

A:

No, but support could be added.
To do this you would need to add support for npm in rosdep. A good place to start would be to look at support for pip and gem in rosdep, especially gem since it was added recently. Then you could specify npm keys in the rosdep database and in your package's package.xml and have the rosdep CLI install them for you.
One caveat with all of these cross platform package managers is that when doing binary packaging, we cannot build a .deb for example of a package which depends on something that is not installed from apt-get.
