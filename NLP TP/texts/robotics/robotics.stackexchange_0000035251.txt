Q:

Problems using GridCells msgs in own eclipse project

Hello,
i would like to use the GridCells messages defined in common_msgs/nav_msgs in my own project.
Up till now i had a include_directory() statement in my CMakeList.txt file which pointed to the header file defining GridCells, but i wander if i could just add a  onto my manifest.xml and add #include "nav_msgs/GridCells.h" to my code. ( like stated in the tutorial http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/DefiningCustomMessages )
My problem is if i do that compilation still fails saying that GridCells.h is not found. What i dont udnerstand about the nav_msgs package is that it doest seems to export any linker cflags for incluing the messages of the package.
So  how am i supposed to use this messages without having to specify the include file by hand?
Regards,
Manuel

A:

Hello,
the problem was that i am using the eclipse environment for development and build. After chancing CMakeList.txt i forgot to run "cmake Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" to rebuild the eclipse project files. After doing so, the header file was found and everything compiled fine.
Thank you very much!
