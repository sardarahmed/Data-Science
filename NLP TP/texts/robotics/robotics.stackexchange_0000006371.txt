Q:

Basic programming in arducopter

I am starting with a project using Arducopter. I am a person familiar with arduino, but seeing the arducopter for the first time. Commands codes and everything is completly different compared to normal Arduino programming. I am not getting any help or commandlist for specific purposes in arducopter. Any body can help me in leading to any links which can help me out..

A:

You should start with http://dev.ardupilot.com/
You can find articles that will make you familarize with code.
Alternatively you can look at Aeroquad(https://github.com/AeroQuad/AeroQuad) which runs quadcopter on Arduino
