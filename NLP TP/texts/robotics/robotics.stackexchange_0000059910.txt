I download the latest updated navigation package from github.And I come across a problem .move_base crashed when I call clear_costmaps service at high rate,such as 2Hz.
below is the error infomation:

  what():  std::bad_alloc

log file: /home/robocup/.ros/log/ad85e5de-ed8f-11e3-b90b-0015005e1628/move_base-1*.log

A:

Calling clear costmaps at a high rate is probably not tested -- as it is not a common use case. Typically this service is called only periodically when there is too much garbage in the costmaps. If you find yourself calling this frequently, you might want to look at why, and figure out what in your use case causes you to do this.
You might also file a ticket and/or open a pull request if you find a solution to the segfault.

And I thought maybe calling clear costmaps periodically can solve the problem.Then  the error occured like I have   described above. Is there another way to solve the previous problem?
