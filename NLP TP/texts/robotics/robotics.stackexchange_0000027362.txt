Q:

simulate gyroscope, accelerometer, magnetometer, and GPS?

Hi
I'm working on project for localization of cars, and I use accelerometer, gyroscope and GPS, (perhaps I will need magnetometer)
I need to know if your simulator can be used in my case (before reading all the documentation) and I prepared this list of questions (according to answers, I will decide to use it or not ) :
can it

Simulate gyroscope, accelerometer, magnetometer, and GPS ?
Simulate the sensor errors ? can I choose the error's variance ?
work with C language ?
Can I make scenarios ( for 2 ~ 5 minutes )?
from where I can read the simulated output ? socket (TCP/IP protocol) or files like in /dev/*  ?

Any ideas anyone?

A:

Gazebo has IMU, Camera (2d & 3d), magnetometer, GPS, and many more sensors.

You can add noise to many of the sensors. Gaussian noise is built into gazebo, but you can extend this functionality.

The API uses c++

There is no limit on the size of an environment, or the amount of time you want to run simulation.

Data is available via TCP/IP, through a library interface, and you can also write custom plugins to handle other cases.
