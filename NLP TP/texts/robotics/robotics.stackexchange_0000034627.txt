Q:

Problems with building ros packages

Hello I am new to linux and the ros operating system and I am trying to build the ros packages with diamondback but I am having a lot of trouble. For when I invoke $rosmake mini_max , I build most of the packages but I get a message that says that some of the stacks failed to load and one of the packages aren't built. The following below is what I get:
karl@ubuntu:~$ rosmake mini_max
[ rosmake ] Packages requested are: ['mini_max']
[ rosmake ] Logging to directory/home/karl/.ros/rosmake/rosmake_output-20111001-143339
[ rosmake ] Expanded args ['mini_max'] to:
['mini_max_apps', 'mini_max_tutorials', 'mini_max_defs']
[ rosmake ] Checking rosdeps compliance for packages mini_max.  This may take a few seconds.

A:

It looks like you don't have arm_navigation_msgs installed, which is a dependency of mini_max. You'll have to install the arm_navigation stack before building mini_max.
arm_navigation_msgs is a new package in Electric, so you'll also have to upgrade to ROS Electric from Diamondback.
