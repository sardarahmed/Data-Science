Q:

How is Kinect Data Read by ROS

Hi,
Does anybody know how kinect data is processed in ROS. as i know it has a RGB Data and a Depth Data usually stored in a .xed file. Anybody knows how its processed in ROS??
If its split into 2 files or seperate streams etc?? Does OpenNi do it for ROS??

A:

The ROS drivers simply interact with OpenNI by registering appropriate callbacks and receiving data from OpenNI through these callback functions. There are no .xed files, simply a callback for each stream of data (RGB stream + Depth Stream).
