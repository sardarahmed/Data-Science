Q:

weird logs when using tab completion on rosrun

Recently, I get some weird log messages when i try to complete the package name (or exec name) for rosrun using the tab key:
rosrun ro[OPTION]...: command not found
PATTERN: command not found
by: command not found
-i: command not found
The program 'and' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:
sudo apt-get install and
PATTERN: command not found
PATTERN: command not found
PATTERN: command not found
PATTERN: command not found
No command 'use' found, did you mean:
 Command 'nse' from package 'ns2' (universe)
 Command 'ase' from package 'python-ase' (universe)
 Command 'fuse' from package 'fuse-emulator-sdl' (universe)
 Command 'fuse' from package 'fuse-emulator-gtk' (universe)
 Command 'muse' from package 'muse' (universe)
use: command not found
obtain: command not found
ignore: command not found
No command 'force' found, did you mean:
 Command 'forge' from package 'snap' (universe)
 Command 'zforce' from package 'gzip' (main)
force: command not found
No command 'force' found, did you mean:
 Command 'zforce' from package 'gzip' (main)
 Command 'forge' from package 'snap' (universe)
force: command not found
a: command not found
suppress: command not found
bash: syntax error near unexpected token `newline'

If I enter a fully qualified name rosrun is still working! Also auto completion is still working for roslaunch. Any ideas what could cause this??
Under Ubuntu 14.04.2 ROS indigo....

A:

By comparing my during the installation modified ~/.bashrc with /etc/skel/.bashrc using diff I found that I accidentally inserted some characters behind a grep alias in the ~/.bashrc:
That's how it was, which caused the autocompletion error:
alias grep='grep --color=auto'accidentally inserted characters

That's how it now is and should be:
alias grep='grep --color=auto'

Apparently the autocompletion for rosrun somehow uses this alias which caused the failure...
