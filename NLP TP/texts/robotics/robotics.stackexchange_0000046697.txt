Q:

interface node failing to launch

I'm trying to use a Phidgit InterfaceKit 8/8/8 USB interface.
I have been able to get the package installed, but I get an error when I try to launch the package. The USB interface is recognized as verified by lsusb.
Below is the error that I receive when running this line of code:
roslaunch phidgets_ros interface_kit.launch
and the error:
*started roslaunch server http://192.168.1.12:50386/

Now, /home/ros-root/fuerte_workspace/sandbox/phidgets_ros/src/phidgets_ros/interface_kit.py exists... but I'm not sure about the next part of the message "ImportError: No module named msg"...
Any suggestions on why this isn't launching? Any suggestions about this error?
I appreciate the help.
Joe

A:

Have you done:
rosmake phidgets_ros

and maybe also:
roscd phidgets_ros
make

Looks like the messages defined by the package have not been built yet.
Also, please tag your questions, that makes it easier for people to find them (thus making it more likely that you'll get an answer :)

Yup. That was the issue. For some reason it was failing to make but not throwing an error.
The permissions for the "phidgets_ros" folder were set to user permissions and not for read/ write for the "adm" group. ROS wasn't able to "make" with out the proper folder permissions.

I'll remember to set the tags in the future. I didn't realize that search didn't search the text of the threads as well as the tags. Thanks for the advice.

Now to figure out how to record data while echoing /interface_kit/116807/sensor/1 (which is the one I currently have it plugged in to... Thanks for the help!
