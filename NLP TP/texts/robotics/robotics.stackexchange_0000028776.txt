Q:

Gazebo 9 Contact Plugin Not Working

I have followed the tutorial in this link http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=contact_sensor for contact sensor plugin. However, it seems not just plugin, the sensor itself is not working in gazebo 9.7 . Is there anyone make it running in the gazebo 9?

A:

For anyone who encounters the same issue. The bumper sensor should be attached to the link with the desired collision. Sensor should not be attached to a dedicated link.
