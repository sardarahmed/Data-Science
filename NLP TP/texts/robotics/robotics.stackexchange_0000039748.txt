Q:

Include headers which is in an external package

Hello, I'd like to ask how to include headers in an external package.
I created a package as followings.
・package name: test
・include/test/test.hpp↓
  #ifndef _TEST
  #define _TEST
　#include <iostream>
　
　void test(void);
  #endif
・src/test.cpp↓
  #include "test/test.hpp"

  void test(void)
  {
    std::cout << "test\n";
  }

I added "rosbuild_add_libraries(test src/test.cpp)" in the manifest.xml for it
and lib/test.so was successfully created.
In this case, how do I should include header "test.hpp" in other packages ?
I added " in manifest.xml in other packages, however rosmake failed.
What should I do?
Thank you.

A:

You need put your include path into the export tag of the manifest of "test" as well.
See http://www.ros.org/wiki/Manifest and cflags in the -Tag documentation.
