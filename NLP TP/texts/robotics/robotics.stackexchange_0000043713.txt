Q:

ROS fuerte swig-wx

still trying to install ROS fuerte in OSX lion this formula seems to be broken, I tried brew install -vd swig-wx
long story short :
Error: #<BuildError: Failed executing: make install >

/usr/local/Library/Homebrew/formula.rb:504:in system' /usr/local/Library/Formula/swig-wx.rb:15:in install'
/usr/local/Library/Homebrew/build.rb:118:in install' /usr/local/Library/Homebrew/formula.rb:221:in brew'
/usr/local/Library/Homebrew/formula.rb:533:in stage' /usr/local/Library/Homebrew/extend/fileutils.rb:21:in mktemp'
/usr/local/Library/Homebrew/formula.rb:529:in stage' /usr/local/Library/Homebrew/formula.rb:216:in brew'
/usr/local/Library/Homebrew/build.rb:98:in install' /usr/local/Library/Homebrew/build.rb:42:in main'
/usr/local/Library/Homebrew/build.rb:12
/usr/local/Library/Formula/swig-wx.rb:12
==> Rescuing build...
When you exit this shell Homebrew will attempt to finalise the installation.
If nothing is installed or the shell exits with a non-zero error code,
Homebrew will abort. The installation prefix is:
/usr/local/Cellar/swig-wx/1.3.29
how will this affect ROS fuerte? Is there a known solution?

I found "To install the swig-wx I followed this post http://ardadv.blogspot.com.au/2012/05/using-ros-robot-operating-system-fuerte.html >> cd /Library/Caches/Homebrew/swigwx--git ./configure make make install
Paul Flick (Jul 12 '12)" to be the best answer

A:

This commit fixes this problem for me on Lion:
https://github.com/ros/homebrew-fuerte/commit/9bb9228b210ad0feb76ef778bf44886a74b80d44
That is, brew update and then brew install swig-wx should now work.
