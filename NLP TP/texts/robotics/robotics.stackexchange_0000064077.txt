A:

You can also use sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-usb-cam, replacing kinetic with your desired distribution. This will install the package to your /opt/ros/kinetic/lib directory.

These days (sometime after ROS Indigo era), binary of usb_cam has been released, so I think this is more preferable answer.
