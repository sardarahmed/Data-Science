Q:

Control robot using controller/followjointtrejectory/goal

Hi,
Is it possible to control a robot by using the topic controller/followjointTrejectory/goal. I could see when using moveit, move_group is publishing joint goals to this topic. Similarly, can I control the robot without moveit. I tried publishing joint goal to goal topic. Rostopic echo also giving the data which I published. But robot is not moving. Is there another service to be called after publishing the joint goal.

Can you please add the console output of the controller node, to find out why the robot is not moving?

A:

The topic you are seeing belongs to an action. And yes, you can definitely control the robot this way, without using moveit.
If you look at your current setup, probably you start somewhere the
joint_trajectory_controller. You can use it to control your robot directly in the joint space. There is also an rqt plugin for this controller. YOu could use it for a first try.
Or see here for a Tutorial including source code.
Just keep in mind that there is no obstacle avoidance or anything, then. The robot just moves where you ask it to go to.
