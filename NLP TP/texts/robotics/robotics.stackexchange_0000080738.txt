Q:

Configuring my LeddarVu sensor through a ROS package from github

https://github.com/mcgill-robotics/ros-leddar. In the github page, I have completed the steps stated in the READMe.md file up to the step for running, where I am stuck.
In this step, I am running the command they gave me
roslaunch leddar leddar.launch serial:=<serial> frame:=<frame_id> fov:=<fov> range:=<range>

inserting the correct parameter values, but I am getting this error:
(EDIT: I actually received this error from using catkin_make in my root folder just now)
#### Running command: "make -j8 -l8" in "/home/narayan/catkin_leddar_ws/build"
####
[ 50%] Built target leddar_gencfg

make[1]: *** [leddar/CMakeFiles/leddar.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2
Invoking "make -j8 -l8" failed

How can I fix this error? Any more help would be appreciated
Thank you!

This is way too vague. What "trouble" have you been having exactly? Which package "from a github page" are you trying to use? How did you retrieve, build and install it? Which OS is this, exactly? Please update your question by editing it.

I have updated it.  I can specify more if needed.

A:

Have you sourced the devel/setup.bash of the workspace where you compiled the package?

Edit:

Linking CXX executable /home/narayan/catkin_leddar_ws/devel/lib/leddar/leddar

/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lLeddarTech
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lLeddar
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lLeddarC
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

Have you set the environment variable that configures where the LeddarTech driver is located? Under Compilation in the readme:

You must compile this package before being able to run it. You can do so by running:
export LEDDAR_LIB_DIR=/path/to/driver

catkin_make

I think if you don't do this linking will not be successful.
In any case: if you keep encountering errors while trying to compile this package I recommend you open an issue on the issue tracker of the package.
This is no longer a problem with ROS per se.

So what is the output of rospack find leddar?
Comment by narayan on 2017-05-11:
It is giving me an error, "[rospack] Error: package 'leddar' not found"
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-05-11:
Ok. So did you build your workspace after cloning the package sources from github? You write that you "have completed the steps stated in the READMe.md file". Does that include the catkin_make step? Was that successful?
rospack not finding your pkg is indicative of a problem here.
Comment by narayan on 2017-05-11:
catkin_make is now successful, but the command "roslaunch leddar leddar.launch serial:..." now has a different error, which is "Linking CXX executable /home/narayan/catkin_leddar_ws/devel/lib/leddar/leddar
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lLeddarTech"
