Q:

Callback implementation

I would like to know a low-level implementation on how callback is implemented in ROS. Does it use function pointers, function objects or commands and Hollywood or any others. Could somebody point me to any of its implementations.
Thanks in advance.

A:

Function callbacks are based on C++ functor objects. roscpp normally uses something that's compatible with the return value of boost::bind, e.g. boost::function. There are a bunch of overloaded versions of subscribe that take normal function pointers though. Internally, these methods just use boost::bind to generate the functor object. Have a look at roscpp/include/ros/node_handle.h.
