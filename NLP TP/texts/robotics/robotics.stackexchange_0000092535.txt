Q:

cannot install/run rosbridge on raspberry pi 3

I have a Raspberry Pi 3B which has debian stretch OS and a ROS kinetic running on it.
I have tried to install rosbridge_suite and rosbridge_server on it from source as with this code and I had the following error:
sudo apt install ros-kinetic-rosbridge-server ros-kinetic-rosbridge-suite
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-kinetic-rosbridge-server
E: Unable to locate package ros-kinetic-rosbridge-suite

I believe rosbridge for ROS kinetic is already available, correct me if I am mistaken.
After this failed trial, I tried to build it using a rosinstall_generator as described in here , by those commands:
$ pi@raspberrypi:~/ros_catkin_ws $ rosinstall_generator rosbridge_server --rosdistro kinetic --deps --wet-only --tar > kinetic-custom_ros.rosinstall
$ pi@raspberrypi:~/ros_catkin_ws $  wstool init src kinetic-ros_comm-wet.rosinstall
Error: There already is a workspace config file .rosinstall at "src". Use wstool install/modify.
pi@raspberrypi:~/ros_catkin_ws $ wstool merge -t src kinetic-custom_ros.rosinstall
     Performing actions: 
     Add new elements:
  common_msgs/actionlib_msgs,  common_msgs/diagnostic_msgs,  common_msgs/nav_msgs,  common_msgs/sensor_msgs,  common_msgs/stereo_msgs,  common_msgs/trajectory_msgs,  common_msgs/visualization_msgs,  geometry2/tf2_msgs,  ros_tutorials/rospy_tutorials,  rosauth,  rosbag_migration_rule,  rosbridge_suite/rosapi,  rosbridge_suite/rosbridge_library,  rosbridge_suite/rosbridge_msgs,  rosbridge_suite/rosbridge_server
Config changed, maybe you need run wstool update to update SCM entries.
Overwriting /home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/src/.rosinstall*
update complete.

then I enter this:
pi@raspberrypi:~/ros_catkin_ws $  wstool update -t src

After doing this and catkin making, when I ask for rospack list to see the downloaded/built packages, I cannot see rosbridge server or rosbridge suite. Anway, afterwards I tried to run a node for rosbridge :
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ roslaunch rosbridge_server rosbridge_udp.launch

and I got the error:
[rosbridge_udp.launch] is neither a launch file in package [rosbridge_server] nor is [rosbridge_server] a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

Afterwards, I went to the folder in which launch file is located, and tried to run it with:
pi@raspberrypi:~/ros_catkin_ws/src/rosbridge_suite/rosbridge_server/launch $ roslaunch rosbridge_udp.launch

As you can see I cannot run the node , and I am not sure what is the reason.
Thank you for your help!

A:

It seems that the answer is following installation steps strictly,
after adding a new package with rosinstall:
$ cd ~/ros_catkin_ws
$ rosinstall_generator <your_required_ros_packages> --rosdistro kinetic --deps --wet-only --tar > kinetic-custom_ros.rosinstall
$ wstool merge -t src kinetic-custom_ros.rosinstall
$ wstool update -t src
One should catkin make in a special method (I was just catkin_make'ing and the package did not build in that case):
$ sudo ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release --install-space /opt/ros/kinetic
So this solves the installation and building any package to RosberryPi
