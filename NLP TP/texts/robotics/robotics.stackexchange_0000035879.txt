Q:

set waypoints for robot

Hi!
Could be rviz (or any over utils) used for interactive placing route points of the robot?
Thank you!
UPD it seems possible to write the plugin for rviz (although it is strange that this has not - the problem seems standard). But the documentation on writing rviz plugins doesnt available :(

I think the reason that there isn't is that rviz is mainly a display tool. It is currently undergoing a lot of changes including plugin API. see: http://ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Planning/rviz

How about using Interactive Markers? -> http://www.ros.org/wiki/interactive_markers
