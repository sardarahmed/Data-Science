Q:

How to encode special characters in a launch file  element

In the following example, I would like to have the value of the parameter "myString" to contain only two ASCII characters: CarriageReturn and LineFeed. How do I specify them in the definition of a parameter in a launch file?
I've searched for the definition for all of the "special characters" but have not yet found the right combination of search terms.

BTW, what is your actual use case here? I mean, \r\n is not your typical parameter, so I was wondering if there is another way to achieve what you need.

A:

Usually, you would encode CR and LF as the XML entities &#13; and &#10; respectively. However, roslaunch trims whitespace (including CR/LF) from the beginning and the end of a parameter string value (which is unfortunate and possibly a bug), and seems to apply the XML end-of-line handling (convert CR+LF and CR to LF) even to these encoded entities (which would be a bug in the XML parser).
