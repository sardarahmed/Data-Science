Q:

UnicodeEncodeError while running roslaunch (kinetic)

Hi there, I'm very new to ROS.
I'm trying to connect my lidar (EAI ydlidar X4) with hector mapping, and downloaded from
git clone https://github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/hector_slam
I've created a launch file (from tutorial online):
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<launch>

  <include file="$(find ydlidar)/launch/lidar_view.launch" />

  <node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="map_to_odom" args="0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 /odom /base_link 40" />

  <node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="base_frame_to_laser" args="0 0 0 0 0 0 /base_link /laser_frame 40" />

  <!--<node pkg="rviz" type="rviz" name="rviz" args="-d $(find hector_slam_launch)/rviz_cfg/mapping_demo.rviz"/>-->

  <include file="$(find hector_mapping)/launch/mapping_default.launch" />
  <node pkg="rviz" type="rviz" name="rviz" args="-d $(find ydlidar)/launch/lidar.rviz" />
  <include file="$(find hector_geotiff)/launch/geotiff_mapper.launch" />
</launch>

however, when I roslaunch it, I got:
Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.
Press Ctrl-C to interrupt
Done checking log file disk usage. Usage is <1GB.

'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xa0' in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

and in the log:
.......

resolved = _resolve_args(arg_str, context, resolve_anon, commands)

UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xa0' in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)

[rospy.core][INFO] 2018-10-03 12:28:17,248: signal_shutdown [atexit]

Anyone knows how to solve this?

A:

According to Python: Removing \xa0 from string?, ordinal \xa0 is a "non breaking space".
That is indeed a unicode character, not an ascii one.
If you copied your example from a website, those can include non-breaking spaces (as those are often used on websites to make sure the browser doesn't affect code example rendering).
I would advise you to rewrite your launch file.
Suspicuous characters are:

whitespace (ie: spaces)
(double) quotes (ie: ' and ")
question marks (ie: ?)

the latter may be surprising, but I've been in situations where it was not a question mark from the ascii range (ie: the "normal" question mark), but a slightly different version, from a unicode table.
Just replace all of those with a text editor and try again.
If your editor supports encoding transformations (ie: wholesale conversion from UTF to ASCII) then you could try those.

Thank you so much! I tried that out and the error is gone. Unfortunately, got another error when re-attempting...
Skipped loading plugin with error: XML Document '/opt/ros/kinetic/share/hector_worldmodel_geotiff_plugins/hector_geotiff_plugins.xml' has no Root Element.

Well, that looks like a different problem, so that deserves its own question (but do first search for your current problem, as we don't need more duplicates).
