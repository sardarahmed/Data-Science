Q:

NAO applications using ROS

I want to develop an application for NAO robot using ROS (I already started to use ROS with NAO). But I don't know how to choose a scenario for my robot depending on ROS packages (SLAM, objects recognition...).
My question is: is there any ROS packages for NAO applications that i can started with (turtlebot robot for example has the navigation stacks -SLAM- in ROS).
Can anyone help me please??

A:

There are quite a few NAO related packages available for ROS. One of them is a Kinect based teleoperation package: which may not have been updated recently.

But on the bigger scheme of things, perhaps you can try setting up MoveIt! for NAO, and subsequently use it for motion planning on the arms.

There is also a NAO path follower stack at http://wiki.ros.org/nao_path_follower
