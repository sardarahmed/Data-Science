Q:

Delete multiple ROS parameters at once

I am trying to delete multiple ROS parameters at once using rosparam delete but the command-line only allows to delete the parameters one by one. Unfortunately, sometimes, when re-running a node some of the node state is preserved in the parameters, hence when I want to make sure the nodes start in initial, canonical state I want to clear multiple parameter values at once. I imagine something like
rosparam delete '/my_node/*'

A:

From the command line, you can delete it with:
rosparam delete /my_node

This should get rid of all parameters in your node's namespace. Alternatively, when using a launch file you can use clear_params (see here):
<node name="foo" pkg="bar" type="baz" clear_params="true" />

This will get rid of all params in namespace foo before launching the node.
