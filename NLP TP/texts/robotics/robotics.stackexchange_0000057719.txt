Q:

How versioned build_depend works?

Inspired by this thread, I'm trying to utilize version_gte defined in REP-0127.
I created an empty package beginner_tutorials from a tutorial, then placed in package.xml:
  <build_depend version_gte="1.10.3" version_lt="2.0">roscpp</build_depend>

where $ rosversion roscpp returns 1.10.2, expecting build would fail. But catkin_make-ing (tried install too) doesn't not even yield warning and just passed normally. Am I missing something?

Update) Answer from @Dirk Thomas gong something in me, and it was actually the following that was missing.
catkin_package(
  CATKIN_DEPENDS roscpp
)

A:

The CMake configure step does show a warning if you find_package() your build dependency and it does not satisfy the version specified in your package.xml file.

Is there a way to let catkin return error instead of warning when the specified version dependency is not met?

No, currently these are always only warnings. Since sometimes this is a scenario a developer might have setup locally it would be bad to escalate it into an error.
