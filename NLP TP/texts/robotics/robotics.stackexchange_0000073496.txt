Q:

How to run a driver found on GitHub?

Hello,
I'm new to Ubuntu and especially to ROS.
I use the thermal camera A65 from FLIR and found a driver here.
How do I download and run this driver on ROS? Could somebody give me the exact comands I have to type in, beginning on opening the terminal the first time?
I'm very frustrated, because I need to use the camera with ROS but can't even follow the README on the repository..
Thank you very very much in advance!
Edit:
ROS-Version: Jade Turtle;
Ubuntu-Version: 14.04
Update:
If I do a catkin_make in ´./catkin_ws´ I get the following error. How can I solve this?
-- +++ processing catkin package: 'flir_gige'
-- ==> add_subdirectory(flir_gige)

It would help a lot if you first describe your problems. What are you doing? What is happening?

A:

change into the catkin_ws/src directory and type "git clone https://github.com/KumarRobotics/flir_gige.git"  after downloading, change into catkin_ws directory and type "catkin_make". This should build flir_gige, the e-bus sdk you need to download from pleora and install it, like described
hope this does the job
EDIT: like the error tells you, you need to install e-bus, its mentioned in the README file of flir_gige.

Thank you very much!
Downloading to ./catkin_ws/src worked but after doing the catkin_make in directory ./catkin_ws I get this Error. I've done everything in the README except Running the Node.
What have I done wrong? How do I continue?
Again, thank

Please update your question and copy the error message there. Otherwise, the answer here will be useless for others if the image hoster removes the image.
