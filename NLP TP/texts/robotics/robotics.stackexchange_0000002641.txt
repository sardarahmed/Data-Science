Q:

What is the response time of an Arduino Nano?

I want to make a circuit that powers a transistor when a sound above a set threshold is reached. (Trigger a flash for high speed photography.)
How long will the response time be?

A:

If you're using a microcontroller (Arduino-type) with a loop, you can expect a response time of microseconds or less. If you're using a more advanced controller (Raspberry PI or BeagleBone Black), the latency will be less predictable, but very fast. The reason for less predictable latency is multitasking on the systems running Linux, while the Arduino isn't running anything that will interfere.
Given that you plan to use sound as a signal, there will be physical factors that create greater variation in reaction speed; wind direction comes to mind as a significant source of latency.
Of course, if you're trying to trigger it by the camera click sound, I guess you could do quite well with a simple arduino.
