Q:

Build package everytime a file on the workspace is modified?

I modified some parameters on a file in the catkin worskpace, but nothing happens in the robot. Do i have to build the package everytime i modify something?

What kind of file is it? Is it copied to the install-directory when building? How do you read the parameter file?

it is a publisher node in the catkin workspace

A:

If you require the changes in the publisher node to be reflected when you run it, you need to run catkin_make after making changes to the source file.
