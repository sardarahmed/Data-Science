Q:

libuvc_camera vs. libuvc

Hello,
I would like to compile libuvc_camera with current (git) version of libuvc. The libuvc library is released into ROS but I can't find any catkin package for it. There is release repository (https://github.com/ktossell/libuvc-release) and repository with non-ROS library (https://github.com/ktossell/libuvc). Do I miss something? How can I compile it as a ROS package - to overlay released version (/opt/ros/indigo/share/libuvc)?

A:

Ok, I missed that release repository has more branches - there is release/indigo/libuvc branch which contains catkin package.
