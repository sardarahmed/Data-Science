Q:

rosinstall stuck on perception_pcl

I'm on ubuntu 12.04 and using these instructions  http://ros.org/wiki/Robots/TurtleBot/SDK%20Setup/Source
During the "rosinstall ~/ros turtlebot.rosinstall" part the installation got stuck on
[perception_pcl] Installing https://svn.pointclouds.org/ros/tags/perception_pcl-1.0.2 (None) to /home/owner/ros/perception_pcl
I lefted it on all night and there was still no progress, i checked for other installation methods also, but i wasn't sure what's the same package was called in synaptic  package manager
