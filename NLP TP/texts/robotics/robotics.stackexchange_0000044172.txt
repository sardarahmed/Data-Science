Q:

gmapping creates no map

Hey,
I created a bagfile containing the data of a LaserScan and odometry published
in /tf.
According to rostopic echo the data is fine, by fine I mean the data is changing and in the right form.
Still, for some reason I don't know, this warning occurs:

[ WARN] [1243531255.142345324]:
MessageFilter [target=/odom ]: Dropped
100.00% of messages so far. Please turn the
[ros.gmapping.message_notifier]
rosconsole logger to DEBUG for more
information.

Anyone there, who had the same problem?
P.S.:
I know, there warning contains information about what to do, but I haven't figured out, what it wants me to do...so explanations what "turn the rosconsole logger" means and how it is done are also welcome :-)
Edit:
According to another question asked here, it might be some issue concerning time stamps, therefore I modified my /scan topic by setting the header.stamp to ros::Time::now(), which is exactly what I do with the /odom's header...
Edit2:
link text
That is one of the bagfiles I recorded :-)
Edit3:
testfile
here is a file with a static transform publisher - still all odom data is dropped,
and I really can't make out the difference to the tutorial's bagfile - at least I've found nothing that should matter....

could you post the bagfile? It is hard to tell what's going on without it...

done, thanks for your affords

A:

Are you sure you have set up everything correctly for using simulation time (so the timestamps from the bagfile are used)? Also see the Clock documentation regarding this. You have start a roscore, set the parameter:
rosparam set use_sim_time true

then start anything else you need and then play your bagfile with the --clock option:
rosbag play [your_bagfile] --clock

As for the rosconsole logger question, you can use the rxconsole tool to set different log levels for different nodes and get more debug output.

Short question: Do I have to set use_sim_time before recording the data - because if I follow your instructions still all the odom messages are dropped(rxconsole doesn't really help, seems to be some issue in /tf messagefilter - given codeline is just the output).

I am facing the same problem and I am using the use_sim_time parameter correctly. I have added a static transform publisher between-  base_link and map, & map and odom. This is what i run-
  rosrun gmapping slam_gmapping scan:=base_scan _odom_frame:=odom _base_frame:=base_link _map_frame:=map
