Q:

-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

I have used catkin_make successfully in the past but now whenever i try to use catkin_make  i get the following error( as you can see i just created this directory  named "delete", but catkin_make is still not working (with this directory or any other directory newly or previously created)):
asaad@VAIO:~$ mkdir -p ~/delete/src
asaad@VAIO:~$ cd delete/src/

Comment by inflo on 2015-12-14:
i think catkin_init_workspace failed, create everything new, perhaps with another name?
Comment by Asaad Irfan on 2015-12-15:
i created a new directory named "del" and the same error occurred.
Comment by CMobley7 on 2016-01-21:
Asaad Irfan,
I am actually receiving the same error. Did you ever resolve it?
Thank you for any help you are able to give, as well as your time and attention to this matter. Have a great rest of the week.
Very Respectfully,
CMobley7
Comment by Asaad Irfan on 2016-02-09:
CMobley, i reinstalled ROS because i couldnt find any other way round.

A:

Instead of catkin_init_workspace n you should use simply:
catkin_init_workspace 

See: http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace
