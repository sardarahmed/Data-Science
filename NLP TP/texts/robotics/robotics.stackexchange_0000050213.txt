Q:

How to detect moving object?

Hi peers!
I would like to know how can I make a robot detect a moving object and calculate out the speed of the moving object. Can this be done with a laser scanner or does this require other sensors? Is there any package on ROS that can do this?
Thanks for any advices.

may can use color tracking, such as in gesture recognition ... this for tracking and can edit in algorithm to calculate the speed
