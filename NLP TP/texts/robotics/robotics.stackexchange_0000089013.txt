Q:

Jenkins fails to document because of an dependency to a not yet released package

Hi
I have multiple packages indexed. Some of them are even released but not all.
Now a have a indexed package which depends on a indexed but not yet released package and the Jenkins build complains. Is there a way to tell the Jenkins server to checkout the indexed dependency?

A:

If you want to document a repository bar which needs packages from repository foo which is also being documented but isn't released you can explicitly declare that dependency in the distribution file:
bar:
  doc:
    depends:
    - foo
    type: ...
    url: ...
    version: ...
foo:
  doc:
    type: ...
    url: ...
    version: ...

See the following real world example: https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/blob/3c429ecf241ce5c8f447436baf00cb4cac5295c8/kinetic/distribution.yaml#L6234-L6240
