Question about joinstate publisher and navigation?

hi ,
i have a real robot and i'm trying to work with the navigation stack , i don't have an urdf model and i'm wondering if the navigation and the localization depend on it ? , and i want to know if i  have to use the JointState publisher and robotstate Publisher although i don't have a 3D model , is it esential to the navigation stack ?

A:

Navigation only depends on having a TF frame for your robot and transforms for all the sensor data, but a full 3D model is not necessary.
