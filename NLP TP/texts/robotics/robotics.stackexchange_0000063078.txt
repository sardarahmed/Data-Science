Q:

ROS Arch linux wiki question

Hi
I have a question about the following peice of code in http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Arch
# ROS
indigo() {
  source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
  export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/path/to/your/your/package/path:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
  export PYTHONPATH=/opt/ros/indigo/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/ros/indigo/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
  alias python=/usr/bin/python2

  # Gazebo
  source /usr/share/gazebo/setup.sh
}

In this i did not understand the environment variable ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. Is is needed ? What is the role of it ?

A:

it is used to find packages to build from source.
I suggest you read about the filesystem concepts here
it's also documented here: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/EnvironmentVariables
