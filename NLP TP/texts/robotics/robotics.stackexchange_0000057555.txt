Q:

No tf data.Fixed Frame my_frame does not exist

Hi, I'm following  the rviz tutorial basic shapes.
I  change the cpp file and set both fixed and target frame to "my_frame" not "/my_frame" because when i typed it automatically change to "my_frame".
But when i star rivz, it still said Fixed Frame my_frame does not exist. is there something i missed? thank you.

A:

Hi,
I believe there is no tf frame being published with /my_frame name. That tutorial just talks about an arbitrary frame called /my_frame and if you have set of tf already being published then you could map your markers to one of the frame and get it working for your project. To know how to create a tf please check the http://wiki.ros.org/tf/Tutorials
Hope it helps!
