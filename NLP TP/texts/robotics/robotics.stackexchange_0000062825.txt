Q:

odom â†’ base_footprint

Stage_ros publishes this, now I want to try simulating using STDR but it doesn't use the same nomenclature. How can I calculate this transform and what does it represent exactly in a real world scenario.

Here is the parent-child relationship when I run stage_ros
map -> odom -> base_footprint -> base_link -> rest of robot joints
so I don't see how your link is going to help me with the odom -> base_footprint part

It tells you what base_footprint represents, which you can use to recreate it in STDR. Since it's a 2D simulator I'm guessing you can just add an identity transform from base_link to base_footprint.

I just want to know what odom -> base_footprint or generally speaking odom -> robot represents.
