Q:

Using RGBDSLAM in gazebo environment?

Hi. I'm thinking about using RGBDSLAM in gazebo environment.
If I set up an indoor environment and a robot with kinect in gazebo, how can I implement
SLAM for this simulated environment? For example, I'm wondering how to start up the node RGBDSLAM in gazebo.
Thanks!

A:

Wouldn't it work just as in reality? I have a simulator with kinect support and it works. Except that everything looks the same and therefore the feature matches are really bad :-).
