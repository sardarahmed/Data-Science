Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: ros2 turtlesim

Hi,
I wonder whether there will be soon a package for turtlesim on ROS2.
I downloaded bouncy, but there is no turtlesim package.
Also, is there any robot simulator in current ROS2 packages?
When it will be released?
Thanks
Anis

A:

Currently there is no plan to port turtlesim. Our engineering time is focused on implementing additional features and migrate packages which are requested most to be used for applications. If anybody would like to work on porting turtlesim please feel free to create a pull request for it. I am happy to review it.
For the next ROS 2 release Crystal scheduled for Dec. 2018 we are working on porting gazebo_ros_pkgs as well as some of the plugins. That will provide native integration with ROS 2. Until then you can use Gazebo with the ROS 1 integration together with the ros1_bridge.
