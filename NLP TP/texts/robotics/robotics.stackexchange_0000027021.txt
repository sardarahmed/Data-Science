Q:

How to Modify a Running Gazebo Simulation?

Hi all,
So I am using roslaunch command to simulate a simple Gazebo world file which contains some cubic obstacles. I have a question which I have not been able find any solution for:
Once the simulation is up and running, can I add any objects to Gazebo simulation without having to use the graphical user interface? I am using ROS Hydro and Gazebo-1.9.
I would appreciate any kind of help.
Cheers,
Ali

Could you please update the answer and include which version of gazebo are you using?
Comment by ali_mohandes on 2014-05-21:
Sure, it is ROS Hydro and Gazebo -1.9

A:

There are at least two ways of doing this:

From the command line: using the gzfactory tool (look at the spawn parameter). The user guide described it perfectly.
Programmatically: using a world plugin as described in the corresponding tutorial

Hope it helps.
