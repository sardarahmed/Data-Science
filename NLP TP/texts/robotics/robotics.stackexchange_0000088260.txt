A:

Missing parts within a file is never a problem with modern download tools (wget, web browsers, etc). They all use multiple levels of checksums and hashes to ensure that files are downloaded correctly.
The ROS bag format also includes internal checksums that and you would be unable to open the bag file at all if part of it was missing.
In your case, it actually looks like there we no messages published on those topics for a short period of time. rqt_bag draws a vertical blue line on each topic for each message that is published. For most bag files these lines blend together, but in some cases you can see gaps where the publisher did not send any messages (or where messages were dropped because the bag recorder was overloaded).
