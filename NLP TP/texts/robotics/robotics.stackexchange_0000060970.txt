Q:

What does the command 'catkin_init_workspace' do?

In reading different accounts of how to create a ROS workspace (in Hydro), I encountered a discrepancy. In the ROS tutorial sequence, a command 'catkin_init_workspace' is executed before going on to the 'build' process. In other accounts of the process, this step is not mentioned. I have not been able to find detailed documentation on this command. What exactly does it do?

A:

It will create the CMakeLists.txt file (actually it just create a symbolic link in the src folder of your workspace pointing to CMakeLists.txt -> /opt/ros/groovy/share/catkin/cmake/toplevel.cmake in the case you're using groovy).
You don't need that command now. When you create the the package, you can just run catkin_make and it do also the job of catkin_init_workspace, and that's why sometimes it's not mentioned as you said.
