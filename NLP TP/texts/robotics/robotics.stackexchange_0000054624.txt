I've tried to uninstall my ROS and the reinstall it.
Well after I reinstall I still face the same problem and there is another error coming out somehow ( I guess I have uninstall my ROS in right way ).
Error:

A:

Looks like you had an issue with python fixed by a reboot: http://answers.ros.org/question/86126/import-errorno-module-named-rospkg

What am I suppose to do? I can't even get through that 'source ~/fuerte_workspace/setup.bash' right now, I can't move on..

You posted at the link I sent that the problem importing rospkg was fixed when you rebooted.  "Bad marshal data fixed after I reboot my computer." Does that not fix your yaml import issue?
Comment by FuerteNewbie on 2013-10-06:
No it doesn't. I was thinking that can I append yaml into pythonpath? Something like sys.path ( I don't remember).

python-yaml should install into your system path already, next to rospkg suggesting that you have a problem with your python installation in general.

I had tried to reinstall python for several times, it doesn't seems to have any different. Any possible mistake somewhere else?
Comment by tfoote on 2013-10-06:
It's likely there's a problem with your envionment.  You could try to clear your .bashrc. (keep a backup.) Or another easy way might be to create a new user account and try from it.
Comment by FuerteNewbie on 2013-10-06:
What do you mean by creating a new user account? I thought that internally the setting will still be the same? If the problem happen in python then it will not make any difference.

That's what this test is to verify.  If you can import yaml from another user it is your environment.  If you cannot there's a problem with your greater python installation.
