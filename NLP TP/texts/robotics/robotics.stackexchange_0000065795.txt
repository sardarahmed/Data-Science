Q:

Changing Executable Path

When i built a cpp file in a ros project (after "catkin_make" command) the executable occurs in the path /devel/lib. But i want it to occur in /src . How can i change the built file's directory ?

Why do you want that? It is unlikely that rosrun and other tools will work with that.

A:

I would not recommend putting anything into src, but you can effect the output location of executables in CMake: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13556885/how-to-change-the-executable-output-directory-for-win32-builds-in-cmake
