Q:

Does Softkinetic have drivers for DS525?

I am trying to buy Creative senz 3D camera DS525, under the impression that DS325 is not on sale as far as  I have checked. Do you know if DS525 supports ROS.
Can I use the same softkinetic camera driver ?

A:

According to this, the DS525 is identical to the DS325, but doesn't come with a 'foot':

The DS525 (previously called the DS325) [..]

Same here:

The DS525, which is identical to the DS325 except it does not come with a "foot", [..]

Barring any differences in electronics / software (which I don't see mentioned anywhere), the software for the DS325 should work with the DS525.
