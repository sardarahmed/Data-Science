Q:

Problem with two ROS Versions on single system

Hi All,
I had ROS indigo on my system, then I decided to add the new version (Jade) as separate package. The installation was successful and now I have to folder  /opt/ros/indigo and /opt/ros/jade. However, when I try to switch to jade by sourcing the “setup.bash” file I receive the fallowing error:
ROS_DISTRO was set to 'jade' before. Please make sure that the environment does not mix paths from different distributions.

Moreover it seems that Gazebo is totally is replaced by the new version. That prevents me from running the turtlebot simulation. I receive the below error by running the “roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch”
[turtlebot_world.launch] is neither a launch file in package [turtlebot_gazebo] nor is [turtlebot_gazebo] a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

Thanks
Shervin

A:

That happens when environment is mixed. See a previous thread for possible solutions.
For Gazebo issue between Indigo and Jade, see http://answers.ros.org/question/208334/gazebo-version-collides-between-indigo-and-jade/
