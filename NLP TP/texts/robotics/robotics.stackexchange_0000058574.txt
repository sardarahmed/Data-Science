Q:

How to get started with an obstacle avoidance robot using sharp IR sensors?

I want to design an obstacle avoiding robot using IR sensors and arduibo, can anyone guide me how to get started with programming in ROS? I have already completed my work with rosserial-arduino. I want to know how to make decisions in ROS depending upon the data coming from sensors, and on basis of those decisions I want to control my motors.

A:

If you just use IR sensors and an Arduino, youÂ´ll probably be fine without using ROS for your system. If you want to exchange data with a ROS system you can directly follow the rosserial arduino tutorials, like the Hello World tutorial that shows how to publish from Arduino to the ROS network. If you have any specific questions regarding this, you should edit your question with more details on your problem.

Well I am doing this as a university project so I have to use ROS on my system, so if you can guide me through this? after completing this obstacle avoiding task, i want to implement SLAM through ROS.
basically I want to know how i can make decisions on ROS depending upon the data coming from sensors via arduino.???
