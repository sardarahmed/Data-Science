Q:

ROS MoveIt PR2 Demo Launch Fails

Hi
An interesting one this as I'm not sure whether anyone else will be effected by this but here goes.
From a fresh install of ROS hydro and MoveIt hydro and installation of the 'ros-hydro-moveit-full-pr2' package I have been trying to run the simple moveit demo.launch file
i.e 'roslaunch pr2_moveit_config demo.launch'
However it unfortunately fails to load / work giving the error.

Now I have never had this error before and it has also cropped up when trying to load up another moveit package for fanuc.
Certainly this is new to me, though I do seem to have an poor run in with action servers
 [ERROR] [1377888327.017819527]: Object recognition action: Unable to connect to action server within allotted time

It is possible to go the long way around through loading up rviz separately, along with a robot_description and then adding motion planning / robot_state within Rviz, however without running move_group I get no planning library loaded and running move_group.launch separately also fails.
What I find odd is that two weeks ago everything ran fine, on two separate computers, I go on holiday, take my slow netbook and install similar two the others the same ROS hydro / moveit etc and it runs fine. In fact I can load the damn thing up and run demo.launch with no problems right now, but coming back the other two computers seem to no longer like me, even after a purge and reinstall of ROS.
Has anything changed in the last two weeks with regards to MoveIt or move_group?
I'm kind of worried on whether I should touch my slow netbook at all in case it gets the same disease :)

Good question! In case you don't get any answers here, you should probably post to the moveit google group, perhaps also with a link to this question. Most of the moveit support seems to be happening over there.

I've managed to somehwat get around this problem but probably not in the correct way. I git cloned moveit_core and moveit_ros and catkin_maked them in my src, for some reason this partially failed and didn't complete moveit_ros_move_group, so I copied over the move_group node from opt/ros/... into the devel/lib/moveit_ros_move_group and it all seemed to work fine :S

A:

There was a recent change in Rviz (https://github.com/ros-visualization/rviz/issues/680), which forced some plugins to be updated - including MoveIt's MotionPlanning plugin.
The fix is there, but currently only available via sources (hydro-devel) version. I expect there will be another release soonish.

Well this is somewhat frustrating :).
I decided in some infinite glory to start over again as the Hydro deb has finally been released and reinstall everything. Of course this drove me straight back to the problem above again, however this time my somewhat work around no longer works :).
Anyway, first off some clarification, I have been under the assumption that all you really need to do is catkin_make everything once you have essentially git cloned it into source, however I swear half the time the libraries are not being created. I assume moveit_ros should compile the move_group node into the moveit_ros_move_group folder within catkin_ws/devel/lib as it did before, but now nothing.
Which brings me to my next question on how exactly do I go about applying the fix above?

Did you check for missing system dependencies using rosdep? You also can use for installing catkinized and released ROS packages. In your workspace do rosdep install --from-paths src -i -y
