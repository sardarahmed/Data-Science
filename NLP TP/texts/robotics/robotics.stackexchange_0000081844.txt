Q:

Install Denso package in ROS kinetic

Hello all,
I want to work with the Denso vs60 robot. After I started to model the robot I found out that somebody did already the work, so no need to do it again ;)
I found this this package of the robot but the install instructions are only available for hydro and indigo. Unfortunately, I am running on kinetic. On their github I figured out that there is a "kinetic-devel" branch.
My question is, how do I get this branch working (installed)?

A:

Assuming that you have a catkin workspace in your home folder that is called catkin_ws, you can do:
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/start-jsk/denso
git checkout kinetic-devel
cd ..
catkin_make

Solve compilation errors if any, and assuming you have this line source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash in your ~/.bashrc, you can use the package as you would with any other ROS package.
Good luck!
P.S. If you don't have your own catkin workspace please follow this tutorial, and then follow the steps I provided.

I would add a rosdep install --from-paths ~/catkin_ws/src --ignore-src right before the catkin_make.

Thanks for your answers and suggestions.
@gvdhoorn could you elaborate on your suggested command (for learning purposes). What will it do?
Nevertheless, since the denso package has so many dependencies I decided to set up a virtual machine with Ubuntu12.04 and install the package there.

If you install things from sources, you'll have to make sure that you install all dependencies first. That is what rosdep does.
