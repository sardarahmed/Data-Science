How do you load the model? If from the world file, you can add there the spawning position, you can also add an offset in the robots .sdf file

Is your model given in URDF or SDF format?
Comment by vncntmh on 2013-12-18:
the model is SDF format

A:

If your model is in SDF format, then you can add a <pose> element under the <model> tag which will apply an offset to the robot origin.
For example to raise the robot by 1 meter:
<model name="nao">
<pose>0 0 1 0 0 0</pose>
<link ...
</model>

If I want to spawn a multi link robot with an offset on the z direction, do I have to specify the offset for each link or there's a more general command for this that moves the robot all at once?
