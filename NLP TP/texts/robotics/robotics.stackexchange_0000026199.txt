Q:

Model caching process leaves files in /tmp

The Gazebo model caching process leaves the files

/tmp/gz_model.tar
/tmp/gz_model.tar.gz

in /tmp. This blocks subsequent users from downloading more models automatically from your library. The files are write protected so administrative priveleges are needed to get rid of them.
It would be nice if the model download process deleted these files.
Thanks,
Chris
