Q:

Prop Orientation on a Multirotor

While looking up information for the right propellers for my quadcopter, I realized that they had different orientations i.e. Clockwise and Counterclockwise. On further research I found that all multi-rotors have different combinations of these orientations. So my question is WHY? How does it matter if the propeller is turning clockwise or anti-clockwise?   

A:

This has to do with the torque, or moment, the rotors induce on the body of the quadcopter/multirotor. If all of the rotors were to spin the same direction they would all induce a torque in the same direction causing the craft to yaw. Of course this is undesirable for many reasons. By spinning half of the rotors the opposite direction the torques are theoretically canceled preventing the craft from yawing.
