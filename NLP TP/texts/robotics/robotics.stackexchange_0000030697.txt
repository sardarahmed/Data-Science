Q:

Does rospy not have walltime?

I was under the impression that anything in roscpp should also be available in rospy. WallTime is in roscpp but I can't find it in rospy.

A:

Please see:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/rospy/Overview/Time
for an overview of how you access time in rospy.  rospy doesn't provide an explicit 'WallTime' because Python comes with the time module; in C++, WallTime is basically a convenience wrapper around various POSIX and Win32 inconsistencies.
If you wish to convert it to a rospy.Time instance you can use:
t = rospy.Time.from_sec(time.time())

So there's no equivalent for setting up rospy.Timer() with a callback if there isn't a rospy.WallTimer()?
