Q:

ROS Raspberry Pi <-> PC Communication error

I'm asking this question because I'm trying to get LiDAR sensor values from a home-made robot using a Raspberry Pi and run SLAM on a PC, but I'm having trouble running it.
Raspberry Pi and PC are connected via LAN cable, and both ROS_HOST_NAME and ROS_MASTER_URI have been set.

Connected to Raspberry Pi with VNC Viewer.
When running LIDAR and odom node SLAM on Raspberry Pi, it operates normally as above.
However, mapping speed is very slow.

This is rqt_graph executed on Raspberry Pi.

This error occurs when remotely connecting to an Ubuntu PC.

This is rqt_graph run on Ubuntu.
