Q:

Transformation from world frame to odom(robots) frame

Hey i am new to ROS and Stage. I am simulating a robot to move from one point to other autonomously. The problem is i dont know how to transform from world frame (i.e as soon as you open ROS you get X-Y frame) and odom frame(i.e the frame of robot) So here stage world has one origin and robot(odom) has another origin there is a translation and rotation between them. How can i transform a point from stage world frame to robots odom frame?

Just a note on frame ID: both map and odom are typically world frames, and base_link refers to the body frame of the robot.

I highly recommend going through the TF tutorials.

odom-->base_footprint--->base_link---->base_laser_link
i dnt want any f these trnsfrmtns. I want a trnsfrmtn frm stage world points 2 odom(robots) frames. shud i creat new frame 4 stage world?

If you want actual stage poses for debugging, stage ros publishes base_pose_ground_truth. You can produce a small program that sends this. Alternatively if you configure odometry without noise it should be the same as ground truth.
