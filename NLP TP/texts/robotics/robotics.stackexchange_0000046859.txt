Q:

Is there a ros package that can provide GUI for other ros nodes?

There are a camera and multiple sensors mounted on my robot. And I will write ros nodes for all of them. But is there a ROS package that can provide GUI to show data got my camera and sensors together?
I use Ubuntu 10.04 and ROS electric. So I think package rqt doesn't work for me.
Thanks in advance!

A:

Direct solution to your problem could be that since ROS is distributed system, you could receive messages from your robot (as long as they're published as ROS format) on different computers that run fuerte or higher where rqt is available.

Regarding rqt as @joq suggests, I actually tried using it on electric recently and my answer is no it's impossible/not worth trying.
I used fuerte-devel branch (that is the oldest branch afaik, and also doesn't use catkin to build) of rqt which also requires qt_gui_core and python_qt_binding with same branch names on github. When I run rosmake qt_gui_core I got the following error which seems to depend on a pluginlib's function that might not exist in electric. So, if you dare to workaround even further, rqt may or may not work. I'm curious.
Used Ubuntu Lucid, electric
/home/rosuserian/ROS/qt_gui_core/qt_gui_cpp/src/qt_gui_cpp/recursive_plugin_provider.cpp:68:   instantiated from here
/home/rosuserian/ROS/qt_gui_core/qt_gui_cpp/include/qt_gui_cpp/ros_pluginlib_plugin_provider.h:237: error: ‘class pluginlib::ClassLoader<qt_gui_cpp::PluginProvider>’ has no member named ‘createInstance’

(Added on Jan 12) Another answer based on comments on @alfa_80's answer, is again, rqt. You can open RViz and dynamic_reconfigure's GUI called rqt_reconfigure at the same time on a single window. Using Groovy is ideal though.

Thanks for the useful information, Isaac.
Comment by joq on 2013-01-03:
BTW, I do not recommend mixing different ROS distros in the same ROS graph. In some cases that may work, but not in general.

Agreed. Unless mixing distros is the only solution..
