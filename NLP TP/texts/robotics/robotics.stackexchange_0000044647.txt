Q:

How to rosservice call with arrays

I'm using ROS electric.
I have an srv that contains 2 arrays of int32[]
rosmake functions correctly and the service is listed.
However when I try to call the service I cannot get it to accept the arrays.
Could someone please give me an example of the syntax for the rosservice call command?

Which programming language would you prefer? C++, Python, Lisp or the command line syntax?

A:

If you mean the command line syntax it would be something like
rosservice call /service_name [first_array_items_seperated_by_comma] [1.,2.,3.]

http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/YAMLCommandLine
might be also a good starting point to look at.
http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosservice provides all this information as well.
Cheers
