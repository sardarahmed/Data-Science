Q:

Producing an X any Y coordinate from a Lidar sensor

The project I am working on needs to track a ball on a 10' by 10' platform. I need to produce coordinates with the 2d lidar sensor I have. The sensor I have available to me is a Sick TIM561.
The platform is using ubuntu to run Linux with ROS
This is the first time I have worked with ROS and Python so any help with this would be greatly appreciated. I do have some experience working with arduino programming.

If you've never used ROS before then I'd recommend working through the tutorials first before jumping straight into a project like this. We're here you help but you need to try and find a solution and come to us with more specific questions.

A:

Once you have received a LaserScan message you can access it's individual measurement. Because you know the resolution of your sensor you can calculate the angle for each measurement. With that angle and the distance that the measurement represents you can filter out anything that is part of the platform. You will then have a set of distances that correspond to the ball.
A detailed description of how to transform lidar measurements to coordinates can be found here (in your case the z coordinate would be 0)
