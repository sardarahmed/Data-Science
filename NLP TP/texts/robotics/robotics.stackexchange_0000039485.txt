Hey....
I have been trying to run RGBDSLAM with kinect on my PC. I have downloaded openNI drivers as suggested. And Kinect is giving data if i run only openNI launch files.
But when i try to run rgbdslam+kinect.launch, it shows the gui but its not getting data from kinect.
Its showing 'Waiting for monochrome image'.....

A:

My guess is, that you use openni_launch instead of openni_camera and need to adapt the topics in the launch file:
<param name="config/topic_image_mono"              value="/camera/rgb/image_color"/>
<param name="config/topic_image_depth"             value="/camera/depth_registered/image"/>
<param name="config/topic_points"                  value="/camera/depth_registered/points"/> 

Also you need to enable registration of depth and color, e.g. via dynamic_reconfigure. See this answer for how to enable registration by default.
