A:

Other threads have brought to my attention that I accidentally pulled both the Makefile and rosdep.yaml from the irobot_create_2_1 repo when doing some other maintenance work.I believe this is your problem (and why the older package release solved it for winterhater). This has been corrected both in the repo and in our newer package releases (though these of course take time to catch up). In the meantime, you can pull a fresh copy from the repo:
svn co https://brown-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/experimental/irobot_create_2_1 irobot_create_2_1

or you can download the individually missing files: Makefile and rosdep.yaml .
My sincere apologies. This was really bone-headed and I will spend the requisite time on the wheel.
