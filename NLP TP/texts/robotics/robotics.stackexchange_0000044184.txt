Q:

Use PS3 Controller via USB

I was wondering if there were any libraries for ROS for using a PS3 controller through the USB connection instead of the Bluetooth connection? Or if it is even possible?
I looked at ps3joy, but it seems to only work via the bluetooth pairing.
Any suggestions?

A:

Try the regular joy driver. It will probably work.

Confirmed; the PS3 controller shows up as a standard joystick when attached via USB, so the joy driver works wonderfully.

On 12.04 LTS3, I had to do a few non-obvious steps to get the DualShock 3 controller to work in USB: A) run 'sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-input-joystick'; B) after connecting the gamepad via USB, before or after running joy_node, I had to hold the PS button for 2 seconds to activate it.
