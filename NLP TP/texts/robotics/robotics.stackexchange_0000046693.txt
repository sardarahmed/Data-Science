Q:

using dynamic_reconfigure forces a rebuild of the package

I'm using ubuntu 12.04 with fuerte.
I noticed, that if my packages use dynamic_reconfigure the config header is generated every time I call make. So the whole package is rebuild, even no file was changed.
Did anyone else observed this problem? Is there a solution?
Tanks

I think that's a pretty old issue that noone fixed so far. I'm not sure if there's a ticket already though and I don't know who's maintaining dynamic_reconfigure at the moment. To fix it, you probably just need to fix the dynamic_reconfigure cmake target.

A:

This was a bug in the recent dynamic_reconfigure version and should be fixed with 1.5.29. Basically the command failed to generate the docs in the correct location and therefore always regenerated the headers/Python files.

how can I update dynamic_reconfigure to 1.5.29? I'm using the ros ubuntu repository.
Comment by Dirk Thomas on 2012-12-21:
That version is currently only available for Groovy but the fix might be backported to Fuerte soon.

1.5.29 is in groovy but I am working on back-porting the fix. Should be available in a day or so.
