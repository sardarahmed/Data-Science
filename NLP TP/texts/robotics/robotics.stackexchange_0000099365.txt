Q:

I use the micro-ros rpi pico, how I can generate the time information for odom_msg.header.stamp. I try to use method in micro-ros ping-pong example but the clock_gettime function is not available in rpi-pico lib.

Hi Pablogs thanks for the answer it now working, This my implementation code for others ref.
struct timespec ts;

extern int clock_gettime(clockid_t unused, struct timespec *tp);

clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, &ts);

odom_msg.header.stamp.sec = ts.tv_sec;

odom_msg.header.stamp.nanosec = ts.tv_nsec;
