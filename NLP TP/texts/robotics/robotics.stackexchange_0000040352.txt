Q:

kinect_aux indexing kinect based on serial no

Hi,
I'm currently using Kinect_aux for multiple kinects. I adjust the device_index param each time I want to switch to another kinect. The point is when I replace the USB connectors or restart the OS the index arrangement changes randomly. So I need to choose a kinect based on its serial no. or any other device specific id.

A:

boost::shared_ptr<FreenectDevice> device_;

then
std::string serial_number = device_->getSerialNumber();

take a look at how freenect_stack has implemented this:
