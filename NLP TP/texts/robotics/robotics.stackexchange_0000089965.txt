Q:

ros2 crystal create python pkg

Hello community,
I'm trying to port some of my python nodes to ros2 crystal and I've noticed, that
ros2 pkg create did not support --build-type ament_python.
Is this still an open feature for crystal ?
What is the official workaround for python packages for ros2 crystal ?
Thanks for some feedback
Cheers Chrimo

A:

There is an issue to implement support for the ament_python build type for that verb: https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/issues/125 It just needs someone to take the time to implement it.
Until then you can take a look at existing Python packages and use them as a template to create your own package by hand. The packages in the reference repository are all Python packages.
