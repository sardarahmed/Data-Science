Q:

Viso2 camera frames for ground robot

Hi,
I am completely confused with the static transformations required to make Viso2 work with my setup, any help will be greatly appreciated.
In the wiki says: "The coordinate frame of the camera is expected to be the optical frame, which means x is pointing right, y downwards and z from the camera into the scene.".
I have a ground robot (robotino), the base_link X axis points forward, the base_link Y axis left and the base_link Z axis points upwards and I have a stereo camera installed on the robot looking exactly to the front.
I configured a static transformation between my camera (stereo_cam) and the base_link of my robot (base_link) using only a rotation so the Z axis of the camera frame points forward, the X axis right and the Y axis downwards. I also enabled in the Viso2 parameters the publishing of the /odom to base_link transformation.
However, with this configuration the base_link doesn't move in the x-y plane of the odom frame as I expected but instead is floating around.
Now, watching the youtube video in viso2_ros wiki I noticed that the X axis (the red one) on the /stereo_dow frame is pointing down... shouldn't it be oriented with the Z axis (the blue one) looking down instead?.
Thanks in advance.

Hi Raultron,
in the video we have a stereo camera looking downwards. You should set a TF between base_link (parent) and your camera optical frame (child). Your axis ordering is correct, but maybe the parent and the child you wrote are swapped.
