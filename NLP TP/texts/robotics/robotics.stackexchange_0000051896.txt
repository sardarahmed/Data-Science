Q:

Openni_launch publishes only raw image, I need compressed

I have two ubuntu 12.04 pcs with ros fuerte. I installed openni v1.5.4.0 libraries on both machines. Kinect is recognized by them and I'm able to display captured data on rviz.
Even though the whole process of installation was the same on both machines, after typing roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch one pc is publishing incomplete topic list. Looking at the simple color image topics:
this is a full list published by the first computer:
/camera/rgb/image_color
/camera/rgb/image_color/compressed
/camera/rgb/image_color/compressed/parameter_descriptions
/camera/rgb/image_color/compressed/parameter_updates
/camera/rgb/image_color/compressedDepth
/camera/rgb/image_color/compressedDepth/parameter_descriptions
/camera/rgb/image_color/compressedDepth/parameter_updates
/camera/rgb/image_color/theora
/camera/rgb/image_color/theora/parameter_descriptions
/camera/rgb/image_color/theora/parameter_updates

second one is publishing only this:
/camera/rgb/image_color

The same problem appears for /depth, /ir, and different types of /rgb.
Why the topic list on the second pc is so short? How can I make second computer to publish what I need (compressed images and data)?
