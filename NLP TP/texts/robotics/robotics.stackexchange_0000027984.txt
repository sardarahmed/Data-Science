Q:

Installing Gazebo development files for 2.2.3 version

Hello!
Novice here.
I am trying to develop a plugin for a gazebo model. It requires development files for gazebo to be installed. I am unable to install development files from this command
sudo apt-get install libgazebo2-dev
It says "Unable to locate package libgazebo2-dev"
I request help regarding this.
Gazebo version: 2.2.3,
ROS Indigo 1.11.20,
Ubuntu trusty 14.04.5

A:

Gazebo 2 is deprecated, and we recommend that you use gazebo7 which is compatible with ros indigo.

The reason you see "Unable to locate package libgazebo2-dev" is because we did not release gazebo2 into ubuntu trusty.
