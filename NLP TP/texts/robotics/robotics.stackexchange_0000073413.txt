Q:

kinect not connecting even though powered on and green light

I'm trying to use a kinect xbox360 with hydro on ubuntu 12.04.  I have installed openni and openni-tracker.
The kinect is plugged in and powered on (blinking green light). When running lsusb, I do not see the expected three Microsoft devices
Bus 002 Device 009: ID 045e:02ae Microsoft Corp.    Bus 002 Device 008: ID 045e:02ad Microsoft Corp.    Bus 002 Device 007: ID 045e:02b0 Microsoft Corp.
When running lsusb -t, I do see a device, with device ID that changes when plugging in/ unplugging the kinect (I also see a different device ID when plugging in a USB drive to test...).
I thought it might be a permissions issue, so I've added my user name to the "dialout" group sudo adduser username dialout and logged out... without a change in behaviour.
Any ideas would be appreciated. Thanks.
Ninja EDIT:
This Kinect was working fine yesterday... I currently have Hydro installed on a removable hotswappable drive and am trying to use this on a different "tower" although the hard-drive is the same...
EDIT;
Issue resolved.  It turns out that the USB ports on the front and back of my PC tower were not supplying enough power... even with the Kinect's power supply.  Using a powered USB hub between the Kinect and the USB ports did the trick.

@joe.s: I'd recommend posting your edit as a an answer and then accepting your own answer. That makes the fact that this issue is resolved much more clear when only looking at the question list.
