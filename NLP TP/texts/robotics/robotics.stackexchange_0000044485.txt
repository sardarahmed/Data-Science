Q:

How can I get data in a callback function

I have subscriber receive data from a topic. The message type is std_msgs::Bool. How can I access the data.
I tried ".data" which didn't give me the content.

Do you want to recieve data in a callback function? Then try bool var = msg->Data;

A:

Why don't you look at the tutorials for subscribers and publishers? Also take a look at the bool message to figure it out.
