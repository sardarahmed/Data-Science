Q:

can we move the camera during camera calibration

Hi,
I am calibrating the camera using the camera_calibration package.
I am wondering if the camera can be moved during camera calibration.
Is it equivalent to moving the checker board in various directions?
Thanks,

It should make no difference, theoretically. Everything is relative - to one sitting in a car you are moving and he/she is still, to you - the car is moving and you are still. It make no difference on practice either though.

A:

It's equivalent. camera_calibration only processes the image, so it will see no difference.
