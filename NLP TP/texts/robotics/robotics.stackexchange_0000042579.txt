Q:

Guardian not working in Gazebo

I am trying to study the guardian-ros-pkg to learn more about ros, controlling a skid steer 4 wheel robot, and SLAM. I have installed the package from source and now I'm trying to run a simulation in gazebo following the instructions found here.
First, I cannot teleop the robot properly using the teleop_keyboard node. Q and E work, causing the robot to rotate in place around the Z axis (yaw), but WASD do not cause the robot to translate. Pressing or holding Shift makes no difference.
Second, when I try to run the SLAM algorithm for navigation, the robot just rotates in place endlessly and never explores the space. It should look like this.
When I launch with guardian_robotnik.launch, all of the models load just fine, but I get an error: [FATAL] [1343077767.457597153, 0.712000000]: GuardianController
I also get this warning: [ WARN] [1343077768.818456569, 0.726000000]: multiple inconsistent  exists due to fixed joint reduction, overwriting previous value [false] with [true].
Third, when I try to launch rviz to view the map generated by SLAM, I get several erros and a seg fault, but I have never had a problem opening rviz before.

Have I just missed a step, or is something wrong here?

A:

Maybe you should ask to the company Robotnik directly
