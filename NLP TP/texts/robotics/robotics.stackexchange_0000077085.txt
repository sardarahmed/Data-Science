A:

Just taking a guess, but it's likely that this is related to your other question: It is likely there are too many vertices in collision geometry.
Can you try and see whether reducing the quality of your meshes influences this?

I have used Meshmixer to reduce the meshes.
but I can use the moveit assistant to load my urdf now.
and,I can use rviz display the urdf.It look like OK.
what's error in here.
