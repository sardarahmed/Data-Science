Q:

ros Map_server could not open map

Hi,
Could use some help on this one.
This one works on my robot (I copy the map files manually to the /tmp directory before roslaunching it):
 <launch>
    
      <!--- Run the kinect -->
      <include file="$(find turtlebot_bringup)/kinect.launch" />
    
      <!-- Run the map server -->
      <node name="map_server" pkg="map_server" type="map_server" args="/tmp/my_map_waalre.yaml" />
    
      <!--- Run AMCL -->
      <include file="$(find turtlebot_navigation)/config/amcl_turtlebot.launch" />
    
      <!--- Run Move Base -->
      <include file="$(find turtlebot_navigation)/config/move_base_turtlebot.launch" />
    
    </launch>

But this one not and comes with error
<launch>

  <!--- Run the kinect -->
  <include file="$(find turtlebot_bringup)/kinect.launch" />

  <!-- Run the map server -->
  <node name="map_server" pkg="map_server" type="map_server" args="/home/turtelbot/fuerte_workspace/sandbox/robo/my_map_waalre.yaml" />

  <!--- Run AMCL -->
  <include file="$(find turtlebot_navigation)/config/amcl_turtlebot.launch" />

  <!--- Run Move Base -->
  <include file="$(find turtlebot_navigation)/config/move_base_turtlebot.launch" />

</launch>

So same file but just in a different directory. I must be overseeing something simple.
error it produces:
process[map_server-8]: started with pid [20619]
[ERROR] [1389437922.013953806]: Map_server could not open /home/turtelbot/fuerte_workspace/sandbox/robo/my_map_waalre.yaml.

log file: /home/turtelbot/.ros/log/531236a0-7aaf-11e3-8077-94dbc9f717d5/map_server-8*.log
Any clues?
Thanks

A:

by writing down the question it triggers the mind. Opened the .yaml file and there was a reference of the .pgm file in the /tmp directory. Updated it and now it works.

i faced the same problem, but i didn't fund in the yaml file any reference to the .pgm file!

yes, it has a reference to the .pgm file in the yaml file. Open the yaml file, and you could find these word in the first line::image: /home/...../name.pgm

How exactly did you update it?
Comment by Charel on 2015-08-20:
indeed, open .yaml file with text editor like gedit, in the first line you will find the path name.
