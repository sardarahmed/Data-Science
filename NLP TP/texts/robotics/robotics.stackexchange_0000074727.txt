Q:

Does Rviz have collision detection like gazebo?

I am wondering if rviz has a collision detection system similar to gazebo implemented. I see that there is an option to enable collision, but I have not found and information online about what it does exactly.
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
ROS: Indigo

A:

rviz only renders data, so it does not have collision detection. The option you're seeing is to visualize the collision geometry, which can be different from the visual geometry. A common example is to have a high polygon and detailed mesh for visualization of your robot, but for collision detection you might just use a box or a sphere so it is faster. rviz can render these shapes, but does not do any collision detection with them.
