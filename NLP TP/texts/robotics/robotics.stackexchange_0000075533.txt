Q:

ros node not working when using launch file

Similar issue has been addressed in these two questions before hello node and output roslaunch. But I cannot get my node to work through the launch file. If I run the node like this:
./image_listener_test_node 

it works everything is printed correctly. However through the launch file:
<launch>
    <node name="image_listener_test" type="image_listener_test_node" pkg="image_listener_test"  output="screen"/>

</launch> 

Nothing is printed and no error message. Is there something else I am missing?

A:

I figured it out. It was sourcing that was the issue. This means an old project file of the node existed a different place. So when running rosrun or roslaunch they found the old version. and when I executed I had the correct version. Deleting all Devel and build folders in my folder solved it.
