Q:

What software do you use to design your PCB in the robotics field?

What is the best software (despite the price) for designing the circuits and PCB boards for robots?
I mean having lots of components, different designing methods, best accuracy, ...
I myself use the Altium Designer which I think answers my needs, but maybe there are better ones in the market i don't know about!

A:

We evaluated a variety of options and settled on Altium Designer at our shop.  We build nothing but robots with a team of 9 engineers.  I am not sure there is a ton of stuff that is robotic specific in a PCB design, but Altium allows us to interface directly with our Pick and Place machine, easily generate 3D models, and the integration of the library with Subversion makes teamwork easy.
