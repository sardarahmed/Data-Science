Q:

Animation in Gazebo

Hi all,
I am making an animation of smoke using Blender 2.5s' particle system.

Is it possible to import that animation in Gazebo?
How will the laser behave to that smoke whether it is going to consider it particles or surrounding box?
If it is not possible what could be the best way to simulate smoke in Gazebo?

Thanks.
(p.s I am using ubuntu 10.04 and ROS electric)
