Q:

Unable to download laser.bag

Dear folks,
I am following this tutorial to use laser scanner. "Introduction to Working With Laser Scanner Data"
I will receive my Laser scanner in a few months so I need some raw data to test and develop my program beforehand. When I attempt to download the raw data from the tutorial by this link, I receive a message that I don't have permission to access the data. Anyone has the same problem? or do you know where else I can find raw laser scanner data to test?
Thank you

I also get

You don't have permission to access
/wgdata1/vol1/wiki_docs/laser_pipeline/laser.bag
on this server.

http://vault.willowgarage.com/wgdata1/vol1/wiki_docs/laser_pipeline/laser.bag is an old willowgarage.com link, the website still exists but they cleaned out the wiki in the move to ros.org, but that file slipped through the cracks?
I made a note on the wiki page about it.  It looks like no one else had edited the page in five years.  If no one else responds to this message with one you could make a new post asking for an example LaserScan bag file.  I think I have a hokuyo somewhere, if I can find it I could generate a bag and upload it.

Update
http://classes.engineering.wustl.edu/cse550/a02.php has a couple of bags with LaserScans in them:  http://classes.engineering.wustl.edu/cse550/data/Mapping1.bag
