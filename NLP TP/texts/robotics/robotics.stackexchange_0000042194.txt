camera_node fails to launch with the following errors at terminal :
core service [/rosout] found

tired to run it from root, but it didn't help out.
I am trying to stream images from one PC to another PC..over my LAN. It works sometimes without flaw .. other times it doesn't initialize. Would appreciate some guidance on this. Thanks !

A:

try running ls -l /dev/video0 which should produce this:
crw-rw---- 1 root video 81, 0 Jul 20 19:26 /dev/video0 

if the first part of the message looks this:
crw-rw----

like the above then you don't have the correct permissions so type this:
sudo chmod a+rw /dev/video0

the final message should look like this:
crw-rw-rw- 1 root video 81, 0 Jul 20 19:26 /dev/video0

hi, I encountered the same problem, i followed your instruction, it worked, but the camera driver died soon, and i looked up the permissions, it turned out likes this "crw-rw----" again, It bothers me for a long time, do you know why?
