Q:

Installing turtlebot on ROS kinetic

I am using a master computer to control my turtlebot. My master computer has ubuntu 16.04 xenial, so I was wondering whether turtlebot will work with it and if it does, how to install turtlebot for xenial. In most of the tutorials it says turtlebot is supported for only ROS indigo, so what do I do?

The TurtleBot packages have been released for Kinetic.

the tutorials all point to ros indigo..do I just blindly follow them for ROS kinetic too? Wont there be any changes for installing turtlebot for ROS kinetic? Can you please paste the link to the instructions?
Thanking you

Generally everything that worked in indigo is expected to work in kinetic. Just replace the keywords and use Xenial instead of Trusty.

Do I need to replace keyword indigo with keywords like kinetic anywhere?

Hello~ all
I also have the same problems to install Turtlebot packages on ROS-kinetic.
I followed instruction to install turtlebot deb by replacing indigo to kinetic.
but still some errors there...
Any obvious solution for this ? thank you!

Replacing indigo with kinetic in the current tutorial install line fails due to ros-kinetic-rocon-remocon and ros-kinetic-rocon-qt-library not being found. Removing them works though might impact some functionality.

How did you get on with this? I have the same issue and I am worried I will run into problems down the line.

@srf I don't know! I might have abandoned as I don't recall doing much with the turtlebot. That said, the other day followed along with a tutorial and launched a turtlebot in a gazebo and it worked, so maybe it updated itself away?
