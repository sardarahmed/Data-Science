Q:

playback sequence of bag files in order

I recently created a sequence of large bag files from a single experiment using the chunksize option of rosbag record. Is there a method to play the resulting bag files back to back?

A:

Just adding all bag files in play command should work
rosbag play recorded1.bag recorded2.bag 

command plays both bag files one after other, if they are recorded in different time i.e your case.
doc: rosbag play

Great, I had thought that would play both bags simultaneously but they are in fact consecutive. Thanks so much
