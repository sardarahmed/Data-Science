Q:

Why ar_track_alvar is not installing?

When i try to install the ar_track_alvar using sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-ar-track-alvar
I was getting the following error.  
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-indigo-ar-track-alvar
I also tried using synaptic tool which is alternative to apt-get install. But i was not able to find indigo related alvar packages

Can anyone please help me on this?

ar_track_alvar is listed as released for Indigo, so that should work if you're using Indigo that was installed through apt on Ubuntu x86. Perhaps you're using a different OS or a different CPU?

The build status page and the arm build status page show that ar_track_alvar is built and stable for Ubuntu Trusty x86, amd64 and armhf architectures,

Did you install ROS through apt or from source? Are your apt sources set up correctly?
Comment by ahendrix on 2016-08-09:
Your system reports that it's running Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty), but the ROS packages listed are for Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise). Did you have a previous version of ROS installed? Did you upgrade from a previous version of Ubuntu?

ROS was installed through apt-get    rosversion -d   indigo
