Q:

Error with RViz

Hello, I have indigo ros and I downloaded moveit to work with the graphical interface rviz, but when I want to save some state of the robot, a message says: "Not connected to a database. The state will be created but not stored".
How can i solve this problem?
Thanks.

Same problem for me

A:

I figured out how to fix this problem for me:

Follow install steps for the ros warehouse http://moveit.ros.org/install/source/dependencies/.
(You might not need this depending on your version of moveit) Make the changes in this pull request locally to fix moveit https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/pull/81/files.
Launch the ros warehouse! roslaunch <YOUR_GENERATED_moveit_config>/launch/default_warehouse_db.launch I got this file from the moveit setup wizard.
