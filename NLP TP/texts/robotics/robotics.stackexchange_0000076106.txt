Q:

[rosrun] Count' find executable named ...?

Hey all,
I am trying to move my catkin workspace from my old computer to my new one. I copied the folder from my old computer, pasted into the new one with ROS installed. catkin)make gave no errors. However, when i try to run my program,  i get this error:
$ rosrun sim_pkg sim_init
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named sim_init below /home/icepaka89/algsim_ws/src/sim_pkg
Clearly there is a problem with ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. But I can't seem to figure it out? Does anyone know an easy way to fix this? I made sure i ran source devel/setup.bash before running my program. Thanks!

A:

You need to go to the directory where your executable is, and check if it is there. Usually, the executable generated is in the [WORKSPACE_DIR]/devel/lib/[PKG_NAME]/.
If the executable is not generated, then something wrong with catkin_make or your source code.
If the executable is generated, then something wrong with you environment variables.
