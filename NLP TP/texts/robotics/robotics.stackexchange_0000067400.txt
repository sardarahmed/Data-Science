Q:

ROS/Hydro installation error:qt_dotgraph: No definition of [python-pygraphviz] for OS

Hi,
I tried to install ROS/Hydro in OS X10.9 with homebrew following with ï¼šhttp://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Installation/OSX/Homebrew/Source
When I run $ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro hydro -y, I got
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:

qt_dotgraph: No definition of [python-pygraphviz] for OS [osx]
qt-4.8.6 and graphviz-2.38.0 are already installed.

I am experiencing the same error.  I am installing on OS X Yosemite following the directions at "http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/OSX/Homebrew/Source"

I still can not solve this problem. How about you?

A:

Finally, I fixed it by
$ rosdep install -s --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro hydro -y --skip-keys "python-pygraphviz"
referenced from here 
I don't know whether there will be further problems by doing this. But it works now.
