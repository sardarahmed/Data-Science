Q:

How to add cv_bridge and image_transport package to compile in Raspberry Pi?

Hi,
I have installed ROS indigo in Raspberry Pi by following this link. I also installed opencv using this. I can view the continuous image using ROS. Now I want to convert CV  image from Raspberry Pi to ROS image and send it thru the node and read it from ubuntu PC. I'm following this tutorial. I am having the following error after catkin_make. I think I missing dependencies or package. Please help.

-- +++ processing catkin package: 'learning_image_transport'
-- ==> add_subdirectory(learning_image_transport)
CMake Error at
/home/pi/catkin_ws/devel/share/cv_bridge/cmake/cv_bridgeConfig.cmake:106

Ask the maintainer 'Vincent Rabaud

Did you install cv_bridge in your workspace? I believe it depends on openCV, so you will need that, too.

Alternatively, you could have an issue with your local copy of cv_bridge... did you somehow delete the include/ directory inside of /home/pi/catkin_ws/src/vision_opencv/cv_bridge/

hi joq , could you please tell me how install cv_bridge itself?

Add the https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_opencv.git repository to your workspace.

Thank you @joq and @jarvisschultz
I am able to run the tutorial now. I am not sure which steps solved the problem.
Basically I followed the link mentioned in the posted problem in Resolving Dependencies with rosdep
pi@raspberrypi ~/catkin_ws $ rosinstall_generator common_msgs sensor_msgs image_transport --rosdistro indigo --deps --wet-only --exclude roslisp --tar > indigo-custom_ros.rosinstall
pi@raspberrypi ~/catkin_ws $ wstool merge -t src indigo-custom_ros.rosinstall
pi@raspberrypi ~/catkin_ws $ wstool up -t src
pi@raspberrypi ~/catkin_ws $ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro indigo -y -r --os=debian:wheezy

There was long compilation and I encountered the following problem at the end. Just for the record.
CMake Error at /opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:75 (find_package):
Could not find a package configuration file provided by
"dynamic_reconfigure" with any of the following names:

dynamic_reconfigureConfig.cmake
dynamic_reconfigure-config.cmake

I decided to do final try with new catkin work-space. Luckily, I can run the tutorial on new work-space and I can see published and subscribed topics. Next step, I will try to see physical image with rqt.

Hey luck on solving this error? I am trying to compile gmapping on Raspberry Pi and after installing a few dependencies I'm now stuck at this error.
