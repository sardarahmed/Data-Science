Q:

Is ROS able to cancel the limit of karma to upload pictures?

If the new user of ROS have some pictures to describe question clearly,it is very sad to see that he doesn't have enough karma to upload pictures.
So I ask if there is possible to make new user also can upload pictures to describe his/her questions.
Thank you~

A:

The karma requirement to upload is an anti-spam/abuse measure.  The current requirement is 20 points to upload, which is only two upvotes, or several comments.

There a number of online services that you could upload a picture to and then post a link to that hosted image. For example, http://imgur.com/ , http://imageshack.us/ or even a public gallery on something like Picasa or Dropbox.

For example: this link: http://answers.ros.org/question/2144/rviz-sensor-data-does-not-rotate  ,  which doesn't have permit to upload picture,so he uses a lot of words to describe it. I also have similar question,but failed to compare with this question.

Karma couldn't prevent spam message,why just prevent picture uploading? Is picture upload will cause big problem for ROS server? Thank you~
