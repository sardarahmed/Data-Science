Q:

quick question about TF

On the differential drive package it says
    tf -

    Broadcasts the transform between the odometry frame and the robot's base_link.

My question is what is the odometry frame? is the the transformation between base_link and the world?

A:

Odometry is the frame of robot's odometry reading. This transform is generally generated by robot itself. Base link of robot is defined w.r.t to odometry. Then odometry is defined w.r.t to map/world, whatever is the fixed frame. Transform between odometry and map/world is to be defined explicitly unless some mapping packages like gmapping is used.
Hope this helps..
