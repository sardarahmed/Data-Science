Q:

ros_industrial_cmake_boilerplate/code_coverage.cmake:168 (message): lcov not found!

I'm trying to install TrajOpt to intergrate with the ROS2. I have download the tesseract_ros2 and all its dependencies from https://github.com/tesseract-robotics/tesseract_ros2 ,also the trajOpt_ros2 from https://github.com/Levi-Armstrong/trajopt_ros-2. But during building ,some error ocurr. See my terminal output below:
Starting >>> tesseract_command_language
--- stderr: tesseract_command_language
