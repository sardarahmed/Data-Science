Q:

Problems extruding svg files in Gazebo

Good day, Gazebo people.
I'm a Gazebo beginner. I started using Gazebo less than two weeks ago and I've been reading Gazebo's tutorials, but I don't understand this problem:
When I try to import a svg file that I created with Inkscape, a message appears:
Invalid file
No paths found on file "/home/user/Desktop/my_chassis.svg"
Please select another file.
I don't know why this message appears, because the 2D chassis I created and the 2D tutorial chassis are very similar. I don't know if I'm doing something wrong. Here is the simple 2D chassis I've created:

Another problem I have is that I successfully import my 2D wheel, but the program goes crazy. Here is my 2D wheel

and here is the Gazebo's extrude link window

As you can see, it has no similitude with original picture. I clicked the Ok button, but this message about render engine OGRE appears:
Qt has caught an exception thrown from an event handler. Throwing
exceptions from an event handler is not supported in Qt. You must
reimplement QApplication::notify() and catch all exceptions there.
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'Ogre::InvalidParametersException'
what():  OGRE EXCEPTION(2:InvalidParametersException): Object index out of bounds. in SceneNode::getAttachedObject at /build/buildd/ogre-1.8-1.8.1+dfsg/OgreMain/src/OgreSceneNode.cpp (line 160)
I hope you can help me with these problems. Thank you.

Good day.
Thank you, nkoening and hugomatic, for answering my questions. I finally get my chassis import, but I've got more problems:

Gazebo doesn't recognize my chassis correctly. It shows this window:

When I try to extrude the tutorial chassis, it generates an OGRE and a Qt exception and closes Gazebo automatically:

Qt has caught an exception thrown from an event handler. Throwing
exceptions from an event handler is not supported in Qt. You must
reimplement QApplication::notify() and catch all exceptions there.
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'Ogre::InvalidParametersException'
what():  OGRE EXCEPTION(2:InvalidParametersException): Object index out of bounds. in SceneNode::getAttachedObject at /build/buildd/ogre-1.8-1.8.1+dfsg/OgreMain/src/OgreSceneNode.cpp (line 160)
Thank you in advance.

A:

Your chassis is most likely not an SVG path. In inkscape:

Select the shape
Go to the "Path" menu
Select "Object to Path"
Save and load into gazebo.

Your second question will be easier to debug if you can post the original SVG file.
