Q:

Machine Learning and ROS

Hello
Im collecting lots of data from my robot runs and I wonder if possible some implementation of some Machine Learning techniques in ROS. Or if I can use some machine learning techniques like Support Vector Machine Classifier or some other in correlation with ROS? I would like to do like shared control of the Joystick of my platform so I thought Machine Learning is a good approach.
Thanks

A:

You can use OpenCV or Matlab with ROS. OpenCV is not so powerful in comparison wit Matlab, but you can find SVM in OpenCV.
