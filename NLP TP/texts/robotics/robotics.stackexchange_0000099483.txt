Q:

ROS Driver on Fanuc R-J3iB?

Hello,
I would like to test the ROS driver on the Fanuc M6iB robot with an older R-j3iB controller. Some relevant information about the controller:

Core software version:  Handling Tool 6.4
Socket Messaging (SKMG), includes MSG_CONNECT, MSG_DISCO and MSG_PING: Installed
PC Interface (PCIF): Installed
KAREL (KARL): Installed (not sure about the version, but I can check)
ASCII Upload (ASBN): Installed.

Is it possible to tweak the ROS driver and recompile it for R-j3iB? Maybe somebody has tried this already and can help.
Regards,
Alex

A:

A similar question from (quite) a few years ago would be #q173769. The OP there had a V5.20 system, which turned out to be difficult to simulate, but could have worked after I made some changes. Unfortunately the OP never responded, so it didn't get tested.
I should still have that version somewhere, you could see whether it'll work.
If you could open an issue on ros-industrial/fanuc we can discuss this over there, that'd be easier to track and relate to software changes.
I'll update this answer if/when we get things to work (and also in case we don't).

Socket Messaging (SKMG)

Note: the requirement is actually for User Socket Messaging. There is a similar option (which may be called SKMG on older controllers), but that's not usable for Karel programs. Seeing as you mention MSG_CONNECT(..) et al., you probably have the required option installed, but I wanted to mention it.

Edit: post on the issue tracker: ros-industrial/fanuc#325.
