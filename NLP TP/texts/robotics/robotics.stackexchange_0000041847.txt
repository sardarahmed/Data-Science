Q:

install intrernal and external packages

Hello
I would like to ask about some tutorials and helps installing some internal and external packages. I Installed them through some installation script. First I installed ROS Fuerte set the workspace. Than tried to install the two internal packages :  amcl_listener and pow_analyzer . I the error on the pow_analyzer package.
The error was
make: * No targets specified and no makefile found. Stop.
With the amcl_listener make file was build and its not empty. But its not the case with the other internal package. So I think its about the dependence, so any help about that. Than also could not install the external package.
Thanks

A:

Well thats also no magic. Just let ros install the package and let it fetch the dependency's by itself. The related tutorial is here.
i. cd ~/ros_workspace (I put all checked out packages in here)

ii. roslocate info package_name > package_name.rosinstall

iii. rosinstall . /etc/ros/diamondback|electric|fuerte package_name.rosinstall

iv. rosmake package_name (rosdep --install package_name to install system dependencies)

v. deal with ROS dependencies by iterating 1 or 2
