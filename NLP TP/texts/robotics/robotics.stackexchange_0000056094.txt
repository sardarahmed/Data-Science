Just a note: I've updated the Wiki to fix this problem. the correct sed command should have been "sed -e "s/rosconsole/console_bridge/" rosconsole/package.xml > console_bridge/package.xml" (notice the terminating slash after console_bridge)

A:

I figured this out, sed is a find and replace utility i did it manually. still no turtlebot on pi yet. This makes me thinks somethings changed. Also just a place holder im currently compiling pcl and flann manually on the pi flann took 27hrs to compile but installed ok! Great success! Now i'm waiting on PCL to complete its been going 40+ hrs.
Trying to learn how to cross compile but that is definitly harder but will greatly reduce compile times andd im going to either try to release an image or convert compiled code to a deb! Has anyone made a turtlebot out of a pi?

You might want to check out Embedded Sig. They had some discussions regarding Rasberry Pi stuff.

May I suggest creating a virtual machine with the Raspbian environment and building in there? That would save you some time, even with setting up the VM - try http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/344/emulation-on-a-windows-pc or http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=37386
