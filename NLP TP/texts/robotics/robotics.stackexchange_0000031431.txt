A:

Hi, the value of 10000 is the maximum depth in millimeters. Thats not a software limit, but a limit given by the hardware. Also the value is somewhere given in the OpenNI/PS-Engine libraries.
As "Mac" mentioned, the point clouds published by the node is already in meters in the corresponding coordinate frame.
