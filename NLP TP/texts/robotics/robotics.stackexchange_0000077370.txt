Q:

Debugging a rqt plugin in PyCharm

Hey guys,
I am developing a rqt plugin in Python at the moment and I am using the recommended IDE PyCharm.
When I get errors I always try to debug with print messages.
I am wondering is there a good debugging solution to debug a rqt plugin in PyCharm?
Thank you very much in advance!
Best regards

A:

I realized now that I can debug my plugins by using the "Attach to Local Process" function (you can find it under "Run") and attach it to the rqt process. I had to change the ptrace settings to make it work by:
$ sudo su -
$ echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope

Maybe it'll help someone.
