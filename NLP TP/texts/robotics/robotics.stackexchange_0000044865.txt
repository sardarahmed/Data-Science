Q:

‘removeNaNFromPointCloud’ is not a member of ‘pcl’

When I try to do rosmake on my package I get the following error:
‘removeNaNFromPointCloud’ is not a member of ‘pcl’

However I can see it in the documentation: here
Code:
void cloud_cb (sensor_msgs::PointCloud2 input) {
  pcl::PointCloud<pcl::PointXYZ> in_cloud;
  pcl::PointCloud<pcl::PointXYZ> out_cloud;
  std::vector<int> indicies;
  pcl::fromROSMsg(input, in_cloud);
  pcl::fromROSMsg(input, out_cloud);
  pcl::removeNaNFromPointCloud(in_cloud, out_cloud, indicies);
}

Anyone know why this is currently saying it's not part of the pcl?

A:

Have you included this?:
#include <pcl/filters/filter.h>
