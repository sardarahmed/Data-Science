Q:

which package publishes odom? ROS Hydro + turtlebot

Sorry to disturb everyone.
But I want to know where the odom is published, as I want to record the odom message without the help of topic. I have searched over and over again, but still no found...
Heartfelt thanks to you!!   And sorry to my poor English...

Topics are an essential communications resource in ROS. I'm assuming that you mean that you'd like to save/store the data from odom not just "look" at it with rostopic? (Can you clarify what you need?)

@SL Remy
I am really sorry!  Thank you!
I want to save the odom data before it is published, as my teacher told me that the ros topic would cost more time, which will lead to the poor real-time of the odom.

A:

If you want to record the odometry file in a .csv file do the following in different terminals:
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch //launches roscore along with other turtlebot nodes

rosbag record -j -O house_bag /mobile_base/commands/velocity /odom //records the velocity and odometry topics and creates a .bag file named "house_bag"

//do some moving around with your turtlebot

rostopic echo -b house_bag.bag -p /odom > house_odom.csv //After you are done, this command exports the odometry csv file out of "house_bag.bag"
