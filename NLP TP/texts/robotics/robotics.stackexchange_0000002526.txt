Neuromorphic Engineering and Robotics

I have been into a boggling paper research on neuromorphic engineering and its implications on robotics applications, lately. It is relatively a less applied field and full of academic papers and difficult to skim easily :)
There are many ongoing projects applying analog or digital circuitry design to implement neurosynaptic simulations of the brain. Consumer oriented products like IBM Synapse and Qualcomm's Zeroth focus on digital hardware whereas academic research like Standford's neurogrid or ETC Zurich's Human Brain Project focus more on actual brain study using analog hardware.
If anybody is following this engineering field, can he/she spread more light on it and explain it's implications, methodologies and toolsets to the community, in detail?
PS : Regarding toolsets, I'm talking about the most feasible engineering methodologies to commit to the field.

A:

Regarding methodologies and tools, I recommend Chris Eliasmith's How to Build a Brain. It presents the Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA), a cognitive model that has been realized in the open source Nengo toolkit. I have read the book's introduction and some of Eliasmith's papers, and so far the approach looks very promising.
