Q:

Can GPS modules work inside plastic enclosures?

I'm going to be embarking on an autonomous robot project and I was going to be using GPS to navigate to waypoints (I'm aware of the margin of error when it comes to localization with GPD but I live in a lovely area with many open fields). 
I was going to use Adafruit's Ultimate GPS Breakout board with my RaspberryPi, and I was wondering how I should protect or mount the GPS to protect it from the elements. Do all GPS units need to be face up and unobstructed (ex. wood or plastic) in order to work? If so, how can I still protect a GPS unit from the outdoors?

A:

Yes, it works fine in a plastic (or wood) case. I've used the PA6H GPS from Adafruit in a Hammond 1553B plastic case with no issues.

Mostly what you want to avoid is any sort of conductor that might block a signal. This includes copper and iron.
