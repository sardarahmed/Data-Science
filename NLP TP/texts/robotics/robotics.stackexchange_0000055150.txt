Q:

Joint state settlers crash when trying out to adapt robot calibration to custom robot

hi everyone,
we´re currently working on adapting the available calibration package to work with a custom robot. We started with the maxwell_calibration package and made good progress (robot is moving into desired configurations, checkerboards are processed), but the joint states settlers crash with the following output:
    [ERROR] [1383211182.404871655, 1206.508000000]: Couldn't find mapping for [l_as_y]

We didn´t do any major changes, essentially just renaming the joint names to reflect the actual robot configuration. For simplicity, we also did not rename the arm_chain. Any ideas what the problem could be?

A:

Ok found the culprit: Had multiple different publishers to the "/joint_states" topic, which meant that the joints of interest to the settlers were not contained in some messages received. The settlers are apparently not robust against this and will crash.
