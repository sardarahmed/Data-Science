Q:

How to compile a rosjava package offline?

Hello,
I tried to compile a rosjava package without internet connection and it complained about not being able to reach "https://github.com/rosjava/rosjava_bootstrap/raw/indigo/buildscript.gradle"

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception. 
* What went wrong:
> Could not read script 'https://github.com/rosjava/rosjava_bootstrap/raw/indigo/buildscript.gradle'. 
> github.com

After that, I tried again with internec connection and it compiled. I would like to be able to code without internet connection. Is it possible? How?
Thanks

For that particular error you can work around it by either making sure that file is available locally (and updating the URL to it in your grade script), or by copy/pasting the contents of that file into your own Gradle script (essentially replacing the include. Not recommended).

Thanks. That gave me an idea: always try to download URL, but keep a copy just in case. In build.gradle I changed  this:

buildscript { 
  apply from: "https://github.com/rosjava/rosjava_bootstrap/raw/indigo/buildscript.gradle"  
}

To this:

buildscript {
    def f = new File("buildscript.gradle") 
    try{ 
    new URL("https://github.com/rosjava/rosjava_bootstrap/raw/indigo/buildscript.gradle").withInputStream{ i -> f.withOutputStream{ it 
So I keep a local copy, but if available, downloads from internet.
