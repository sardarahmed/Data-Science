Q:

Device that can push out independent pin points?

I'm looking for a device that can push out independent pinpoints from something similar to a Pin Point Impression Toy. I'm looking to create a 3D image from for example my computer. Does anybody know the name of such a device or can point me in the right direction of making one? 
I've been looking now for a while, but I'm having some slight problems finding a good way to describe it as a search term.
I'm sorry if this is the wrong forum.

A:

I don't know of any devices that exist for this purpose (besides devices that are not for sale, such as the MIT Media Lab's "Transform" table), but I'd imagine that the 2 most promising approaches for a homemade solution would be:

Use a robot arm or X/Y table to move to each pin location and push it the desired distance -- one pin at a time.  Reset the pins by just tilting the pins' frame back.
Attach a bowden cable to each pin and use a servo (or linear actuator) at the other end to control the position.  This has the advantage of setting all the pins in parallel.
