Q:

How can I use rosunit to unit test ROS nodes?

I found the package rosunit (wiki.ros.org / GitHub) which seems to target unit testing of single ROS nodes (in comparison to rostest which targets integration testing of ROS nodes). The last change of the wiki page is from 2014-06-08. Is the information still valid?
Otherwise:

How can I use rosunit?
How can I integrate it with rosbuild?
What's the roadmap of rosunit?
