Q:

Any best practices to record high quality images in rosbag?

Hi,
I am trying to record images (RGB+depth) into a rosbag using ASUS Xtion Pro Live. I followed this tutorial on what topics to record. But it did not mention anything about the quality aspect. For example does rosbag has options (like ffmpeg) to record the images/video as high or low quality? Or is it the openni_camera or openni_launch that takes care of this aspect? For example ASUS has depth resolution 640×480 @ 30 fps, 320×240 @ 60 fps and color 1280×1024 @ 30 fps. How do I select the quality options in ROS?
Thanks in advance,
Krish

A:

rosbag will store the raw messages however they arrive and knows nothing specific about images or any other data type.
So, what you send in your sender will determine the quality of images that are stored.
