Q:

How to find the list of stack on which you depend?

Hi,
I have a personnal stack "ard", and I would like to find the list of other stack I depend on. I have all my packages that declares other dependencies in their manifest.xml, and I would like to create the list of stacks that contains a package that is in all those manifests.
They underground aim is to create a "ligth" embedded ros distribution with only the required stuff for the robot, and keep a full ROS electric distribution on my development host.
An easy way would be to copy all directories find by "rosstack depends ard"
but this suppose that my stack.xml file is completed correctly, but it is currently out of sync with the bunch of manifest.xml. So is it a way to automate this completion ?

A:

roscreate-stack actually does that for you. After changing the dependencies of any package in your stack, just call roscreate-stack on it. It will not overwrite your existing stack.xml but just update the stack dependencies if necessary.

I am now able to select the required package. How could I generate the setup.sh automatically ?
