Q:

In the PID equation K[((s+a)^2)/s] what values correspond to the PID coefficients Kp, Ki, Kd?

I'm trying to understand how to obtain the Kp, Ki, Kd values after finding a combination of K and a that works for me. Do I just expand the equation and take the coefficients? 

A:

It is in frequency domain instead of time domain.
$$
G(s)=\frac{K(s+a)^2}{s} = \frac{Ks^2+2Kas+Ka^2}{s}
$$
according to the Laplace form of the PID controller
$$
G(s)=\frac{K_ds^2+K_ps+K_i}{s}
$$
so 
$$
K_d = K, K_p = 2Ka, K_i = Ka^2
$$
