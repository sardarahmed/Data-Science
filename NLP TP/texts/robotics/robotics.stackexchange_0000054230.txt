Q:

ros-hydro-rosserial-arduino DUE

Hello community,
is there anybody using the new Arduino DUE with rosserial arduino ?
Currently I'm not able to compile anything for the new CPU type, because of missing header files...
Cheers
Christian

A:

I assume by your question title that you are using debs -- I would suggest instead doing a source install from https://github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial and noting these two issues pull requests:

https://github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial/pull/64 (already merged into hydro-devel, should make it easy to use DUE)
https://github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial/pull/58 (not merged, not going to be merged, but notes some issues with the default examples due to problems with the DUE)
