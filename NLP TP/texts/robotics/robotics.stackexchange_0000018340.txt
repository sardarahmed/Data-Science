Q:

Algorithm for centering an object that is changing speed

I'm trying to use a pan / tilt alt-azimuth telescope mount to track an object that is moving in the sky. The problem is that the object is changing speed constantly. I can easily track objects that are moving at a steady speed. 
I'm using the OpenCV library to compute the object's distance from the center of the image. I should be able to tell the telescope mount to speed up or slow down to follow the object. The actual algorithm though seems surprisingly hard to write. 
For instance if I tell the mount to speed up to follow the object, then the apparent speed between the two is much less, but still not zero. So the object is slowly drifting out of the view. So I have to recenter it which is totally different than adjusting the speed. It's like I need a re-centering algorithm and a speed adjusting algorithm running at the same time. 
Does anyone have any ideas how to do this or where to ask? Neither the OpenCV or telescope forums seems the right place to ask this question.
Thanks

A:

It seems that your algorithm that controls the speed of your telescope does not make use of any integral part, thus you've been observing drifts while tracking.
Let $e_x$ be the error in the image plane between the x-coordinate $o_x$ of the object and the center $c_x$:
$$
e_x=o_x-c_x.
$$
Then, the azimuth velocity $\dot{a}$ of your telescope should be:
$$
\dot{a}=K_p \cdot e_x + K_I\int e_x dt,
$$
being $K_P$ and $K_I$ the two gains you have to tune up to obtain a nice tracking. In particular, the integral gain $K_I$ is responsible for compensating the drift so as for delivering non-null velocity when $e_x=0$.
There exist many methods to tune the gains. In your case, my suggestion is to start with $K_I=0$ and play with $K_P$ up to the point when you'll get small $e_x$ at steady-state and a residual drift. Only then, slowly increase $K_I$ until the small difference in velocities is brought to zero. 
Analogous reasoning applies to the elevation velocity.
