A:

The error message is telling you that /opt/ros/electric/stacks/simulator_gazebo/gazebo_worlds/empty_world.launch doesn't exist. If you do
ls /opt/ros/electric/stacks/simulator_gazebo/gazebo_worlds/empty_world.launch

what does it say? Can you verify that simulator_gazebo is installed correctly?

if i execute ls, it says "ls: cannot access (file path): No such file or directory"..i tried for other existing launch files, and i get the same file path(successful access) as entered...what could be the problem?

Sorry, my mistake...(there was a space between launch and xml that i missed while editing file)...thank you, your solution worked....thanks...
