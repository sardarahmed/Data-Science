Q:

Turtlebot2 Kobuki usb error

Hi guys I need a little help we have 5 turtlebots in our lab, 2 work fine but we're having trouble with the other 3. They power up fine but do not show up as a device (either /dev/kobuki or /dev/ttyUSB*)
dmesg outputs the following error message:
hub 2-1:1.0: connect-debounce failed, port 4 disabled
We've tried different cables, laptops, fully charging the robots and switching to firmware update mode and get the same error.
Any help would be appreciated.

Did that ever work? If the same procedure/laptop works on some and not others, this might be a hardware problem and might be something for the support.

It might be a hardware issue. I would recommend to contact kobuki@yujinrobot.com
