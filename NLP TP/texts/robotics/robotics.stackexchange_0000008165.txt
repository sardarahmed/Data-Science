Q:

what's confidence level? and how can we use it for vehicle detection using OpenCV?

I'm working on project for the Autonomous vehicle, and i want to know what's confidence level means and how can we use confidence level for vehicle detection in OpenCV ?

A:

Statistical confidence is most often defined in terms of a score that is the number of standard deviations away from the mean.
Now let's say you have a set of states (a state vector) used to define an object recognized using image processing in OpenCV (for example, RGB data, HSV data, filter responses, etc.). Given a series of training images for vehicles, you can compute the mean and covariance of their state vectors. If you then consider some new object being tested, you can compute what is known as the Mahalanobis distance between the new object's state vector and the vehicle state vector. This distance will essentially be the statistical confidence that the new object is a vehicle.
In fact, OpenCV has functions available to compute things like the covariance matrix and the Mahalanobis distance.
