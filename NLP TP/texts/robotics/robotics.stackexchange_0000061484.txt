Q:

RVIZ doesnot show /camera_link when kinect is connected

when I run openni_launch for kinect and open the RVIZ, I don't get the "/camera_link" in the drop down of the fixed frame in the global options. it always show map.
Because of this I am unable to visualise the point cloud from the kinect.
Any idea why this is happening..?
many thanks in advance.
