Q:

help with rosrun image_transport

I have been following the tutorial http://wiki.ros.org/image_transport/Tutorials/ExaminingImagePublisherSubscriber
But when i ran rosrun image_transport my_publisher path/to/some/image.jpg it says
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named my_publisher below /opt/ros/indigo/share/image_transport

i think there is a mistake in http://wiki.ros.org/image_transport/Tutorials/PublishingImages where after git clone it says
mkdir src which is already there.
Thanks

A:

image_transport is a different ROS package. Your project is named image_transport_tutorial and you simply need to launch

rosrun image_transport_tutorial my_publisher
path/to/some/image.jpg

in order for it to work. You have to make sure that your project is in ROS working path.
