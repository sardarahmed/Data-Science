Q:

Paper work before I do make my own Line follower Robot

I am a graduate student trying to make my own Line follower Robot for my minor assessment, I've all hardware parts and all data-sheets with me, I've attended a workshops of Robotics and studied a lot on Line follower robot. I have a good knowledge of C Programming and Embedded systems, but the problem is I've a very limited amount of time(2 days).
Please help me to suggest a good paper work about my Project - Line follower robot, where should I start from ? I am getting myself confused should I start from Programming or should I first do circuit simulations as I know It is not a better approach to use directly hardware. 
Please suggest me a fine Paper work or some links/videos so that I can make my Robotics projects fast. Any help would be really appreciated, Thanks.

A:

Two days?  Eeek!
I wouldn't try to simulate the thing at a circuit level.  If you're an EE and you're familiar with circuit simulation packages then using SPICE (or whatever) to simulate the system may let you slide by with an acceptable performance.
Personally, if I were designing one of these for money, I'd probably simulate it in Scilab, possibly using Xcos -- but that's because I'm familiar with that tool.
Given your limited time I wouldn't try to do more than make something that follows straight lines and gentle curves at some fixed speed.
