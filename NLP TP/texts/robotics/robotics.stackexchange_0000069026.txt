Q:

How to Add the installation prefix of "Eigen3" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "Eigen3_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files

When I entered this command:
cd /Users/mona/ros_catkin_ws/build_isolated/pcl_ros && /Users/mona/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/env.sh cmake /Users/mona/ros_catkin_ws/src/perception_pcl/pcl_ros -DCATKIN_DEVEL_PREFIX=/Users/mona/ros_catkin_ws/devel_isolated/pcl_ros -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/Users/mona/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G 'Unix Makefiles'

I get the following error:
-- Boost version: 1.58.0
-- Found the following Boost libraries:
--   system
--   filesystem
--   thread
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:7 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindEigen3.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Eigen3", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Eigen3" with any
  of the following names:

    Eigen3Config.cmake
    eigen3-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Eigen3" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "Eigen3_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Eigen3"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.

I tried to follow the guide for installing the eigen but apparently it was unsuccessful. I have these in /usr/local/eigen :
Monas-MacBook-Pro:~ mona$ cd /usr/local/eigen
Monas-MacBook-Pro:eigen mona$ ls
CMakeLists.txt              build_dir
COPYING.BSD             cmake
COPYING.GPL             debug
COPYING.LGPL                demos
COPYING.MINPACK             doc
COPYING.MPL2                eigen3.pc.in
COPYING.README              failtest
CTestConfig.cmake           lapack
CTestCustom.cmake.in            scripts
Eigen                   signature_of_eigen3_matrix_library
INSTALL                 test
bench                   unsupported
blas

And I have followed these steps in INSTALL file:
cd build_dir
cmake source_dir
make install

However when I enter eigen it is not recognized.
I need to get this fixed for this step of installing ROS on OSX:
./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

I am not an OSX guru, so if you are want to help me, it is best suggested to tell me how to set paths or where the files you want me to modify are located.
** I used destination path for eigen3:
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/eigen3
make install

and now I have these items after make install :
Monas-MacBook-Pro:build_dir mona$ ls /usr/local/eigen3/include/eigen3/
Eigen                   unsupported
signature_of_eigen3_matrix_library
Monas-MacBook-Pro:build_dir mona$ ls /usr/local/eigen3/include/eigen3/Eigen/
Array           Householder     QR          StdDeque
Cholesky        IterativeLinearSolvers  QtAlignedMalloc     StdList
CholmodSupport      Jacobi          SPQRSupport     StdVector
Core            LU          SVD         SuperLUSupport
Dense           LeastSquares        Sparse          UmfPackSupport
Eigen           MetisSupport        SparseCholesky      src
Eigen2Support       OrderingMethods     SparseCore
Eigenvalues     PaStiXSupport       SparseLU
Geometry        PardisoSupport      SparseQR

Yet I don't know where is the executable for eigen3 and how to set path for cmake.
Thanks a bunch,
Mona Jalal

Hi! I am having the exact same issue as you. Did you ever solve it?

have you been able to solve it?
I stil have the same issue

I have not been able to instal ROS on OSX yet. It seems the OSX version is having some issues at the moment, unfortunately.

A:

We (the ROS community) provide a CMake module for Eigen, but it is provided under the name Eigen but it is deprecated in Jade:
https://github.com/ros/cmake_modules#eigen-deprecated
But the package you're compiling is not using that deprecated module and is failing because it is looking for the Eigen provided Eigen3 CMake module. So the problem is likely that the version of Eigen you installed on your machine does not have this Eigen3 CMake module. Older versions of Eigen did not ship it. If you installed Eigen with Homebrew then it might be a packaging problem with Eigen in Homebrew. The Jade migration guide has a suggest way that packages should find Eigen to avoid disruption in the mean time:
http://wiki.ros.org/jade/Migration#Eigen_CMake_Module_in_cmake_modules
It seems the package you're trying to compile (pcl_ros?) is not doing this or is doing it incorrectly. If it were following the suggestion then it would have "fallen" back on the FindEigen.cmake cmake module provided by the cmake_modules ROS package.
It could be that something else is going on that's causing the issue, but that's my take on it.
