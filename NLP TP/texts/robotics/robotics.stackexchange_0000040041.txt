Your makefile can't locate the AddTwoInts.h file. It's either not in your path or the make file's not quite right

Please copy and paste the error from the console, and relevant snippets of what files generated the problem. http://www.ros.org/wiki/Support

A:

If you're following the tutorials, I'm fairly certain that your client.cpp file is trying to subscribe to a topic of type AddTwoInts from the tutorials. If this is the case, it means that your package cannot find the necessary message description. In order to access this information, you must either re-define the message type in your package as per the tutorials, or add the beginner_tutorials package as a dependency in your package. Do this by adding the following to your manifest.xml:
<depend package="beginner_tutorials" />
