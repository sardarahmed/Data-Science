Q:

Need suggestion about which microcontroller/processor and language to be used in my project

I am very new to robotics. but I will be writing algorithm for my robot to move around and gather information from its surroundings and process it. It will also process audio-visual signals. but I am in confusion about which micro-controller to use so it would be performance efficient and consumes less power.
The controller should also be capable of communication with wireless network (internet through wi-fi) and should also support memory integration.
Also I know to program in Java and C. please suggest which would be the best language to use for programming.
Thanks.
P.S. I would really like to use a microprocessor as it is highly customizable. Please suggest the best to use

It sounds like you are the perfect candidate for the Raspberry PI! It is an awesome microcomputer that can do plenty of things, has a great community of support and tons of add on boards that can do everything you might need including driving motors for a robot
