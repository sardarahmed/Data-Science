Hi there Prof. Xavier, you definitely want to check out:
Programming Robots with ROS, especially chapter 12: Follow-bot, that is exactly what you are looking for. A robot that follows a yellow line using a camera only, using gazebo for the simulation.
You can even check out their code at: https://github.com/osrf/rosbook/tree/master/followbot
Some pictures from the project:

And the book is a piece of beauty, written by OSRF themselves, check it out! Most of the code is on python, so it's easy to get used to.
Good luck!
