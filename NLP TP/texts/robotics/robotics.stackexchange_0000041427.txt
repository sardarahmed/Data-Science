Currently the robot I am using is able to use joystick to move around. I am quite new to ros and linux.

A:

Since you are new to ROS, it would be best you start from the tutorials, especially this
Once you know how to write a publisher, use the code that you have to grab data off your gyro. Put this data into the correct format for publishing.
You can also refer to codes for other sensor nodes eg http://www.ros.org/wiki/lse_xsens_mti to see what is published and how to publish it
