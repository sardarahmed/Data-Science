A:

I would suggest you'd better first check segmentation fault of RViz issue in this QA web site, separately from ppl_detection. In my environment it doesn't occur, and based on your tweak (changing package name) I'm now successfully running the people detection.
Environment: Ubuntu 11.04, electric all updated up to "important security" as of 12/1/2011.
