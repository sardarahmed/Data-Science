Q:

Releasing non-catkin Groovy packages through the build farm

Hello,
I have a collection of non-catkin packages (they form a stack in pre-Groovy terminology) for ROS Groovy that I would like to have built as Debian packages on the build farm.  Since these are not catkin packages, what set of instructions should I follow to make the release?  They will be hosted on Github.
Thanks!
patrick

A:

You will still use the older "release" package: http://ros.org/wiki/release
