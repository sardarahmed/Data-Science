Q:

How to get a different random sequence with OpenCV RNG?

I am using OpenCV to create some random numbers. I initialize the generator as:
RNG rng( 0xFFFFFFFF );

And then to get a number:
rng.uniform( 0, 100);

But everytime I run my program the generated sequence is the same. How do I get a different sequence?

A:

As stated in the doc
http://docs.opencv.org/modules/core/doc/old_basic_structures.html?highlight=random%20number%20generator#rng
RNG takes a seed as arg. If you need a different sequence every time you have to initialize it with a different value every time, e. g. use time, thread id or some thing like this as seed....
