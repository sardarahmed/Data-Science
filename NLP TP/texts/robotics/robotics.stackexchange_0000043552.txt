Q:

ar_kinect node not found

Is there a possibility how I can check that a node exists in a package?
Because in the ar_kinect package should be the ar_kinect node, but when I start the launch file, I get the error message that there is no node like this in this package.
Am I right that this node should be in ar_kinect package after I download this package?
Thanks!

I execute the "rosmake" command, but it does not help, but I found the mistake. Thanks.

A:

Did you remember to compile the package after you downloaded it? If not you should open a terminal, navigate to the package and execute the "rosmake" command.
