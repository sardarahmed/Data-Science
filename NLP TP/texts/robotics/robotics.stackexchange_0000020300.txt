Q:

What should be the ideal ratio for link lengths ( L1/ L2) of a 2 link manipuator robot with revolute joints?

I am working on making a CAD model of a two link robotic manipulator, with link lengths around 15-20 cm. I am unable to figure how to set their mutual ratio and I want to know whether there is some fixed, determined ratio on how to take these values. I thought taking the human arm as an inspiration, but if so,  is it right to take so?

A:

This is a good question, and one you should definitely consider when designing a new robot arm.  But unfortunately, it depends a lot on the configuration of your arm (i.e. how the joints will be bent), and how you determine "best" (i.e. are you optimizing for speed, strength, dexterity, etc).  And even if you know these things, the metrics you use to determine "best" can differ.
You should read up on "manipulabilty".  This is a feature of the arm's configuration.  Roughly, it is a measure of how well the arm can move in a particular direction.  Usually, this is represented as an ellipse.

The interesting thing about manupulabilty is that there are actually 2, orthogonal ellipoids.  One for velocity and one for force.  Intuitively, if you think about mechanics, where the arm can move fast, it is not very strong.  But where it is strong, it is not very fast.  And if you want a very general purpose arm, trying to achieve a more circular ellipse might be desirable. 
You may have different link lengths and arm configurations depending on your use case.
There are other measures that you might want to consider too.  Such as distance from joint limits, and condition number.
