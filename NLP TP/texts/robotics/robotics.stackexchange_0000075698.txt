Q:

Adding a ROS node

I made a ROS node by simply doing some scripting in Python. Now, when I do rosnode list, it displays the list of all the active nodes. Now, I want to know how can I add the node to the list of already developed nodes ?

A:

rosnode list lists the running ROS nodes (I'm not sure what you mean by "developed")
if you want your node to appear in rosnode list you just run it.
