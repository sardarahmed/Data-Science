Q:

error in import

Dear ROS-Users
I created a service in my_package but I am not able to import it. In particular, using "from my_package import srv" in a ros-python node raise me this error: ImportError: cannot import name srv
However, doing the same "from my_package import srv" from a python shell, I don't get any error
I'm using catkin on ros-hydro and both catkin_make and catkin_make install don't give me any erro
Thank you for your help

Could it be related to the PYTHONPATH?

A:

The problem was on the name of file: it gave me problem when package, file and node had the same name
Sorry for the "noob" question
