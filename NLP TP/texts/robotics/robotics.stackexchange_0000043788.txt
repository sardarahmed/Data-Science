A:

You cannot use execfile because it runs a python file. Launch files are xml files that describe which parameters to set and which nodes to run.
To execute a launch file, you can use subprocess.call to execute roslaunch and give it either the absolute path to your launch file or two parameters where the first is the package of your launch file and the second is the name of the file.

Given that roslaunch is implemented in python, this answer seems a little dissatisfying.
