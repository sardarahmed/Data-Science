Q:

Execute Pyhton file - Output terminal

Hi.
How can I display something from a Phyton file on the terminal?
I start the launch file with the node from the pyhton file, but I do not get back the informations on the terminal. For example when I have the order "print 5", shouldnâ€™t I see the number 5 on the terminal after I launch the file?

A:

See the rospy logging overview page for more details.
You can use
number = 5
rospy.loginfo("%d", number)
rospy.logwarn("%d", number)

If you run your Python node from a launch file you need to put output="screen" inside the node tag to see info messages.
