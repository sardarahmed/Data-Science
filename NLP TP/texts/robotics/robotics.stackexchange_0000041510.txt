Q:

what is joint effort?

I'm looking at the realtime joint controller tutorial, and it's talking about "commanded effort" for controlling the joint. What exactly is "effort"? It's not defined anywhere that I see. It looks just like some kind of position displacement.

A:

The term 'effort' is used to describe either the force of a prismatic joint or the torque of a rotational joint. It's used to generalize the name for this two types of joints.
