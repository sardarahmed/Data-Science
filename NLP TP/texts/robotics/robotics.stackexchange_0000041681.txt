Q:

clearing_radius costmap

Hello,
I have one question with this parameter in the navigation stack.
I have already running the move_base node with fake_localize, base_local_planner, base_global_planner and works great but I have some troubles because the ugv goes very near of the walls. I try to change this parameters:
clearing_radius
inflation_radius
but I can't change the global_planner to make the path very near of the obstacles, the robot goes with the same distance with the difference that it can't go inside some places (maybe because the inflation_radius).
I want the robot goes a little far from the walls (about 30-40 cm).
Can anybody tell me how this parameters work? I don't find any documentation.

A:

No, At least I found the correct parameter:
occdist_scale
This parameter causes the robot goes little far from walls.
# Trajectory Scoring Parameters
    goal_distance_bias: 0.8
    path_distance_bias: 0.6
    occdist_scale: 0.2 #0.01
    heading_lookahead: 0.325
    dwa: true

Thanks for the info, you help me very much
