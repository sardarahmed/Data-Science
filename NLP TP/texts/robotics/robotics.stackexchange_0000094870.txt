Q:

Could not find a package configuration file provided by "tf2" with any of the following names

I have downloaded the tf2 package recently and I am hoping to process the packages for my turtlebot 3 burger.
The error messages are:
Could not find the required component 'tf2'. The following CMake error indicates that you either need to install the package with the same name or change your environment so that it can be found.
CMake Error at /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:83 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "tf2" with any of
  the following names:

    tf2Config.cmake
    tf2-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "tf2" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "tf2_DIR"
  to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "tf2" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  CMakeLists.txt:7 (find_package)

Please advise.

A:

sudo apt install ros-<distro>-tf2*

In general, you should get familiar with rosdep & errors like this. That's just the canonical error for "yo, you're missing the package mate".

error indicates that you either need
to install the package with the same
name or change your environment so
that it can be found.

This error is pretty straight forward but I agree all the text around it can be overwhelming if you're new to C++

Thank you for the prompt reply. However, after typing that command, trying ros-kinetic-tf2* , ros-kinetic-tf2 and also ros-indigo-tf2* , ros-indigo-tf2 . The result are similar to:
E: Unable to locate package ros-kinetic-tf2*
E: Couldn't find any package by glob 'ros-kinetic-tf2*'
E: Couldn't find any package by regex 'ros-kinetic-tf2*'

Side note: I have the tf2 package in my src folder of the workspace.

Seeing as the OP has mentioned Raspbian, there is a good chance he's build ROS from source.
In that case you cannot use apt to install additional packages.

@gvdhoorn Yes, I am processing these packages from a Raspberry Pi 3B+ on my turtlebot. I have the tf2 package file in the src folder. The command I am using to process the packages is catkin_make_isolated. I am not sure if it will affect the processing, forgive me.
