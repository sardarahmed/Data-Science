Q:

IMU_node doesn't work with 3dm-gx3-25, indigo, ubuntu 14.04

Hi, guys, I saw that this Imu_node worked with 3dm-gx3-25 in fuerte, now I am trying to use it with indigo, under Ubuntu 1404, but doesn't work.
when I run
roslaunch microstrain_3dmgx2_imu microstrain_3dmgx2.launch
error is :
SUMMARY

[ERROR] [1462778064.984122077]: Exception thrown while starting IMU. This sometimes happens if you are not connected to an IMU or if another process is trying to access the IMU port. You may try 'lsof|grep /dev/tty0' to see if other processes have the port open. timeout reached (in microstrain_3dmgx2_imu::IMU:read_with_timeout) You may find further details at http://www.ros.org/wiki/microstrain_3dmgx2_imu/Troubleshooting

I tried to run lsof|grep /dev/tty0, and it shows:
mech-user@test1-pc:~$ lsof | grep /dev/tty0
imu_node  7344       mech-user    9uW     CHR                4,0      0t0     1038 /dev/tty0

and if I kill one of these 5, the node will be killed, so the solution in troubleshooting doesn't  match this problem.
any helps?

A:

For me, the 3dm-gx3-25 showed up on /dev/ttyACM0 by defualt. Try typing ls -l /dev/ttyACM0 (assuming the imu is the only usb sensor you have connected), or you can try with process of elimination by disconnecting the sensor (wait about 5-10 seconds for the usb device to unregister), typing ls -l /dev/tty to view the whole list. Then connect the sensor, and view the list again. You should either see a new /dev/ttyACM or a new /dev/ttyUSB .
Id also recommend that you set up some udev rules. You can use this one

I actually ended up disabling it after i set a calibration from the microstrain utility application on windows
