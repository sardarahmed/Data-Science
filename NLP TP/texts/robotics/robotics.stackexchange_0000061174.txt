Q:

Make the package usueful

I just finish working a project in ROS.
What I want to do actually is to make my package useful for another people, my package contain a node and big library.
Like when I give the package to someone, he can use it without any problem.
So the question is how can I take the package to another computer and what should do in it so that the package works fine ?
(I'm using catkin package.)

So what's your question?
Comment by ROSkinect on 2014-07-25:
the question is clear but anyway I just add one

A:

Just copy-paste your project (the folder catkin_workspace/src/project) into the other person's catkin_workspace/src folder. Go to the top level catkin_workspace directory and hit catkin_make.
That is all that is needed. (Of course, assuming all dependencies, ROS and external, are satisfied.)
It is nice to use git-github. So that everything becomes easy.
Have a great day!

two questions : 1- Go to the top level catkin_workspace directory, where is that ? 2- "It is nice to use git-github. So that everything becomes easy." you mean that I could share my package in git-github website ?

Git is a version control software. You can find tutorials here: http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Git/article.html.
The top level catkin_workspace is the directory from where you type catkin_make. It is the directory that has src, devel, build and CMakeLists.txt
