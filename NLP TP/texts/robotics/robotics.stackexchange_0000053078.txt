A:

Hi there
If you want to use ncurses++ (in electric) you should add the following to your CMakeList.txt:
find_package( PkgConfig REQUIRED )
pkg_check_modules ( ncurses++ REQUIRED ncurses++ )

add_executable ( my_exec path_to_my_exec/my_exec.cpp )
target_link_libraries ( my_exec ${ncurses++_LIBRARIES} )

And then modify the manifest.xml of your package to let know ROS that you are using an external library:
<rosdep name="ncurses++"/>

I hope this helps
