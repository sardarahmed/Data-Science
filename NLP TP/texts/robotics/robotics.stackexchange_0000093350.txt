Q:

ROS2: URL to camera_info yaml not being recognized

Running ROS2 dashing Ubuntu 18.04 bionic on x86.
URL to camera info yaml file not being recognized. The url is being loaded via the launch file as a parameter.
I have declared the parameter before trying to use.
I have confirmed that the intended url from the launch file is obtained.
See the following repo. Place camera_info.yaml in the /config directory. (example file can be found here.)

A:

Looking at your launch file, you need to either specify the camera_calibration_file with either a file:// prefix or in the package:// format.  Without the prefix on the URI, the package will fail to parse it.
Example correction:
# Using file://
config_file = 'file://' + os.path.join(config_dir, 'camera_info.yaml')
# OR using package://
config_file = 'package://ros2_ipcamera/config/camera_info.yaml'

@mjcarroll Thank you for this. I went with using 'file://'.  Don't think I would have been able to figure this out without your input.
