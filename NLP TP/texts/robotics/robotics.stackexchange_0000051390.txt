Q:

rosdep init error

I am installing ros from behind a proxy server
while using sudo rosdep init it gives a page address and then website may be down ,
while the proxy has been configured in apt.conf as well as exported using export command.
I checked using wget command, I am able to download the pages I enter the link for but when I enter the page address returned while using rosdep init it says proxy tunnelling failed.
What is the solution for this?

A:

Working behind a proxy is not currently supported. I opened a ticket https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rosdep/issues/271 to add support for being behind a proxy.
