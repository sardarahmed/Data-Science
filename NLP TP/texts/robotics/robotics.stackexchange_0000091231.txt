Q:

frontier_exploration installation can't locate explore_client and explore_server in its package

Hi everyone. I'm running ROS Kinetic on Raspberry Pi.
So it seems that frontier_exploration package was successfully built via git clone https://github.com/paulbovbel/frontier_exploration.git and catkin_make.
I've also downloaded global_map.launch and created a launch folder within frontier_exploration folder since it was not generated after installation.
However, running roslaunch frontier_exploration global_map.launch returns the following error:
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [frontier_exploration/explore_client]: can't locate node [explore_client] in package [frontier_exploration] 
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [frontier_exploration/explore_server]: can't locate node [explore_server] in package [frontier_exploration]

I have tried with ROS Melodic and the same error is printed after attempting to run. What could be the problem?
Thanks

A:

It seems that the launch file is in exploration_server folder. Running rosrun exploration_server exploration.launch worked.
