Q:

No color when I open a part exported from SolidWorks in Gazebo?

Hello Everyone!
I am trying to create a conveyor belt simulation in gazebo, using the SolidWorks to URDF exporter. Before importing the conveyor, I decided to test the exporter out on a simple part, and I managed to spawn it in Gazebo just fine, but no matter what I do, I cannot seem to get any color but white/gray.
Tried the following: Changing texture in URDF Exporter, changing the RGB values in URDF file, changing colors and textures in SolidWorks before exporting.
Am I doing something wrong?
Thank you for your time!

Thanks for your response, Benjamin Blumer! I do not spot  in the URDF... Is this something I should add manually?

If it didn't properly display the color, that may be a bug. Single parts should have the correct colors specified in the URDF. One day, I'll  add the gazebo colors to the options.

Thank you! For now, the fix suggested by Benjamin does the trick.

A:

What does the generated URDF look like?
Does the  match the  ?
Try adding:
<gazebo reference="PinkCube">
    <material>Gazebo/Blue</material>
</gazebo>

between the  and  tags.  That should make it blue. If so, we're on the right track. From there you can play around with the different materials available. In Fuerte, they're listed in here: /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/simulator_gazebo/gazebo/gazebo/share/gazebo-1.0.2/Media/materials/scripts/Gazebo.material
for Groovy, I think the G in "Gazebo.material" is lower case.
