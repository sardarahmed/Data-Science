This should give you some idea ros message filter. But remember this isn't working because call back is never called for some reason which i couldn't identify.

What particular part you don't understand? If you have position of detected object with respect to camera you just create tf publisher publishing transformation between camera tf frame and object. Of course you also need camera's tf publisher if you don't have it written already.

I think the answer is on a question that you made about 3 days ago.
