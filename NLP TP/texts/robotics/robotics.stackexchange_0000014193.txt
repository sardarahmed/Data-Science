Q:

Calculating the resistor for a buzzer

Please note: Although this question tangentially involves a Raspberry Pi, this is really more just a pure robotics question at heart.

I'm trying to connect my Raspberry Pi 1 Model A to this buzzer. I've seen wiring diagrams of this in action, and believe I need to put a resistor in between the buzzer and the (3.3V) output GPIO pin. If this is incorrect, please begin by correcting me!
My question is: how do I calculate the required ohms of this resistor? This particular buzzer is rated at 6VDC.

A:

Without a more detailed spec sheet I can't say for sure, but this is my understanding: 
The buzzer has a self-drive circuit is rated for input 6V max, at which point it will pull 45mA and oscillate at 300-500Hz.
You don't need to explicitly limit the current into the buzzer, however 3.3V may not be enough to turn on the drive circuit.
I also recommend enabling in software the pull-down resistor of the pin you will be using.
Putting a resistor between the output pin and the buzzer will decrease the voltage across the buzzer and limit the current through it, which will reduce the volume.
It can also cause unwanted ringing without the use of a capacitor in parallel. See page 31 of this document for an example.
