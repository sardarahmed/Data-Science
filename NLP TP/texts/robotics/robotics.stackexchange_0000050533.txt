Q:

ROS Install on Pandaboard trouble linking ASSIMP 3 collada_urdf

I have followed this guide to install ROS on my Pandaboard: ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/PandaBoard/Source
I have gotten to package 100/103 in the build (collada_urdf) and it fails to build giving me this error:
/opt/ros/groovy/ros_catkin_ws/devel_isolated/collada_urdf/lib/libcollada_urdf.so: undefined reference to ``aiScene::aiScene()'`
I added set(IS_ASSIMP3 1) and
add_definitions(-DIS_ASSIMP3) to the CMakeLists.txt for collada_urdf but with no luck.
Also, I followed the build instructions to build Assimp 3.
If anyone can provide any suggestions I would really appreciate it.
Full out put of sudo ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --pkg collada_urdf:

If you don't need collada_urdf, you can try removing it from your src folder and rebuilding.
I've been using the Ubuntu ARM debs with good success: http://www.ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/UbuntuARM . No collada_urdf build there either, but I haven't needed it yet.

I think this is related to: https://github.com/ros/robot_model/pull/15#issuecomment-16760508

A:

I think the problem is that you have Assimp 2.0 also on the system.  collada_urdf then gets confused because it finds Assimp 2.0 and does not bother to check for Assimp 3.0 which is needed by collada_urdf.
You must remove Assimp 2.0:
sudo apt-get remove libassimp2 libassimp-dev
Make sure Assimp 3.0 is installed and the path to the assimp.pc file is listed in your PKG_CONFIG_PATH.
Recompile everything and it should work.
