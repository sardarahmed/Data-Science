Q:

Kinect can't be connected to my netbook

I'm using Ubuntu10.10.  Following the diamondback installation instruction, I installed the ros-diamondback-turtlebot-robot,and finished turtlebot setup,networking setup,environment setup. There was nothing wrong, and I thought it's OK to connect the kinect.
However, when I tried roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch,it presented that
[ INFO] [1320732062.736897541]: [/openni_node1] No devices connected.... waiting for devices to be connected

Then I installed openni_kinect according to http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_kinect, I got the same result.The light of kinect was twinkling,It didn't work, either.
I sincerely wish someone could give me some suggestions,thanks a lot.

Please follow the TurtleBot Tutorials  you need to make sure the breakers are turned on for the Kinect.
