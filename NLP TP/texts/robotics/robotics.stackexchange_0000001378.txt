Q:

How to tell when an ArduPilot has finished initialising its gyros (without referencing telemetry)?

Using ArduPilot software (fixed wing, ArduPlane), I know that after I boot up I need to keep the system sit still while the gyros initialise.
When I have ground station in the field it's easy to know when it's safe to launch because the telemetry message tells me. But I don't always fly with a ground station. In these situations I currently just sit and wait for a while before arming, then again before launching. 
Is there some reliable rule of thumb? information in the blinking of the arming switch or buzzing that I haven't worked out yet? This UAV has PX4 autopilot hardware (with both Px4FMU and PX4IOBoard), including with buzzer and illuminated arming switch. The LEDs on the board are obscured (but I could make light channels from them if required).
(Note: I'm asking this question here to test the theory that robotics stack exchange night be an appropriate forum for these sorts of questions, which has been suggested a couple of times in response to the Area51 drones proposal.)

A:

This depends on a few things. First of all, are you using ArduPlane or ArduCopter, and what mode are you in? For ArduPlane, your answers are here, and for arducopter, here.
In both cases, the software has safeguards that will not let you arm or start the motor while it is initializing. In both cases, the LEDs indicate when it is ready to arm or fly. Of course, these behaviours are mostly configurable. For example, you can set the MANUAL_LEVEL parameter in ArduPlane to 1 if you want to skip the accelerometer calibration on each boot.
