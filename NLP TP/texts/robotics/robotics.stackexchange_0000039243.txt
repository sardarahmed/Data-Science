Q:

University of Washington rgb-d slam package availability

Hi there, I came across some fantastic work put out by the University of Washington doing room mapping and localization with just a laptop and a kinect and wanted to know if the software is available.
The link to the demo videos and website are here, but they do not seem to point to the software.
