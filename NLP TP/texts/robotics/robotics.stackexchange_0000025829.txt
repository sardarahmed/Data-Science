Q:

Player gazebo ERROR protobuf missing requiered position,orientation

I am getting a lot of errors when I am trying conect player and gazebo (1.4.0).
When I run playerv or whatever other client pf player I getting the follow message:
Encounterd strings containinf invalid UTF-8 while parsing protocol buffer. Stirngs must contain inly UTF-8; yse the "bytes" type for waw bytes.
libprotobud ERROR google : Cna't parse message of type "gazebo.msgs.Pose" because it is missing requierd field: position, orientarion.
I have compiled player and gazebo several times but the problem persists.
thanks

This type of error looks like multiple conflicting version of gazebo are in use. First place to look is your environment variables.
