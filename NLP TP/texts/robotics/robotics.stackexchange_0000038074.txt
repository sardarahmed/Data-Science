Q:

Gmapping noise in map

Hi all,
i am using erratic robot in Gazebo and taking laser scan after that using gmapping i create a map which looks like this
i cant figure out that why the map has noise in it or unexplored places since before i was trying with basic_localization_stage.bag can find here the map was perfect.
Thanks in advance

What type of laser scanner are you using? Specifically, what is its max range?
Comment by Zee-Q on 2012-02-21:
it is sick lms 200 with max range 32 m practically.

A:

The gray areas you see in the middle are "unknown" which can mean they are unexplored, or you only got a few scans in those areas and gmapping didn't clear them out. This is perfectly normal, and if you know those areas are clear, you can open your map up in an image editor and mark them as such. The map format is described in more detail in the map_server wiki page.
