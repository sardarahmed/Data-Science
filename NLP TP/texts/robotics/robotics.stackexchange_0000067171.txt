Q:

freenect_launch with Kinect

i follow this answer:http://answers.ros.org/question/196455/kinect-installation-and-setup-on-ros-updated/
I understand Openni_launch does not work anymore under Indigo for Kinect
so I install freenect_launch already

Can you give more information about "but not work correctly" ? What doesnt work ? Do you receive images?
Be aware that by default freenect_launch does not enable depth_registration, you can emable it either by modifying the launchfile or using the GUI rqt_reconfigure

A:

Openni provides a driver that works.
this is an out of the box solution!
just type in your console
Sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-openni-camera
Sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-openni-launch

then u have to change something at the driver:
download this driver:https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect/zipball/unstable
and input the following commands:
cd ~/Downloads
unzip avin2-SensorKinect-v0.93-5.1.2.1-0-g15f1975.zip 
cd avin2-SensorKinect-15f1975/Bin
tar -xjf SensorKinect093-Bin-Linux-x64-v5.1.2.1.tar.bz2
cd Sensor-Bin-Linux-x64-v5.1.2.1
sudo ./install.sh

after that it will work, for a live test of kinect open rviz and add a topic or type in:
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch

open a new terminal and type in:
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/rgb/image_color

Dear felixwatzlawik,
thank you so much that I installed openni successfully
but I ran the command roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch
it shows
[openni.launch] is neither a launch file in package [openni_launch] nor is [openni_launch] a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was written

Comment by felixwatzlawik on 2015-06-08:
something must have gone wrong with your installation, the line with roslaunch works for me..
