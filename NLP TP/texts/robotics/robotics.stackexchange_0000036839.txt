Q:

cluster_extraction - pcl::search not declared?

Hi Everyone,
I've tried selectively importing the code from the Point Cloud Library Cylinder Model Segmentation tutorial into the template provided in the ROS PCL tutorial.
Trying to run rosmake throws an error:
/ros_workspace/turtlebot_test/src/model_segmentation.cpp:49:8: error: ‘pcl::search’ has not been declared
The tutorials compile and work on my system individually in ROS and using the CMake method described on the PCL website respectively.  I've tried adding headers and library links to the CMake file but to no avail.
Any help would be appreciated.

Hi,
If you want to use the latest pcl 1.4, download the perception_pcl_unstable package to your ros_workspace so that its looked on top of the perception_pcl path. So in that case the pcl 1.4 will be used in all your compilation.
Use the following command to download the package onto the workspace.
svn co https://svn.pointclouds.org/ros/trunk/perception_pcl_unstable perception_pcl_unstable

This is what i did and it worked
Hope this helps,
Karthik

Hey, Thank you very much. It solved one of my issues here. http://answers.ros.org/question/3539/installation-of-tabletop_object-detector-package

It turns out what looks like a more general method to include Eigen is described here http://www.ros.org/wiki/eigen  I had put that original include line just before the 'rosbuild_genmsg()' line in the CMakeLists.txt in my test package directory.

Hey, May i know where you pasted the include_directories(/usr/include/eigen3) to solve the Eigen/StdVector issue.

You are welcome :)

Putting perception_pcl_unstable into my ROS workspace folder has solved that compile error.  The compiler still needed some help finding includes like 'Eigen/StdVector', which I ended up handling by adding 'include_directories(/usr/include/eigen3)' to CMakeLists.txt.  Thanks for your suggestion!
