Q:

Install on OSX fails with missing libboost_signals-mt.dylib

Hi,
have a problem with OSX and groovy installation.
Did anyone have to cope with this error?
Should be installed...

A:

I had the same problem, it appears some pkg-config files are incorrect in ROS. Check my previous question for the solution:

Can't find a file with : in it.

Do you get anything if you execute : cd ~/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/lib/pkgconfig && grep -r 'l:/usr' *

I found some libs and I can compile more packages. But I get the same error again with rospack_genmsg_libexe ... Edit: Works now, have to delete CMakeCache files ...
