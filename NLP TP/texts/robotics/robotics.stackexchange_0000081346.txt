Q:

What's the mathmatics formula in robot_localization

Hi Tom/all:
I'm wondering what the mathmatics formula in ekf.cpp file is. It's the core of EKF. But I got confused when looking through those code. Can somebody enlighten it to me? Thank you so much!

What code are you referring to? Do you have a link?

A:

You can read this paper from the authors of the package. But even there it's a bit unclear what the exact state update is. This question contains some details too.
As I understand it they assume a second order model for all calculations and estimate the velocity+acceleration from measurements, they then use the standard EKF update. But I haven't been able to find details on how these motion model parameters are estimated.
