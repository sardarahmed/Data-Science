Q:

CV bridge OpenCV4 error

ROS Noetic
Ubuntu 20.04
When I include cv_bridge like this:
#include <cv_bridge/cv_bridge.h>

and then use:
catkin build <project_name>

I get this error:
/opt/ros/noetic/include/cv_bridge/cv_bridge.h:43:10: fatal error: opencv2/core/core.hpp: No such file or directory
   43 | #include <opencv2/core/core.hpp>

I installed the full version of Noetic.
Is there a way to fix this?
Am I missing any additional things in my CMake or xml file? All that I have added is the following:
  <build_depend>cv_bridge</build_depend>

target_link_libraries(Color ${catkin_LIBRARIES}
                        ${OpenCV_INCLUDE_DIRS})

As far asmy knowledge goed, Noetic comes with OpenCV4, while cv_bridge is trying to include Opencv2

Did you include cv_bridge in your Cmake?

On find_package
On catkin_package

Yes you are correct. I was missing it in find_package. My bad.
Although, im not sure if it should be added to catkin_package, as it gave me additional errors when added there.
Thanks Ranjit
