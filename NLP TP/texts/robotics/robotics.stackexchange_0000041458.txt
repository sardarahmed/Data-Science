Q:

how to get a 2D map using octomap

I am using ubuntu 11.10 and electric ROS.
I've already got 3D map using rgbdslam pkg and now I want to downproject the 3D map to 2D in order for localization. However I cannot find a tutorial on how to do this using octomap though I know it has such a function. Can someone give me any advice? Thanks !

I am new in ROS, so I am confused at how to get this 2D map from the topic and use this map for later use. Can you give me some more specific instructions? Thanks a lot !

try this command
rosrun map_server map_saver -f map , this command will save the map in your current directory
