rqt_ptam was written with support for groovy and later only. One difference is the pluginlib macro which fails compiling in your code. In fuerte, it used to have 4 arguments. Here is a description what you need to change:
http://wiki.ros.org/pluginlib (and switch to fuerte) also, when you switch to the groovy documentation, there is a migration guide at 5) for fuerte --> groovy, which you essentially would have to revert. However, if possible, I'd consider upgrading to hydro since fuerte is deprecated with the release of hydro.
