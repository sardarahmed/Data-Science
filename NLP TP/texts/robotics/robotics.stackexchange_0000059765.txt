Q:

No diff_drive_controller for ARM?

Hi - I have a differential drive robot based on the BeagleBone Black (it's actually the robot built for a Coursera course). I'd really like to use the diff_drive_controller, but there isn't a debian package in the ARM repo. The BBB has Ubuntu 13.04 and ROS Hydro on it.
Any idea why that specific package is absent from the ARM repo?
I did try to build diff_drive_controller myself on the BBB but ran into other problems. I'd rather stick with official binaries though, if possible.
Also - I tried to include links to a lot of the items mentioned above but I don't have enough karma - sorry for that. :(
Thanks,
Zach

A:

It looks like the diff_drive_controller package didn't exist when I did the last set of ARM builds for Hydro.
You can probably build it from source if you use the latest hydro-devel branches of the ros_control and ros_controllers repositories.
