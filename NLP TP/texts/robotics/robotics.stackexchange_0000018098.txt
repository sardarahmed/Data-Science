Q:

how to control servo motor with potentiometer in arduino

I'm working on a robotic arm which uses 3x MG995 servo motors, 3x potentiometers (10k), and 1 Arduino Uno. 
I uploaded the code to the Arduino but the servo won't stop. I want to control it with the rotation of the potentiometer knob. In other words, as I rotate the knob on the potentiometer the servo should rotate by the same angle. 
But it won't work. What do I need to do to complete the function?
Here is my code..
#include <Servo.h>

//define our servos
Servo servo1;
Servo servo2;
Servo servo3;
Servo servo4;

//define our potentiometers
int pot1 = A1;
int pot2 = A2;
int pot3 = A3;
int pot4 = A4;

//variable to read the values from the analog pin (potentiometers)
int valPot1;
int valPot2;
int valPot3;
int valPot4;

void setup()
{
  //attaches our servos on pins PWM 3-5-6-9 to the servos
  servo1.attach(3);
  servo1.write(0);  //define servo1 start position
  servo2.attach(5);
  servo2.write(90); //define servo2 start position
  servo3.attach(6);
  servo3.write(90); //define servo3 start position
  servo4.attach(9);
  servo4.write(70); //define servo4 start position
}

void loop()
{
  //reads the value of potentiometers (value between 0 and 1023)

  valPot1 = analogRead(pot1);
  valPot1 = map (valPot1, 0, 1023, 90, 180); //scale it to use it with the servo (value between 0 and 180)
  servo1.write(valPot1); //set the servo position according to the scaled value

  valPot2 = analogRead(pot2);
  valPot2 = map (valPot2, 0, 1023, 0, 180);
  servo2.write(valPot2);

  valPot3 = analogRead(pot3);
  valPot3 = map (valPot3, 0, 1023, 0, 180);
  servo3.write(valPot3);

  valPot4 = analogRead(pot4);
  valPot4 = map (valPot4, 0, 1023, 0, 180);
  servo4.write(valPot4);

}

A:

Could you please upload a schematic of the circuit as well. There might be several possibilities for what could be wrong in your system. First try to pass some angle values to the servos and make sure that those are working correctly. 
If it's okay, try to read the inputs from potentiometers and print them in the Serial monitor. Observe the values in serial monitor while rotating the knobs and make sure that they are working well.
These two are the most possible cases for the problem.
Make sure that the potentiometer is connected between the 5v and Gnd.
