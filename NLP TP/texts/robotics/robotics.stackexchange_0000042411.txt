Do you have the kinect plugged into the USB 3.0 port? For some reason, it works best there.

I think it might be better if you reference your previous question, or stay on that thread, so people will know what things you've already tried. Please indicate what things you've changed http://answers.ros.org/question/38991/no-device-connected-turtlebot-kinect/
