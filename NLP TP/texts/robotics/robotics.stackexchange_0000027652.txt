Q:

error _x is not a member of gazebo::math::Pose

Hi,
I am using the following :
math::Pose A = this->model->GetWorldPose();
while(A._x!= pointB[0] && A._y!=pointB[1] && A._z!=pointC[2])
do something
on compiling i am getting the error,
‘class gazebo::math::Pose’ has no member named ‘_x’
‘class gazebo::math::Pose’ has no member named ‘_y’
‘class gazebo::math::Pose’ has no member named ‘_z’
But the API[1] does show _x _y and _z as double members of math::Pose.

A:

You should try to access these values with :
