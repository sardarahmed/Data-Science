Q:

Autonomous navigation with turtlebot. Troubles through doors

Hi,
I'm using the navigation stack on turtlebot, but when I try to navigate autonomously in the map my robot can not go through doors. I suspect that's because of the inflated objects. If you look at what's being shown in rviz the blue part of each part of the door is touching at the middle.
Does somebody know where I can change the inflated objects to a smaller range?
Thanks.

Can you post your navigation stack configuration files?

A:

Direct answer to your question is turtlebot_apps/turtlebot_navigation/costmap_common_params.yaml (as in @Pi Robot's comment too).
