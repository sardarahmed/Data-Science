Q:

Error with rosbag record

When I try to record any topic with rosbag, such as:
rosbag record /camera/depth/points

I get this error:
Error writing: Error opening file: 2012-07-06-11-13-31.bag.active

Possibly extraneous info: I'm running this on my laptop that is physically attached to my turtlebot and I know for a fact that the topics I'm trying to subscribe to are being published.

wow i feel silly. I was trying to do this in my ros workspace where apparently i don't have permissions. it worked perfectly in my home directory. Thanks allenh1!

Ok. This could be a couple things. You didn't finish a bag file, so fix the bag:
rosbag reindex 2012-07-06-11-13-31.bag.active

To take the bag file and make it record to a different name, try this:
rosbag record /camera/depth/points -O Camera.bag

The first command makes the bag file playable (the laptop probably shut down in the middle of a run).
The second one tells rosbag to record to a different file name.
This could also be a problem with your version of rosbag. Which rosbag are you using? Which OS? Ros version?
Or, you could be recording your bag file in a place you don't have write permissions. Try recording it in the home directory.
Hope this helps!
