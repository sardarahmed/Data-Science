If referring to any on-line tutorials or pages, please always include a link to those resources, as we cannot guess which one you are actually referring to, and it will make helping you much more difficult.
Also "it doesn't work" is not a good way to ask for help: what did happen?

A:

See Cartesian Paths section on the tutorial.
# You need to instantiate a Planning Group of your interest as `group`
waypoints.append(group.get_current_pose().pose)
