Q:

load mesh to rviz and "publish current scene" no effect MoveIt!

When I work with MoveIt!, instead of loading objects from the tabs in Rviz GUI, I loaded a mesh model into rviz using C++ code (visualization marker) and the loading was successful, I can see the object was there in Rviz. But after I clicked "publish current scene" the planning scene did not take into account the object in terms of collision detection and path planning. Could anyone shed light on how I can make sure the planning scene is aware of the loaded object? Thanks!

A:

RViz != MoveIt. There is no direct connection between RViz and MoveIt's internal models. A visualisation marker is just that, a marker for RViz.
To get objects registered in the Planning Scene, see fi ROS moveit programmatically adding collision object, the MoveIt Environment API examples or any of the messages on the moveit-users list.
