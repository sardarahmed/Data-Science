I'm trying to incorporate gazebo_ros_control plugin in my own urdf and starting by just putting a controller on a single joint. I keep getting the same error saying "cannont launch node of this type..."  ros-hydro-robot-state-publisher installed.  Did you find a solution to this?

A:

Do you have ros-hydro-robot-state-publisher installed?
If not, try
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-robot-state-publisher

When I tried to run the commanded, it gave me the following error.
E: Unable to locate package ros-hydro-robot-state-publisher
Is there a way to fix this issue?

You probably have to adapt to your version of ROS. For me, it is ros-melodic-robot-state-publisher. You should be able to find the right package name via apt-cache search robot-state-publisher.
