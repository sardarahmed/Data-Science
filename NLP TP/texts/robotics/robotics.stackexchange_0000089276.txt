Q:

Do local and remote machines have to run the same version of ROS?

I just installed Ubuntu 18.04, and with it ROS Melodic Morenia on my workstation.  I have a Raspberry Pi based bobot running Lubuntu 16.04 with ROS Kinetic Kame.  Will these machines be able to communicate, or will I have to try and upgrade the Pi to 18.04 with Melodic too ?
I have already tried to make this work.  The workstation sees topics being published on the Pi. However I see a raspicam_node on the Pi publishing at 10 hz on the Pi.  When I check the rate of raspicam_node, on the workstation, rostopic says that no messages have been published. I need to determine if this is because the versions of ROS are incompatible, or if I am doing something else wrong.

A:

As long as the specific messages have not been changed between the two ROS distributions it should be work fine maybe your ip address didn't set correctly

Yes , from my experience , it works fairly well across different variants .

I remember having huge problems with some marker messages when I was using a combo ROS Kinetic + ROS Indigo. I would highly recommend sticking to the same distro if possible
