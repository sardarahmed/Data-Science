Q:

how to create world frame!

Hi all,
I've worked on simulated husky with simulated kinect to create a customize 3d occupancy map, i want to transform the pointcloud frame to map or world frame, but i don't have these frames, just i can translate to odom frame, for creating 3d occupancy map, is it enough or i should add a link in my urdf or any thing else to create world frame ?!
Thank you.

How could you do it?

A:

The easiest way would be to use static_transform_publisher to add a link between your Kinect frame and the simulated Husky base_link. That represents the physical link between the Husky and the sensor.
