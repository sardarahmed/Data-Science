Q:

running images in a loop using roslaunch

I have few images which I wanted to run using roslaunch command. Unfortunately, the images doesn't loop itself.
Is there a way to loop images in ROS using roslaunch?

A:

Hi
You could write a node that publishes your images one after the other and then launch that node from a launch file.
To do that you can probably follow this tutorial and modify it to loop through your images.
I haven't tested any of this but I guess you would have to change   cv::Mat image = cv::imread(argv[1], CV_LOAD_IMAGE_COLOR);
to something like :
  cv::Mat image1 = cv::imread(path/to/image1, CV_LOAD_IMAGE_COLOR);
 cv::Mat image2 = cv::imread(path/to/image2, CV_LOAD_IMAGE_COLOR);
 cv::Mat image3 = cv::imread(path/to/image3, CV_LOAD_IMAGE_COLOR);
and then change msg at a regular time interval in the loop
