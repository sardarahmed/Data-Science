Q:

About Husky UGV Connection

Somehow a Husky UGV came into the lab without any sensors or onboard PC.
Fortunately, there is a laptop with ROS2 Humble installed and a PS4 controller.
Q1. What do I need to do to act as an Onboard PC connecting a laptop with ROS2 Humble installed between the robot and the controller?
Q2. What do I do to connect a laptop and a robot, then connect a PS4 controller for wireless control?

A:

I agree with @Russ76 that you should get in touch with clearpath about this, but I would point out that Clearpath does a pretty good job of documenting their platforms and open-sourcing code. For example, here's code for the Husky on GitHub, and here's the user manual.
I would contact clearpath first to make sure they've given you everything you ordered, but if they have: I would install ROS to some laptop or SBC, then load the Husky packages onto that device (just like any other ROS package).
