Q:

Combining JointState messages from several topics

Hello everyone,
I am using ptu46 driver. It publishes pan and tilt joints to the /ptu/state topic using sensor_msgs/JointState. There are other nodes in my system that publish joint states to /joint_states topic. I want robot_state_publisher to listen to both /joint_states and /ptu/state topics and publish a transform tree. The reason I don't want the PTU driver to publish to /joint_states directly is that there is an action server node that listens to /ptu/state and allows controlling the PTU. Is there a way to get around this problem?

A:

Ok, I have found a solution. You can aggregate JointState messages from several topics into a single /joint_states topic using the source list parameter of joint_state_publisher. You have to make sure that your urdf model has the joint names corresponding to those published in your JointState sources.
