Q:

Can the nmea drivers be used with kinetic?

When I try to run the nmea_navsat_driver project on Kinetic (on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS), I get the following error:
$ rosrun nmea_navsat_driver nmea_serial_driver _port:=/dev/ttyUSB0 _baud:=4800
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "/home/feitew/catkin_ws/src/nmea_navsat_driver/scripts/nmea_serial_driver", line 39, in <module>
    import libnmea_navsat_driver.driver

ImportError: No module named libnmea_navsat_driver.driver

Is there any change I can make to fix this, or do I have to switch to Indigo?

Can you tell us how you installed the package? How did you setup your workspace, etc?

I installed ROS with
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-desktop-full
Basically, I just followed all of the instructions here:

And how did you add nmea_navsat_driver to your workspace? Did you only clone the repository? Then what?

I cloned it from https://github.com/ros-drivers/nmea_navsat_driver into the src folder of my catkin workspace, then ran catkin make.

Two things:

you might want to run a rosdep install --from-paths ~/catkin_ws/src --ignore-src, then run catkin_make again
did you also do a source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash after catkin_make was finished?

Thanks! That fixed part of the problem. The command runs now, but it's telling me I don't have permission to access the usb port with my gps. It works fine with picocom, but with the command above, I get
[Errno 13] Permission denied: '/dev/ttyUSB0'

A:

ImportError: No module named libnmea_navsat_driver.driver

You either haven't installed all of the prerequisites of the package, or you've forgotten to source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash after catkin_make was finished.
Would still be nice if you could tell us how you setup your workspace: without sourceing setup.bash, rosrun should not have been able to find the nmea_navsat_driver package. So I'm curious as to what you did.

That sounds like a different problem, so it would be best if you open a new question for that. Make sure to search first, as permission problems with (serial) ports are a common topic.
