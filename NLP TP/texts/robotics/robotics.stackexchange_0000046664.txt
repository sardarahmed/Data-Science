Q:

RGBDSLAM error: Trust certificate g2o problem

Hey guys,
I am using ubuntu 12.04 and ros fuerte. I am trying to run rgbdslam.
I followed the instructions given in this post link text: and I got the following error:
svn --non-interactive --config-dir /home/samme/trunk/g2o/svnconf co https://svn.openslam.org/data/svn/g2o/trunk build/g2o svn: OPTIONS of 'https://svn.openslam.org/data/svn/g2o/trunk': Server certificate verification failed: issuer is not trusted (https://svn.openslam.org)
Note: I had previously downloaded g2o from the svn: https://openslam.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/data/svn/g2o/trunk/. I then moved the file trunk to the rubbish bin and downloaded g2o again from the svn : https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/vslam/trunk/
I have been told to add the line: SVN_CMDLINE = svn--trust-server-cert--non-interactive --config-dir $(TOP_DIR)/svnconf to the makefile in the g2o folder.
However I am now getting this error:
svn--trust-server-cert--non-interactive --config-dir /home/samme/trunk/g2o/svnconf co  https://svn.openslam.org/data/svn/g2o/trunk build/g2o
make: svn--trust-server-cert--non-interactive: Command not found
Am I doing the command correctly? I really appreciate your help.
Regards,
Khalid

I resolved this issue (the answer below), I have another problem, I will post it on a new thread.

A:

The solution to this problem is adding this line: SVN_CMDLINE = svn --no-auth-cache --trust-server-cert --non-interactive instead of the one I mentioned earlier.

The author commented the wrong one I think. We encountered the same prob yesterday.

This does not work for me. The line is already in the Makefile.
