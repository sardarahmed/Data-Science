Q:

where I can fins a tutorial on Feurte-catkin 0.4.6?

A tutorial link given on ROS wiki for Feurte-catkin but its not that way good as it is for Groovy-catkin.
Please suggest a good tutorial on Feurte-catkin.

A:

It's in the API link on the wiki page, but you have to select Fuerte first.

Dear Sir,Thank you. Just trying the same with little extra effort, hope will come. Don't you think this tutorial is not an easy going stuff for a beginner like me, relatively the catkin groovy tutorial is relatively good. However catkin groovy has a lot of changes so that does not works for fuerte.

I agree that it is very difficult. None of the catkin docs are "beginner", in my opinion. Once you upgrade to more recent ROS versions, I suggest looking at catkin_simple. It's much easier to understand. Consider using rosbuild with Fuerte and waiting until Groovy or Hydro for catkin.

Thanking you again. In fact I started Groovy first and started leaning catkin along with implementation of other packages for turtlebot. Unfortunately I had to shift back on Fuerte as Simulator_Gazebo is not available for Groovy, it will be launched with Hydro now. Thanking again for moral booting.

Groovy includes simulator_gazebo-1.7.12. That version still uses rosbuild, so catkin packages may not depend on it. I expect a catkin version to be released with Hydro.

I think I need to try it once more, hope it will come good to me. I wish to give you good news regarding that. Thank you.
