Q:

rviz qt creator gui

Hi all
I have a question.
I would like to develop a GUI. I want this GUI to interact with a robot running the navigation stack, further I would like to insert this GUI in RVIZ so I can have just a single GUI to deal with.
Can some body tell me the best way to tackle this issue.
I know that I can use qt-creator and CMakelist. I can also use ros-qt, which one would be the best and how can they be integrated in RVIZ.
By the way, I am running ros groovy.
In advance thank you for your help

A:

Personally I use the quick and useful rqt_gui from rqt, you can integrate RVIZ in rqt_gui by choosing it from the plugins menu but you will have less viewing area if you have other plugins running, one way to solve that would be to close all RVIZ panels except Tools and Time
I've never used qt-creator so I can't comment on which might be better, hope that helps

Hi,  thanx, ok, sounds interesting, my question now is how to create a GUI based on rqt_gui and then exported or build a plugin

The tutorials are good: http://ros.org/wiki/rqt/Tutorials

Ok, thank you for the replay, the issue no is that if I need to create my GUI first and then the plugin will call it and then I can visualise it in RVIZ

Well, I suspect that if you do the tutorials and understand that code you will be able to answer your question. If you are not familiar with QT maybe you have to read up on that before also.

ok, in a few words, I need to create my GUI based on QT, and then create the plugin so it can be visualised by rqt, rigt?

I guess I need to create a QWidget-based GUI, what kind of environment you may recommend to create it?
Comment by TommyP on 2013-08-21:
I use Emacs to write code to create an GUI. Or maybe I use QT Designer to graphically design how the UI should look and then write code to implement the GUI. All this is explained in the tutorials. Maybe you should read them and try to understand them.

I have been through the tutorial, I have to run the python example and I get the fowlloing error: PluginManager._load_plugin() could not load plugin "rqt_mypkg/My Plugin":  do you have a clue? thanks.

Moreover, could you tell a bit the .ui file? what is that for? and how to create it, thank you?
Comment by TommyP on 2013-08-22:
Had you declared the xml plugin file in package.xml? I use QT Designer to create an ui file. I start it with "designer quad.ui".
Comment by acp on 2013-08-22:
I have declared it like this  <rqt_gui plugin="${prefix}/plugin.xml"/>

Hi, I manage to solve the problem, it was the .ui file, I had and I changed to . Because I created the gui with qt designer.
Now my next issue is to connect a click event in the rqt gui with some ros application. For instance, if I click a PushButtom I want to start the navigation satck. And if I click another Pushbutton I want to control the robot with a joystick etc. In advance thank you :)
