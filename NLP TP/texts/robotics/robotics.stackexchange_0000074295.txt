Q:

error when install usb_cam

Hi,
I am installing usb_cam and get this error:
CMake Error at /opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:75 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "camera_info_manager" with any of the following names:

    camera_info_managerConfig.cmake
    camera_info_manager-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "camera_info_manager" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "camera_info_manager_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "camera_info_manager" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  usb_cam/CMakeLists.txt:7 (find_package)

Please let me know how to fix this.

I'm going to take a guess and suggest that you only git cloned the repository for usb_cam, and forgot to run a rosdep install --from-paths /path/to/your/catkin_ws/src --ignore-src. That would mean that all of the prerequisites of usb_cam haven't been installed, and CMake can't find them, causing it to show you error message you copy/pasted.
If you don't want or need to build usb_cam from source, I'd really recommend you just run the appropriate sudo apt-get install ros-$DISTRO-usb-cam.

Edit: rosdep install is really not mean to install packages themselves, that is what apt-get is for. It's only meant to install dependencies of the packages. I see a lot of questions about people seemingly trying to use it as a replacement for apt-get (or whatever the package manager is called for your specific platform).
