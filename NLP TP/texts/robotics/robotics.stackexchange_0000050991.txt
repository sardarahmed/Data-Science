Q:

unclear instruction in groovy install from source

After finishing section 2.1 (Building Catkin Packages) and sourcing the catkin workspace section 2.2 (Build Rosbuild Packages) starts with mkdir ros_ws.
What I would like clarified is where to put the ros_ws directory. After finishing 2.1 the system is still in the ros_catkin_ws so to follow the instructions exactly will place the ros_ws inside the ros_catkin_ws.
So, should ros_ws be inside the ros_catkin_ws?

A:

Section 2.2 tells you to create it in your home folder, from the tutorial:
$ mkdir ~/ros_ws
$ cd ~/ros_ws
$ rosws init . ~/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated

I don't see the confusion, but the location of the ros_ws doesn't matter, though personally I would keep it separate from the catkin_ws as not to confuse them.

Thanks for the answer. This is what I suspected and I agree it should be kept separate from the catkin_ws and thus the question. I've reread the installation wiki (http://www.ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/Source) several times and I still don't see a reference to putting rosws in the home folder.
