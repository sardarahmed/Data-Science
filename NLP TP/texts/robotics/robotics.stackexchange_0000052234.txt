Q:

How do I get a valid NodeHandle in a rqt plugin

I need a NodeHandle in order to make my library work properly. I am also using this library in a rqt plugin. Should I just create a new Nodehandle (don't think that this is a good idea) or is there any API which gives me a valid NodeHandle.

A:

It seems like I can just instantiate a new NodeHandle. According to the  documentation there is no problem with that:

When a NodeHandle is constructed, it checks to see if the global node state has already been started. If so, it increments a global reference count. If not, it starts the node with ros::start() and sets the reference count to 1.

But still are there any better options and do I need to be aware of anything?
