Q:

stageros tf frame names

Is it possible to change the tf frame names from the stageros node?
I could use the tf_remap, but it is not  useful in this case because the default names are being used for other propose and I need to avoid collisions in the data sent to /tf

A:

It looks it is not implemented.
I directly implemented it and I have sent a pull request to the stage_ros git repository:
https://github.com/ros-simulation/stage_ros/pull/38
Applying this pull request it is directly possible to change the values of the frames through the local parameters called:
"odom_frame_id", "base_frame_id", "base_frame_footprint_id" and "base_laser_frame_id"
