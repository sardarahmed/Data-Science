Q:

rviz_cfg for hector_slam

roslaunch hector_slam_launch tutorial.launch points to an rviz_cfg folder in the hector_slam_launch folder, but no such folder or mapping_demo.rviz file exists after install of hector_slam. I've generated the mapping_demo.rviz file to match the older mapping_demo.cfg file (I just have this on my desktop for now) but I want to verify how to add the rviz_cfg directory to the hector_slam_launch folder along with the .rviz file under the new ROS Indigo format.
OR, is this even the correct protocol under Indigo?

A:

It looks like the rviz configs are present in the source version of hector_slam_launch, but aren't installed properly.
You should open a bug on the hector_slam repository about this.
