Q:

How to verify if motoROS was installed correctly

The motoman_driver tutorial left me hanging after these lines. How would I know if the pseudo-external signal is successful?

Rotate the pendant key-switch (upper left of pendant) fully counter-clockwise into TEACH mode. 

Upgrade your Security Level to MANAGEMENT
Using the pendant, select [In/OUT]â†’[PSEUDO INPUT SIG]
Set input #82015 CMD REMOTE SEL to ON
Rotate the pendant key-switch (upper left of pendant) fully clockwise into REMOTE mode.

Thanks! I'm referring to this page: http://wiki.ros.org/motoman_driver/Tutorials/indigo/InstallServer

You tagged this with HC10.
Please see Compatibility with collaborative robots (HC series). Afaik, MotoROS is as yet not compatible with the collaborative robots of Yaskawa.

I was hoping the next line implied it would work if the Power/Force-Limiting features were disabled:
The MotoROS application can be installed, but only after disabling the collaborative features

It's fine if it won't work, but we would rather use ROS  ;)

Yes, that is stated in that section, but last time I spoke to @millete he said it was not supported at all at the moment.
Perhaps he can clarify.
Edit: and we should update the docs.

I got a strong no on HC10 compatability from Motoman. Will edit the docs.

Your actual question has of course still not been addressed.
Perhaps @millete can answer that one as well :)

HC10 is not compatible today. But we have a team actively working on it now.

A:

You will know if the Pseudo Input has been activated if the circle next to the description has a solid dark-blue fill. If the signal if off, then the there will be dark-blue outline with a light-blue fill.

Programmatically, you would be able to determine this when you send motion commands to the robot. If this signal has not been enabled, then the robot will reply with a result of ROS_RESULT_NOT_READY and a subcode of ROS_RESULT_NOT_READY_NOT_REMOTE. Though, this reply code could also indicate that the mode-selector-switch on the pendant has not been rotated fully clockwise into REMOTE mode.
