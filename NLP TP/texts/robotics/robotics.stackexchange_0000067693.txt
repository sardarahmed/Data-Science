Q:

Problem Installing Ros Indigo on Ubuntu 14.04.2

Distributor ID: Ubuntu
Description:    Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS
Release:    14.04
Codename:   trusty
Here is the error message that I have:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
ros-indigo-desktop-full : Depends: ros-indigo-desktop but it is not going to be installed
Depends: ros-indigo-perception but it is not going to be installed
Depends: ros-indigo-simulators but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
This is what I get when I explore each of these dependency issues
ros-indigo-cpp-common : Depends: libconsole-bridge0.2 but it is not installable
Depends: libboost-all-dev but it is not installable
Depends: libconsole-bridge-dev but it is not installable

A:

As mentioned in ROS Installation Guide for Ubuntu, you need to install some dependencies manually for 14.04.2 . Quoting from the page:

If you are using Ubuntu Trusty 14.04.2 and experience dependency issues during the ROS installation, you may have to install some additional system dependencies. (Do not install these packages if you are using 14.04, it will destroy your X server)

sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-dev-lts-utopic mesa-common-dev-lts-utopic libxatracker-dev-lts-utopic libopenvg1-mesa-dev-lts-utopic libgles2-mesa-dev-lts-utopic libgles1-mesa-dev-lts-utopic libgl1-mesa-dev-lts-utopic libgbm-dev-lts-utopic libegl1-mesa-dev-lts-utopic

Alternatively, try installing just this to fix dependency issues: (Do not install the above packages if you are using 14.04, it will destroy your X server)

sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev-lts-utopic

For more information on this issue see this answers.ros.org thread or this launchpad issue

When trying to do this, terminal prints out that each of the packages could not be found.
Why does't it find them?

I'm using 14.04.5 and this doesn't work. It gives me similar "but it is not going to be installed" errors.
