Q:

ROS 2: Message Filters (e.g. exact time)

Potentially looking to move to ROS 2.0 for python 3 support in a new project.
Question I can't seem to find an answer too, is the feature of sync'ing messages working in ROS 2.0 yet? Is there an example of how to do this somewhere? Or another option of achieving the same function?
Rely on the message sync'ing pretty heavily for collating all our sensor data, without that ability upgrading to ROS 2.0 seems like a non-starter.
