Q:

benchmarking between SLAM alghoritms

Hello,
I'm trying to make a benchmark between GMAPPING and Cartographer SLAM alghoritms.
I have made 2D maps with gmapping and cartographer on ROS kinetic.(occupancy grid map format , i have saved maps with map_saver)
I need a roadmap about how to compare maps. Also I have to make a ground-truth map and compare the maps against this ground truth map.
My questions;

How can I make a ground truth map, which tools can be used?
How can I compare pgm files(maps) I know that first I have to allign my maps and then compare but how?

Thanks for your help.

A:

I know it's quite late to answer this but I recently did compare two results from two SLAM packages. For the comparison I used a Python package called evo that is meant to be used to compare odometry and SLAM.
I have described my full workflow in this post but in short it consists of the following steps:

Record a bag file while the robot is moving around space
Replay the data while running slam packages of your choice, record these as bag files again
Run a script that will convert the logged tf to a message supported by evo on every bag file
Merge two bag files

What I was missing in my experiments is groundtruth but if you have this information you will easily be able to add it.
