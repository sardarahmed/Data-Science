Q:

CMake gazebo package not found when installing from source

Hi,
After installing gazebo 3.0 from source (the installation path being my local home folder) the pkg_check_modules(GAZEBO gazebo) command from CMake does not find the gazebo package:
-- checking for module 'gazebo'
--   package 'gazebo' not found

As a workaround I added the absolute path for GAZEBO_INCLUDE_DIRS and GAZEBO_LIBRARY_DIRS in the CMakeLists.txt :
 set(GAZEBO_INCLUDE_DIRS /home/<path>/include/gazebo-3.0;/usr/include/sdformat-2.0)
 set(GAZEBO_LIBRARY_DIRS /home/<path>/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu)

Any way to fix this, or is it a bug?
Thanks,
Andrei

A:

If it is not strictly necessary to use pkg_check_modules, you can try with
find_package(gazebo REQUIRED)

That for me works perfectly with gazebo 3.0 installed from source.
