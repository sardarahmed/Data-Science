Q:

roscd can't find packages

hi ,
i'm using ros indigo and suddenly after reboot my pc i can't run some package , for example when i try to type :
"roscd turtle "  and use the tab touch keyboard it gives only these packages
 turtle_actionlib/        turtlebot_description/   turtle_tf/
turtlebot_capabilities/  turtlesim/               turtle_tf2/

so why it can't  detect turtlbot_teleop and other packages ?

Have you tried rospack find turtlebot_teleop ? If rospack can't find it, then it must've been deleted if you did a apt-get autoremove.

A:

Have you tried sourcing the setup file again? This must be done for every fresh console.
Do
cd ~/path/to/your/catkin_workspace
source devel/setup.bash
