Q:

How do you run rosbag2 in ROS2 Crystal?

I'm running ROS2 Crystal on Ubuntu 18.04.  I've installed the ros-crystal-rosbag2 package, but am not sure how to run it.  From the Github readme it looks like this should add a verb to the ROS2 command, but when I run:
ros2 bag record -a

I get the following error:
usage: ros2 [-h] Call `ros2 <command> -h` for more detailed usage. ...
ros2: error: argument Call `ros2 <command> -h` for more detailed usage.: invalid choice: 'bag' (choose from 'daemon', 'extension_points', 'extensions', 'launch', 'lifecycle', 'msg', 'multicast', 'node', 'param', 'pkg', 'run', 'service', 'srv', 'topic')

How do I run rosbag2 in Crystal?
Thanks,
David

A:

Please make sure to follow the debian instructions correctly:
https://github.com/ros2/rosbag2#debian-packages
So in particular, the package you installed does only support the API for rosbag2. The actual command line verb gets added by ros-crystal-ros2bag.

Thanks.  That fixed it.  Having a ros2bag and rosbag2 package is somewhat confusing.  Is there any documentation on the difference in the two?
