Q:

how to increase real time factor while doing simulation

When I load an empty world in gazebo,the real time factor is close to 1,but if I load a pr2 model in the gazebo environment,the value of it decrease to 0.2.How to increase the value of real time factor when doing simulation with pr2?
I tried modifying the physics link in the wrold file,but it didn't help...

A:

On the left panel, go to the World Tab and click on Physics. Then change the real time update rate to 0. This will make gazebo run as fast as possible.

Thank you for your answerï¼Œthis solution works well in some situation.My problem seems to be related to the hardware configuration of my computer,so that after I modified the physics tag,the robot still move slow in the gazebo.

FYI as fast as possible does not mean faster than real time. If your model is too complicated, or your computer doesn't have enough resources, gazebo might still run slower than real time.
