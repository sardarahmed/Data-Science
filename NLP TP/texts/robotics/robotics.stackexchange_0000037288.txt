Q:

Cloud values are not loaded

My code snippet in order to build a point cloud as below:
static tf::TransformBroadcaster tfb;
tf::Transform xform;
xform.setOrigin(tf::Vector3(pose3D_LD2.pose.position.x, pose3D_LD2.pose.position.y, pose3D_LD2.pose.position.z));
xform.setRotation(tf::Quaternion(previous_poseLD_.pose.orientation.x, previous_poseLD_.pose.orientation.y, previous_poseLD_.pose.orientation.z, previous_poseLD_.pose.orientation.w));
tfb.sendTransform(tf::StampedTransform(xform, ros::Time(pose3D_LD2.header.stamp), "base_link", "laser"));
tfListener_.waitForTransform("base_link", "laser", previous_scan_.header.stamp, ros::Duration(2.0));
projector_.transformLaserScanToPointCloud("base_link", previous_scan_, cloud, tfListener_);

It neither gives error and nor emits warning messages. However, when I run "rostopic echo /cloud" it gives the following information:
header: 
  seq: 198
  stamp: 
    secs: 0
    nsecs: 0
  frame_id: cloud
points: []
channels: []
---
header: 
  seq: 199
  stamp: 
    secs: 0
    nsecs: 0
  frame_id: cloud
points: []
channels: []
---
header: 
  seq: 200
  stamp: 
    secs: 0
    nsecs: 0
  frame_id: cloud
points: []
channels: []
---
header: 
  seq: 201
  stamp: 
    secs: 0
    nsecs: 0
  frame_id: cloud
points: []
channels: []
---

It seems that the point cloud is not successfully configured. Apparently, when running the rviz, it complaints that "no messages received".
Any remedy for this weird behavior?
Thanks in advance.

It's just solved! Thanks anyway.

Does the incoming LaserScan have any messages coming in?
