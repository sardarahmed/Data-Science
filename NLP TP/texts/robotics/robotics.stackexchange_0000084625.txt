Q:

catkin_make install and dynamic_reconfigure issue

Hello,
I am getting this weird behavior under ROS Indigo:

I am using dynamic_reconfigure: e.g. cfg/Node.cfg
In CMakelists I am calling generate_dynamic_reconfigure_options()
Files are generated nicely, e.g. NodeConfig.h
catkin_make works
Node works in general
However when I do: catkin_make install I get an error that the file NodeConfigConfig.h is missing. So for some reason it adds another Config string to the generated header and naturally it cannot find it. Weird.

Any ideas what can been happening? I not getting this in other packages. And I don't know how to debug this...

Yes this was it. Name file and .cfg parameter name missmatch. Nasty error! Thanks!
