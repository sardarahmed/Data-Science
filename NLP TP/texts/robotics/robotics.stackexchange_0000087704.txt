Q:

install ros-melodic-desktop-full error

I did 1.2 Setup you sources.list, then
I did 1.3 Set up your keys, then
I did Installation. All seemed like it was going well.
Then i entered the command
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-desktop-full.

I don't get far:
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-melodic-desktop-full.

Now I'm sad. I've had ros kenetic on my system working well. But I don't know what to do.
Remove ROS again? And try adding pixie dust or water from the river jordan?
If I can not fix this I may go back to loading ROS kenetic, which was a successful install.

A:

No need for pixie dust or anything else. You're trying to install Melodic onto an unsupported platform. It's targeted for 18.04. See http://wiki.ros.org/melodic#Platforms
