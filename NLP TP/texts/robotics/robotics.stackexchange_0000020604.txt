Q:

EKF sensor fusion

What is the standard way to fuse multiple sensor measurements in an EKF framework?
Say you have Odometry, IMU and some form of Lidar which can produce landmarks. 
EKF is normally presented as a prediction/correction framework after each action but it's not clear how 3+ sensor sources can be integrated.  

A:

An EKF or any of the variants of the Kalman filter, as you said mainly works in two steps: prediction and correction. The prediction steps gives you a state estimate based on your process model and the correction step updates your state estimate based on the current measurement. If you have multiple measurements from more than one sensor, you would just update the state as you would in the correction step whenever a new measurement is available. The only difference is that your measurement model would change depending on which sensor is giving you the measurement. If your sensors give you data at different rates then you would do something like: prediction, correction1, prediction, correction2 ... and so on, where correction 1 and correction 2 are based on measurements from sensor 1 and sensor 2 respectively.
