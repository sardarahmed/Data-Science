Q:

robot_pose_ekf pubs on robot_pose_ekf/odom but not on robot_pose_ekf/odom_combined

I am supplying odometry and Imu data to robot_pose_ekf and it is publishing the transform to base_footprint and the topic robot_pose_ekf/odom correctly.  It advertises the topic robot_pose_ekf/odom_combined but rostopic echo shows that nothing is being published on that topic.  So I am concerned that it is just using the odometry data sent to it and ignoring the Imu data.
The documentation:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/robot_pose_ekf
says it should just be publishing the transform and robot_pose_ekf/odom_combined, not mentioning the topic robot_pose_ekf/odom.
So, what's up?  Is the topic robot_pose_ekf/odum what was previously the topic robot_pose_EKF/odom_combined?  Or do I need to debug some more to determine why the combined topic is not getting data published?

A:

Answered.  It is because I used the example launch file from the wiki page.  In that launch file, the parameter "output_frame" is set to value = "odom"
The odom_estimation_node.cpp file uses that parameter to determine the topic advertised, with the default being "odom_combined"
I found it confusing because I was thinking that "output frame" would refer to the tf frame not the published topic name.

You're right, it is confusing. The parameter output_frame refers to both the tf frame and the name of the published topic.
