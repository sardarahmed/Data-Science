Q:

How do I install a particular version of ros-melodic-franka-ros

Hello,
I'm using Ubuntu 18.04 for implementing robot(franka emika panda) with custom controller.
I was away for a week, but the controller I used was not running well, so I checked the problem.
Compared to other working computers, it seems that there was a problem with the update of "franka-ros" to the latest version.
So, I tried to install the previous version(0.7.1-1bionic.20210304.174422) of franka-ros with following command

sudo apt install ros-melodic-franka-ros=0.7.1-1bionic.20210304.174422

Then, the results is as follows.

E: Unable to locate package ros-melodic-frank-ros-0.7.1-1bionic.20210304.174422

I already added 'http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main' in '/etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'.
by following commands

sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'

sudo apt-key adv --keyserver 'hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80' --recv-key C1CF6E31E6BADE8868B172B4F42ED6FBAB17C654

sudo apt update

I was wondering if there was a way to install an older version of "ros-melodic-franka-ros"
Thanks

A:

You'd have to build it from source, in your workspace. The ROS package repositories do not retain older versions of released packages. That's a limitation of the apt repository backend.

Thank you for help, I solved it through "https://frankaemika.github.io/docs/installation_linux" as you said
Actually, I did it before, but I missed to change command 'kinetic' to 'melodic'
