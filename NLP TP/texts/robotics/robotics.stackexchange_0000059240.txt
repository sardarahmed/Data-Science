A:

It means exactly what it says: it tried to open a connection to github.com to download the default sources.list, and failed.
I would start troubleshooting by confirming that your machine has internet connectivity and can ping github.com. You can also try visiting that url directly or trying to fetch it with curl or wget.
If you're only have problems connecting to github, you can always check their status page to see if their servers are having problems.
