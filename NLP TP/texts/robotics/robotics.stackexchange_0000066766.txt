Q:

NVIDIA Jetson TK1 Board and rviz indigo

Hi
Has Anyone tested rviz in NVIDIA Jetson Board?
We are looking the most lightweight and compact hardware that allows run rviz in a properly way.
We have focused in this hardware, which has a NVIDIA GPU,  because I have read threads here that it suggests the use of NVIDIA GPU to avoid problems with rviz.
Best regard.

Hi jaghvi,
In fact we donÂ´t have the board. We were waiting any user experience about this one.
I see that you have some problems. If you fix the problem please let me know.
Best regards

@jaghvi: if you need help, please ask a new question instead of posting an answer.

A:

We've got rviz running on a Jetson TK1, but found issues with the version of libpcre (which libogre depends on) that Ubuntu Trusty ships with. We ended up installing libpcre 1:8.35 from Utopic.
