Q:

Additional topics in ROS kinetic

I use the rostopic command on my ROS and get the following output:

had@had-HP-Pavilion-Laptop-15-cs0xxx:~$ rostopic list
/rosout
/rosout_agg

I'm looking at a tutorial and they also use "rostopic list" but there are more topics in it:

/gazebo/set_model_state
/initialpose
/joint_state
/map
/map_metadata
/mobile_base/commands/velocity
/mobile_base_nodelet_manager/bond
/move_base_simple/goal
/odom
/rosout
/rosout_agg
/slam_gmapping/entropy
/tf
/tf_static
etc...
=> So please tell me if I am missing something and if so, how should I add those topics?

A:

They must be launching few other nodes and then using the rostopic list command.
