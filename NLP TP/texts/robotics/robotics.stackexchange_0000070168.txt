Q:

Is it possible to have a header file for a node?

I'm writing a ROS node in C++. I wanted to know if it's possible to have a .h file (in addition to the .cpp file that includes the node's code) for it.  The .h file includes just a bunch of other #include-s, a typedef command, and the declaration of all the functions used by the node.
This way the .cpp file only has an #include for its .h file.
So, is it possible to do that? And what do I need to add to my CMakeLists.txt to make it compile?

A:

Yes this is possible. You use roscpp, so you can use all aspects of C++.
In your CMakeLists.txt you have to make sure that your include directory is listed in the include_directories section.

and that's it? no need to explicitly add the .h file in the add_executable section (or is that just a wrong way to add .h files anyway?)

No that's it. The compiler will search it's include path for the include files.
