Q:

Can you launch non-ROS programs from a .launch file?

My workflow requires launching ROS nodes as well as other programs. This results in the "many terminal" problem :) Is there a way to launch these non-ROS executables from a launch file, too?

#q272267 has an answer similar to both of these but with more details.

A:

roslaunch might add extra parameters like __name and __log.
The non-ros executable should be able to handle those (by ignoring)
