Q:

Ros::Timer, will stopping it with .stop() cause its counter to restart?

Hello,
If I declare a basic timer like this:
ros::Timer my_timer = nh.createTimer(ros::Duration(1), callback);

And then I stop it like this (say, 0.5 seconds later):
my_timer.stop();

And then I start it again like this:
my_timer.start();

Will the timer start again at the beginning of its counter (0 sec), or will it start up from where it left off (0.5 sec)?
Thanks!

A:

The timer will start again at the beginning. The stop() method cancels all pending callbacks and lets the timer forget about the time that has already elapsed.
