Q:

Is there any GUI based builder for URDF?

My question is, I am a novice in ROS. I find the URDF builder by way of manually entering x, y and z values cumbersome. Is there any GUI builder - drag and drop where we concentrate on building the robot model visually faster? Any pointers to links where they explain how to specify x,y and z values easier?

You can use solidworks or any other software for developing your Robot and then you can change this into URDF

Thank you. Editing the URDF file manually each time and then running it is so time consuming. I found the following link, which allows at least a web based interface to quickly edit and model your robot.

That's amazing tool on online but if you not know how to create URDF how will you use this ?

Thanks. I understand the basics of URDF, what I find cumbersome is that the alignment of each of the links of the robots and links is time consuming and I am not getting any logic how to place for e.x, 1 box shape above another shape. If you know any tutorial which helps get a hang of it, let me kno
