Could you tell us what you've already found and tried yourself?
We're here to help, but not to do (all) of the work for you.

A:

You can use a RViz marker for that, take a look:  http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/DisplayTypes/Marker#View-Oriented_Text_.28TEXT_VIEW_FACING.3D9.29_.5B1.1.2B-.5D
And here a publisher example: http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/DisplayTypes/Marker#The_Marker_Message
