Q:

cakin_make returns the error '/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lRTIMULib'

I'm attempting to catkin_make the imu package from this link
But I'm getting the error:
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lRTIMULib

From as far as I can tell the library is include and linked in the CMake.txt
Does the location of the library file matter? It's currently in ~/catkin_ws/src/i2c_imu-master/src
Thanks for any help, the CMake.txt is as follows:
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)
project(i2c_imu)

find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
  sensor_msgs
  roscpp
  tf
  angles
)

find_library(RTIMULib libRTIMULib.so)
message(STATUS "RTIMULib: ${RTIMULib }")

catkin_package(
CATKIN_DEPENDS sensor_msgs roscpp tf angles
)

include_directories(
${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS}
)

add_executable(i2c_imu_node src/i2c_imu_node.cpp)

target_link_libraries(i2c_imu_node
RTIMULib
${catkin_LIBRARIES}
)

EDIT:
The output of catkin_make after adding message(STATUS "RTIMULib: ${RTIMULib }") after find_library(RTIMULib ..): in the CMakeList.txt.

Can you add the following line to the CMakeLists.txt and add whatever gets printed to your OP? Add this after find_library(RTIMULib ..):
message(STATUS "RTIMULib: ${RTIMULib}")

Thanks for your reply! The question has been updated with the information you asked for
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-02-19:
You have a space in there after the variable name. CMake might not like that.
And as @ahendrix writes: you probably need to install the library. The message(STATUS ..) was just to see whether the library is actually found or not.

A:

It looks like that ROS package is just a wrapper for an IMU library, RTIMULib2. You should probably install that library.
