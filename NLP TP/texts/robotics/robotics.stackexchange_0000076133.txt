A:

As stated on the Electric Install page for Ubuntu, the apt packages for ROS Electric was only supported on Ubuntu 10.04, 10.10, 11.04 and 11.10.
ROS Electric is no longer supported, so there are no updates or bug fixes for it.
You should probably install a newer version of ROS, or if you really need Electric you can try to build it from source or install a compatible version of Ubuntu.
