Q:

rqt_gui shows no menu bar on Mac OSX

I'm expecting file, plugin and other menus like this:

I followed Homebrew source installation. Versions are:
rosuser-mac1:src nrosuser$ cat .rosinstall|grep rqt_gui
- tar: {local-name: rqt_gui, uri: 'https://github.com/ros-gbp/rqt-release/archive/release/rqt_gui/0.2.8.tar.gz', version: rqt-release-release-rqt_gui-0.2.8}
rosuser-mac1:src nrosuser$ cat .rosinstall|grep qt_gui_core
- tar: {local-name: qt_gui_core, uri: 'https://github.com/ros-gbp/qt_gui_core-release/archive/release/qt_gui_core/0.2.12.tar.gz', version: qt_gui_core-release-release-qt_gui_core-0.2.12}

(I'm still figuring out what's the best way to get the version in use on OSX.)
OSX 10.8.2, ROS Groovy
Any idea? Thank you.

A:

It's a bug. I fixed it two months ago, but qt_gui_core has not been released since then:
