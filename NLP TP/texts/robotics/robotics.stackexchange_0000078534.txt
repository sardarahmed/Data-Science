Q:

*.cfg: permission denied while building workspace

I am making a custom robot for my final year project, for the robot to work, I was given a custom catkin_ws file.
I followed the steps mention here
http://answers.ros.org/question/193901/how-to-migrate-a-catkin-workspace/
and after following the steps, this occurred.

I am only a beginner but the -j4 usually means use 4 cores  on the processor.  Could you try changing -j4 to -j1
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-01-24:
I've updated the title of your question to better reflect what is the problem (and to also differentiate it a bit from the million other "make -j4 -l4 failed" questions.

A:

/home/ros/catkin_ws/build/rbx1/rbx1_nav/setup_custom_pythonpath.sh: 4: exec: /home/ros/catkin_ws/src/rbx1/rbx1_nav/cfg/CalibrateAngular.cfg: Permission denied

...
/home/ros/catkin_ws/build/urg_node/setup_custom_pythonpath.sh: 4: exec: /home/ros/catkin_ws/src/urg_node/cfg/URG.cfg: Permission denied

have you extracted these files from a zip file, or copied them from a usb stick or Windows share?
Those .cfg files (they are files for dynamic_reconfigure) should have their executable bit set, and they currently probably don't have it, that's why you get the Permission denied errors.
Try and see what the output is of:
ls -al /home/ros/catkin_ws/src/rbx1/rbx1_nav/cfg/CalibrateAngular.cfg

and:
ls -al /home/ros/catkin_ws/src/urg_node/cfg/URG.cfg

If it doesn't include the x bit for both you and other users, then do a:
chmod +x /home/ros/catkin_ws/src/rbx1/rbx1_nav/cfg/CalibrateAngular.cfg

and:
chmod +x /home/ros/catkin_ws/src/urg_node/cfg/URG.cfg

and try again.

PS:

[..] I was given a custom catkin_ws file.

Pedantic perhaps, but note that 'catkin_ws' is typically a directory, not a single file.
