Q:

can't locate node [naoqi_joint_states_cpp]

Hello,
we are trying to run nao_driver on our remote machine, connecting to your real Nao with :
NAO_IP=192.168.1.10 roslaunch nao_driver nao_driver.launch   ( as said in http://wiki.ros.org/naoqi_driver)
but we get :
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [naoqi_driver/naoqi_joint_states_cpp]: can't locate node [naoqi_joint_states_cpp] in package [naoqi_driver]
we tried to update/upgrade but nothing changed. We are working under indigo and naoqi1.14 and we setup the PYTHONPATH to the pynaoqi path.
What can I try ?

A:

Hi,
naoqi_joint_state_cpp is a c++ node. So changing your PYTHONPATH won't help you in this matter.
You should add an environment variable AL_DIR and link it to the folder of the naoqi c++ SDK.
Otherwise when you run catkin_make you should have the following error message :
-- +++ processing catkin package: 'naoqi_driver'
-- ==> add_subdirectory(naoqi_bridge/naoqi_driver)
-- Using these message generators: gencpp;genlisp;genpy
-- Could not find NAOqi's alcommon
-- Could not find NAOqi's alvision
-- Could not find NAOqi's alproxies
-- Could not find NAOqi's alerror
-- Could not find NAOqi's alvalue
-- Cannot find NAOqi C++ sdk; C++ nodes will NOT be built
This means that the naoqi_joint_states_cpp node won't be built.
Hope this helps,
Cheers,
Mikael
