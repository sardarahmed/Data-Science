Q:

How can i show on my browser what i see on Rviz?

Im on ROS2-Humble and i want to see my robot's location and movement on the map, the way i see it on Rviz, on my browser.
 Like the picture above, I want from Rviz to get the Grid, RobotModel, TF, and Map, send it on my browser and show it there, kinda like streaming it or rendering it via a .js file and .html.
Im new with ROS2 and i cant seem to find any sources to help me. Most of the things i find are for ROS1 and Chat GPT doesnt help at all.
Basically something like this: https://answers.ros.org/question/319626/real-time-map-generate-on-web-like-a-rviz/
Any tips/help would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance!

For anyone who wants the same thing as me I ended up using https://github.com/MoffKalast/vizanti and it works like a charm!
