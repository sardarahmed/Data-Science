Q:

How to create a launch file?

Hello Everyone!!
How can i create a launch file?
As a sample, have a look at turtlemimic.launch
<launch>

  <group ns="turtlesim1">
    <node pkg="turtlesim" name="sim" type="turtlesim_node"/>
  </group>

  <group ns="turtlesim2">
    <node pkg="turtlesim" name="sim" type="turtlesim_node"/>
  </group>

  <node pkg="turtlesim" name="mimic" type="mimic">
    <remap from="input" to="turtlesim1/turtle1"/>
    <remap from="output" to="turtlesim2/turtle1"/>
  </node>

</launch>

However, how do I get this working ?
Best,
Vincent

start with $ gedit turtlemimic.launch, then a new window with gedit will pop up, just paste those stuff, save and close.

A:

Launch file is useful when you want to start/launch many nodes at once without any need to do "rosrun for every node".
In the package, create a folder by the name launch and create a filename.launch file.
It always start with
 <launch>

and if some parameters should be set then
<param name="use_sim_time"  value="true" />

To start a node
<node pkg="name_of_package" type="name_of_packge" name="name_of_executable" 
output="screen"/>

Example
<node pkg="sure_on_cloud" type="estimate_transform_svd" name="estimate_transform_svd" 
output="screen"/>

In the above way, one can call multiple nodes from different packages.
Nodelets can also be initialized. Sorry I dont know what they are, but they can also be initialized from the example below
  <node pkg="nodelet" type="nodelet" name="standalone_nodelet"  args="manager"/>

 <node pkg="nodelet" type="nodelet" name="point_cloud_xyz"
    args="load depth_image_proc/point_cloud_xyz standalone_nodelet">

Some packages have their topics already set to specific names. They can be remapped to different names.
<remap from="/image_rect" to="/camera/depth/image"/>
<remap from="/points" to="/camera/depth/points"/>
<remap from="/camera_info" to="/camera/depth/camera_info"/>

launching a node worked for me after a slight modification
