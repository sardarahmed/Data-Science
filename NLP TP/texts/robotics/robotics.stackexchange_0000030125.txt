Q:

How to change the Kinect point cloud resolution

Is it possible to change the Kinect point cloud resolution, via openni_camera or openni_node, such that fewer points are returned ?

A:

Check out the Changing driver settings section of the openni_camera wiki. The parameter you'd want to tweak is depth_mode. The Kinect openni_node driver supports VGA(640x480), QVGA(320x240), and QQVGA(160x120) resolutions of the point cloud, all at 30Hz.

Ok, using a value of 8 for both depth and image I can get the QQVGA resolution.

Are you sure? I think I used the 160x120 before. Make sure you select the 30Hz though, otherwise it won't work

It looks as if the QQVGA resolutions aren't available, but QVGA does work and gives a much better update rate.
