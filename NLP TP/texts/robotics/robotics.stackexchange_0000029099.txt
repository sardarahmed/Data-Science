Q:

Rendering images in GAZEBO

Hello Guys,
I'm completely new to GAZEO because of a research task.
Therefor I'm focussing on the way GAZEBO is rendering and what are pros and cons of the used rendering algorithms.
I haven't found many information about it in the tutorials.
Thank you in advance!

A:

Gazebo renders everything with OGRE, so maybe maybe you find your answer here https://www.ogre3d.org/
As far as I know, openGL is used as default and the UI works with QT.
