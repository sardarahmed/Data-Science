Q:

Where is tf2_echo? And turtle_tf2?

In some tutorials is mentioned the existence of tf2_echo. I'm using Ubuntu and ROS Hydro but I don't find it anymore in any package installed.
The same issue is about turtle_tf2?
They do exist?
How can I install both of them?
Regards

The tutorials are now finished, so maybe you can close the question...

A:

Hello,
This is answer on second part of your question:
I just created the tutorial for turtle_tf2. Also it should be added soon upstream in geometry_tutorials repository.
Now we have to fix ROS-wiki. Any help is welcome :)
Regards!
