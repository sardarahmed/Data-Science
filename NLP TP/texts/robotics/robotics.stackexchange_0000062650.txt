Q:

Problem with roslaunch on a local machine

Hi,
I have a robot which is my ros_master and my local machine which is able to to list the nodes and topics and also do rosrun. I have ROS_MASTER_URI, ROS_HOSTNAME and ROS_IP correctly set on both machines. However when I want to start a package on my local machine using roslaunch ( in my case I am trying to launch gmapping) I have problems. My local machine tries to run roscore locally and it gives me errors.
Thanks in advance for helping me out.

A:

Apparently I had set the ROS_HOSTNAME to the name of my ros_master instead of the name of my local machine. So for this to work we need to set the ROS_HOSTNAME to the name of the local machine ( in /etc/hosts) or its IP, set the ROS_IP to the ip of the local machine and ROS_MASTER_URI to the ip of the master.
