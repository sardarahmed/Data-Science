Q:

how to fix ros:Message error?

I try to run Minority Report Interface in MIT Kinect Demos, and when I rosmake kgui, I got this error:
/kgui/src/RosGlobals.h:293:21: error: ‘Message’ in namespace ‘ros’ does not name a type
and I checked RosGlobals.h, it says(start from Row 293):
 void Publish(const ros::Message&_msg){
      if(connected)
                    gf->publish(topic,(void*)&_msg);
    }

I did a little search and find this might be the difference between diamondback and electric, does anybody know how to solve this?

A:

Is using diamondback an option or are you looking for something more long-term.
If it is just that piece of code, you could template over the Message. That should work here. Alternately pass in a void* and change the calling code.

I'm not sure how to " template over the Message". would you be more specific please? I acutally met the same problem wen try to build motion_planning_rviz_plugin in ROS electric. Would really appreciate the help here.

Make the Publish function a templated function, e.g. over  and replace ros::Message with T.

Finally, I get it work! Thanks. just insert "template typename rosMessage", then replace the "ros::Message" with "rosMessage" in line 293.
