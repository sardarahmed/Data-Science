Q:

flir thermal camera driver?

have just purchased a flir a615 thermal camera.
we use ubuntu 11.10 with latest ROS and PCL.
has anyone made drivers already for a flir camera to be used in ubuntu / ros / pcl?
the company itself only provides windows drivers.
i've never made drivers before so if you have any and would like to share, it would be very much appreciated and +100000 karma points to u :)

A:

There is a FLIR driver (linking to doc at Freiburg's mirror, because ROS.org appears to be down) available. This one appears to be rather old however, I have no idea if it is usable with your device.
