This sounds similar to http://answers.ros.org/question/11252/prosilica-calibration-freezes-during-calibration
Calibration may take a while. Just be patient.
Which ROS distro are you running? The Calibrate step could be quite slow in Diamondback, but we made it much faster in Electric.

Hello again! I'm using the 10.10 of Ubuntu. I've already gotten the calibration but after 5 times trying it. Thank you!
