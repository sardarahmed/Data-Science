Q:

global frame in move_base

Hi,
I am slightly confused regarding the global frame parameter that is set in the local_costmap.yaml and global_costmap.yaml files to run move_base. The "local" parameter specified global frame as odom and the "global_costmap" specifies it as map. What exactly is the significance of this? Additionally where is map coming from? I have odom being published by the controller of my robot however my map building is published at another topic. Does move_base generate map by itself? If so why can I not see it as a published topic?
The reason I ask this question is because I am facing the following problem: I send a Goal to the move_base action server to complete. /odom is set as the global frame in my local_costmap_params.yaml file. However the robot goes to a random position and sends back task successful. In other words it does not listen to data published by /odom. Since at task completion /odom is publishing a random pose that does not correspond to the Goal position I specified it to go to. Any inputs/ suggestions?
Thanks
Ammar

A:

The map is a costmap. The purpose behind the costmap is to have the local area around the robot freshly mapped to prevent collision with a dynamic object. The costmap also inflates the objects in the costmap to the user specified inflation radius. You can see it as a published topic, even in rviz. The Odom is not the same as the localized pose. Odom starts when the motors turn. This is the robot's odometry frame. The robot localizes to the global frame.
