Q:

Searching for TOD, ending up at Ecto

Hello ROS-users and developers,
I am getting a bit confused while searching for a possibly fresh and working version of TOD.
I guess these two are slightly old for me:

http://www.ros.org/wiki/tod
http://www.ros.org/wiki/textured_object_detection

These are said to be deprecated and unstable in different threads regarding this topic.

http://www.ros.org/wiki/tod_training
http://www.ros.org/wiki/tod_detecting

While all the above references:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/object_recognition which consists of

http://www.ros.org/wiki/object_recognition_core
http://www.ros.org/wiki/object_recognition_server
which are one could say highly underdocumented :)
There is no documentation on that page but there is a reference to http://ecto.willowgarage.com/recognition.

Digging into the docs here for object_recognition might help:
http://ecto.willowgarage.com/recognition/release/rc1/object_recognition/index.html
however I feel a bit confused now that I installed ros-electric-object_recognition which seems to include ecto and TOD related codes but have no idea how to start with it.
Ok the documentations are there but they are a bit outdated and not really convenient for me.
I would appreciate any help either if someone can help me

by naming which to work with of the above (or none right now and wait for the ecto release) or
assemble a simple training&run with TOD or
providing a link to an updated "how to run TOD (ecto) for newbies" tutorial

Thx in advance :)

I'm curious, too.

A:

Hi, please follow the updated documentation on : http://ecto.willowgarage.com/recognition/
Just jump to the ROS quickguide if you can't wait :)
If you find any bug (in the code or the documentation), please file a bug report at the links indicated at http://www.ros.org/wiki/object_recognition/
A lot of infrastructure/build work had to be done before advertising the stack but we're finally done. We're actively developing/using it for more/better pipelines.
