Indigo isn't officially released yet either. I had success installing ros_comm from source and installing the rest through apt-get.

hamid thank you for your reply but as Hansg said even I am unable to install the package I am getting below error message admin@admin:~$ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-desktop-full

ros-indigo-desktop-full is not available yet. For now, you can just do
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-*
It'll have far more packages than you'll probably want/need, but you'll be sure to have everything. :)

did you update your sources.list?
Comment by William on 2014-04-28:
The from source instructions should work on 14.04 unless there are problems compiling against newer versions of libraries in 14.04: http://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Installation/Source However hydro isn't supported for 14.04, so it may not work without some debugging.
