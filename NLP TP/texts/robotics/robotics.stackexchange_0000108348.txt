Q:

Comparing navigation algorithms

I am new to Nav2 stack and currently there are a bunch of navigation plugins to choose from (https://navigation.ros.org/plugins/index.html). I am interested in how to choose available algorithms from those in "Planners" and "Controllers" sections. For example, how to know pros & cons of NavFn planner compared with SmacPlanner. How to know pros & cons of DWB controller against TEB controller. Is there any site clarify something like this?
Thank you,
Peera

There's a paper for that: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.15236.pdf
