Q:

When i want to create workspace it give me an error

Hi everyone!
I try to set up my workspace for ROS Lunar, but when i run the comand rosws set ~/fuerte_workspace/sandbox  it give me this error: ERROR in config: Command requires a target workspace.
I followed the steps in the tutorial on ROS.ORG site.
After that I tried Catkin instead of rosbuild.
The comands i entered are in this order:

mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src

 cd ~/catkin_ws/

catkin_make

After this point i get the next error:
####

I also want to mention that i had anaconda3 installed but I uninstalled it.
If someone could help me i would be grateful.
Thanks!

can you clarify why you call your workspace fuerte_sandbox in that case and try to use rosws? Since Groovy we typically use Catkin workspaces and rosws is rarely used.

I followed the instruction on the link I mentioned. At point 3 i stuck. I will try with Catkin.

I followed the instruction on the link I mentioned.

The rosbuild option is deprecated and only there for historical/archival reasons. The default is Catkin.

I tried with Catkin but it give me this message:

please update your original question with the error. Comments are too small for that.
Include all commands that you enter that lead up to the error.
Use the edit button/link and append the new information to your current text.
Do not post a new question.

Ok. I edited it.

A:

You appear to have Anaconda installed and active:

-- Using PYTHON_EXECUTABLE: /home/ovidiu/anaconda3/bin/python

that is going to cause problems, as the ROS Python packages are not installed in that environment.
Please deactivate Anaconda (ie: remove it from your PATH) and try again.

How can I do that?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-09-18:
Most likely by:

remov[ing] it from your PATH

Comment by oovidiustr on 2019-09-18:
I uninstalled safe anaconda... but the PYTHON_EXECUTABLE path didn't changed.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-09-18:
Delete the build and devel folders in the workspace. The paths are cached in those.
Comment by oovidiustr on 2019-09-18:
Yes. I deleted entire catkin_ws  folder and i run again the commands I wrote before.
Thanks a lot!!!!
