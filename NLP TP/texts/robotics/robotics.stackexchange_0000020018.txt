Q:

Fusing IMU sensor with odometry

Would fusing Odometry estimation with IMU sensor increase the accuracy of estimation for planar differential drive robots?

A:

Yes.
Example of this can be found here.
Depending on how good your modeling is you could also use the IMU to help detect wheel slippage.
