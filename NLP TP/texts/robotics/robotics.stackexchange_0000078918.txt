Q:

lwheel and rwheel frame to link up to URDF

So, this seem to be the final thing I am stuck on, please help
My wheels in my URDF is lwheel and rwheel
When I list topics, the wheels are listed
/rwheel
/rwheel_vel
/rwheel_vtarget

When I do rosrun tf view_frames
Exception thrown:"odom" passed to lookupTransform argument source_frame does not exist.  
The current list of frames is: 
Frame laser exists with parent base_frame. 
Frame base_frame exists with parent map. 
Frame scanmatcher_frame exists with parent

What the hell do I need to map these so the URDF maps to the publisher?  I think its something to do with a TF?

If you have a URDF describing the geometry of your robot (e.g. the transform between base_link and lwheel) then you likely need to be running an instance of the robot_state_publisher which publishes the /tf data between the links in a URDF

First thank you for answer, you rock.  My base_link is actually base_frame (seems Hector Mapping uses that) however everything is linked (base_frame, lwheel, rwheel, laser etc)  Laser and Base_frame come up fine in RVIZ.  lwheel, rwheel do not? ]

Do lwheel and rwheel have non-fixed joints? For example continuous rotation joints about the axle axis? If so, something needs to publish a sensor_msgs/JointState message, typically on the /joints_states topic, containing these angles

You may be interested in using the joint_state_publisher to help get these values published.

I was following the URDF tutorial and so the wheels are just connected to the Base_frame http://wiki.ros.org/differential_drive/tutorials/setup_urdf

Tonight I will try the code again with  

A:

So the bit I needed to add as mentioned above was:
This seems to advertises the parts of the robot URDF(joints etc) to RVIZ.  The errors went away
