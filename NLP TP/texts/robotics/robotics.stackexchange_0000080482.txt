Q:

Baxter Installation error (boost vs. QT conflict)?

Hello there,
I get an error while trying to build the baxter simulator by following their installation instructions on ros kinetic and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. The error is specifically when I try to make the baxter_sim_io package as shown below. Any help with this regard is appreciated:

Check this question for suggestions @stackoverflow

The kinetic-devel branch is not the default branch. Make sure you've checked out kinetic-devel in both baxter_common and baxter_simulator, and then do a clean build by removing the build/ and devel/ directories.

Used the solution suggested by @imcmahon and it worked. Thanks all.

For future visitors from the Internet:
Please try the ROS Kinetic tab of the Baster Simulator Installation guide to get up and running with Baxter Gazebo in Kinetic. Cheers!
