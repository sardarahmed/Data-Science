Q:

Rosrun as super user

Hello, I have some code in my ros node (within a catkin workspace) that requires super user privilege in order to access some serial ports. How can this be done as sudo does not work with rosrun.
Thanks.
Edit: This is using the admin account:
$groups ros
ros : ros adm dialout cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin sambashare

How about you try to open the ports in .bashrc file ?

A:

You should really not use sudo with rosrun. It leads to all sorts of nastiness with permissions.
For serial ports (and access to other hardware through /dev/xxx) you just need to give the relevant user (most likely your user) access to the device file (fi: /dev/ttyS0). This is not ROS specific.
See How do I allow a non-default user to use serial device ttyUSB0? on the Ubuntu stack-exchange for instance.
For ROS specific answers: google: linux serial ports udev access, which gives you:

port problems for not being root
Can't access turtlebot through ttyUSB0
Failed to open port /dev/ttyUSB0

Edit: and just for completeness (and for the lazy), a quote from the first answer to the question on the Ubuntu stack-exchange:

As you've noticed, the /dev/ttyUSB0 device has the group of dialout. All you need to do is add the second user to the dialout group:

sudo adduser USERNAME dialout

Note: you need to log out and back in for your user groups to be reloaded.
