Q:

rosdep install error

I am trying to install cartographer_ros. I was following the "Building and installation" instruction provided in here .
At one step when I tried
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro=${ROS_DISTRO} -y

I got following error.
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
laser_geometry: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [pcl]
spin_hokuyo: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [pcl]

FYI, I use pcl_ros, laser_geometry in my workspace as I have modified them for my application.
I am not very sure what is the source of this error.

A:

I am not very sure what is the source of this error.

pcl is not a valid rosdep key, which is why rosdep cannot find it.
The keys for PCL itself are libpcl-all-dev (build depend) and libpcl-all (run depend), but it's more common to depend on the ROS wrapper packages which will bring in PCL as one of their dependencies. For that, just depend on the ROS package names (ie: pcl_conversions and friends).
Note that this is not a problem with/in Cartographer, but in spin_hokuyo and your copy of laser_geometry.

cool. I removed the build dependency on PCL from both the packages and it works.  thanks.
