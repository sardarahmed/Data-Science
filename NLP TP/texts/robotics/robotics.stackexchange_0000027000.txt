Q:

Error [Plugin.hh:138] Failed to load plugin libgazebo_ros_camera.so: libCameraPlugin.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Hello guys, I have the following issue on gazebo 1.9 (ROS Hydro - Ubuntu 12.04):
I have a package, for example pioneer3at, where in .sdf file some plugin, as libgazebo_ros_camera.so, are inserted.
When I type
roslaunch pioneer3at myfile.launch
it gives me this error
Msg Waiting for masterMsg Connected to gazebo master @ http://127.0.0.1:11345
Msg Publicized address: 172.20.242.19
Error [Plugin.hh:138] Failed to load plugin libgazebo_ros_camera.so: libCameraPlugin.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

I tried also to set env variable GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH correctly but however it doesn't work. However I noted that, in a tutorial of gazebo about RRBot Example, when I typed roslaunch command, it gave me the same error but with a several plugin:
Error [Plugin.hh:138] Failed to load plugin libgazebo_ros_control.so:libgazebo_ros_control.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

To resolve this last problem, I installed ros-hydro-gazebo-ros-control package.
Now my question is: to resolve the problem with libgazebo_ros_camera.so:libCameraPlugin.so, I should install a missing package or what?
This is really important for me...
Excuse me and thanks to all

A:

The gazebo_ros_packages (or ros-hydro-gazebo-ros-pkgs) should contain the plugin.
If the gazebo_ros_control plugin can be found this will solve the problem...
The whole installation procedure is described here: Installing_gazebo_ros_Packages
