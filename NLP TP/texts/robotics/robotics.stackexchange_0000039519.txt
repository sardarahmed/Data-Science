Q:

How to force kinect to a certain USB 2.0 BUS

I've got laptop with 4 usb BUS inside, 3 of them are usb 2.0. And I have 4 usb ports on side of my laptop, 3 of them are usb 2.0 PORT and one is 3.0 port. I want to connect 2 kinects to 2 of my usb 2.0 BUS, But no matter which usb 2.0 PORT I connect the Kinects to, they alwas goes in the same usb 2.0 BUS, hence I can only get data out of one Kinect, since one kinect will cost the whole bandwidth of a usb 2.0 BUS.
here's my lsusb results:

I want to force one kinect to use BUS 01 instead of BUS 02, but I don't know how. Any suggestions? Where can I find more information on that?

A:

USB ports are physically connected to one bus or another, and there's no way to change that. The ThinkPads I've worked with have had each port on a separate bus. If your laptop vendor decided to put all of your USB ports on the same bus, then you're probably out of luck.
If you have an expansion slot, you may be able to install a USB card in it and get another USB bus that way.
You might try one kinect on the USB 3.0 bus if you're desperate, but it hasn't worked for me.

kinect simplely don't work with usb 3.0 for now. Thanks for your answer anyway, but it seems I'm no luck on this. My laptop doesn't have any expansion ability.
