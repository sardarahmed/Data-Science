Q:

Kinetic: Problems during installation of turtlebot_Simulator

Hi All,
I was trying to install the binaries of the  turtlebot_Simulator by the follwing way.
1) Installation by binarys of  turtlebot-simulator
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-turtlebot-simulator
2) move files of packet to "src" folder
I tried before I get the hint to use the binaries, directly the source code "src" of my
workspace "turtlebot_ws"
I also installed the source code package of turtlebot_simulator.
git clone https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot_simulator.git
3)Following files are now in the folder (inkl. turtlebot_simulator.git )
~/turtlebot_ws$ ls src
CMakeLists.txt   setup_kobuki.sh    turtlebot_capabilities             turtlebot.rosinstall
README.md        turtlebot          turtlebot_capabilities.rosinstall  turtlebot_simulator
setup_create.sh  turtlebot_bringup  turtlebot_description              turtlebot_teleop
4) Compile the package
Enter the command: ~/turtlebot_ws$ catkin_make
5) Trying to start
When I trying to start the simulator, I get the following error message:
~/turtlebot_ws$ roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch
... logging to /home/ros/.ros/log/ebc2837c-60cb-11e7-baaa-000c29a91528/roslaunch-ubuntu-4167.log
Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.

Invalid  tag: environment variable 'TURTLEBOT_GAZEBO_WORLD_FILE' is not set.
Arg xml is 
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file
6) Here are my ROS Variables:
printenv | grep ROS
ROS_ROOT=/opt/ros/kinetic/share/ros
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/ros/turtlebot_ws/src:/opt/ros/kinetic/share
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
ROSLISP_PACKAGE_DIRECTORIES=/home/ros/turtlebot_ws/devel/share/common-lisp
ROS_DISTRO=kinetic
ROS_ETC_DIR=/opt/ros/kinetic/etc/ros
Same for the turtle bot variables:
printenv | grep TURTLE
TURTLEBOT_3D_SENSOR=asus_xtion_pro
TURTLEBOT_STACKS=hexagons
TURTLEBOT_SIMULATION=false
TURTLEBOT_RAPP_PACKAGE_WHITELIST=[rocon_apps, turtlebot_rapps]
TURTLEBOT_SERIAL_PORT=/dev/kobuki
TURTLEBOT_BASE=kobuki
TURTLEBOT_RAPP_PACKAGE_BLACKLIST=[]
TURTLEBOT_TYPE=turtlebot
TURTLEBOT_BATTERY=/sys/class/power_supply/BAT0
TURTLEBOT_INTERACTIONS_LIST=[turtlebot_bringup/admin.interactions, turtlebot_bringup/documentation.interactions, turtlebot_bringup/pairing.interactions, turtlebot_bringup/visualisation.interactions]
TURTLEBOT_NAME=turtlebot
I do not know, if it is a failure to try install the binaries and the source code version ?
Later I would like to modify the source code to lern more about the system. Therefore, the goal for
me would be to install and get run the source code version.
I am new in ROS and trying to get a foot into the door and need help.
Best regards
Ritchie

A:

I guess I found the problem first problem by myself.
I enter the follwong command
export TURTLEBOT_GAZEBO_WORLD_FILE=~/turtlebot_ws/src/turtlebot_simulator/turtlebot_gazebo/worlds/playground.world
And now it starts.
Best regards
R.
