Q:

pre-built ROS packages don't have CMakeLists.txt?

All these pre-built ROS packages like turtlesim and others don't seem to be having CMakeLists.txt file in them unlike the user created packages ( where a workspace is created and the packages are built ) . Is the file deliberately removed in the pre-built ones?

A:

No, it's just not included in the list of installed artefacts. It's a build script, not something you would use / need when you're using the nodes / libraries that the package provides.
Compare it to this: do you ever see a Makefile in any of the Debian/Ubuntu packages that you install?

So it would be included if I want to work with the source code to install ROS?

If you git clone .. or svn checkout .. the sources of the packages it should be included, yes.
