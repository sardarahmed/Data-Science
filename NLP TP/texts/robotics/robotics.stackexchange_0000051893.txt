Q:

How to start up the Kinova (JACO Arms) API in ROS?

What I am working on already has a couple of "sample programs" to help move the arms. But looking upon the code for these programs, there seems to be an API involved. I am trying to understand the code, but it all relates to the API which I can't find and run. I understand this information is not enough, but does anyone have any idea?
