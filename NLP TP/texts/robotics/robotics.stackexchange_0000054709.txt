Q:

How can I run the demo of viso2_ros for monocular odometry?

Hi I'm working with ROS and libviso. Could anyone tell me the steps that I have to follow in order to get the odometry? The file demo.launch is specially for stereo vision? It could be easily edited in order to use it just with one camera?

Hi Ellian!
I've just added two launchfiles in the groovy branch, one for mono and the other for stereo. Both have all the parameters listed with the default values.
Enjoy!
