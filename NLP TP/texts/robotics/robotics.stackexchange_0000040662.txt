Q:

rosjava = pure java ros master?

Hi,
I'm testing rosjava (last version I hope), from this instruction :
http://docs.rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/rosjava_core/html/index.html
But I don't understand a basis : is it not possible to run a pure java ros master (ros core ?).
In all the tutorial it is ask to run the "standard" roscore (C++/python).
By advance thank you for helping me to understand rosjava.
Regards,
Gaëtan

A:

rosjava_core is a pure ros_core java implementation.
You either run the python standard roscore or rosjava_core as the main ros process (not both).
