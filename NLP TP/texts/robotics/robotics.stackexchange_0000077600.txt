Q:

What do you suggest as a robust person tracking ROS-based solution using the Kinect

Hi,
I am looking for a robust person tracking ROS-based solution for the Kinect. I know there exist a number of different packages but I was wondering which one you recommend as a robust tracking solution when using specifically the Kinect.
Thanks a lot in advance.

Can you provide some more details? Using Kinect I assume you are targeting indoor application? Can you assume the ground is planar? Are you having a static camera or Kinect mounted on a robot?

Thank for your prompt reply. I am targeting an indoor application. The Kinect is mounted on the robot at the height of approximately 1.2 m and the ground can be assumed to be planar. the robot can move up to 2 .5 m/s.

Then I don't know a good ready-made solution. You should maybe clarify as well if you are thinking of detector and tracker as a package deal or tracker only.
Comment by zeinab on 2016-12-01:
I need a detector and tracker in combination. I could limit the speed of the robot to an extent. I am more considered about the robustness of the detection-tracking of the people (even at the expense of having to use lower speeds)

A:

I have found that openpose and its wrappers seem very promising at the moment.
