Q:

[rospack] Error: package 'turtlebot_gazebo' not found

Yesterday my turtlebot_gazebo worked just fine.Suddenly today everytime I open a new terminal, the following error immediately appears (BEFORE I DO ANYTHING):
[rospack] Error: package 'turtlebot_gazebo' not found
[rospack] Error: package 'turtlebot_gazebo' not found
[rospack] Error: package 'turtlebot_navigation' not found

When I navigate to /opt/ros/indigo/share , all the turtlebotpackages disappear.
SO I follow the instruction here
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-turtlebot ros-indigo-turtlebot-apps ros-indigo-turtlebot-interactions ros-indigo-turtlebot-simulator ros-indigo-kobuki-ftdi ros-indigo-rocon-remocon ros-indigo-rocon-qt-library ros-indigo-ar-track-alvar-msgs

and I also install the turtlebot_gazebo
When I install the turtlebot_gazebo, it shows
ros-indigo-turtlebot-gazebo is already the newest version.
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 14 not upgraded.

HOWEVER the same problem still appears, and the turtlebot_gazebo package is not in my directory.
PLEASE HELP
-------------------------------------------------------------EDIT-------------------------
I uninstall and reinstall turtlebot..
now turtlebot_gazebo is available, but when i try to launch the example.
 File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rospkg/rospack.py", line 200, in get_path
    raise ResourceNotFound(name, ros_paths=self._ros_paths)

Param xml is <param command="$(arg urdf_file)" name="robot_description"/>
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

HELP I saw a lot of ppl facing the same problem. I tried the suggested solution, but It doesn't work for me.

Please respect the fact that forum contributors respond on their own time; we're not obligated to help you in any way.

A:

For the initial problem.
Uninstall and reinstalling turtlebot solve the problem.
sudo apt-get remove turtlebot-*
sudo apt-get intsall ros-indigo-turtlebot

For the later problem, I think I'll post it as a new question HERE
