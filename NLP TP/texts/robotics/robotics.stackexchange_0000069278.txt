Q:

Executables not found and autocompletion not working with meta-ros

I have a many systems running meta-ros according to https://github.com/bmwcarit/meta-ros/ instructions. In all of them, ROS seems to work OK. However, one of them cannot find nodes executables. For instance, the joy package is correctly installed and I can run by doing /opt/ros/indigo/lib/joy/joy_node. However, if I try rosrun joy joy_node the output is:
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named joy_node below /opt/ros/indigo/share/joy
The executable is actually in /opt/ros/indigo/lib/joy.
I have compared both systems, and all the environment variables are the same. However, this one in which it does not work does not have /opt/ros/indigo/include folder for instance. That is the only difference I can find, apart from some different packages.
I have also run rospack profile
Do you have any suggestion on what to try? Thanks a lot!

A:

I found the problem: for some reason, the catkin_find command which is executed in rosrun script was not installed. A bit weird, since other packages depend on this one.
Anyway, installing catkin, in my case opkg install catkin solved the problem.
EDIT: I had the problem again on a different platform and I had to do:
source /opt/ros/indigo/share/rosbash/rosbash to make it work.

@fj138696 I recommend you to create a new question giving more details about your case (platform, what are you running and how, output, etc).
