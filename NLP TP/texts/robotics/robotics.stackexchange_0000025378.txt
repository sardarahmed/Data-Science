Hey, here is an example that works in Gazebo 1.2.5:
    <material>
      <script>
        <uri>file://media/materials/scripts/gazebo.material</uri>
        <name>Gazebo/Grey</name>
      </script>
    </material>

Are you using this code in a URDF file or a SDF file?
Comment by AndreiHaidu on 2013-01-09:
it is an SDF file

Check out the SDF documentation: http://gazebosim.org/sdf

This doesn't work for me.
I try to spawn e.g. a simple box from an urdf.xacro-file.
And it always is white in Gazebo (2.2.3).
Is there another way, that allows me to set the color?
