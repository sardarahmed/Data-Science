Q:

Compiling tools using pcl fails during linking

Currently I'm trying to update our code base to be used with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and indigo. When building a package which uses PCL I hit this issue:

/usr/bin/ld:
/usr/local/lib/libqhull.a(mem.c.o)(.debug_info+0x701):
unresolvable R_X86_64_64 relocation
against symbol `qhmem'   /usr/bin/ld:
final link failed: Nonrepresentable
section on output   collect2: error:
ld returned 1 exit status

It seems there is something fatally broken/mixed up with headers and the pre-compiled 32/64 bit libraries. Reinstalling the libqhull packages won't resolve this issue. So, has anybody an idea how to solve this?
Best wishes,
Alex

A:

Deleting /usr/local/lib/libqhull.a and doing
sudo apt-get --reinstall install libopencv-dev libpcl-1.7-all-dev ros-indigo-pcl-ros

clean your project and rebuild it.
