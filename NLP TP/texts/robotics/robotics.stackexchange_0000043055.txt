Q:

Tutorial Question: Writing a Simple Publisher and Subscriber (C++)

i'm new to ROS and following the standard tutorial given on the ROS.ORG site. While running based on the topic of writing a simple publisher and subscriber, the outputs for talker and listener are shown below:
Talker output:
[INFO] hello world 1
[INFO] hello world 2
[INFO] hello world 3
[INFO] hello world 4
[INFO] hello world 5
[INFO] hello world 6
[INFO] hello world 7
[INFO] hello world 8
Listener output
[INFO] hello world 3
[INFO] hello world 4
[INFO] hello world 5
[INFO] hello world 6
[INFO] hello world 7
[INFO] hello world 8

It seems that "hello world 0", "hello world 1" and "hello world 2" are missing from the listener.
I have used the original source code given on the topic.
Is this normal, how come they are missing?

A:

This is normal.
Your code starts publishing right away, but in the background the two nodes first have to find each other and handle out a connection. Until that is done the messages are published to nowhere.
You can check when there is a connection by using pub.getNumSubscribers().
