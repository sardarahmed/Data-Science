Q:

rosbag not publishing clock

I recorded some bagfiles with different experiments, then using the rosbag cookbook I change some timestamps (http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosbag/Cookbook).
Now when playing back the new bagfiles, the clock is not being publish.
I've already set the use_sim_time parameter to true and playing the bagfile with --clock option. What could be wrong?
EDIT: I re-run my program and remove the compression options for the bag file. When writing uncompressed bagfiles, the clock works with no problems.

Could you provide a downloadable bag file with this problem?

A:

This seems to be a bug (https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/issues/82) in rosrun.
(Too low karma to post a link. Will edit when possible)
