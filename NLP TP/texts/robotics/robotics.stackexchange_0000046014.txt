Q:

SW to urdf converter: errors in links masses

Hi,
We have used the SW to urdf converter to obtain the model of a 6 dof arm robot (6 links). The converetr works well but we found that the masses calculated for each link correspond to the mass of the entire robot. It seems that the same is happening with moments of inertia.
Does anybody know if there is a mistake in the converter?
Thanks in advance!
