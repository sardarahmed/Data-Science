Q:

Assimp and RViz will not import .scene file

I am trying to load a collision object into my hydraulic arm's planning scene, but it doesn't work with the pillar example provided for the baxter robot:
[ WARN] [1412647012.600856139]: Assimp reports no scene in file:///home/controller/Downloads/baxter_pillar.scene

There is a box.stl from the MoveIt! tutorial example that loads perfectly well.
Why is Assimp not loading these text scene files? All I want to do is have a cylinder that my robot is not allowed to collide with when executing a path.
Kind Regards
Bart

A:

I think Assimp is only capable of loading 3D models in a number of 'standardised' formats (stl, obj, etc). I doubt .scene is one of those.
From the tutorial you linked (section "Introducing an environment representation for planning", emphasis mine):

We will now create a scene object in a text file to be imported into our environment.

and:

You can now import this scene from the Scene Geometry field selecting Import From Text

Are you sure you clicked the Import from text button in the MoveIt RViz plugin, and not Import File?

That was it. Out of interest how come there are two ways of importing the files?

There are more, but in this case I'm guessing that there was a need to separate the import of a single mesh, versus a .scene file that may contain an entire world (although I don't think it was meant for that).
