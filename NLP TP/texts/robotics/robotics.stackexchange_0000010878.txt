Q:

Is there a sensor that can measure through an object?

Is there a sensor that can measure through an object, for example a mattress. (This is not what I want to do but it is a good illustration) I want to mount a sensor on the ceiling above the top bunk of a bunk bed and want to measure the presence of a person on the bottom bunk (when no one is in the top bunk). I have read about thermal and ultrasonic sensors however it does appear that they would be able to measure on the other side of a mattress.

I am not sure you will be able to find a cheap off the shelf sensor.  But if you are an RF engineer and willing to implement something yourself, you might want to read: A Multifrequency Radar System for Detecting Humans and Characterizing Human Activities for Short-Range Through-Wall and Long-Range Foliage Penetration Applications by Ram M. Narayanan, Sonny Smith, and Kyle A. Gallagher.
