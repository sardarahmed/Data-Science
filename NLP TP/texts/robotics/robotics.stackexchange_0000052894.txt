Q:

ROS not finding installed dependency, 'python-serial'

I'm attempting to install the 'dynamixel_controllers' package. I have pulled own via the svn and am attempting to 'rosmake'.
I receive this error
 Results:

python-serial is already the newest version.
The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required:
  nite-dev ps-engine libbluetooth-dev bison evtest gforth
  libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev python-bluez libusb-dev gforth-common
  joystick flex libffcall1 openni-dev libgstreamer0.10-dev
Use 'apt-get autoremove' to remove them.
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 344 not upgraded.

Even though 'python-serial' is listed as the newest version, i'm still receiving this warning. This is a 10.04 Ubuntu running Electric (yes, I realize it's an old system but it's necessary that I use this and not upgrade at this moment).
Any suggestions?
I will be controlling Dynamixel Servos from this machine and I assume I will need to be able to communicate to them via Serial... so this is a bit troubling.

A:

There's nothing to worry about here.  It's telling you that what you asked for is already present so it's not going to install anything.

So, then, it will "run" when I execute the proper launch commands? (with out an error?
