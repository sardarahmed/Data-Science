Q:

Navigation using footstep planner and real NAO

Hello,
I am using footstep planner through the command line NAO_IP=<ip-address> roslaunch footstep_planner footstep_planner_complete.launch. I am able to create a footstep plan according to the instructions in the ROS tutorial 

Also, when I load a robot model, every change in the pose of arms, legs, head, etc, is reflected in the simulated robot.

My question: to control the robot to automatically follow the path just created, should I implement (using the ROS API) a code to interface with RViz to control the robot? Or is there any easier way to accomplish this navigation task?

Thanks!

Marcelo.

A:

There are two options. First, you can take the computed footstep plan and execute it open-look with the Nao. Check out the nodes nao_walker and nao_footsteps, they will allow you to execute a sequence of footsteps computed by footstep_planner. The robot will then not correct for drift however, and likely not reach the goal correctly.
As another option you can have a look at the footstep_navigation node in the footstep planner (class FootstepNavigation.cpp). It will interleave execution and localization, correct for small errors and start replanning when the derivation is too large. It requires a working pose estimate in the map frame, such as humanoid_localization from range or laser data. You will probably have to understand the code yourself and adjust it to your needs, since I haven't used it for some while.
