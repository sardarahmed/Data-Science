Q:

Integrator type in order to solve the differential equations

Hi,
Does anyone know which integrator type (e.g. implicit Euler) is used in Gazebo, respectively ODE, in order to solve the differential equations?
Best

A:

Gazebo uses ODE as physics engine by default and ODE uses semi-implicit Euler integration.
Bullet uses semi-implicit Euler integration as well.

Hi, thanks for your answer. Do you know where I can find some paper or something else where the integrator type of the ODE is described?

You can probably refer to this webpage: http://wiki.ros.org/physics_ode/ODE  although the latex display is bad, but you might get an idea.
If you are looking for how the time stepper is working, refer to my thesis here https://foswiki.cs.rpi.edu/foswiki/pub/RoboticsWeb/LabPublications/YLu_thesis.pdf
In chapter 3, From basic equation of motion (3.1), you can jump to equation (3.27) Hopefully section 3.3 in this thesis will give you some reference as well
