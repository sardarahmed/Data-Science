Q:

catkin_make require build of package without dependencies

We have a driver package for our hardware we have developed ourselves, which I shall call foo_driver. On our test desktop environment, we do not need the package, so there are no dependencies in the package.xml files of other packages, so it never builds on the desktop as expected.
However, we now want to run a QA tool on the library, which according to our QA department requires the standard catkin_make to try to build the library. We cannot ask for a single package build with catkin_make --pkg foo_driver apparently, so is there some way to flag a library as "Always build" or something?

A:

Assuming your driver package has a manifest file catkin_make always builds all packages in a workspace. The dependencies only determine the order

Oops, just checked and there is a if (${CMAKE_DEB_HOST_ARCH} MATCHES "amd642) return() endif() at the top of the CMakeLists.txt making it not build on the desktop.
