Q:

robot (PR2) physical information

Hello
I've been working with lasers for laser avoidance, and because of the Eigen/Core bug, I skipped using a Laser projector and did the computation of tilt scan into base scan by hand. Rotation is ok, I still need to translate my data between frames (robot tilt height to robot base height, etc.). So I would know if a physical description of the robot (base width, length of joints) is available or I should define myself the distances I need (by measuring, which is the worst solution).
Of course, if you are able to answer my question on Eigen/Core, that would be the best option, imho.
Thanks,
Erwan

A:

You should really be able to use TF for this, to transform points from one frame to another.
That Eigen bug looks suspiciously old. You probably aren't running into the same issue as the original author. I'll respond there.

Your solution on Eigen/Core post worked fine for me.
