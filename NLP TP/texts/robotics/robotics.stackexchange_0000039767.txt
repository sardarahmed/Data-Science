Q:

Can't find my command "rosinstall"

I installed ros-electric on my ubuntu10.04 and tried to install the 3D package by writing a t.rosintall file as follow
  - svn:
      uri: https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/branches/trunk_diamondback/sandbox/3d_navigation/
      local-name: stacks/3d_navigation
  - svn:
      uri: https://alufr-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/octomap_mapping
      local-name: stacks/octomap_mapping
  - svn:
      uri: https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/stacks/motion_planning_common/branches/arm_navigation_metrics
      local-name: stacks/motion_planning_common

However when I tried to install the package by the command
  rosinstall . /opt/ros/electric/ ./t.rosinstall

It showed:
  bcddivad@bcddivad-laptop:~/code/ros$ rosinstall ./opt/ros/electric/ ./t.rosinstall
  rosinstall: command not found
  bcddivad@bcddivad-laptop:~/code/ros$ 

Then I tried
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo apt-get install ros-electric-*
but still in vein.
Can anyone please help me?
Thanks to @Dan Lazewatsky

A:

rosinstall is not installed as part of the debian packages. You can install it with pip as follows
sudo pip install -U rosinstall
