Q:

Load SDF (.model) into robot_description

In the past and currently, you can load a URDF/XACRO file into the parameter service via something like:
<param name="robot_description" command="$(find xacro)/xacro.py 'my_robot.urdf.xacro'"/>

The latest Gazebo package supplies several nice robot models (simulator_gazebo/gazebo/gazebo/share/gazebo-1.0.1/models/youbot.model for example) which are great to spawn in Gazebo. Is it possible to use the .model file (in the SDF format that Gazebo uses) in order to load the model into robot_description in Fuerte?

A:

I believe the robot_description parameter can only handle Collada and URDF formatted files. This is then read by the "URDF Interface" for use with tf, Rviz, etc. A SDF .model file is not supported.
