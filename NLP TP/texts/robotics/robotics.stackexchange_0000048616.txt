Q:

viso2_ros package make error

I am trying to rosmake viso2_ros but I am getting this error:
/home/eric/fuerte_workspace/sandbox/viso2/viso2_ros/src/stereo_odometer.cpp: In member function ‘virtual void viso2_ros::StereoOdometer::imageCallback(const ImageConstPtr&, const ImageConstPtr&, const CameraInfoConstPtr&, const CameraInfoConstPtr&)’:
  /home/eric/fuerte_workspace/sandbox/viso2/viso2_ros/src/stereo_odometer.cpp:112:47: error: conversion from ‘ros::WallTime’ to non-scalar type ‘ros::Time’ requested
  /home/eric/fuerte_workspace/sandbox/viso2/viso2_ros/src/stereo_odometer.cpp:222:61: error: no match for ‘operator-’ in ‘ros::WallTime::now()() - start_time’

Can anyone tell me why I am getting this make error?
I am running Ubuntu Precise Fuerte.
Thanks

The error causes the stereoOdometer node to not compile.  I noticed that the monoOdometer node compiled which is the only node I need.  Thanks.

Hi Eric,
thanks for reporting! There was a bug I just corrected there. Please, update your repo and let me know if there is any other issue.
Edit: I changed that in develop branch but forgot to merge then in master. Now it should work. Thanks limhyon!
