A:

You can take a look at the VRX project, where Gazebo is used to simulate a maritime environment. There is a buoyancy plugin that takes into account the level of the water.

I have gone through the vrx plugin, but i just want simple buoyancy plugin up to level of still water with drag force of water acting on water.
