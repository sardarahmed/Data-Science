Q:

VM RVIZ inits but crashes shortly after start

Notes

ROS Indigo / Ubuntu 14.04.5 via VirtualBox 5.0.14 / mbp OS X 10.11.3
RVIZ runs rgbdslam with no problems rosrun rgbdslam rgbdslam

Initial Steps

$ roscore &
$ rosrun using_markers basic_shapes

Error
 $ rosrun rviz rviz

Since RVIZ works on it's own, why am I getting issues with RVIZ running with using_markers ?

Same problem as well. Ubuntu host with nvidia drivers. Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit guest on Virtual box 5.0.16 and guest additions 5.0.17. How long is VBox going to be blamed for this? We're going on 6 years.

@Constantin S VirtualBox 5.1.22 r115126 (Qt5.6.2) May 2017 still crashing with 3D acceleration enabled

A:

This is the VirtualBox 3D acceleration for Ubuntu problem. If you turn off the VirtualBox 3D acceleration, the RViz will work fine, but your CPU will be overused, the compiz will take about 70% of your CPU.
I install dual OS in my laptop, then the libGL error is gone. So you may try this.

I've found that if you users "spheres" in your point clouds that reduces the performance cost by a lot which makes cpu rviz usable for what I'm doing.
