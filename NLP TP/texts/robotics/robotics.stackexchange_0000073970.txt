A:

According to the publisher's website (I'm guessing that's the book since no link was provided in the question), that book is for Hydro. Now, you can use it for Indigo, but I suspect that you may run into trouble trying to use Hydro code with Indigo.
I highly recommend the comprehensive ROS by Example (Indigo) series. They are comprehensive, cover many different aspects of ROS, and includes two Github repos that you can use as inspiration for your own work. Plus, there is a Google Group for the books and the author, @Pi Robot, frequents this site as well. Volume 1 covers:

Real and Simulated Robots
Operating Systems and ROS Versions
Reviewing the ROS Basics
Installing the ros-by-example Code
Installing the Arbotix Simulator
Controlling a Mobile Base
Navigation, Path Planning and SLAM
Speech Recognition and Synthesis
Robot Vision
Combining Vision and Base Control
Dynamixel Servos and ROS

and Volume 2 covers:

Task Execution using ROS
Creating a URDF Model for your Robot
Controlling Dynamixel Servos: Take 2
Robot Diagnostics
Dynamic Reconfigure
Multiplexing Topics with mux & yocs
Head Tracking in 3D
Detecting and Tracking AR Tags
Arm Navigation using MoveIt!
Gazebo: Simulating Worlds and Robots
Rosbridge: Building a Web GUI for your Robot

I've used these at work and they have helped me considerably. Please note that I am in no way attached to these books financially, I just think that they are excellent.
