Q:

What planners are available in Moveit?

Hi, all, I want to implement a new global path planner for turtlebots with RRTstar or TRRT which are available in OMPL. I have checked Moveit and didn't  find .cpp/.h files or infterfaces to RRTstar/ TRRT.  I also read tutorial of Moveit  and didn't find any instruction on using Moveit for path planning, not to speak of RRTstar/TRRT.
Could  someone give me some advices on using Moveit for path planning with RRTstar?
Thank you !

hi, @isucan, It is well-known that you are one of the greater founders of Moveit and OMPL. Would you like to give me some advices? Thank you!

Hi, @scopus, If you would like to know detailed information about OMPL, I recommend you to post to ompl-users@lists.sourceforge.net. I imagine that it is not better to directly ask a specific person on web site. I expect that your work will make progress.

A:

Did you install ros-hydro-ompl? There is RRTstar.h in opt/ros/hydro/include/ompl/geometric/planners/rrt. Could you check it out? As OMPL is stand alone, you can add RRTstar.h to your code as follows.

#include &ltompl/geometric/planners/rrt/RRTstar.h>

I'm sorry. you wanted to use RRTstar on MoveIt!, didn't you. I wrote how to implement RRTStar with OMPL. In case of MoveIt, some planners you want to apply to a PR2 appear on Rviz. I have never applied a planner to my turtlebot. I continue to edit my code with ompl to make a turtlebot move.

Hi, Ken_in_JAPAN, I am also editing a code with ompl to make a turtlebot move. I just successfully compile the example code in Hydro as I told you. Next time I will try to build it into a global planner and move a turtlebot with it.
