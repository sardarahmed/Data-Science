Q:

XnUserID ROS source code

While looking at the source code for openni_tracker.cpp, I came across a class called XnUserID. I cannot find the constructor for the class, and I have found nothing about it on the internet. Could someone post the constructor for XnUserID as well as its functions, or at least tell me where I can find it?
On a side note, what is Xn supposed to mean? It is in a lot of the code for ROS packages.

A:

XnUserIS is just an XnUInt32:
typedef XnUInt32 XnUserID

All the types that start with Xn are defined by the OpenNI framework. Check it's documentation and API to find out more.

How can it be an unsigned int if it is its own class?
