Q:

autonomous navigation

I want to create an autonomous robot, i start with installing ROS indigo on ubuntu, and i arrived to create a map manually with hector slam and teleop keyboard (i use arduino mega and motors with encoders).
Now i want to launch a file for autonomous navigation on unknown map, what can i do please?
i already saw hector navigation but i don't understand how it works

A:

In the Hector Navigation Stack there is also a hector_exploration_node and a hector_exploration controller. The hector_exploration controller will publish twist messages on the cmd_vel topic. These values will give you a velocity x and an angular z.
If you are using arduino, in the arduino code you need to subscribe to the cmd_vel topic, and then manipulate the values there.
If you want to test and see if you publish values on cmd_vel, run your laser scanner and hector slam and then run
roslaunch hector_exploration node exploration_planner.launch
and
rosrun hector_exploration_controller simple_exploration_controller
then you need to listen to the topic
rostopic echo cmd_vel
After that you should see a stream of values. Mine comes out in bursts.
Hope this helps.

i do this but i receive x=0 y=0 and z=1.4, and the motors don't stop,, it is not synchronised with hector slam.
what can i do in this case please?
