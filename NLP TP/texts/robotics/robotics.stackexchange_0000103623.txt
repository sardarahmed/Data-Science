Q:

Cannot find turtlebot3_gazebo on ROS2 humble on 22.04

I am following this tutorial
https://roboticsbackend.com/ros2-nav2-tutorial/
Although I installed the required packages,
sudo apt install ros-humble-navigation2 ros-humble-nav2-bringup ros-humble-turtlebot3*

I get this error
ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch.py
Package 'turtlebot3_gazebo' not found: "package 'turtlebot3_gazebo' not found, searching: ['/opt/ros/humble']"

here is an excerpt of my variables

[edit]
from the video tutorial , I try to simply run gazebo, and it is just not there at all
pi@pi-ros2:~/WORK$ gazebo
gazebo: command not found
pi@pi-ros2:~/WORK$ sudo find / -name gazebo
[sudo] password for pi:

I created an issue on github
https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/issues/3774
I created another similar issue, as I follow tutorials from F.M Rico's book(Robot programming with ROS2)
https://github.com/fmrico/book_ros2/issues/23
is humble maintained for gazebo and navigation at all ???

A:

https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/issues/3766
"So there's a dependency missing in gazebo-land on ARM64 which is blocking everything from gazebo ros to turtlebot then to us. So unfortunately there's really nothing we can do about it here, but I'd recommend following up in that ticket if you wanted to help fix the issue. Else, building from source is your best bet. The issue isn't much to do with nav2_bringup as much as nothing in gazebo classic will work for you on ARM without compilation."
