Q:

Moveit-catkin build

Why does source installation of moveit package needs to be built with catkin build command instead of catkin_make? What is the advantage of doing so.

A:

It does not need to.
catkin_make works perfectly fine.
Dave Coleman wrote the current build instructions and he's a proponent of the catkin tools over catkin_make.
It handles some things more "user-friendly" than catkin_make, among other things it automatically deals with pure-cmake projects inside the workspace (catkin_make_isolated is required for that). I suppose this is especially important for Dave as he often builds OMPL within the same workspace as far as I know.
Personally, I believe building up more software on top of cmake just moves us back in the direction of rosbuild and that's not were I want to go.. But I do see the "user-friendliness argument".

Its ability to build non-catkin CMake projects is a huge selling point for me, yes. And the ability to delete and rebuild specific packages without having to rebuild the entire workspace is huge. Perhaps we should note on the source install page that catkin_make is fine as well - could you do that?
