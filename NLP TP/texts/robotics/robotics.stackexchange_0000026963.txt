I have seen this fix but is after the 1.9.3 version https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/pull-request/915/added-gui-configuration-via-ini-file

Bon dia Martí:
You are right, the feature was implemented in pull request 915, but it is still not released, hosted in the default branch of the repository, to appear in the next major release of gazebo, the version 3.0. It breaks the API so it is not possible to backport it to previous series. So I'm afraid that you won't be able to use it in gazebo 1.9 series.
