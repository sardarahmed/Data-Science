Q:

dynamic_reconfigure (python) changes in fuerte

I recently migrated to fuerte and noticed that the sick_ldmrs driver is broken due to some changes in dynamic_reconfigure python's API in fuerte.
"apply_changes" in config

had to be changed to
"apply_changes" in config.__dict__

,
self.ros_params = config.copy()

had to be changed to
self.ros_params = copy.deepcopy(config.__dict__)

,
for param_name, value in config.iteritems()

had to be changed to
for param_name, value in config.items()

Accessing the dict from outside of the class seems an ugly trick to me. Because it's a super-private variable... Is there any other way this could be achieved?
