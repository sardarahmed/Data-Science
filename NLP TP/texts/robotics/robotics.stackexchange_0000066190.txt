Q:

Debugging with QtCreator

I am trying to switch from Eclipse to QtCreator (the indexing on Eclipse is very poor after our recent switch from fuerte to indigo). And while I have indexing and building working wonderfully in QtCreator, I cannot get debugging to work at all. I found the following article on this forum:
http://answers.ros.org/question/96586/putting-it-together-where-do-ides-come-in-with-ros-development/
I did the following with QtCreator 3.0.1:

Switch Projects/Build & Run / Run
Set run configuration as the name of my executable
Set program arguments
Set working directory to ~/workspace/bin ( a newly created folder)
Checked my run environment (the ROS_MASTER_URI and ROS_ROOT variables are correctly set)

And then I tried to debug and I get a small error window titled "Unknown error" with no message. Debug never reaches the first line of the program. But if I execute the program by hand, it works fine.
Any ideas on what I have not configured? In general, I should be able to debug with qtcreator, right?

A:

It seems to be a QtCreator problem (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/qtcreator-plugin-cmake/+bug/1299441). Removing the CMakeLists.txt.user file fixes the issue temporarily... upgrading to Creator 3.1.0 may solve the issue.
