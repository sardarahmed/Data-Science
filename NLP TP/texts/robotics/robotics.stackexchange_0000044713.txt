Q:

Geometry tools for python

I want to perform some basic geometry computations using python, for example calculating the euclidean distance between two points. Of course, implementing that is easy enough, but littering code with this kind of basic functions seems pretty redundant.
Searching for a existing solution I only found the pr2_python package. This is basically exactly what I'm looking for, but it is not available as a package from .debs and very heavyweight in it's dependencies.
Any other options, or is everyone just copying and pasting as needed? :)

A:

Alternatives might be numpy/scipy and the tf.transformations library that you can find in tf/src/tf/transformations.py. PyKDL could work, too.
