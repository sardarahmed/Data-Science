Q:

groovy gscam for 12.04armhf not existing?

Hi,
I want to install groovy gscam on 12.04armhf and find it likely doesn't exist since it doesn't show up in synaptic, unlike groovy gscam on x86. Before I try to build it myself, has anyone else tried it (@ahendrix)?
Thanks.

A:

I don't think I built a deb of gscam for 12.04 armhf, but I was using uvc_camera successfully from debs on my robot before upgrading it to Hydro.

Thanks for your response. Just checked, but in synaptic, "ros-groovy-uvc" gives no hits. With "sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-uvc-camera" it doesn't show or up either: Unable to locate package. I tried with uvc_camera as well, but no luck either.

Try compiling from source.

Checking again on x86, I find hydro-uvc-camera, not groovy. After reloading repo's on armhf, nothing again. If you used uvc_camera before hydro, was it actually groovy ?
