Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Sensor fusion

Hey guys,
I have a quadrocopter and want to fuse all sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer, GPS and heading) to determine the position and pose.
What is the best way to do this?

the problem is I don't know how to get the odometry information, which is required for robot_localization
