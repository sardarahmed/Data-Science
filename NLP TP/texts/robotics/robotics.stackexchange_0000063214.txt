Q:

Indigo on Raspberry/Debian - dependency problem / catkin error

Hello together,
I try to get Indigo work on the raasberry pi (raspbian) and get the same probems as mentioned here: http://answers.ros.org/question/192250/raspberry-pi-with-ros-indigo-or-any-new-release-of-ros/ As there is no solution yet, I post some more details, maybe someone can help:
I'm following the steps from the tutorial here: http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Source.
With the following command, I get the dependency problem:
pi@raspberrypi ~/ros_catkin_ws $ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro indigo -y --os=debian:wheezy
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
roslisp: No definition of [libconsole-bridge-dev] for OS [debian]
collada_parser: No definition of [liburdfdom-headers-dev] for OS [debian]
rosconsole_bridge: No definition of [libconsole-bridge-dev] for OS [debian]
class_loader: No definition of [libconsole-bridge-dev] for OS [debian]
urdf: No definition of [liburdfdom-headers-dev] for OS [debian]
collada_urdf: No definition of [liburdfdom-headers-dev] for OS [debian]
urdf_parser_plugin: No definition of [liburdfdom-headers-dev] for OS [debian]
cpp_common: No definition of [libconsole-bridge-dev] for OS [debian]
geometric_shapes: No definition of [libconsole-bridge-dev] for OS [debian]
rosbag_storage: No definition of [libconsole-bridge-dev] for OS [debian]
tf2: No definition of [libconsole-bridge-dev] for OS [debian]

Is there a way to get this solved? I also tryed to install the packages with apt-get, but could not find a source that provides the packages for raspberry pi. And I found that manual installation of the armhf packages from sides like https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=libconsole-bridge-dev does not work, as the dependencies go on and on forever...
Then I red that I could just skip the step above, so I went on to the next step and get the error as follows. Is this error maybe due to some other root cause, and can someone help to solve this? Thanks for any help :-):

A:

I was also trying to get Indigo installed on the Raspberry Pi and I think I've gotten it figured out.  Rosdep needed a few new rules since packages like libconsole-bridge-dev have now been released separately from ROS.  I've written installation instructions for the Raspberry Pi on Indigo, so I'd appreciate if you could try it out and let me know if there are any problems.
(Note that as of 10/2014, libconsole-bridge-dev and liburdfdom-dev haven't made it yet to wheezy, only jessie, so they need to be installed from source - the directions for this are in the installation instructions)

Oh wow, thanks very very much!! The instructions look quite detailed, I will check it in the next days and come back! Thanks again :-)

It all works perfectly, thanks a lot!! I installed ros_comm version. Only comment is that the ros_comm version besides the libconsole-bridge-dev also needs the liblz4-dev. Thanks agin, I would not have made it on my own :-)!

Thanks for the info!  I've updated the instructions to fix that.

Hi, while installing liburdfdom-headers-dev, I forgot to change the name. Is there any way to undo the install, as reinstalling it is leading to some overwrite errors.
Thanks

You should be able to remove the package by running dpkg -r urdfdom-headers and then reinstall using the correct name with checkinstall.
