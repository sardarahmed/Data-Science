Q:

vcs not setup correctly while I install ROS using source

I followed : http://www.ros.org/wiki/diamondback/Installation/Ubuntu/Source
I use the command
 rosinstall ~/ros "http://packages.ros.org/cgi-bin/gen_rosinstall.py?rosdistro=diamondback&variant=desktop-full&overlay=no"

And after a while it appears:
 Installing https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/simulator_gazebo/tags/simulator_gazebo-1.2.8  to /media/634bad56-5543-40fe-843b-cd31f4a95dba/home/sam/ros/simulator_gazebo
 svn: OPTIONS of 'https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/simulator_gazebo/tags/simulator_gazebo-1.2.8': Could not read status line: Secure connection truncated (https://code.ros.org)
 ERROR: Failed to install tree '/media/634bad56-5543-40fe-843b-cd31f4a95dba/home/sam/ros/simulator_gazebo'
  vcs not setup correctly

My ubuntu: uname -a
 Linux sam-desktop 2.6.32-25-generic #45-Ubuntu SMP Sat Oct 16 19:48:22 UTC 2010 i686 GNU/Linux

How to solve it?
Thank you~

A:

"Secure connection truncated" sounds like a network hiccup; what happens if you just run it again?
