What do you get for rosdep db | grep catkin?
Comment by 130s on 2013-02-18:
@Mohsen Hk Btw, I have a feeling that turtle_tf might not require to be rosdep install although the tutorial says to do so. Can you skip that part and see what happens?

That's probably true. Should still work, though!

A:

catkin isn't installed in your machine.
Install it with necessary ROS distro http://www.ros.org/wiki/catkin I haven't tried on fuerte but try:
% sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-catkin
