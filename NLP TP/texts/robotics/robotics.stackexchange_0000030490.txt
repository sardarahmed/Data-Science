Q:

Problem installing gscam

Hi,
I'm trying to install the gscam packet for Rovio. I've checked out the package into the directory /opt/ros/diamondback/stacks. When I try to use the command rosmake --rosdep-install gscam I always get this error "mkdir: cannot create directory `build': Permission denied". I've tried to change the permissions of the directory with no results.
What is wrong?
Thank you

A:

Do not modify the /opt/ros install trees. They contain shared binaries, already built for your system.
To add another package and build it from source, see the new package downloading question. In your case, specify /opt/ros/diamondback in place of /opt/ros/cturtle.

Thank you very much, I follow your suggestion and it works. I can't fix the problem using rosmake on the downloaded package, but I'd like to thanks also GeniusGeeko for the assistance!
