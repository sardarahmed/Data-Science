Q:

RQT_GUI fails after upgrade

After upgrading RQT_GUI now fails when run:
turtlebot@turtleVM:~$ rosrun rqt_gui rqt_gui 
WARNING: Package name "swig-wx" does not follow the naming conventions. It should start with a lower case letter and only contain lower case letters, digits and underscores.

Had this happen on a couple of machines, so quite sure it's not my setup. All packages are now upgraded and nothing is held back.
Seems like the recent upgrades broke a lot of things. Is this a weird situation due to ROS changing hands, or is it unrelated to that?
I've spent a day of leave just trying to get stuff working again, and looks like I won't have my turtlebot running for MakerFaire Adelaide.

A:

It's because the recent faulty release. We're working on it, and looks like the fix is ready to be released into public (although it might take several days. I'm not sure when is the next release date).
Quick workaround if you don't use rqt with kobuki, uninstall kobuki pkgs should work (so far I've only seen this issue to happen when kobukis are installed). But just to be clear, the root cause is in qt_gui_core metapackage and kobuki is not doing any harm.
Sorry for any inconvenience.

Thanks, Issac. I'll keep my eyes out for the new release.

Now the fixed version (qt_gui_core 0.2.15-1) is available publicly.
