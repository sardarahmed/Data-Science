Q:

What's the effect of find_package(catkin components ...)?

It seems that with catkin in Groovy,
find_package(catkin COMPONENTS roscpp std_msgs)

is equivalent to
find_package(catkin)
find_package(roscpp)
find_package(std_msgs)

Is there any difference?

Follow up question: How does CMake know to look for the .cmake config files in the /opt/ros/ directory?

A:

As far as I understand they are equivalent.
The only difference is that find_package(catkin COMPONENTS roscpp std_msgs) will consolidate all of the COMPONENTS into the catkin_* CMake variables, for instance catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS will contain roscpp_INCLUDE_DIRS and std_msgs_INCLUDE_DIRS.

I could have checked the docs: http://ros.org/wiki/catkin/CMakeLists.txt
