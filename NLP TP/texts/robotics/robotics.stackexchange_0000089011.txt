Q:

Got controller gains for six-axis manipulator?

Do you have working PID gains for the effort_controllers/JointTrajectoryController of a six-axis manipulator that I could use as a starting point for tuning the gains on a UR10?  The universal_robot package uses the PositionJointInterface class for getting the joints to their desired positions but this mechanism causes unrealistic interactions between the manipulator and the Gazebo environment.  For that reason I've changed the package locally to use the EffortJointInterface following this example.  The author notes that the gains there are not working.  Please share with me any advice on tuning a 6-R 'bot or working gains for a manipulator.

Do you have the values which worked for you?
Comment by raequin on 2019-03-20:
The values at the link in the accepted answer worked well.
linear_arm_actuator_joint: {p: 10000, d: 500, i: 0, i_clamp: 1}
shoulder_pan_joint: {p: 10000, d: 150, i: 0, i_clamp: 1}
shoulder_lift_joint: {p: 50000, d: 150, i: 10, i_clamp: 50}
elbow_joint: {p: 50000, d: 150, i: 1, i_clamp: 25}
wrist_1_joint: {p: 100, d: 5, i: 0, i_clamp: 1}
wrist_2_joint: {p: 75, d: 2, i: 0, i_clamp: 1}
wrist_3_joint: {p: 25, d: 1, i: 0, i_clamp: 1}

A:

I don't know whether they "work", but you could take a look at the values that OSRF used for the ARIAC 2017 competition: osrf/ariac/src/osrf_gear/launch/ur10/arm_controller_ur10_custom.yaml.

Those values perform better for me than the original ones in the link included in the question.  The ones you referred to are a good starting point for tuning :)

If you manage to improve the behaviour by using different values, it would be nice if you could post here to let us know which values you used.

The first time I used the posted gains was with a voluminous tool on the robot and the manipulator had a lot of overshoot.  Since then, my simulations have used more conventional tooling and performance has been fine.  That is, these gains seem okay to me :)

Nice.
We might add them as defaults to the improved version of the universal_robot packages.
