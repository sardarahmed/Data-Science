Q:

how to use the segbot package for navigation?

Hi,
Could anyone know how to use the segbot package (https://github.com/utexas-bwi/segbot) for navigation?
Currently what I can think is that the following three, but I don't know how to combine this segbot package with the navigation package (https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation)

git clone https://github.com/utexas-bwi/segbot
catkin_make in the catkin_ws folder
roslaunch segbot.launch

Thank you in advance!

A:

I am going to assume you are talking about autonomous navigation here. If you want to setup your navigation configuration, take a look at the documentation on this page: http://wiki.ros.org/navigation
You can also take a look at how we do navigation using the segbot stack in the segbot_navigation package: https://github.com/utexas-bwi/segbot_apps
Between the documentation on navigation and our implementation inside segbot_navigation, I am hopeful that you will figure out the navigation configuration required to run your robot.
You can also try using segbot_navigation directly, with the following caveats:

It is designed for ros hydro
The ABI is unstable and still changed frequently. It should stabilize by the end of year.
