Q:

openni_launch for kinect xbox 360 -1414

so,... i don't know what going on..
i'm using Kinect xbox 360, model 1414.
i've succeed run the example of nite (nite/NITE-Bin-Dev-Linux-x64-v1.5.2.23/Samples/Bin), but, i tried connected it with ros roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch, it shown up:
process[camera_base_link2-23]: started with pid [15373]
process[camera_base_link3-24]: started with pid [15374]
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'openni_wrapper::OpenNIException'
  what():  unsigned int openni_wrapper::OpenNIDriver::updateDeviceList() @ /home/adelleodel/ros/src/openni_camera/src/openni_driver.cpp @ 125 : enumerating image nodes failed. Reason: One or more of the following nodes could not be enumerated:

A:

It appears your device is not connected. Have you given permissions for the USB port being used for the kinect?

how to do it?
Comment by stevemacenski on 2016-02-14:
Try chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0, this should give Ubuntu read and write permissions on all accounts to access USB ports. It expires after some time / terminal closing or something, so if it works now and doesn't later, just try it again
