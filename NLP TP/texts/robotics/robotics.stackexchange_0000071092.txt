Q:

What is the pose topic move_base subscribes to?

move_base extracts the current position from tf. what is the name of the frame it subscribes to relative to /map frame?

A:

move_base actually gets the current position from the costmap (see here).
Thus, you specify the the frame_id in the costmap config file via the ~<name>/robot_base_frame parameter, which defaults to base_link.
As you write correctly, it uses tf to get the current position, so it does not subscribe to a topic other than tf for this.
