Q:

hector map static map

Hello everyone, I'm new to the forum and to ROS.
I'm trying to use hector_slam without it updating the map. The reason is I have loaded a static map via map_server, the map loads correctly but only for a few frames, after which it is replaced by hector generated map.
I modified HectorMappingRos.cpp by switching p_use_static_map. Now no new map is generated (which is good), only laser scans are shown in navViz, but the static map is still removed after a few seconds after the static map is loaded and displayed.
Is there a way to make hector mapping to listen to map_server, or to connect to mapTopic from map_server or to make it not to replace the static map at all?
Thank you,
Octavio

Hello Octavio I am also trying to use hector_mapping with a static map for a school project. Do you have a link to your code or could you explain to me the changes you made in hector mapping?
When I broadcast my .tif map with the map_server the process dies. How did you feed hector_mapping the static map in the launch file?

Hello,
I figured it out. It was an issue with the yalm configuration file having too much offset for the center. A zoom out revealed the map and was able to fix the offset.
Thank you,
Octavio
