Q:

Does robot_localization merge RPY and Quaternion Orientation?

I was wondering whether robot_localization package merges RPY and quaternion orientation data for you (from 2 different sensors), or whether this needs to be done manually prior to sending it to the package?

A:

The EKF and UKF in r_l take in the message types described here. All the message types that have orientation data use quaternions. r_l doesn't support messages with RPY data, so if you only have that, you'll have to convert it.
