Q:

Moveit Setup Assistant crashes when loading a URDF

Hi,
I am doing the Tutorials from http://aeswiki.datasys.swri.edu/rositraining/hydro/Exercises
During the Session 3 Tutorials Moveit! keeps crashing when ever I have to use it.
I am running Ubuntu 13.04 (32-bit), ROS-I Hydro
I noticed that the Moveit Setup Assistant launchens when I start it with:
roslaunch moveit_setup_assistant setup_assistant.launch

But as soon as I try to create a new moveit config pkg by loading a .urdf file it crashes.
The console shows this Error message:
REQUIRED process [moveit_setup_assistant-2] has died!
process has died [pid 7937, exit code -11, cmd /opt/ros/hydro/lib/moveit_setup_assistant/moveit_setup_assistant __name:=moveit_setup_assistant __log:=/home/siemens/.ros/log/c324fdc4-9769-11e4-99d8-c4d98785fc5f/moveit_setup_assistant-2.log].
log file: /home/siemens/.ros/log/c324fdc4-9769-11e4-99d8-c4d98785fc5f/moveit_setup_assistant-2*.log
Initiating shutdown!

the log file /moveit_setup_assistant-2.log does not exist!
This is the urdf file I used: https://www.dropbox.com/s/2mtvf4ctmax9xq5/pr2.urdf?dl=0

Without access to the URDF we cannot really do anything I'm afraid. You might want to try and run the Setup Assistant in GDB. That could provide you with some more information as to where it is crashing precisely, but without proper debug symbols that will probably not be too helpful.

A:

The ROS-Industrial training files also contain "working" solutions to each of the tasks.  They can be found in the "ref" directory as described at the bottom of this page.
Instead of using "training_unit", you can call "training_ref" and that will switch you to the solved package.  You can also diff the working and ref directories to determine what may be causing the issue (assuming the ref version does not cause the same issue).
