Q:

jackal gazebo navigation example

Thanks to jackal gazebo tutorial I was able to run it without any issue, and control the robot's twist using interactive markers.
I'm in the process of building a simple robot with XV-11 lidar and iRobot create as its mobile base.  Before I get all that up and running - I like to learn about navigation stack and would like to run it completely in gazebo.
What would be a simplest setup for me to run Jackal with navigation stack in gazebo?

A:

If you run jackal, look at rqtnode introspection to find out (visually) what topics are coming out of jackal. Basically just play plug and play. Off the top of my head i know an input topic would be "cmd_vel" and the odometry output topic would be "odometry/filtered" since they are running a instance of robot_localization. Then you can just simply follow the Nav stack tutorial http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials and setup all the topics correctly. And when you add a observation source in the common costmap configurations, just put the laser topic coming out of gazebo.
