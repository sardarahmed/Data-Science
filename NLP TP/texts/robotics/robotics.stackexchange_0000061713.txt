Q:

How can use external library in ros

I want to use POCO library within my package.
I followed this manual http://wiki.ros.org/UsingThirdPartyLibraries
but it was not successful.
I tried to add
find_package(poco REQUIRED)
to CMakeLists.txt but cmake can't find it.
Would you please help me to add POCO to my project.

Maybe it might be a good idea to find out if what you'd like to do is handled by http://wiki.ros.org/pluginlib.

A:

The class_loader package uses Poco. Perhaps you can use it as a template?
It looks like they have a cmake directory and a PocoConfig.cmake which describes where to find the Poco libraries, and a dependency on libpoco-dev in their package.xml
