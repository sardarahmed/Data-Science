Q:

How to visualize mass properties with the RobotModel plugin (rviz2)?

I'm trying to visualize in rviz the mass properties of a robot simulation. This properties are in the inertial block in the urdf of each part of the robot. According to this and this threads, this should be implemented, and it is a matter of configuring the RobotModel plugin, so does anybody knows how to do this?
I'm currently using ros2 in foxy.

Is this a duplicate of #q388944?
It actually has a better title.

A:

You tagged this foxy, and that's likely why you can't find the checkbox (which you mention in the comments you posted on ros2/rviz#714).
Unfortunately the CHANGELOG does not seem to make any mention of that PR, nor the feature, but as you can see in ros2/rviz@2b551f80, this feature was merged into RViz2 version 8.7.0:

According to index.ros.org/p/rviz2 (and status_page/ros_foxy_default.html?q=rviz2), RViz2 is at version 8.2.x in Foxy.
The only ROS 2 version which has RViz2 at 8.7.0 would be Rolling at this time. See index.ros.org/p/rviz2/#rolling.
Galactic gets 8.5.0 (index.ros.org/p/rviz2/#galactic).
So that would explain why you don't have that checkbox.

Thank you very much for the answer, now I understand what's happening. Do you think there's a way to make this work in foxy? I'm thinking maybe modifying the files with the changes listed in the commit can work, but I can't find in my local foxy files all the files listed in the commit, I can see the .hpp, but the .cpp I don't know where they are. Any suggestions? Really appreciate your help, thanks again!

You could try and see whether you can build Rolling's RViz2 on Foxy, but there are no guarantees it will work.
Failing that, you could try to backport the changes from just the PR to a Foxy source checkout of RViz2 in a Colcon workspace.
