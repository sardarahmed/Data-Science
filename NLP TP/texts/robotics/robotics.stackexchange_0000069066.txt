Q:

new node registered with same name- arduino

Hi, I have 2 arduino mega connected to 2 usb ports. When i rosserial one is forced to shut down because it says new node registered with same name. This i think because the node.initNode() in both files. In arduino , i cant specify the name of the subscriber node.
How can i overcome this problem

A:

Did you try running each rosserial_python with a different __name argument? See here for a more detailed definition
rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyUSB0 __name:=node1

rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyUSB1 __name:=node2
