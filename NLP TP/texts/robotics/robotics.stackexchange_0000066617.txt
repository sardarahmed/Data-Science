Q:

Tutorial Turtlebot 3dsensor not working with Kinect

Hello,
I am working on Ubuntu 14.04 with ROS Indigo
I was following the turtlebot tutorials, and found that the
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup 3dsensor.launch
instruction in the 3d visualisation tutorial didn't recognize the kinect, while
roslaunch freenect_launch freenect.launch
did.
Then i went on the SLAM tutorial but had the same problem because it use the 3dsensor.launch file.
I had to remove the
agr name="3d_sensor" default="$( env TURTLEBOT_3D_SENSOR)"
line of the 3dsensor.launch and manually select the kinect.launch file in the
include file="$(find turtlebot_bringup)/launch/includes/3dsensor/$(arg 3dsensor ).launch.xml
Is that a problem that happened to others, and actually need a modification of the file to work, or is it that i did something wrong ?
EDIT :
After following jihoonl's advice, i deleted ROS and re installed it from scratch, and this time this part worked fine. But i had another problem when loading the map i created during "SLAM Map Building with TurtleBot"'s tutorial :
The amdl_demo.launch was loading a map whose path was fixed ( find turtlebot_navigation`/maps/willow-2010-02-18-0.10.yaml )and not dependent on the ROS environment variable we were asked to choose. Did i once again forgot some part of the tutorials ?
