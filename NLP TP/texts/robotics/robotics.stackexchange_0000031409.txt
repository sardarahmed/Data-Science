Q:

decimation of image streams?

I have been doing some experimentation with image processing, but I am finding that I am constrained by the available CPU resources.  Is there some method for dropping images from a stream to lower the CPU load?

A:

If you just want to drop frames, throttle in the topic tools should do what you want.
