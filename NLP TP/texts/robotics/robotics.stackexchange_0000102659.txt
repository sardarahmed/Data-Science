Q:

Can't connect custom msg to publisher and subscriber

Hi. Sorry for all mistakes, English is not my native language. So, I created custom .msg and tested it with not_composable.cpp simple publisher and subscriber that was taken from here in separate package and project has successfully builded. After that I used same CMakeLists.txt and package.xml comands and used them in my original  package and I have following error:
By not providing "Findminicar_control.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "minicar_control", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "minicar_control"
  with any of the following names:

    minicar_controlConfig.cmake
    minicar_control-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "minicar_control" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "minicar_control_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
  If "minicar_control" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
  sure it has been installed.

Where minicar_control is package that contains my .msg files and in this package I create publisher and subscriber.
This method works normally with my test package. .msg was created using this guide and added to package with commands that are shown in this duide.
Appreciate any help and suggestions

I am sorry, but are the publisher and the .msg files in the same package? If yes, then you need a few changes in CMakeLists.txt file as shown in the following question: #q402196
