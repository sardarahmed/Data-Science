Q:

Default values inside a message or srv definition

elements in a srv or msg definition are assigned zero values by the default constructor. What about when I wish to assign a non-zero or other special value as the default initialization value to a msg element.
using a construct such as:
int32 x=100

regards x as a constant when the msg headers are generated.
Is what I'm looking for possible at all? Thanks much

A:

Not in the message definition, itself. The problem is that message generation must support multiple languages.
For any specific language (like Python or C++), you can probably define your own derived class for the message with a constructor that fills in useful default values.
