Q:

Swig-wx does not contain CMakeLists.txt file

Hi,
my current build of Groovy on ARM / Linaro 12.11 fails because swig-wx does not contain a CMakeLists.txt file. "git status" says it's "on branch groovy-devel". What's going on? Any idea how I can reconstruct this file?
Thanks a lot in advance,
Bj√∂rn

A:

swig-wx is built using autotools not CMake. You need to do the standard ./configure && make && make install to compile it from source not add it to your catkin workspace.
