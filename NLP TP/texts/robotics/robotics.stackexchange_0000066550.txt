Q:

Laser scan to probabilistic map based on occupancy grid

Hi all,
I would like to transform laser data (LaserScan) in a local 2D occupancy grid (OccupancyGrid). I tried to use "gmapping" and it worked well. But gmapping builds a global map while I only need the local one.
Is there a simple solution (a package or a node) to build a local map around the robot? Could you please tell me what should I do in details? or show me some references?
Thank you.

Hi,
I finally found a node ROS that can do that. But can be run only on ROS Indigo. More information on this page : http://wiki.ros.org/local_map

Hi!
Can you please tell me how do you run the local_map? I'm tried to run the package but it tells me that there is no executable.
Thanks!
