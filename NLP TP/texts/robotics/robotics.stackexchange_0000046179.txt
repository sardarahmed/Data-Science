Q:

Undefined reference for string constant in service

Hi,
when I define a simple service, e.g.
string my_string
string CONST_STRING=some_value
---

I get an undefined reference to ...::CONST_STRING during linking. Looking at the generated header file, I noticed that CONST_STRING gets declared, but never defined. I tested the same with messages, here it works fine and I can see the definition of CONST_STRING.
The same applies for floatXX-- I guess that problem exists for every constant that can not be encoded into an enum.
Am I doing something wrong,or is this a bug in gensrv? I'm working with Fuerte
Thanks a lot for your help!
Markus

I think nowadays, after everything was moved to github, the ticket should be filed here.
