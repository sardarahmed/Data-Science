Q:

How to install Kinetic on Ubuntu 14?

is it possible to install Kinetic on Ubuntu 14? The obvious sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-ros-base fails.

A:

The Kinetic installation instructions clearly state that binary packages (apt-get) for ROS Kinetic are only available for Ubuntu Wily (15.10) and Xenial (16.04).
I'd recommend that you use ROS Indigo instead (it is a long-term support release compatible with Ubuntu 14.04)
If you have a specific package that you need, you can try to build it from source on Indigo (usually works), or you can build Kinetic from source, but the full source installation can take a while.

Will a ROS node on a computer running Indigo be able to communicate to ROS nodes on a system running Kinetic?

Probably. Perhaps if you asked about what you're actually trying to do instead of asking about a proposed solution without context, we could help you better. (See http://xyproblem.info/ )
