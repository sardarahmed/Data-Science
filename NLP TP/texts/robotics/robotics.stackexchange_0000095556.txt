Q:

How do you find rosdep definition location?

When running:
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -y

The outout is:
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved to system dependencies:  spin_database: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [lamp]

My understanding from reading this (https://answers.ros.org/question/320734/cannot-locate-rosdep-definition/) is that rosdep looked for a package that is named lamp.
The node spin_database is a node that I have created, but I am not aware of where rosdep is looking for this definition.
Where can I find the location of these dependencies?

A:

The rosdep DB is here: ros/rosdistro/rosdep, in most cases you'll want to look at base.yaml.

My understanding from reading this (https://answers.ros.org/question/320734/cannot-locate-rosdep-definition/) is that rosdep looked for a package that is named lamp.

No, not quite. rosdep tries to lookup the key lamp in the database. Note the difference: a key has to be resolved to a package name. It's not a package name itself, unless it's the name of a ROS package. But then you would most likely get a different error.

Ahh ok, I see. Do you know where and why it is looking for the key "lamp"?

Most likely because you've listed it as a build or exec depend in your package.xml, or it's listed in one of the other packages in the workspace.
