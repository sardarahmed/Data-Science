Q:

What tools do you like to use for LiDAR Point Cloud Analysis and Manipulation?

Hello,
Are there open source tools you like to use for manipulating and analyzing LiDAR data (.pcd, .las, .laz)? Generally the problems I am trying to solve are related to robotics.
Here's a list of features I am looking for preferably also having a GUI as an interface.

Labeling pointcloud data and their classes

Scale.ai (Commercial)

Segments.ai (Commercial)

Labelbox (Commercial)

Label Cloud

Manually adjusting LiDAR frames/entire sections (translations, rotations) with visualization/tools. Not just applying transformations via script.

Viewing the pointcloud data and in different modes (intensity, RGB, distance, etc.)

RVIZ

pcl_viewer

Cloud compare

Projecting LiDAR points onto an image or plane for creating 2D Vector maps

Tier IV

Tools to assist in auto-stitching lidar frames together to create a map

Converting between point cloud formats

PDAL

Comparing point cloud data files

LAStools

Cloud compare

General filtering, outlier removal, and manipulation

LAStools

pcl library

I'm sure I am missing other useful features and undervaluing some tools I listed above (pcl_library, LAStools, CloudCompare). I am a LiDAR newbie looking to deep dive into all that is wonderful with LiDARs and robotics!

A:

After trying out various tools, I really like using PDAL for quick conversions and downsizing of your pointcloud.
Cloudcompare has been very helpful for almost everything else and can do most of what PDAL does. HIGHLY recommend.
