Q:

Quadcopter - is iPhone the ultimate flight controller?

iPhone contains

Gyroscope
GPS
Two photo and video cameras
Self-sufficient battery that outlives the motor battery
Wifi
Backup connectivity (cellular, bluetooth)
Programmable computer
Real-time image processing capabilities and face detection
General purpose IO (with something like this)

and old models are available very cheap.
What is the main benefit of having a separate dedicated flight controller and camera on hobbyist rotorcraft rather than a general purpose device like the iPhone?

A:

Speaking from experience, smartphones (android in my case) do work as flight controllers but they have significant drawbacks

The operating system gets in the way. You don't have root access and can't kill off unnecessary processes.
The cameras are decent, but somewhat narrow field-of-view. Dual cameras  are not setup to enable stereo vision and even trying to use both at the same time overheats the phone quickly.
Camera placement is fixed relative to the body (problem if you want to look forward rather than down)
IMU sensors are really cheap which leads to noisy signals
Everything is thermally connected and not well cooled, so sensors exhibit significant drift.
You still need extra processors. Most motors talk over PWM or i2c so you need a board to receive commands from the phone and translate.
WIFI range is smaller than most RC transmitter/receiver pairs.

Like I said, you can make it work but it is not optimal.
