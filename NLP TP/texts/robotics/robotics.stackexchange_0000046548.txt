Q:

How to write a pr2 controller like base_controller

Hello allï¼Œ
I want to write a pr2 controller to control the robot manipulators by sending commands in another executing file (not in command line). But the tutorials link text did everything inside the plugin. I saw the way to use the base_controller to control the pose of the robot. It is the way I want to control the robot. link text But I don't know how to write a controller like the base_controller. If anyone knows how to do that, please give me some help. I really appreciate that.
Thanks,
Xiaolong
