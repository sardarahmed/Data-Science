Q:

How do you re-specify the current step_queue using a Python script

What is the code similar to: self.client.sendgoal(walkgoal) used in the Keyboard Teleop example that sends only an updated set of steps while the BDI continues to actively execute a step list.  Do we need to specify where in the list of 4 steps these numbered steps need to be inserted?  Can we specify steps further out then the 4 steps that the controller is holding?

A:

You can only specify the next 4 steps, and you can know when there is another needed by looking at the "/atlas/atlas_sim_interface_state" message which specifies "walk_feedback" which has the field "next_step_index_needed":
