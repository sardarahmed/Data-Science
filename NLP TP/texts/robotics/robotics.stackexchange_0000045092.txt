Q:

nodelets in python

Hi all -- I don't know much about python threading nor how nodelets are actually implemented, so please pardon me if this is a stupid question, but is there any way to get nodelet functionality using rospy?

A:

Python being more dynamic doesn't need as much structure as C++ for loading plugins.  If you want to see an example of using plugins in python I suggest you take a look at roswtf.

I haven't seen a explicit nodelet for python. It would be quite useful to mix, in the same nodelet manager, a python nodelet and a C++ nodelet
