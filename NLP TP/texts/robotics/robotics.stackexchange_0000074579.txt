Q:

Is there any URDF plugin available for Autodesk Fusion 360?

Hey There,
I am currently using Solidworks to model a Robotic Arm, and "SW2URDF" plugin to generate the URDF file( so that I can  run that in Gazebo and Rviz).
But I wish to switch to Autodesk Fusion 360. Is there any URDF plugin available for Autodesk Fusion 360?.
Thank You.

Hello,
I wrote a Fusion 360 script to export URDF.
https://github.com/syuntoku14/fusion2urdf
Currently, this can export only revolute joint. Let me know if your model contains joints except for revolute.
I hope this will help you!

My model has some slider joints! I want to convert it to urdf, so that I can use it in ros-gazebo
