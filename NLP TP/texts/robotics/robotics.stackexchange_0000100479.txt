I'm sorry to have to do this for something seemingly minor, but please don't post screenshots of terminal text or source code in question on ROS Answers. It's all text, so there is no need. Just copy-paste the text from the terminal or the source into your question text. Do make sure to format it properly by selecting the text and pressing ctrl+k (or clicking the Preformatted Text button (the one with 101010 on it)).
You don't need to post a new question, just edit your curent one. You can use the edit button/link for this.
After you replace the screenshot with the error message itself, we can re-open your question.

Hi @N.N.Huy that's old tutorial. Try installing navigation package: sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-husky-navigation

For Husky more recent tutorials, check this: https://www.clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/kinetic/husky/HuskyMove.html

A:

Use a more recent version of Husky tutorial
https://www.clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/kinetic/husky/HuskyMove.html
install the simulator from the most recent Noetic version.
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-husky-simulator
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-husky-desktop

For HUSKY MOVE BASE DEMO you also need to install:
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-husky-navigation
