Q:

Place marker offset from robots position

I am currently detecting an object using the Kinect and have the depth of the object. I am wanting to display this object in rviz by representing it as a simple marker.
What I am having trouble with is finding the transformed location of my robots position (with offset) to /map. i.e I want to do something like rosrun tf tf_echo /map /base_footprint + (0, 1, 0) (1m Y offset).
I have gone through the tf python tutorials and have successfully set up broadcasters and listeners I am just having trouble transforming a pose given an offset of some kind. (I can successfully transform between /map and /base_footprint but I cannot add an offset to /base_footprint)
I am sure I am missing something simple, just having a bit of trouble getting this going.

Welcome. It would be helpful to know what you've tried so far (such as your code).

A:

A static transform publisher can create a new frame relative to an another one:
rosrun tf static_transform_publisher 0 1 0 0 0 0 base_footprint base_offset 0.1

http://wiki.ros.org/tf#static_transform_publisher
With that running you could then do a tf_echo with base_offset in the map frame (given a tf between map and base_footprint exists), or have a rviz Marker or Axes use the base_offset frame to visualize it.
