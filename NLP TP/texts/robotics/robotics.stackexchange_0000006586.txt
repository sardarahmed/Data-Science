Q:

Denavit-Hartenberg convention or the product of exponentials formulation, when dealing with the manipulator kinematics?

Though, Denavit-Hartenberg notation is commonly used to describe the kinematics of robot manipulator, some researcher prefer the product of exponential instead; and even the claim that it's better.
Which one should I use, and which one is generally better; is final solution same for both kinematics and dynamics?
Any suggestions?

A:

They are two different ways of getting the same thing. Correctly set D-H parameters will give the exact same kinematics and dynamics as correctly set POE parameters. There are well-defined (although tedious) ways to convert between the two.
So "better" or not purely  is up to user preference. Some people prefer D-H because for many setups they give a unique set of parameters to describe the system. There are some configurations, though, for which D-H parameters are not unique.
The big advantage of POE is you just define the 6-DOF relationship between two joints. Often this ends up being more intuitive than using D-H parameters. The downside is two different people might define that differently. The resulting dynamics are exactly the same, though.
