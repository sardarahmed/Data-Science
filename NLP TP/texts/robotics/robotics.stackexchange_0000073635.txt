Q:

rosbridge - communicate with ros using another Laptop

I am following this example:
http://wiki.ros.org/roslibjs/Tutorials/BasicRosFunctionality
I have two laptops, one is running Ubuntu with ROS; the other is running Windows. What I want to do is to control ROS using a non-ROS platform and I chose to use webpages running on browsers.
Experiment 1: Both browser(client) and rosbridge-server on a same computer
It works! And green "connected" showed up. Actually, both
ros.connect('ws://192.168.1.109:9090/');

and
ros.connect('ws://localhost:9090/');

works. Successful message of connected shows.
Experiment 2: Browser is running on another PC in the same LAN
I tried to use the following code in html. "192.168.1.109" is the IP address of the computer which is hosting the rosbridge-server in LAN. The LAN is setup through a TPLINK wireless router.
ros.connect('ws://192.168.1.109:9090/');

I could not get successful connected message.
When I typed http://192.168.1.109:9090/ in my browser in Windows, the following info showed up:
Can "Upgrade" only to "WebSocket".

There is some information showed up! So I guess there is some sort of connection!
However, I just cannot get the simple.html run right with successful message of "Connected".
Why is that?

A:

I was using html code from github. It shall be a whole folder but I only used the html file in my PC.
The 6th line of simple.html is:
<script src="../build/roslib.js"></script>

The solution is to replaced it with
<script src="http://cdn.robotwebtools.org/roslibjs/current/roslib.min.js"></script>

I found the bug using debug tool provided by Chrome. Apparently I am not familiar with web programming at all.
