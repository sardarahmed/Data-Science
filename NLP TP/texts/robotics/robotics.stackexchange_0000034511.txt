Q:

rviz segfault in ros-electric

I have just installed ros-electric. However, when I tried "rosrun rviz rviz", the error occurred as:
[ INFO] [1317134200.383469425]: rviz revision number 1.6.4
[ INFO] [1317134200.383560843]: ogre_tools revision number 1.6.2
[ INFO] [1317134200.383580665]: compiled against OGRE version 1.7.3 (Cthugha)
Segmentation fault
My os's version is ubuntu11.04, and gpu is ATI HD6630. Thank you for your help.

The developers will probably need a gdb stack backtrace to help with this.

Hi kexiang,
I suppose you have the same problem discussed here http://answers.ros.org/question/2109/rviz-in-ros-electric#3609
I think you should look at hersh 2nd answer. If you have still problems post the same things I posted in my last answer.
Hope it helps!

Thank you for answering. Before your answer,I tried uninstall the closed driver of ATI, then rviz worked normally. However, it still gives out information:
