Q:

some question about the frame of the hector slam

Hello everyone:
I am studying the hector slam .
I have some questions when I watch the some example about the .launch file:
1.what is the base_stabilized frame ?
2.what is the scan_matcher frame ?
Is there some special affect for them?
Thanks in advance:)

A:

base_stabilized is the frame which provides height data of the robot relative to the map/odom/base_footprint frames, but does not provide any orientation data. Not too sure about, scan_matcher. It might be the output frame from the laser_scan_matcher node. This node will match scans to a map, and publish a transform of the source based on feature mapping.
