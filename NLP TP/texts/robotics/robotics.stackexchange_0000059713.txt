Q:

rviz error: "Discarding message from [/move_base] due to empty frame_id"

Yesterday, I could navigate my turtlebot with eband_local_planner. but today, I can't move it. So, rviz says following warning.

[ WARN] [1401378967.283247030]: MessageFilter [target=map ]: Discarding message from [/move_base] due to empty frame_id.  This message will only print once.
[ WARN] [1401378967.283417501]: Invalid argument passed to canTransform argument source_frame in tf2 frame_ids cannot be empty
[ WARN] [1401378998.796621804]: Invalid argument passed to canTransform argument source_frame in tf2 frame_ids cannot be empty
[ WARN] [1401379032.819038628]: Invalid argument passed to canTransform argument source_frame in tf2 frame_ids cannot be empty

Does anyone have any idea to solve these warning?
After that, Eband_local_planner says that it can't make path as following

[ INFO] [1401378966.134403366]: Global plan set to elastic band for optimization

My turtlebot moves with base_local_planner, even though same error and warning happens.

Can you use ros console to figure out which module these messages originate from?

A:

Apparently eband_local_planner is having trouble finding a plan, but is still publishing messages to /move_base. The problem is that these messages have an empty frame_id, as the warning states, so rviz can't make any sense of it. I have never used that planner, so I can't help you solve your problem, but that's all rviz is saying as far as I am aware.
