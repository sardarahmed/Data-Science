Q:

how to install Move_base action lib message

Hellow,
I'm trying to follow the tutorial from here so i created the package but I have this error :
-- ==> add_subdirectory(simple_navigation_goals)
CMake Error at /opt/ros/groovy/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:72 (find_package):
Could not find a configuration file for package move_base_msgs.

Set move_base_msgs_DIR to the directory containing a CMake configuration
file for move_base_msgs.  The file will have one of the following names:

move_base_msgsConfig.cmake
move_base_msgs-config.cmake

Call Stack (most recent call first):
simple_navigation_goals/CMakeLists.txt:7 (find_package)

I guess it's because I miss some package but I have all those installed already :
ros@ros-K56CM:~$ dpkg -l | grep navigation
ii  libdvdnav4                                  4.2.0-1                                             DVD navigation library

These includes messages for actions (actionlib_msgs), diagnostics (diagnostic_msgs), geometric primitives (geometry_msgs), robot navigation (nav_msgs), and common sensors (sensor_msgs), such as laser range finders, cameras, point clouds.

[EDIT]
rospack find move_base_msgs
/opt/ros/groovy/stacks/navigation/move_base_msgs

the CmakeLists :
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)
project(simple_navigation_goals)

## Find catkin macros and libraries
## if COMPONENTS list like find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS xyz)
## is used, also find other catkin packages
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
 actionlib
 move_base_msgs
 roscpp
)

catkin_package(
#  INCLUDE_DIRS include
#  LIBRARIES simple_navigation_goals
#  CATKIN_DEPENDS actionlib move_base_msgs roscpp
#  DEPENDS system_lib
)

include_directories(
 ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS}
)

add_executable(simple_navigation_goals src/hello.cpp)
target_link_libraries(simple_navigation_goals ${catkin_LIBRARIES})

can you add the output of rospack find move_base_msgs to your question?

A:

The correct package is installed, as you can see from the rospack command (the package is actually ros-groovy-navigation).
Please post the contents of your CMakeLists.txt and package.xml. Likely there is a missing declaration of the the dependency on move_base_msgs that is causing your cmake error.
Edit: aha, I didn't realize at first but the navigation stack in groovy is still not catkinized, so you can not use it in catkin packages. Either update to hydro, or use rosbuild/rosmake in for your package as well.

Can I let every other part of the project under catkin and just the node that use the navigation stack under rosbuild/rosmake ?
Comment by demmeln on 2014-04-03:
Maybe. It depends on the dependencies within your project. As a general rule, dry packages ( = rosbuild) can depend on dry packages and wet packages ( = catkin). On the other hand wet packages cannot depend on dry packages.
Comment by demmeln on 2014-04-03:
So anything that depends on the navigation stack, either directly or indirectly will have to use rosbuild. But your package that depends on navigation, can perfectly fine depend on other catkin packages in your project.
Comment by Maya on 2014-04-03:
Here this package send goals to the move_base node. It's the only one that needs the navigation dependancies right? I mean for example I see no reason for my node publishingthe Odometry to can't be on catkin. Am I right?
Comment by demmeln on 2014-04-03:
That is correct, as long as it does not depend on the package that depends on navigation. Sounds like this is the case. I'm not sure what other packages in groovy besides the navigation stack are dry, so you have to also watch out for those if you depend on them.
