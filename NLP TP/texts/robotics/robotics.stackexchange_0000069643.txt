Q:

Terminal Freezes after roslaunch event

I want to spawn a pioneer3at robot in gazebo through ros so I created a file called p3at.launch and made the corresponding urdf file. When I roslaunch it, it started normally but freezes. Terminal looks like this -
//Terminal
arpit@arpit-SVE15137CNB:/opt/ros/indigo/share/urdf$ roslaunch gazebo_ros p3at.launch

... logging to /home/arpit/.ros/log/ee1fb8ae-5bcf-11e5-97ce-b8763fea9d09/roslaunch-arpit-SVE15137CNB-16521.log

And here is the launch file

  <arg name="world" default="worlds/empty.world" />

  <arg name="urdf" default="$(find urdf)/pioneer3at.urdf" />

  <param name="robot_description" command="$(find xacro)/xacro.py $(arg urdf)" />
  <node name="spawn_urdf" pkg="gazebo_ros" type="spawn_model" args="-param robot_description -urdf -model $(arg name)" /> 
  <node name="robot_state_publisher" pkg="robot_state_publisher" type="robot_state_publisher" />

  </launch>

That looks normal. What do you expect it to do?
Comment by Arpit on 2015-09-15:
It does not launch the gazebo simulator with the p3at robot. It is not doing anything after this whereas the other launch files are launched in the gazebo simulator.

May be your processor is slow or less RAM. What is your processor and how much RAM ?

A:

It looks like your launch file doesn't include an instance of gazebo; only the spawner, which expects to connect to gazebo.
If you want to solve this on your own, compare your launch file to an existing launch file that behaves the way you expect, with a different robot.
If you want more help, please edit your question to include the launch file that you've written.
EDIT
Your launch file does not start gazebo.
You can start gazebo by adding the following include to your launch file:
<include file="$(find gazebo_ros)/launch/empty_world.launch">
  <arg name="use_sim_time" value="true"/>
  <arg name="debug" value="false"/>
</include>
