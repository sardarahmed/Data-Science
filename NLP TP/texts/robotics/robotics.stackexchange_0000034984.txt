Q:

cannot get Julius to run properly

I get this error message:
read waveform input
Stat: adin_oss: device name = /dev/dsp (application default)
Error: adin_oss: failed to open /dev/dsp
failed to begin input stream
Everything seems to be working until it reads the mic, then error.  It is in the Rear input of the desktop.  It cannot open it.  I tried the voice recorder program and it inputs and outputs fine. What do I do now??
Thanks in advance.
