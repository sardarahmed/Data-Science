Does anyone know how to fix this?
Have this problem while compiling all the packages on OSX:
ros_ws/orocos_kinematics_dynamics/python_orocos_kdl/cmake/FindSIP.py", line 8, in <module>
  import sipconfig
ImportError: No module named sipconfig
CMake Error at cmake/FindSIP.cmake:54 (MESSAGE):

A:

Sip is not on your PYTHONPATH most likely.
See the Caveat for sip:
$ brew info sip
sip: stable 4.13.3, HEAD
http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/sip
/usr/local/Cellar/sip/4.13.3 (9 files, 600K) *
https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/commits/master/Library/Formula/sip.rb
==> Caveats
For non-homebrew Python, you need to amend your PYTHONPATH like so:
  export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH

This Caveat is where this step of the Homebrew install instructions come from:
