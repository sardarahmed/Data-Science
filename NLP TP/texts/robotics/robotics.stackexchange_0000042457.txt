How do I bring up the Prime Sense User Tracker viewer? I ran rosrun openni_tracker openni_tracker and it looks like it published to /tf.

Hi,
It sounds like you're trying to get skeleton tracking? Take a look at this thread, it may be useful...

Also, I had written something up on my blog a while back about skeleton tracking using the same components (thanks Pi Robot!). You can look at that here... scroll down to the section on skeleton tracking though to save some time
