Q:

Guidlines on meshes and image textures

Hello all, are there general guidelines for images used as textures for collada files?
I have a faint recollection that these images are supposed to be square and maybe also have dimensions that are powers of 2 (e.g. 64x64, 512x512, etc.).. I also know that small is better from a memory/speed concern.. but what are the practical guidelines that should be followed?

A:

You are correct on all accounts. The textures should be square and powers of two. Smaller is also more efficient.
