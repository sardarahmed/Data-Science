Q:

Navigation Experimental Stack

Dear All,
I was trying to make eband_local_planner to get it worked.
As I understand from the code, it is implemented as a plugin to ROS base local planner.
Can you please advise on how to get it to work ?
Should I launch something like the below ?

also, what needs to be added in the manifest file.
Best Regards
Praveen

A:

In your launch file, add the following parameter to your move_base node:
<node name="move_base" type="move_base" pkg="move_base">
    ...
    <param name="base_local_planner" value="eband_local_planner/EBandPlannerROS" />
</node>
