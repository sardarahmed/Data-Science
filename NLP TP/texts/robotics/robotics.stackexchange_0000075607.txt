Q:

Sending goals outside global costmap

Hi, we're currently setting up a robot using stereo navigation using rtabmap_ros and a zed. We're using the pointcloud to generate costmaps, and we can send goals via 2D Nav Goal using rviz which gives us a plan and allows move_base to send a /cmd_vel message.
We've got a few problems though, first of all we want to be able to send goals outside of the global cost map by having the user clicking a regular map (that is, the user has a map, but the robot simply receives a goal outside of its costmap). Obviously this makes it impossible for the planner to make a plan, but we want to explore the perimeter of the global cost map in order to reach the goal. How can this be done?

A:

In rtabmap, you can initialize the minimum size of the map with grid_size parameter:
<node pkg="rtabmap_ros" type="rtabmap" name="rtabmap">
   <param name="grid_size" type="double" value="50"/> <!-- 50 meters wide -->
</node>

cheers
