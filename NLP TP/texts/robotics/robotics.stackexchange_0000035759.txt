Q:

What's the meaning of global in getGlobalCallbackQueue()?

Hi there!
Does the getGlobalCallbackQueue function return a pointer to a queue shared by all the nodes? or does it return a pointer to a queue intended global within the node?
Thanks a lot.

A:

It's a pointer to the default callback queue for that node. All callbacks by default in that node use this callback queue, unless specified otherwise at construction.
