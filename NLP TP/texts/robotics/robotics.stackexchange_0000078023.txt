Q:

CMakeLists pkg-config opencv C++

I made program with "opencv2/nonfree/features2d.hpp" like this include.
#include "opencv2/nonfree/features2d.hpp"

When I compile the program, I need some option like this.
g++ filename.cpp `pkg-config opencv --cflags --libs`

These are no error. But I don't know how to write this on CMakeLists.
When I do catkin_make, these are same error that I compiled without option.
Please tell me.
Thanks.

A:

A quick google search for "cmake opencv" turns up: http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/introduction/linux_gcc_cmake/linux_gcc_cmake.html
Following the example there, it looks like you need to add the following to your CMakeLists:
find_package( OpenCV REQUIRED )

And then link to OpenCV with:
target_link_libraries( your_executable ${OpenCV_LIBS} )

But, I can solve it by your advice.
