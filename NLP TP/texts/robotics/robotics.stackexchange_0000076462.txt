Q:

Unable to locate package ros-indigo-desktop-full

I am trying  to install Indigo-desktop-full on Ubuntu 14.04.  I am going through the install for Indigo.  I have set up my keys, and did the updates.  I keep getting Unable to locate package ros-indigo-desktop-full.  Is there a problem with the site?  Or am I doing something wrong.
Thanks,
Brent

Can you install any of the other packages?
Comment by SL Remy on 2016-09-25:
What do you see when you type apt-get install ros<\tab>   (i.e. press the tab key)?

As SL Remy pointed out, it could be that the package is not available on your repositories for your architecture (e.g ARM vs amd64). If that is the case you may be able to find the non-complete package (ros-indigo-ros-base) and then selectively find and add what you need from packages or source.

I did get it to work.  I had some problems with Ubuntu.  Thanks for your help.

Could you perhaps describe what kind of problems you had, and how you solved them? That could help future readers.

A:

Dont know if this still actual, but you can find the package only for the 64-Bit version of Ubuntu. Is that probably your problem?
