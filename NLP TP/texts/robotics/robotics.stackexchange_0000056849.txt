Q:

Can't Install RosJava

I am trying to follow this rosJava installation tutorial: here
When running catkin_make I get the following error:
    FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
A problem occurred configuring root project 'android_core'.
> Could not resolve all dependencies for configuration ':classpath'.
   > Could not find any version that matches org.ros.rosjava_bootstrap:gradle_plugins:[0.2,0.3).
     Required by:
         :android_core:unspecified

I am using the ADT with eclipse on version 19 of the SDK.

A:

Sorry, they should be pointing at the hydro branches - experimental code has been going into the master branches and is not continually tested.
I updated the links on the wiki page to point to the android hydro rosinstallers.
Give them a whirl and thanks for the heads up.
