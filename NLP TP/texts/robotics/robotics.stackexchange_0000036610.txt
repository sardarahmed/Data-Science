Q:

need clue for "exit code 40"

When I ran a self-developed ros node via roslaunch, it could run for some time, e.g., 10 mins, and then reports the following error and quit:
"[dm-1] process has died [pid 4365, exit code 40].
log files: /home/robot/.ros/log/0119ddc6-2ad9-11e1-be05-000df06e274c/dm-1*.log"
I couldn't find any info about the exit code 40, so any help will be welcome and appreciated.

It's weired, the same code runs without crash on another computer.
What could be the reason to cause the program terminatation, which is specific to the first computer?
