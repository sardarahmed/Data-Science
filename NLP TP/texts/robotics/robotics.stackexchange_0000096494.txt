Q:

No joy package in noetic?

I cannot find or install the ros-noetic-joy package. I am on Ubuntu 20.04 and installed ROS Noetic according to the instructions here: http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu
When I search for it, I get the following:
$ apt search ros-noetic-joy
Sorting... Done
Full Text Search... Done
ros-noetic-joy-teleop/focal,now 0.4.0-1focal.20200608.160320 amd64 [installed]
  A (to be) generic joystick interface to control a robot

ros-noetic-joystick-interrupt-dbgsym/focal 0.8.8-1focal.20200616.142941 amd64
  debug symbols for ros-noetic-joystick-interrupt

Is the joy package available in noetic?

A:

Its been released https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/blob/master/noetic/distribution.yaml and the builds successful http://build.ros.org/job/Nbin_uF64__joy__ubuntu_focal_amd64__binary/. The last sync was a couple days before https://discourse.ros.org/t/new-packages-for-noetic-2020-07-03/15232 so its available just not released to apt yet. You can access it with shadow fixed or build from source.

Thanks. Do you know when it might be released to apt?
Comment by sloretz on 2020-07-10:
A new sync should happen within a couple weeks, after which it will be available via the main apt repo
