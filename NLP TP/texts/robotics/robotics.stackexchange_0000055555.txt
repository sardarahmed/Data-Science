Q:

About the camera calibration parameters

Hi,
I have been looking at the camera calibration parameters generated during the calibration and the explanation of the cameraInfo parameters in the ROS wiki.
I can't figure out what the K' matrix is and how the projection matrix is obtained. I thought it would be given by P=K*R but the math doesn't add up.
Thanks!

A:

The CameraInfo message definition describes each of the parameters in great detail.
