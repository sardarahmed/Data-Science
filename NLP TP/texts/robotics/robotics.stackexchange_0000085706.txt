Q:

VMWare Ubuntu low graphics mode after installing Kinetic

So this is exactly what I do:
Install a new VM with 8gb ram, from e.g. VMWare easy install, using file ubuntu-16.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso
apt-get install open-vm-tools open-vm-tools-desktop

follow ros official install guide for Kinect, add sources, keys, run update then
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-desktop-full

after it installs if I reboot the os I get to the screen
The system is running in low-graphics mode

the output of dmesg gave several errors like this
[drm:vmw_fb_setcolreg [vmwgfx]] *ERROR* Bad regno xxx

Welcome! Do you mean Kinetic (vs Kinect)? I'm not sure that this is a ROS issue. Please see this Ask Ubuntu post.

Yes, Kinetic, sorry for this. I've been thru several of those "fixes" at Ubuntu, none of them fixed it.
It seems to be more like a VMWare issue, since I did exactly the same at a VirtualBox VPC and it worked ok.

A:

Reading along the web and trying other stuff I fixed it by doing
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade

Hope this helps someone else
