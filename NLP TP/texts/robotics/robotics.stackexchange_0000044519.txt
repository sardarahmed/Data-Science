Q:

Is it possible to get navigation 1.10.1?

Hi, i am a beginner and is using the navigation stack for my school project. The function that I am interested in is the base_local_ planner. On its web page section 4 generic local planning, it is mentioned that it is possible to create custom local planner. However, this is only for release 1.10.1. But I can't get navigation 1.10.1, even after running apt-get update. (mine is 1.8.3, after checking the Cmakelist). May i know if navigation 1.10.1 is out yet? If so how can i get it?

A:

The nav stack did change in that respect, so if you can, you should use the new code.
The new classes as shown on that wiki page make it easier for you to create a custom local planner.
You can use the sources for 1.9/1.10 with ros 1.8 as well, the APIs did not change.
And to get it, just download the sources.
$ hg pull https://kforge.ros.org/navigation/navigation

will get you the sources, if you use rosws, you can do
$ roslocate info navigation 
- hg:
    local-name: navigation
    meta:
      repo-name: rosdistro_fuerte
    uri: https://kforge.ros.org/navigation/navigation
    version: navigation-1.8

Copy this to your rosinstall file replacing version navigation-1.8 with navigation-1.9.1
Another way to do this is to call
$ rosws set navigation --hg https://kforge.ros.org/navigation/navigation --version=navigation-1.9.1
