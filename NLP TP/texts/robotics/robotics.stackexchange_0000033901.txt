Q:

ros node does not change its name after restart

Hello everybody,
actually I'm working on a c++ s-function in Matlab Simulink that is able to comunicate to ros. Therefore I initialize the ros node once by
ros::int(argc, argv, nodeName);
and terminate the node by
ros::shutdown();
Therewith I can create and destroy a ros node.
The issue I have with this is, that after once starting and ending a simulink model, the ros node name can't be changed. Even by starting another model the node name is not changed. I tried changing nodeName and also the command line arguments argc and argv ( __name:=NodeName ). It only changes after a recompile of the s-function or by a restart of matlab. What can I do with this?
Many thanks for your answers in advance.

A:

yeah that's a matlab problem.
matlab caches the s-funtions
there is a brutal way by running:

clear all

or just unload every single s-function by using

clear fun s-function_name

cheers
