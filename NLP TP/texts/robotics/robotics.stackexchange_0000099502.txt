Q:

rosparam load key is giving errors when i try to list the parameters available to the node

I created a package called pkg_ros_basics. Then inside that, I created a folder called scripts and inside which i made a folder called config inside which I created a file using touch config_my.yaml and gedit config_my.yaml
then inside this i wrote
#inside config_my.yaml
details:
          name:
                  first: "Hisenberg"
                  last: "White"
          contact:
                  address: "Random Street"
                  phone: 77777

Then when i do rosparam load config_my.yaml, It is expected that these 4 paramters from config_my.yaml is also visible but instead i get a huge error

#I request you all to help me solve this problem as i am a beginner in ROS. ThankYou!
I have created a package called pkg_ros_basics. Inside the package, I have a folder called scripts where I made another folder called config where I typed in some name-value pairs as the following
#inside config_my.yaml
   details:
   
              name:
                      first: "hisenberg"
                      last: "white"
   

               contact:
                          address: "Random street"
                          phone: 77777

Then I closed this and put rosparam load config_my.yaml and got this huge error, I would like you to guide me to solve this and  help me as i am a beginner in ROS :

PLEASE modify your question into a precise format, it's difficult to read everything.
Also please format your error into inline code format by adding ``` before and after the error
Comment by Mike Scheutzow on 2021-07-05:
Are you using tabs? The tab character is not valid in the yaml syntax.
Comment by Mike Scheutzow on 2021-07-05:
P.S. Storing a phone number as an integer is going to cause you huge problems in the future.
Comment by electrophod on 2021-07-08:
@Mike Scheutzow What's the right way? Storing it as a string?
Yeah I guess String makes more sense
Comment by Mike Scheutzow on 2021-07-08:
@electrophod Yes, a string is much better.

A:

The tab character is not valid in the yaml syntax.
