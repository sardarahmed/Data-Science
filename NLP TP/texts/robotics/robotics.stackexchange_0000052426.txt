Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: PCD to Octree

Hi,
I have a registered point-cloud as PCD file. I want to convert it into octree representation. There are two ways I could go. The first one is by using PCL. The second method by using octomap. Is there any difference between them? Which one should I choose?
How could it be done using octomap?
Greetings

Have you got any answer?

A:

First used pcl to publish a point cloud from the pcd file and then used octomap to get the octree
<launch>
<node pkg = "pcl_ros" type = "pcd_to_pointcloud" name = "show_pointcloud" args = "xyz.pcd _frame_id:=/world" output="screen" /
<node pkg="octomap_server" type="octomap_server_node" name="octomap_server">
    <param name="resolution" value="0.4" />
    <param name="frame_id" type="string" value="world" />
    <!-- maximum range to integrate (speedup!) -->
    <param name="sensor_model/max_range" value="100" />
    <!-- data source to integrate (PointCloud2) -->
    <remap from="cloud_in" to="/cloud_pcd" />
</node>
</launch>
