Q:

how to run clearpaht_husky simulation in gazebo?

is there any way to run ros stacks of clearpath_husky in gazebo?
I want to know, is it possible to simulate clearpath_husky in gazebo without having real-model attached to computer? I want to use it for research purpose, so if it is possible please post how it is possible..
