Q:

Status of Armhf Kenetic build for Jessie or other recommendation

I see that Kinetics does not list Jessie armhf as a ready release
http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation
I note that the last question about this dates back to July.
http://answers.ros.org/question/239466/incomplete-packages-for-kinetic-armhf-jessie/
I am in the same situation as that poster, preferring the Jessie distribution on the BeagleBone Black.
Can someone update the status?  I guess if this Jessie armhf build has been pending since July I shouldn't hold my breath.
I will only need modest ROS functionality to operate a panel with an ARM BBB board
tethered to the vehicle with another ARM BBB board, over Ethernet.
What do you advise?  Building from source?
Thanks!

A:

There's no update since http://answers.ros.org/question/239466/incomplete-packages-for-kinetic-armhf-jessie/ and is not expected to be a change.
