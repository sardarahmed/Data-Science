Q:

unknown_cost_value

Im using ROS navigation package, during setting navigation parameters I have seen some used unknown_cost_value parameters by setting 0. I understood by setting it 0 it means robot should assume unknown celss as free, but I wonder what is the general tendency ? Should I set it 0 (FREE_SPACE) or LETHAL_OBSTACLE = 254 or NO_INFORMATION = 255 ? Isn't it awkward if I set unknown_cost_value to NO_INFORMATION=255 ?(why they didnt already set it to 255?)
Thanks.

A:

This question is ambiguous. The values you quote in the second part of the question are the conventions for costmaps, but you don't specify who the "some" is that is using 0.
