Q:

Setting up emacs with rosemacs

I followed the information for installing rosemacs but this has presented me with some problems.  For starters, I didn't have a .emacs file so I created one from scratch (not sure if that's what is supposed to be done).  I tried editing this file in both ways described but I keep getting errors.
 Warning (initialization): An error occurred while loading `/home/usr/.emacs':
File error: Cannot open load file, rosemacs
To ensure normal operation, you should investigate and remove the
cause of the error in your initialization file.  Start Emacs with
the `--debug-init' option to view a complete error backtrace.

I did exactly that, opening emacs in debug mode through the command line:
$emacs --debug-init
This yields the following in the scratch area once emacs is open:
͂͂͂
Debugger entered--Lisp error: (file-error "Opening directory" "permission denied" "/home/usr/.emacs.d/auto-save-list/")
 directory-files("~/.emacs.d/auto-save-list/" nil "\\`\\.saves-" t)
 (and auto-save-list-file-prefix (file-directory-p (file-name-directory auto-save-list-file-prefix)) (directory-files (file-name-directory auto-save-list-file-prefix) nil (concat "\\`" ...) t))
  delete-process(#)
  (progn (message "Cancelling existing rostopic tracker") (delete-process old-proc))
  (if old-proc (progn (message "Cancelling existing rostopic tracker") (delete-process old-proc)))
  (when old-proc (message "Cancelling existing rostopic tracker") (delete-process old-proc))
  (let ((old-proc ...)) (when old-proc (message "Cancelling existing rostopic tracker") (delete-process old-proc)))
  (let ((name "*rostopic-tracker*")) (let (...) (when old-proc ... ...)) (when (> interval 0) (let ... ... ...)))
  rosemacs/track-topics(8)
  invoke-rosemacs()
  (progn (add-to-list (quote load-path) checked-result) (require (quote rosemacs)) (invoke-rosemacs))
  (progn (progn (add-to-list ... checked-result) (require ...) (invoke-rosemacs)))
  (if checked-result (progn (progn ... ... ...)))
  (when checked-result (progn (add-to-list ... checked-result) (require ...) (invoke-rosemacs)))
  (let* ((result ...) (checked-result ...)) (when checked-result (progn ... ... ...)))
  eval-buffer(# nil "/home/usr/.emacs" nil t)  ; Reading at buffer position 517
  load-with-code-conversion("/home/usr/.emacs" "/home/usr/.emacs" t t)
  load("~/.emacs" t t)

If anyone has an idea as to what might be going on please let me know.

Could you post the relevant part of your .emacs as well?

A:

Ho! Apparently you don't have the permission to browse this directory:
(file-error "Opening directory" "permission denied" "/home/usr/.emacs.d/auto-save-list/")

This can be solved by running:
sudo chmod -R a+rw /home/usr/.emacs.d

Hope this helps.

I didn't see an option for this.  Is it the "mark answer as favorite" (checkmark) option?  If so, I just did that.

Happy to help :) You should probably select this as the correct answer then.

BINGO!!  Thanks Ugo, that solved it!  I had a feeling it would be something simple like that.
