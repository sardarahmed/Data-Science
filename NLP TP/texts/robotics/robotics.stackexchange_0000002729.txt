Q:

Is there an analytical solution for inverse kinematics of a 6 DOF serial chain?

Let's take a 6 DOF robotic structure. It's consisting of the 3 DOF global structure for the position - and the 3 DOF local structure for the orientation of the endeffector.
If the last 3 axis (of the local structure) are coincident in one point, the inverse kinematics can be solved analytically by decomposing it into a position- and orientation-problem. 
But is it possible to solve the inverse kinematics analytically if the last 3 axis are NOT coincident in one point? I've read several papers that claim that due to high non-linearity of the trigonometric functions and motion complexity in 3D-space, a 6 DOF serial chain cannot be solved analytically. 
Does anybody know if this is right?

A:

This paper seems to agree with you on the fact that 6 DOF arms exist that are not analytically solvable using inverse kinematics, but it also implies there are arm structures that can be analytically solved for, so I would recommenced sticking to those. Most 6 DOF robot arms don't have their last 3 axes coincident in one point, but they are still incredibly precise. Analytical solutions must exist for standard 6 DOF robotic arms.
