Q:

After using catkin_make the executable exists 2 times

After making with catkin_make, when I start my node with rosrun, I get the following message:
You have chosen a non-unique executable, please pick one of the following:

/home/name/ros/devel/lib/gero_move/servo_driver
/home/name/ros/src/gero_move/servo_driver

CMakeLists.txt is as follows:
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)
project(gero_move)
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS roscpp std_msgs gero_msgs message_generation)
catkin_package( CATKIN_DEPENDS gero_msgs)
add_executable(servo_driver servo_driver.cpp)

I use Ubuntu and ROS Indigo. Even if I delete build and devel directory and make catkin_make again, it creates both files new. What could be root cause for this?
Thanks for any help :-)

Can you edit your question to add your CMakeLists.txt?

Thanks for your kind request, I added it.

not sure, but please try to rename your .cpp file with another name and try again: for istance:
add_executable(servo_driver main_servo.cpp)

Thanks a lot for your help, when I delete it in the src directory, it does not get recreated again by catkin_make. So I assume it is right, that the executable is only in the devel directory?What do I do with data files I have to read in, do I have to make catkin copy this file to the devel directo?

Ok, I found out that working directory is the workspace, for me home/jonny/ros. So if I place data files there, I can access them with a relative pathname. Thanks a lot for all your answeres, it helped me a lot!! :-) Ahendirx, can you convert your comment to an answer, so I can mark as solved?

A:

Your CMakeLists.txt looks reasonable. Have you tried removing the executable in the src directory and confirming that it gets recreated when you do a build?

after removing in the src directory "src/gero_move/servo_driver" the problem was gone.
