Q:

Gazebo World Reset

Hello,
I need to reset the world in Gazebo. I know it can be done manually using the Gazebo GUI and doing Ctrl-R but I need to do it programmatically. I have genetic algorithms running in Visual Studio in Windows and I am communicating with ROS mater using rosserial_windows. Now after every generation I need to reset the world since I am evolving controllers for the robot. How and where should I do this?
Thanks,
