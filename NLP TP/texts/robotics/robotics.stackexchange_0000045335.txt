Do you have a link to the job with the new error, the latest one on hudson looks like the original problem?
Comment by WilliamWoodall on 2012-11-12:
It looks like the wrong version of rosdep is being used at that point.  Which is really odd because earlier in the build rosdep init and rosdep update are called successfully.  Let me ask around the office about this for you.

A:

It looks like you are running the ROS build farm pre-release tests.
I have not had much luck running legacy pre-release tests recently, either. Most attention is currently focused on the new catkin and bloom-based build farm.
Your question will probably get more response on the ros-release@code.ros.org mailing list.
