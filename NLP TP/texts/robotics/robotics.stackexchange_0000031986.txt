Q:

Proper source of xncore for compiling svn opencv with openni support?

I've just upgraded my opencv svn to 2.2.9 and am building it with OpenNI support on a Ubuntu 10.10 64-bit system, already having installed the apt-get available openni-dev (either because I have ros installed or it's part of ubuntu repositories now).
I used -D WITH_OPENNI=ON and -D OPENNI_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/openni/ with cmake, and this generated this error:
"WARNING, PrimeSensor Module binaries directory (set by OPENNI_PRIME_SENSOR_MODULE_BIN_DIR variable) is not found or does not have 
PrimeSensor Module binaries."

In the OpenCVFindOpenNI.cmake I found this was due to XnCore not being found- this happened to be on my system in a ros installed directory /.../ros/ni/ni/ps_engine/lib/libXnCore.so, but where should I get it from if I don't want to install ros if I'm to install opencv on another system?
The above compiles opencv fine, but kinect_maps fails
Kinect opening ...
done.
Can not open a capture object.

Which might be the source of a separate question, unless I shouldn't be using the openni-dev package at all and it's causing that problem also.

A:

You need to install OpenNI and PrimeSense sensor module from source. That's what I did.

Get the source codes
$ git clone https://github.com/OpenNI/OpenNI.git
$ git clone https://github.com/PrimeSense/Sensor.git

Compile them in order (follow their README instructions of each package to satisfy requirements/dependencies)

Re-build (Cmake) your openCV.
