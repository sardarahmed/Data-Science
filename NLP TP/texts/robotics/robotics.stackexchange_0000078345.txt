Q:

How to correcly compile and run UM7 downloaded from git

Dear,
i tried to install UM7 drivers on my RPI with Ubuntu Mate (1.12.1). I installed ros-kinetics library (all).
Unfortunatelly, the kinetic package have not um7 library for apt-get. Then i download  sources from git ( https://github.com/ros-drivers/um7.git), compile and install it.
Simly, steps:
git clone xxxx
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../ (sucessfully)
make (sucessfully)
make install (sucessfully)
rosrun um7 um7_driver _port:=/dev/ttyAMA0 : [rospack] Error: package 'um7' not found
Any sugestions where is a problem and how to run UM7?

A:

What you did is possible, but I don't recommend it if you just started out.
It's probably easier to create a catkin workspace, put the um7 package in that and build it using catkin_make. If successful, source devel/setup.bash. Then try your rosrun .. command again.
See Creating a workspace for catkin for a tutorial.

Hello.. I am getting error no such file or directory when I do perform rosrun..... command.
Followed the same steps as mentioned above.

Was the compilation successful? Did you see any errors?
If it was successful: try running rospack profile afer having sourced the devel/setup.bash.

Yes compilation was successful. after rospack profile following error.
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::run time error'
what() locale::facet ::_S_create_c_locale name not valid
Aborted (core dumped)
it is not able to find package.

Well if rospack throws an error then it wouldn't have run. So effectively the situation hasn't changed.

Can you let me know how to debug this? I also tried to install um7 using sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-um7. when I am trying to perform rosrun um7 um7_driver it shows error no file or directory found.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-02-13:
I would guess first make sure the files are actually there, and that um7_driver is actually a binary/ros node.
What is the output of ls -al /opt/ros/indigo/lib/um7?
Comment by B Dhruva on 2019-02-13:
Hello Dhoorn,
please find the output below:
administrator@administrator:~$ ls -al /opt/ros/indigo/lib/um7
total 124
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root   4096 Feb 11 05:32 .
drwxr-xr-x 56 root root  12288 Feb 12 07:15 ..
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 109720 May 17  2018 um7_driver

Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-02-13:
Seeing as the node is there and you're running into rospack issues with crashes, I would suggest to post a new question. Please clearly describe what is not working, mention the rospack profile crash, show the ls -al output and refer to this question.
