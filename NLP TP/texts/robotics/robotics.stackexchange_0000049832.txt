Q:

Specify xacro properties in launch file

Is there a way to specify the values for <xacro:property> tags in launch file ? I want to use a single *.urdf.xacro file using different values for the same property. Is it possible ?
For eg.:
In door.urdf.xacro
<xacro:property name = room value = "workroom" />
<link name = "${room}_door">
....

I would like to specify the value "workroom" for the property room in the launch file so that I can use the same *.urdf.xacro file for all the rooms in my gazebo world (kitchen, bedroom etc..). I know I can use TinyXML but it will be easier and simpler if I can specify the properties in launch file. Or is there any other way out ?
Thanks!

A:

You have to use a macro.
You may use something like this:
<xacro:macro name="whatever" params="room">
<link name = "${room}_door">
 ...
</link>
</xacro:macro>
<xacro:whatever room="workroom"/>
