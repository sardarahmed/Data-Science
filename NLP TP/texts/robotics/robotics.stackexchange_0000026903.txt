Q:

DRCSim + Precise + Hydro + roslaunch

I have Gazebo 3.0, gazebo_ros_pkgs-current, and the default branch of drcsim all compiling from source successfully with ROS Hydro and Ubuntu Precise. Now when I run

roslaunch drcsim_gazebo atlas.launch

I get a lot of errors in the terminal:

Has DRCSim been tested with Hydro yet? What am I doing wrong? Thanks!

looks like a bunch of ros nodes are not coming up properly. Did you source ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/share/drcsim/setup.sh before roslaunch?
Comment by Jose Luis Rivero on 2014-01-21:
Indeed, if you are using a catkin workspace, you should source install/setup.bash and install/share/drcsim/setup.sh

This was due to an unrelated ROS core bug: https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/issues/342#issuecomment-33271508
