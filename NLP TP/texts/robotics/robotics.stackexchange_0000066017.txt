Q:

problem with catkin and pcl_ros

hi,
after give from terminal the catkin_make command, it give an error that say:
CMake Error at /home/jacopo/catkin_ws/devel/share/pcl_ros/cmake/pcl_rosConfig.cmake:106 (message):
  Project 'pcl_ros' specifies '/usr/include/ni' as an include dir, which is
  not found.  It does neither exist as an absolute directory nor in
  '/home/jacopo/catkin_ws/src/perception_pcl-indigo-devel/pcl_ros//usr/include/ni'.

i've found in the web that the manual removing of the /usr/include/ni from the /opt/ros/hydro/share/pcl_ros/cmake/pcl_rosConfig.cmake can solve the problem.
after removing it, you could see that the error is no more from that directory, but from the devel directory of catkin...
how i can solve that problem??

A:

You're missing dependencies. Run

rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro [hydro/indigo] -y

on your workspace, using the appropriate distro tag.

i cannot understand what from-paths src and --ignore-src -- means
can you explain well or link some pages? cause i really cannot understand what you'd write.

rosdep has built in documentation. Run rosdep install -h
