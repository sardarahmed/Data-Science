Q:

Does cmvision save framennnn.jpg files?

Can cmvision somehow save a frame0000.jpg file?  I've run colorgui.launch, blobfinder.launch and cmvision.launch while trying to learn this package, and I found this JPG in my turtlebot directory above my cmvision directory.  Where did it come from?  How can I do it again?  ;>)

A:

image_view saves images in that format when you right click.
(didn't know there were other hams on here - 73 de N1LAZ)

Thanks, now if I can just get image_view working again.  Yes, a few hams here, does ROS run on Ham radios?
