Q:

Colcon commands

Hello,
I'm new to ROS 2 and recently started using it for a project. I have been using ROS (1) for the last year and really liked the catkin_tools. I guess it's easier to use. I'm wondering if there are analogues commands in colon build. Commands like catkin clean, catkin list. In addition, is it possible to build only certain packages in colcon?
Thanks,

A:

Hello Anjulo,

Commands like catkin clean

rm -r build install

I think colon does not have any clean command. For that have a look at the below links.

https://github.com/colcon/colcon-core/issues/37

catkin list

colcon-package-information

https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/reference/verb/list.html

In addition, is it possible to build only certain packages in colcon?

colcon build --packages-select <name-of-pkg>

If you only want to build selected package from workspace:
colcon build --packages-select <name-of-pkg> <name-of-another-pkg>

https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/user/how-to.html?highlight=colcon%20build%20--packages-selec#build-only-a-single-package-or-selected-packages
I think this will help you. This is a good official user documentation: https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/index.html.
Moreover, You can also have a look at this documentation by Dirk Thomas:  https://docplayer.net/207294236-Colcon-documentation-dirk-thomas-nov-05-2020.html
