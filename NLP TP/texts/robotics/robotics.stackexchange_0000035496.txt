Q:

Is there some filter in PCL to segment kinect point cloud based on color?

Hi. Is there some filter that allows to segment a kinect point cloud based on the rbg color of the points?
I've tried with a passthrough filter but it doesn't work with rgb, only with position. I've also found this answer explaining why.

Thanks in advance

A:

As of a recent version of PCL (maybe 1.1?), there should now be .r, .g, and .b fields in a PointXYZRGB, so it should be possible to do this.

Are you sure that is correct?  From the PCL API, rgb values seem to be combined into a single field

Scratch that.  .r , .g , .b can be individually accessed in PCL 1.1.0.  However, I don't think this will help with the passthrough filter
