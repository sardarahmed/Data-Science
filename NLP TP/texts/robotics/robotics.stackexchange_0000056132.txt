Q:

error creating ros_lib with groovy

I'm not able to create the arduino library with groovy on either the Raspberry Pi or Ubuntu 12.04.  When I switched to Hydro on Ubuntu I was able to create the library and plan to copy it over, but I'm not sure if there will be incompatibilities to try and use the hydro ros_lib while running groovy.
pi@raspbian ~/Arduino/libraries $ rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py .  
Exporting to .
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/groovy/share/rosserial_arduino/make_libraries.py", line 88, in <module>
    rosserial_client_copy_files(rospack, rosserial_arduino_dir+"/src/ros_lib/")
  File "/opt/ros/groovy/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rosserial_client/make_library.py", line 580, in rosserial_client_copy_files

A:

Hello,
in http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Arduino%20IDE%20Setup
follows the steps "3.2 Installing from Source onto the ROS workstation" and "3.3 Install ros_lib into the Arduino Environment" when you install rosserial on the raspberry pi.
Instalation from binaries is broken ("3.1 Installing Binaries on the ROS workstation").
This is due to https://github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial/issues/79 and have been fixed on sources but not in the raspbian build farm.
This works with rosserial/groovy/raspbian
