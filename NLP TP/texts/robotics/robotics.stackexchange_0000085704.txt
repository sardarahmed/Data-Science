Q:

how to get rid of running bash command every time

Respected members whenever i build a package, every time i need to run source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash command. is there anyway to solve it ? while installing ROS i used this command source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash because in case of my friend he doesn't need to run everytime. he just did it in the beginning of ROS installation.
Please help.
Thanks in advance

A:

Add following environment variables to your .bashrc file
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash

export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/user/catkin_ws:/opt/ros/kinetic/share:/opt/ros/kinetic/stacks

export ROS_WORKSPACE=/home/user/catkin_ws

Additionally we have an alias alias S='source ${HOME}/.bashrc' to quickly source after building new packages, very useful
