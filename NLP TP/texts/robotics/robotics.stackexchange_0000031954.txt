I have been trying to solve for days to no avail.
I'm running Ubuntu 10.04, on a RoBoard-110 with special kernal, 2.6.34.9
Thank you in advanced

A:

This is your problem:
Setting up openni-dev (0.1.0~lucid) ... Illegal instruction Illegal instruction Illegal instruction
I'm not familiar with the hardware you are using. Is it i386 compatible?
Illegal instruction sounds like an instruction that is not executable on the system.

See some of the other questions around (especially ones for ARM since they also have to remove things like SSE flags). e.g. http://answers.ros.org/question/130/openni-compilation-error-diamondback-version .
Comment by dornhege on 2011-05-31:
You would need to look in the CMakeLists.txt of each package. Hopefully when you compile from source you will automatically stumble upon that (although you can crosscompile with g++).
Comment by Aether Robotics on 2011-05-31:
ok, will remove and try from source, how would i remove SSE flags? post on robosavvy forum (who sell roboard to europe and all UK where i am) telling you how to do it for openCV in windows.
Comment by Eric Perko on 2011-05-31:
You installed both ROS and openni_kinect from source? Also, you may have to remove hardcoded SSE flags in things like openni_kinect, but I would think that rosrun should work just fine if you install Diamondback from source.
Comment by Aether Robotics on 2011-05-31:
tried installing from source same error with illegal instruction, get with rosrun too. looked into sse on roboard, it isnt supported
Comment by Eric Perko on 2011-05-31:
Can you try installing from source? I don't know if the Roboard supports things like SSE/2/3, but many of the debs are built with SSE support enabled.
Comment by Aether Robotics on 2011-05-31:
yeah it is i386 compatable. i get illegal instruction msg when try to run rviz too: http://www.roboard.com/RB-110.htm
