Q:

(rosjava) class files of custom messages cannot be found

I'm making a custom stack using rosjava. After writing some code, rosmake successfully ends but I can't find the message class that I made.
This page says as quoted below. If so, where can I put .msg files, and where the .class files of those messages are generated in?
you cannot place msg or srv files in a rosjava-based package. They have to be in a separate package. This is not considered a major issue as this is generally best practice anyway. 

.msg file I made (it is placed under %STACK_HOME%/msg currently though I know this doesn't work. Just had no idea where to put it.):
uint32 clockValue
geometry_msgs/Point[] points

.jar files of geometry_msgs and other messages provided by ROS are already generated under .ros/rosjava/lib as expected.
I need to know this because I can't use the custom message unless I know the class name and (Java's) package name of the .class file of the message. Thanks!

A:

I think the message is telling you to create another (non-java) package within your stack that contains only the message definitions.
Have you tried that?

@joq oh that sounds like a good/best practice that I haven't found so far anywhere in ROS related documents!

Good. Keeping all the messages in a separate package is a good idea, anyway. It minimizes dependencies between the other packages.

I tried referring to .msg in the existing .cpp package based on your hint (because I already tried similar stuff in .cpp so that I defined .msg in that package), and it worked. @joq 's suggestion should also work if you haven't made .msg definition. Thank you!

@joq thank you, I've never thought about it (nor seen the direction like that). I'll try see how it works.
