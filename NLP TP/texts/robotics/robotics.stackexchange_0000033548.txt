Q:

RViz does not respect transparency (alpha) for a simple URDF component (e.g. cylinder)

Hello,
I am trying to make a part of my URDF model semi transparent since the part is a clear 12" acrylic plate.  So I tried making the plate a flat cylinder with a light grey color and alpha set to 0.1 as shown below.  However, the plate looks solid grey in RViz--the same as if I had set alpha to 1.0.  I can make the whole robot more or less transparent by changing the alpha property for the Robot Model display.  However, I want just the plate to be transparent.  Below is a test URDF file that illustrates the problem.  I am trying this using the latest Electric debian packages under Ubuntu 10.04.

+1: I have seen the same problem in diamondback on Ubuntu 10.10

A:

Can you report this problem on the bug tracking of the visualization stack? You find a link at the bottom of the wiki page http://www.ros.org/wiki/visualization
