Q:

How to submit a (documentation) ticket

We are encouraged to submit a ticket for bugs. However, http://www.ros.org/wiki/Tickets:

Does not include an entry for documentation 'bugs'
All three topic areas listed on that page lead to lists of 'handoff' requests, rather than bug entry forms.

Which link am I missing?
thanks,
Andreas

A:

Filing a ticket for documentation bugs is no different than filing a ticket for a software bug.  You simply file a ticket for the software that the defect is related to.
