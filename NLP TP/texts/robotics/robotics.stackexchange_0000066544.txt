Q:

Willow PR2 svn repo

How can I clone this SVN repo: http://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/all.
I understand that this repo isn't used for development anymore, but I'd still like to clone it in order to navigate through revision history.

$ svn co http://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/all
svn: Repository moved permanently to 'https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/all'; please relocate
$ svn co https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/all

It is possible to use this interface to see the SVN repo: https://code.ros.org/gf/project/wg-ros-pkg/scmsvn, but I still want to checkout the SVN repo in order to have access to all the history on my machine.
