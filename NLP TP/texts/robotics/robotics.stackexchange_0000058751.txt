Q:

Error code -11?

Hi,
I do sometimes get the error code -11 while building my ros package. I am using groovy.
Has someone found a list describing error codes? That would help debugging.
Thanks in advance,
Daniel

Do you get that while building or executing? If it's really during the build, which step/program causes this? What output is there? 11 is usually a segfault. This seems unlikely to be caused by a build.

A:

-11 could be python segfaulting. It would be good if you updated your question with a precise description of how this error occurs reproducably.
