Q:

What is wrong with my ros installation

I have just installed the ros indigo system followed the sdk.rethinkrobotics.wiki tutorial on my laptop.
However every time I type in the terminal with rosrun or roscore or other command, the response are command not found.
The ros installed on a desktop followed by the same installation tutorial will not response like that.
So I would like to ask what is wrong with my installation or my laptop.*

A:

You need to source your setup.bash file in your .bashrc file.
Edit ~/.bashrc file and add source /home/<user_name>/<catkin_ws>/devel/setup.bash line to the bottom of the file, then restart your terminal.
