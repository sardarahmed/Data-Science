Q:

repositories.ros.org status page not updated for 10 days

Status pages for both M and K mention the page was generated 10 days ago, which sounds a kind of old. Is this intended?

Edit:
regarding the build farm: see Security issue on ROS build farm for the reason the buildfarm is down.
Key rotation for ROS 2 apt repositories is related, but for now only the ROS 2 repositories are affected.

well that depends how you look at it: build.ros.org has been down since May the 19th, so in a way this is to be expected.
From status.ros.org:

Build.ros.org offline
Investigating - Our Jenkins instance is having issues with running the management jobs. We're taking it offline until we can resolve the issue.

@nuclearsandwich: what is the prognosis for build.ros.org?
Comment by wxm on 2019-06-02:
Do we have an update on the buildfarm status? I couldn't find anything on ROS Answers and just created account on the new Jenkins instance. I keep getting build error emails, but can't see their status pages.

just created account on the new Jenkins instance

there's most likely no point doing that: it's not going to be needed and that instance is most likely going to be reset at any time coming weeks.
