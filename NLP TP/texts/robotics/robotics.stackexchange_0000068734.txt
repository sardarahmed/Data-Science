Q:

rqt ImportError: No module named my_module (different from previous post)

Hello,
In my attempt to create an rqt gui in ROS indigo, following the tutorials http://wiki.ros.org/rqt/Tutorials/Create%20your%20new%20rqt%20plugin and http://wiki.ros.org/rqt/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20Python%20Plugin, with the use of a .ui file, I began with just a simple version (two QPushButtons and a QLabel), just to check if it works. Unfortunately, it doesn't, while it gives me this error:
RosPluginProvider.load(rqt_mypkg/MyPlugin) exception raised in __builtin__.__import__(rqt_mypkg.my_module, [MyPlugin]):
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/indigo/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rqt_gui/ros_plugin_provider.py", line 77, in load
    module = __builtin__.__import__(attributes['module_name'], fromlist=[attributes['class_from_class_type']], level=0)
ImportError: No module named my_module

I have checked for other similar questions, like http://answers.ros.org/question/188825/importerror-for-rqt-plugin/ and http://answers.ros.org/question/205408/ros-rqt-plugin-importerror-unrelated-to-previous-post/ (I also had the same mistakes, which I corrected), but still, the same error occurs. I have put my code (and the related files) here:
https://github.com/PanosP/rqt-mypkg-fail .
My environment variables are:
ROS_ROOT=/opt/ros/indigo/share/ros
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/panosss/catkin_ws/src:/opt/ros/indigo/share:/opt/ros/indigo/stacks
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311

and I work on Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS.
Does anybody have any idea what could have gone wrong?

A:

You have _init_.py. It has to be __init__.py, double-underscore, not single. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/448271/what-is-init-py-for

Thank you very very much! (It now gives me some other errors but I will fix them and post when it is ready)

Just to close it, the "other errors" had to do with the loadUi function, but it is irrelevant with this question (I did it without using ui)
