Q:

Setting up odometry on physical bot

Howdy!
I'm currently making the switch from gazebo to a physical bot and realized I was using gazebo's diff drive plugin to handle publishing odom transformations.
I'm wondering how can I create a odom -> base_link transformation using ROS2 galactic for real life application. If anyone knows any examples, it would be greatly appreciated!

A:

It’s a very exciting journey you will embark in understanding how to make simulations come to live.
Im sure there are many technical answers to your question. So I’ll share how I started learning as I’m self taught. Pick a commercial robot with great documentation that has a simulation package. By studying how the hardware is simulated then you develop an appreciation of what is involved
Highly recommend to study Rosbot:

A tutorial using Ros2 but Foxy shows you how is done. Then study the manuals and simulation package thoroughly and you will find what makes this possible. Hope this gives you a starting point.
