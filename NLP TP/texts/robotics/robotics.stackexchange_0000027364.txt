Q:

Get translation of prismatic joints through C++ API

Hi all,
I am making a ROS plugin for a cylindrical manipulator. I need to get the translation of the prismatic joint in order to report the position of the end effector. I looked through the Joint API (http://osrf-distributions.s3.amazonaws.com/gazebo/api/dev/classgazebo_1_1physics_1_1Joint.html) and failed to see a function that would give me this information. I found GetAngle, but that is meaningless for a prismatic joint. The SliderJoint API didn't provide any help either. How do I get the translation of a prismatic joint through the C++ API?
Thanks in advance!

A:

The function is probably badly named, but I believe GetAngle for a prismatic joint returns the joint's displacement in meters. See this issue.
I did a quick test with the GUI. Insert the Simple Arm model and on the World tree, select the arm_wrist_lift_joint, which is prismatic. Expand axis1 and you'll see that the joint's lower and upper limits are -0.8 m and 0.1 m respectively. Now expand the joint control panel on the right and apply some forces to move this joint up and down, and you'll see the value of angle_0 go from one joint limit to the other.

Great, thank you for your answer! I agree, badly named function.

One other question, the GetAngle function returns a math::Angle type which can be resolved to a number using math::Angle::Degree or math::Angle::Radian. If it is a prismatic joint, which do I use? I'll assume radian but I'm not sure.

Radian seems to be the one.
