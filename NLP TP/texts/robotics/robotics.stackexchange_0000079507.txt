Q:

Problem with rqt, siplib.c - KDE Neon

Hi,
I'm use KDE Neon as main system and have the problem with rqt.
Launching any rqt program I have th—É same answer.
$ rqt
python: siplib.c:12299: sipEnumType_alloc: Assertion `sipTypeIsEnum(currentType)' failed.
Aborted
Maybe anyone know how to fix it, or can give me advice about debug this problem ?
Thanks.
p.s. Yes, I now that KDE Neon is not recommended system for ROS. But changing the system because one program did'n work - is not a linux-way.

Have you solved this? I'm switching to neon from kubuntu just now because of desktop issues.

Some colleagues and me struggle with the same issue... Hope it is fixed soon!

I think there are more issues coming for us. Because no one tested ROS with newest Qt. If your usually used applications are kde based too, I suggest kubuntu. Because they aren't well configurable on unity.

Problem solved with last distr update (26.03.2017) - NO
edit 28.05.2017
I solve this problem with compile rtq by hand.
cd catkin_ws/src/
git clone https://github.com/ros-visualization/qt_gui_core.git
git clone https://github.com/ros-visualization/rqt.git
git clone https://github.com/ros-visualization/rqt_common_plugins.git
git clone https://github.com/ros-visualization/rqt_robot_plugins.git
cd ..
catkin_make install

I have some problems with compiling of rqt_gui. But all works.
