A:

Afaik, RViz does not run on Windows right now.
Popular approaches / work-arounds include using ROSBridge (often in combination with the Robot Web Tools) and rosserial_windows.

Has this changed in the past two years?

No, not really. Although codenotes/ros_cygwin comes close when you don't have too high performance requirements. Robot Web Tools is still a nice way to get visualisations (and some interaction) onto any device with an HTML5 capable browser.

If some of the issues are resolved, WSL on Win10 might become a way to do this (although technically it isn't really running on Windows then). See Installing ROS on Ubuntu Bash in Windows 10.
