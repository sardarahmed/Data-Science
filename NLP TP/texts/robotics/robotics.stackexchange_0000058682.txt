Q:

Cannot locate node in package

How to run a server?
I cloned the package dmp and saved it in my sandbox. when I roslaunch the dmp node, I get the error
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [dmp/dmp_server]: can't locate node [dmp_server] in package [dmp]

Must I add something in CMakeList.txt before I launch?

A:

Have you build your workspace before trying to launch the node? ROS C++ nodes are just regular Linux binaries, which you need to build by compiling their source code. As you are refering to a sandbox, I'm assuming you're on Hydro, using catkin. In that case, go to the toplevel directory of your sandbox (ie: probably catkin_ws) after having sourced your setup.bash file, then:
$ catkin_make

This should build your workspace. Then (after sourcing the setup.bash in the devel directory) try to launch the node again.

Edit: all wrong: apparently dmp is a rosbuild package, so instead of using catkin, you should build it using rosmake.
