Q:

RC Transmitter Quadcopter with Arduino

I have a WL v262 quadcopter and I want to control it using Arduino instead of the joysticks on the transmitter. I opened up the transmitter and saw that each joystick has 2 potentiometers on the PCB and that the voltage for each pot goes from 0-3.3V. I used arduino's PWM and a low pass filter and connected the output of the filtered output to the potentiometer's analog pin which is connected to the PCB (I cannot desolder and take out the pots from the PCB) but even with this $V_{out}$ going onto the analog pin, my transmitter's display gave ???? 
Now I am really confused and frustrated because I don't know how else to control this transmitter other than attaching stepper motors to the joysticks and manually controlling the transmitter but this is really my last resort. Can someone help me with this? I have spent hours and hours trial and error but I am getting nowhere. 
Here is the PCB of the transmitter:

A:

Did it actually output only "????"
Does removing the PWM restore normal operation?
 It is likely that the load from the PWM is not initially within correct voltage range at RC's bootup and it is detecting this and faulting.
With the Pot's still inplace the range will be limited, but you could try to match it. Initially (and even while ????'ing) try to set the PWM's output to be the same voltage as when it is not connected. This may solve your ???? problem.
I also note from your picture the Transmitter module at top between joy sticks. I would suspect that you can better decipher the stream of information sent into this module by the controller and send your own information. This would be similar to what I did for IR Helicopter controllers
