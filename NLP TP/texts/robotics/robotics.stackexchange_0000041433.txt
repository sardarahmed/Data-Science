Q:

Changing the stereo camera angle in PR2 simulation

Hi, I was going through pick and place tutorial for PR2 robot (in simulation).
I noticed that /narrow_stereo(_textured) angle (in gazebo and rviz) got set such that now it covers things at a distance (previously it was set such that it was covering a part of its base and the table). In this setting it is unable to pick anything as all the objects which it detects are out of its reach.
How can I change the angle of the stereo camera (probably that requires changing the head angle)??
I am able to move arm around using the tutorial : http://ros.org/wiki/pr2_simulator/Tutorials/Teleop%20PR2%20arm%20in%20simulation
and launch file : http://ros-users.122217.n3.nabble.com/yaml-file-for-CartesianPoseController-JTTeleop-etc-td1396230.html
But I do not understand what exactly is happening in the launch file. I guess I might be able to solve the problem if I understand this completely.
I think error posted at :[ http://answers.ros.org/question/31995/how-to-solve-tabletop-detection-returned-error/?answer=36455#post-id-36455 ] could also be because of this.
Any help/pointers is greatly appreciated.
