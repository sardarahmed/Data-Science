Q:

Installing artoolkit with Ros

Hi everyone,
for my project I need to use Artoolkit with Ros. I downloaded the package from https://github.com/ar-tools/ar_tools but when I tried to compile I got the following error:

Built target opencv_apps svn: E000110:
Unable to connect to a repository at
URL
'svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/artoolkit/code/trunk/artoolkit'
svn: E000110: Can't connect to host
'svn.code.sf.net': Connection timed
out make[2]: ***
[ar_tools/artoolkit/ARToolkit-prefix/src/ARToolkit-stamp/ARToolkit-download]
Interrupt make[1]: ***
[ar_tools/artoolkit/CMakeFiles/ARToolkit.dir/all]
Interrupt make: *** [all] Interrupt

Thinking that my university network blocks the svn I tried to use a VPN but without success:

svn: E670002: Unable to connect to a repository at URL 'svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/artoolkit/code/trunk/artoolkit' svn: E670002: Unknown hostname 'svn.code.sf.net' make[2]: *** [ar_tools/artoolkit/ARToolkit-prefix/src/ARToolkit-stamp/ARToolkit-download] Error 1 make[1]: *** [ar_tools/artoolkit/CMakeFiles/ARToolkit.dir/all] Error 2 make: *** [all] Error 2 Invoking "make -j4 -l4" failed

Without compiling the package I can't run some important nodes (e.g. ar_single). Did someone of you have the same problem and was able to solve it?
Edit: This is the result of the curl command

curl: (6) Could not resolve host: svn.code.sf.net

Can you edit your answer to add the output of curl -I svn.code.sf.net/p/artoolkit/code/trunk/artoolkit? This will help us see what happens when you try to access the artoolkit repo.

Hi,
I would suggest posting your question on stack overflow or the ARToolkit community forum :) Someone more technical than me could be able to help

A:

Hi, I tried to compile from home instead from university and it worked. Apparently svn was blocked!
Cheers!
