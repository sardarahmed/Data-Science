Q:

Ros launch command not found

I am trying to auto launch a roslaunch file, whenever ubuntu starts.
I have written a shell command file "start.sh" and it contains "roslaunch pkg_name file.launch"
When i try to execute this shell file in terminal, it runs successfully.
But when it runs automatically on start up, the terminal shows "source not found", "roslaunch not found" . Can any one help me correct it.
the link to autostarting a sh file is : http://ros-users.122217.n3.nabble.com/auto-start-ROS-launch-script-on-boot-up-td1687093.html

A:

If roslaunch isn't found it's likely that you have not done the first thing in the linked example script of sourcing the setup.bash file in your script. If you'd like more information please share a minimal reproduction of your script that doesn't work, using standard tools that will make it easy for us to reproduce.

This is my shell file. Its works fine when i run ./start.sh in terminal, but not at startup.
#! /bin/sh
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
source /home/ubuntu/guidance_ws/devel/setup.bash
echo "launching the launch file"
roslaunch rfly_launch main.launch

i found the problem. The sh file has to be run as a bash file. so by replacing first line (#! /bin/sh) by #! /bin/bash,  works
