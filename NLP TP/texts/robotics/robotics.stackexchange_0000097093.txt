Q:

[ros 2] How to create a non-node logger?

In the documentation it says:

Non-node loggers can also be created that use a specific name.

Is there an example or tutorial somewhere that shows how to do this?

A:

Hey, Jeff. I actually stumbled across the answer to this not too long ago. When you use logging macros in ROS2, the first argument is an rclcpp::Logger which you would normally get from calling get_logger() on an rclcpp::Node. However, the rclcpp namespace also provides a get_logger() function which can be used to generate an rclcpp::Logger without a node instance by just giving it a name. I believe the only difference between this type of rclcpp::Logger instance and the one you would get from a node is the logger maintaining a reference to the node and changing its name if the node name changes.

If anyone is looking for the python answer, it can be called with: rclpy.logging.get_logger(name)
