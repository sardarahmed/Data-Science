Q:

How to launch multiple turtlebots in real environment?

I want to launch multiple turtlebots in real environment. In this scenario, there are several turtlebots and a remote workstation connected with each other. I want the robots to be controlled independently. I know how to revise the navigation and amcl launch files. But I don't know how to revise the minimal.launch file in turtlebot_bringup package of each robot to accomplish this. The ROS version I use is Indigo.Thank you!

hi, @Minglong, I ran into same problem. What @Mehdi suggests is the way to go, however, I can't get it to work with navigation stack. Therefore, I added new, more detailed question.

@Minglong, @Mehdi: I also added a github repository to try to reach a complete solution - try to see if it is useful for you, or if you can improve it.

A:

I think this can be done by either having a roscore running on each Turtlebot laptop or by having one ROS core on your workstation and launching each Turtlebot on a different namespace such that all nodes and topics have a prefix like i.e turtlebot1/topic1 turtlebot1/node1
