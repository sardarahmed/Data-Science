Q:

Schunk Arm URD COLLADA file is not a valid robot model

I am trying to import Schunk arm using the setupAssistant in moveit!
But when I browse to the SchunkDescription and load the .urdf file, then the setupAssistant gives me the following message:
URDF/COLLADA file is not a valid robot model.
How to fix it?

A:

I am also using schunk arm in moveit.
I think you should first define a real arm with the given schunk description file, not only using macro part for the arm.
