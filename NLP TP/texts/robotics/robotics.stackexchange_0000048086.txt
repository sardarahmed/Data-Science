Q:

debug ros node python

Hi I am new to ROS
how do you debug your ros node, say you code it in python.
Is it possible to use run a ros node in an ide and set break points ect?
I saw a link on setting up ide's but they seemed like it was for C++ IDE's

A:

From commandline, you can run your script on debugger by:
$ roscd %YOUR_PKG_HOME%
$ gdb python
$ run %YOUR_SCRIPT_PATH%

If you'd prefer to sticking to eclipse, one dumb workaround to utilize make solution on wiki is:
1 Install pydev on eclipse, create your python project on eclipse by "File" --> "New" --> "Pydev Project". When successful, close eclipse.
2 Copy the .project file that was just generated by eclipse. Eg. by doing:
$ roscd %YOUR_PKG_HOME%
$ cp .project .project.org

3 Run make eclipse-project following http://www.ros.org/wiki/IDEs#Eclipse. If you don't have Makefile in the current dir, create one as the same wiki page suggests when error occurs.
4 Swap .project and remove .cproject:
$ mv .project.org .project 
$ rm .cproject

This sets up ROS python environment on eclipse. You should be able to run your ROS script in debug mode.
Apparently this is not smart and ideal, but works for me.
This works even on Groovy where make eclipse-project generates many unnecessary files & directories. In this case you might want to remove them & Makefile you no longer need by like:
$ rm -fR catkin* CATKIN_IGNORE cmake_install.cmake devel/ gtest/ Makefile test_results/

Hi Thanks for the reply
I also got this to work for python debugging
http://winpdb.org/docs/ Its a graphical debugger for python. All I have to do is go the source directory and run it from the terminal from there.
