Q:

tf tutorial... running a broadcaster

in the tf tutorial.
in: writing a tf broadcaster (Python), while creating the launch file (in section, running the broadcaster), why it is written:
<node name="turtle1_tf_broadcaster" pkg="learning_tf" type="turtle_tf_broadcaster.py" respawn="false" output="screen" >

, because the node was created as:
rospy.init_node('turtle_tf_broadcaster')

not
rospy.init_node('turtle1_tf_broadcaster')

So how will ros identify the node??
Ans what does respawn="false" mean?

I reformatted your question to enable syntax highlighting (it's easier to read) and I included a link to the section of the tutorial that you're asking about (it's a good idea to link to anything you're asking about).

A:

Even though the node's source declared the name as turtle_tf_broadcaster, roslaunch allows you to rename a node using the <node> tag's name attribute. This way you can run multiple instances of the same node. If you tried to run multiple instances of a node with the same name you'd get a warning stating
[ WARN] [1486130761.721137111]: Reason given for shutdown: [new node registered with same name]

The roslaunch section of the wiki explains what the respawn attribute does

respawn="true"(optional)
Restart the node automatically if it quits.

So, if you're node dies for some reason it will automatically be restarted if you include the respawn attribute.
