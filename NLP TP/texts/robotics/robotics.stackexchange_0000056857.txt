Q:

how to execute navigation experimental

I'm about to execute navigation_experimental. But, I don't know which launch file I should execute.
A launch folder in eband_local_planner includes gazebo_launch folder, rviz_launch folder and stage_launch folder. The pr2_ompl_planner_base_gazebo.launch in gazebo_launch folder calls 2dnav_stack_fake_loc_planner_prm.launch. The 2dnav_stack_fake_loc_planner_prm.launch calls fake_location.launch and map_server.launch. But, the launch files in groovy seem not to exist.
If you have already executed the package, I'd like you to teach how to execute it.
Could anyone help me?

A:

Navigation_experimental is not an executable, but rather a stack (metapackage) containing several packages related to navigation.  I suggest that you study the navigation metapackage, and follow some of the tutorials on that page. The navigation_experimental metapackage has some very specific tools that you normally would not need to use when creating basic setups using ROS.

Thank you for your reply! Do you mean that navigation_experiment uses navigation stack together? I'm sorry, I'm a beginner for ROS.
For example,
$roscore
$roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch
$roslaunch turtlebot_navigation amcl_demo.launch map_file=/tmp/my_app.yaml
$roslaunch eband_local_planner rviz_move_base.launch
Is this correct?
