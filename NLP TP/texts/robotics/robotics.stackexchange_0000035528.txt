A:

For simulation you have a very complete answer here about how to manage node namespaces and tf issues.
Working with real robots makes it harder.
I suggest using a roscore in each robot, so that all data is private to each robot.
In order to share certain topics, you can use packages such as ros-rt-wmp, which provides a wireless communication protocol that propagate selective topics to other roscores.
