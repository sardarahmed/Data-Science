Q:

roboearth no models?

Hi all,
I'm trying to use the roboearth stack. However, when trying to download the test model I get a "410 GONE". Are there available models to test with ? Or do I have to build one ?
Best regards,
Guido

Hi Guido,
to see the object models available in the database, please take a look at the web interface: click on the upper "Search" button without entering anything to see all object models.
Also, if you want to test the recognition algorithm, try downloading the "videogames.kinectadventures" model (this is the model from the video).
HTH,
Daniel
