Q:

Ros-Control four_wheel_steering_controller no-commands output

Hi,
I try to use the four_wheel_steering_controller from Ros-Control. I set it up as in the example file on github. cmd_vel gets subsribed to by the controller and teleop_twist_keyboard generates data.
However the "steering_joints_[i].position_command" outputs Zero. The same with the velocity commands.
Anybody got a hint how to hunt down the problem? Now and Then I get a control period overtime warning, but I dont think this schould shutoff the controller.

Is the controller started? That would be the first thing I'd check.

Thanks for the reply. The controller seems running, rosservice call controller_manager/list_controllers shows it running, the Logfiles shows its started without any issue. As link text shows they are using a ServiceServer, I dont know about that, maybe that isnt up and running?

A:

Question can be closed, was just a typo in the topic remap :/
EDIT: The remap was by "rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py cmd_vel:=[mybot]/four_wheel_steering_controller/cmd_vel"
When I first ran it it was correct, thus pub and sub was OK. But I then by mistake must have changed the command to "four_wheel_steering_controller/cmd_ve[missing the "l"]" As I start and stopped the node I just use "Arrow up" to get the same/last command again in the console, thus this error occured on and on. My confusion was because I thought I use the correct command as it once was, but changed it inadvertendly, maybe by trying to write something in another window that wasnt really active yet.

No need to close it.
Please expand on your answer and accept it as the answer.
What exactly was the problem (ie: what was the remap, and what should it have been)?
