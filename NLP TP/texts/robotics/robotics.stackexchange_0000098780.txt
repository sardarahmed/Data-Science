Q:

How to change the positive direction of coordinates for links?

I want the make the coordinates be the same as real robot ,but I cannot find where can I achieve this. I guess by changing some factors in urdf file will be useful. Could you tell where can I change the positive direction of coordinates.
Here is part of the urdf file. Please take base link's coordinate as an example.Thx!

A:

It depends how you want to change the axes.  You can rotate them as a whole, but you can't change them relative to each other.  For example, you can't reverse the direction of the x-axis without also reversing y or z, which would constitute a 180Â° rotation.  This is because, as stated in REP 103, all coordinate systems are right-handed, and reversing only one axis would make it left-handed.
If you want to rotate the whole frame, use the rpy attribute in the elements you want to rotate.  Have you looked through the URDF tutorials?  The Building a Visual Robot Model with URDF from Scratch tutorial involves rotating links.
If I missed the point of your question, please clarify what you would like to know.
