A:

Have you tried building the franka_ros packages?
E.g. with these steps there: https://frankaemika.github.io/docs/installation_linux.html#installing-from-the-ros-repositories
What errors do you see there?
Do you have these installed
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-ros-control ros-kinetic-ros-controllers 
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-gazebo-ros-control

?

Would it have something to do with kinetic being EOL? Doesn't rosdep update skip EOL distributions?
EDIT in that case, they should try rosdep update --include-eol-distros and try again to run rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y

I didn't know this flag --include-eol-distros for rosdep, thank you :) It's worth a shot for sure!

@Joe28965 was right, I tryed with rosdep update --include-eol-distros and later again with my rosdep install -y --from-paths . --ignore-src --rosdistro kinetic again and it was fixed. I will study what EOL distributions are.
Thank you so much to both of you, have a nice day.

EOL means End Of Life - http://wiki.ros.org/Distributions It's not longer actively supported. You can accept this answer and upvote comments to let others see that it's solved
