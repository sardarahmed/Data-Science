Q:

How to upgrade package

Hi !
I was wondering whether one could more or less easily upgrade a package (indigo -> kinetic or even up to lunar) by installing it with the source code taken on git in a catkin_ws ?
I'm for example thinking about:

 urg_node 
 laser_scan_matcher

I couldn't find a tutorial on that, and especially need to update laser_scan_matcher from source by adding odometry to the node with  already developped code . One of my problems for doing that being that  laser_scan_matcher git repository is associated with Indigo and not kinetic. Furthermore, the package install with apt doesn't offer (or at least I don't know how) the possibility to add the .h and  .cpp  files that permit the usage of odometry with that particular node.
Thanks to anyone considering my question ! Really trying to understand ROS but it is sometimes frustrating ^^

A:

Yeah, you can totally build those packages from source. Odds are good that the packages will work just fine in the new distribution, but you might have to make a few tweaks to get them to work. Check out the Kinetic Migration Guide and the Lunar Migration Guide.

thanks ! I forgot those pages, going to read them right away. If it's not a problem, I'll let this thread open a little longer just in case I encounter what I see as a newbie dead end

@EdVanator It appears migrating the packages I considered would be too painful - they depend on other packages which would request migration and so on... Anyway thanks for your answer !

I just remembered that you can check this page to see whether a package has been released and if there are any unreleased dependencies.
