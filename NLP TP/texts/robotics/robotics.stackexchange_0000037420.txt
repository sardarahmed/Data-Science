Q:

URDF for a sphere

I am learning URDF, when I tried making a sphere;
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<robot name="myfirst">
  <link name="base_link">
    <visual>
      <geometry>
        <sphere radius="1.0"/>
      </geometry>
      <material name="green">
            <color rgba="0 1 0 1"/>
      </material>
    </visual>
  </link>
</robot>

All I get is something more like a polyhedra;

Is there any way to get a better sphere ?

A:

I'm also not aware of a way to change the tesselation of the built-in primitives in rviz. Using an external mesh works fine, however. I've used the default sphere you can add in Blender (32 segments, 16 rings) for the image below. I scaled it and set it to smooth shading (and converted to triangles before exporting to .dae to prevent bugs as mentioned here).
Gazebo on the left, rviz on the right:

/edit: Two versions of a COLLADA sphere are available here.
One is using 32 segments/16 rings, the other 16 segments/8 rings.
