Q:

How do I find specific planner configuration options?

Basically, I'd like to re-ask this question.
I would like to run some benchmarking tests using several of the planners available in ompl.  I would also like to be able to experiment with different configuration options for those planners.  But in order to populate ompl_planning.yaml, I need to know what those options are named, and presumably this will vary by planner type.  How do I find this out?

A:

Currently all the options are not filled in the yaml file itself but you can look into the src/ompl_ros_planning_group.cpp file to find which planners and options are supported. I will try and get out a better yaml file or more information on the Wiki to help with that.
