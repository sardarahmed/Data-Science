Q:

turtlebot driver.launch error: object has no attribute Rotation

Hi,
When I try to launch the driver.launch file I get the following error.
'module' object has no attribute 'Rotation'
Any help would be appreciated.
Full output at launch is below.
The create beeps when I run driver.launch, so I know it has connectivity to the Create.
Thanks in advance for assistance.

Please provide more information on what computer you're running, how you installed ROS and turtlebot software, what version you're running etc so we can try to understand or reproduce your problem.  http://www.ros.org/wiki/Support  My first guess is that you have not built all the dependencies.

A:

Reinstall of ROS electric after upgrade to Natty version of Ubuntu appears to have fixed the error.
