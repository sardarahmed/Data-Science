Q:

How to use Python with Gazebo

Hi,
I just installed Gazebo on Ubuntu. I want to set up a basic simulation where I can control robots as well as environment via Python. Via Google I found information on libgazebo.a, however from this I do not understand where to find the python files to include or what to install to get them.
I would be very happy if someone can help me!
Thanks
Timo

A:

There is no python interface to Gazebo. You'll have to write c++ plugins, or use ROS or Player.
