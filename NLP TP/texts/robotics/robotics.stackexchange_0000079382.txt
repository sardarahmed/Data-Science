Please post error messages in English only. This looks like a serious problem, but I can't tell because I don't speak Chinese.

ok, thank you!

A:

Is this a machine that has an earlier version of MoveIt installed?
There has been a reshuffling of packages and .debs recently in MoveIt, so it could be you're running into some conflicts as a result of that.
Could you try and purge all moveit packages from your machine and then try reinstalling them again?
