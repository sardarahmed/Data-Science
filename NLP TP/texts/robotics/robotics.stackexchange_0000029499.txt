Q:

How do I add a new stereo or monocular camera to ROS?

Do I need to write my own "driver"? (That is code that interfaces with the camera APIs and publishes to ROS?)
In that case, what do I publish?
Do I give only raw image output or is there a way to publish a stereo pair?
Are there any examples for how to do this, e.g. from some other stereo cameras?
What is the easiest way to do this?

A:

Do I need to write my own "driver"?
Yes, unless someone has already written one.
That is code that interfaces with the camera APIs and publishes to ROS?
Yes.
In that case, what do I publish? Do I give only raw image output or is there a way to publish a stereo pair?
There are standard ROS ways to publish stereo data.

http://www.ros.org/wiki/stereo_image_proc
http://www.ros.org/wiki/camera_calibration
http://www.ros.org/wiki/image_pipeline

Are there any examples for how to do this, e.g. from some other stereo cameras?

http://www.ros.org/wiki/bumblebee2
http://www.ros.org/wiki/videre_stereo_cam

What is the easiest way to do this?
The extra ROS wrapping for publishing camera data does not involve
much additional code, but does require a basic understanding of the
image pipeline. So, study the interfaces and look at examples of other
drivers, then ask more questions.
