Q:

Unable to locate ros-hydro-desktop-full

Yes, I followed the ros wiki.  I added the sources and the apt-key and they both show up with cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list and with sudo apt-key list.  But when i sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-desktop-full or even sudo apt-cache search ros-hydro (or any disto), nothing shows up.  Im running on xubuntu with xfce on a chromebook if that help at all.

Did you run apt-get update?

By looking at other questions I figured someone would ask me that haha.  And yes, multiple times.

What is the output of your apt-get update? Does it show packages.ros.org being downloaded? What version of Xubuntu are you using?

Ahh, you are using armhf.  Not all packages are available for armhf, especially the desktop packages.

Is there any way around that?  Like compiling from source or something?
Comment by tfoote on 2013-10-15:
Yeah, though a lot of the visualization libraries are not going to work well on embedded computers. http://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Installation/Source

now it can't locate python-wstool... I can't win haha
Comment by tfoote on 2013-10-15:
It's available from pip.  Armhf is not an officially supported architecture, so there's going to be a little bit of extra work to get things working.

I am not using armhf but find the same problem.

@kristpan: you should probably ask that as a new question rather than trying to reopen a year-old question.
