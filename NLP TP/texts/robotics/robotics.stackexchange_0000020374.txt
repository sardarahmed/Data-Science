Q:

Dual constraint non-linear optimization for SLAM

I am trying to achieve a nonlinear optimization for SLAM on a function that contains two different constraints, like this :
$$
T_{opt} = \underset{T}{\arg\min} \sum_i(\left\lVert T.X_i - x_i \right\rVert)^2 + \sum_j(\left\lVert\pi(T.Y_i) - y_i\right\rVert)^2
$$

T : Affine transformation (Rotation + Translation),
X_i some source's 3d points, x_i are target's 3d points that correspond to X_i,
Y_i some source's 3d points (different than X_i), y_i are target's 2d points that correspond to Y_i,
PI function is the projection of a 3d point to the image plane.

My questions are :

The two constraints have different units, first give an error in meter, second give an error in pixel. Is it a problem for the optimization to minimize two constraints with different scale units ?
Is it a problem if one constraint have lot more data to deal with ? For example, first constraint would have 10 points for the optimization, second constraint would have 50 points. Is it a problem if sets of data have complete different sizes ?

For your problem I think it will be fine(if your optimizer uses Levenberg Marquadt it will implicitly handle it). But generally yes this is a problem you have to deal with any sort of optimization algorithm(not limited to SLAM). The topic is called feature scaling and comes up a lot in machine learning.

Other things being equal then the constraint with more samples will have a bigger effect on your output. One way to fix this is to add a weighting($\lambda$) parameter that will reduce the effect of that constraint.
So your equation would become something like this
$$T_{opt} = \underset{T}{\arg\min} \sum_i(\left\lVert T.X_i - x_i \right\rVert)^2 + \lambda \sum_j(\left\lVert\pi(T.Y_i) - y_i\right\rVert)^2$$
