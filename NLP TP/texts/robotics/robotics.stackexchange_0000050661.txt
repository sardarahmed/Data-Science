Hi
Algorithm of local planner  is based on global plan (is not based on the goal).
There is method in 'TrajectoryPlannerROS' class:
bool TrajectoryPlannerROS::setPlan(const std::vector<geometry_msgs::PoseStamped>& orig_global_plan)

Can I change this and make the local planner to follow my own trajectory?
