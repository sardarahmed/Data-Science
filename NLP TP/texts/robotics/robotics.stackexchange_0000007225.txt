Q:

Robotic winch force sensor

I have a requirement for a motor that pulls a piece of rope until the rope is taught. However I'm at a loss as to how to achieve this, I'm sure it must've been done before but I'm not sure how to best describe this in a way that would get me more results. I wondered if there are any sensors or pre-established methods for sensing resistance to motion in electrical motors?

A:

There are two ways that I can think of measuring this:

Motor current, as the resistance to motion increases the current increases linearly, you could measure the desired torque and the current and simply pull until this is met
You could have a tensioner wheel with a potentiometer to measure when the rope is taut.
