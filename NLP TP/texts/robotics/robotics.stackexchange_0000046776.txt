Q:

rostopic hz doesn't work when using playing from a bag

Not sure if my problem is similiar to [1], but this have been flagged as solved and I still have it in Fuerte.
I follow the tutorial "MappingFromLoggedData" at [2], and after I start "rosbag play ..." if I do a "rostopic hz /tf" there is no output.
The map gets generated correctly, so everthing else is fine!

A:

Have you tried playing with rosbag play --clock?
rostopic hz requires a time component.  If the 'use_sim_time' parameter is set to true, you need to publish the time using rosbag play --clock.
