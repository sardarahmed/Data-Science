Q:

What happened to the Python API for Interactive Markers?

With the desktop-full installation, I'm trying to run the interactive_markers_tutorials python node and I get this error message:
$ rosrun interactive_marker_tutorials simple_marker.py 

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/groovy/stacks/visualization_tutorials/interactive_marker_tutorials/python/simple_marker.py", line 35, in <module>
    from interactive_markers.interactive_marker_server import *
ImportError: No module named interactive_markers.interactive_marker_server

This works in Fuerte. The C++ node works fine in Groovy. It looks like the Python code is missing in the installation.

A:

This had been fixed for some time, but not released. I've triggered a release into groovy (1.9.5).
