Q:

Error when simulating baxter in gazebo

When I launch baxter_world I get the following errors in order. I'm struggling with fixing these.
[ INFO] [1448157761.777717835]: getting bounds for joint: [right_s0]

Which branch of baxter_simulator and all baxter repos are you using? Make sure the are all on the same branch. The first error makes it seem like either baxter_gazebo wasn't built with catkin or the environment wasn't sourced again after the build. Have you tried a fresh build?

A:

This is a tough since the error doesn't provide many details as to the actual problem. I left a comment to rule out some common errors, but I suspect your Linux graphics card is the likely culprit. Try switching to a proprietary driver using the Troubleshooting page of the Baxter wiki: http://sdk.rethinkrobotics.com/wiki/Gazebo_Troubleshooting
