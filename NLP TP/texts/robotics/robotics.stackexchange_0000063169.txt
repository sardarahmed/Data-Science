Check this paper from authors, they have resulting model image.Hope it give you and idea. Also the video in wiki page.

A:

6D RGB-D SLAM is a bit more computationally expensive.
ccny_rgbd is comparatively very fast.
Both of these can help in localizing with respect to your initial position or with respect to the reference frame at your starting point.
They can help you in building a 3D map but they are not meant for navigation.
For navigation, you can try using ROS NAVIGATION STACK
You can try to create a 2D map from 3D map (created using previously mentioned methods) and use it with ROS NAVIGATION stack for navigation
Using ccny_rgbd or RGB-D SLAM with a structure sensor may not be a straightforward task.
Firstly, the depth data from the structure sensor should be registered to another external RGB camera, if your structure camera does not provide RGB information.
I would suggest you to use Asus Xtion pro live as it works out of the box with RGB-D SLAM or ccny_rgbd or many other algorithms are out there for RGB-D sensors. Most of these methods need both RGB and depth information for them to work.

ccny_rgbd method allows us to create  a map from RGB-D data and localize using visual odometr
Pls provide more details on the differences between this method and 6D RGBD SLAM or RGBD SLAM
How do I incorporate the ROS navigation stack with SLA

Does the ccn_rgbd use both RGBD and visual odometr
Comment by sai on 2014-10-08:
yes, it works with rgb-d sensors like kinect and asus xtion pro live
Comment by Francis Dom on 2014-10-08:
Does it work with the structure sensor as well

How do I combine ccny_rgbd & ROS NAVIGATION STACK
I am using a Parrot Drone with PX4 Autopilot...and Structure Sensor
with ODROID-U3  board
How do I connect the ODROID and PX4 - mavros help?

I have edited the answer. You can have a look at the links given below.
These work with a RGB camera and do not need a structure sensor.

Hi,
the Structure sensor is a RGB-D sensor or just depth sensor
Comment by sai on 2014-10-09:
I do not know that..i think its just a depth sensor..

May I use Gmapping slam with the structure sensor?
