Q:

How to take a 3D point cloud of rotating object with a fixed kinect position using RGBDSLAM?

Hi,
I have installed and used RGBDSLAM to take a 3D point cloud of my room.
I am using Ros groovy on Ubuntu 12.04 . I have an ASUS Xtion Pro live.
Now my question:-
In my project I will not be able to move my Asus .My Asus can direclty look at a pot. But I have to take a 3D point cloud of a rotating pot with a plant in it.
I can rotate the pot a full 360 degrees.
How do I achieve this using RGBDSLAM?

A:

Most easily by putting it in front of a featureless background, e.g. a black bedsheet. Make sure that the turntable is the same color, otherwise you have prominent feature at the edge between sheet and turntable.
Or you can program a node that filters the images from the xtion pro, e.g. by color or depth, to remove the background. Then subscribe rgbdslam to the filtered image.

That is a great idea.I cannot use the black cloth but May be I was thinking if I could make the changes in the RGBDSLAM source code it self to filter the images.
Can you please tell me which file I should look into?
Or may be if your could just guide me a little to write this node?

Depends on how you want to filter the image (I don't know how exactly you would do that, depends on your scene). I'd look into the node (.cpp/.h) class. Maybe write a new method to filter the feature_... attributes which contain the info about features.
