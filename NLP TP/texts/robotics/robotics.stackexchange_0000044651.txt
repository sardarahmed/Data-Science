A:

There is a Pointcloud_to_Laserscan package, which works fine.
If I remind correctly, you have to make your own launchfile - if you need help on that,
I can search for my launchfile(I basically did the same).
Just for information: The package will take your PointCloud and generate a LaserScan from it.
