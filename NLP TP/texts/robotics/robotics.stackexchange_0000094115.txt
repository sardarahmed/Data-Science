Q:

How to install a package urdf_tutorial

I am following the tutorials in the wiki step by step. I have encountered urdf tutorial wiki and I am supposed to install the urdf_tutrorial package. I am new to Ubuntu and ROS. Kindly help if possible.

I tried to check out various questions but couldn't figure it out. I have a catkin workspace.

A:

You basically have two options:

Install the debian package (Requires sudo rights): sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-urdf-tutorial
Clone the source-code directly into your workspace and then rebuild your workspace. See http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/using_a_workspace as a guide to do this.

If you just want to get urdf_tutorial installed, the first option is probably the better and easier choice.

Thanks, it worked! Is the debian package present in my system or is it installed from the net?
What is a debian package?
