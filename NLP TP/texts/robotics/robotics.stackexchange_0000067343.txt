Q:

urdf in rviz is too deep

Hi, I setup my robot system and its working good.
I am using hector mapping with urdf and a laserscanner and I am getting the following result:

I dont know why exactly the robot is kind of swimming in the world, here is my tf tree:

Another Question is now, how can I make the Robot move autonomously and how can I integrate a path planner?
What is a common used module to make the robot move and avoid obstacles and crashes?
thanks in advance, felix

For your second question, you'll want to check out the navigation stack. It has packages that include local and global path planning, and it is the most common way to get started with autonomous navigation in ROS.

A:

I dont know why exactly the robot is kind of swimming in the world [..]

A likely reason is because you have placed the origin of your urdf (typically called base_link) in the centre of the yellow (?) cube. The origin of a cube in URDF is not at one of its corners, but in its centre.
If you place you base_link (or whatever the first link of your robot is called) at ground level, your robot should no longer be 'swimming'.
