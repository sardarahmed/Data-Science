Q:

How to connect VLP-16 (confused about the tutorial)

I try to connect VLP-16 to indigo in four ways, but all failed and led to the same result (no data was printed through command "rostopic echo /velodyne_points" and "rostopic echo /velodyne_packets"):
First method, refer to tutorial about VLP-16 http://wiki.ros.org/velodyne/Tutorials/Getting%20Started%20with%20the%20Velodyne%20VLP16
1 Access the Gnome Menu (Super key), type "Networks Connections" then run it.
2 Select the connection's name and click on "edit".
3 Choose the IPV4 Settings tab and change the “Method” field to "Manual". Set as below, according to
http://answers.ros.org/question/235992/why-routes-are-deleted-using-vlp16-and-rviz/ :

Is the setting correct?
4 sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.3.100
5 I don't what it means in tutorial: "Add a static route to the LIDAR's IP address. The IP address can be found on the CD case which was included with the LIDAR.  sudo route add 192.168.XX.YY eth0", since I don't have a CD. What should XX and YY be? Or can I skip this step?
Second method:
1 sudo route add 192.168.1.201 eth0  (Without turning off wire and change the settings in "Network Connections")
Third method:
1 sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.77 (Without turning off wire and change the settings in "Network Connections")
Fourth method:

sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.77

sudo route add 192.168.1.201 eth0

After any of the methods,
I applied:
$ roscore
change to the correct workspace
$source devel/setup.bash
$ roslaunch velodyne_pointcloud VLP16-points.launch
Then,
$ rostopic echo /velodyne_points
$ rostopic echo /velodyne_packets
no data was printed from any command above
Or
rosrun rviz rviz -f velodyne
After open the interface:

"No tf data. Actual error: Fixed frame [velodyne] doesn't exist"
So, what's wrong with the connection to VLP 16? Can you provide me with a detailed and correct way to connect VLP 16 to indigo (Don't mention the tutorial. It is based on HDL-32E)?
Thanks for you all!

A:

I don't think your Velodyne is connected, can you access the Velodyne interface on a browser ? The default IP address is 192.168.1.201. Looking at your screenshots, you have the name of the connection wrong, the connection has to be eth0. Change that and everything should work. Also, you need to add a pointcloud2 topic in Rviz, then double click pointcloud2 and from the drop down of topics, select /velodyne_points. You should be able to see your pointcloud then.

Okay, what if you enter 192.168.1.77 in the browser? Although, the default VLP-16 IP address is 192.168.1.201. You should try  this  to see which devices are connected.

ok , I do that, however, it dosen't work. the screen also shows NOT FOUND. What should I do?

What is the IP address of the VLP-16? You should know that once you see a list of connected devices. And once you figure the IP address, just type in the terminal and the Velodyne interface will open.

I should enter 192.168.1.77 in browser or terminal?
