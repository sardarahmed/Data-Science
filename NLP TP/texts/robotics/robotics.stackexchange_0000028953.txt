Q:

Rviz Visualization Topic in Gazebo

Hi,
I am looking to visualize some objects in gazebo, however, I don't  actually want them to be apart of the physical environment. I know that rviz has a topic called "visualization_marker" In which you can publish different types of markers via the visualization_msgs.msg structure.
Is there a away to do this Gazebo too?

Yes, Gazebo also has visualization markers, see this example: https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/src/gazebo11/examples/stand_alone/marker/

Thank you this worked. Do you know if it is possible to replicate this in python?

We don't have a python interface to ign-transport yet, so no easy way yet. I guess you could use ROS and the ros_ign bridge, but marker messages aren't supported yet.
