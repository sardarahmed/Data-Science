Q:

rosbridge questions

I am kinda new to ROS here. I'm confused as to how rosjs works, it specified in the tutorial that I need to run rosbridge, but since I am currently running on windows, is it possible to get the package via SVN checkout or apt-get repository?

Thanks BeuBeu! One other tip: uf you're running on windows, you probably want to use the "nightly" or experimental version at: http://brown-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/experimental/rosbridge . How exactly you download it via SVN will depend on your client.

Oh and I should of course point out that you can run rosbridge on a non-windows machine and do your JS stuff on the Windows machine or anywhere else.

Thanks for the replies. I managed to download the package with TortoiseSVN. Gonna try going through the tutorials on how to install the package.
If it is still impossible, I might give the second method a try.

So, I encountered this -
svn: OPTIONS of 'http://brown-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/experimental/rosbridge': could not connect to server (http://brown-ros-pkg.googlecode.com) while trying to get the package in Ubuntu.
Any help?
Okay, managed to solve it because of a proxy problem.
