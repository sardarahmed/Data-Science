Q:

Why rxgraph show partial information when selecting the combo box?

Hi~
I used rxgraph to see how gazebo works,
and I found a weird thing.
It showed all topics connecting to the gazebo node when
I didn't select any PATH combo box.
But when I selected the gazebo node of PATH combo box,
it just showed little parts of all topics which connecting the gazebo node.

I am wondering why this happens.
Thanks in advance.

A:

That's because you are filtering the graph to see only the topics and nodes whoose names or path start with "/gazebo/".
