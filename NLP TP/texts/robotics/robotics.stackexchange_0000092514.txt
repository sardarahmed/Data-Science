Q:

Catkin_make is unable to find package present in source folder

Hi All,
I am trying to work on Hector SLAM as per the instructions at the link.
I have ROS Kinetic installed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
I was able to clone the repository using the following code
cd catkin_workspace/src
git clone https://github.com/NickL77/RPLidar_Hector_SLAM

Once the repository is cloned I tried to compile the package
cd catkin_workspace
catkin_make --only-pkg-with-deps Rplidar_Hector_SLAM

The result is
 Base path: /home/rnd415/catkin_workspace
 Source space: /home/rnd415/catkin_workspace/src
 Build space: /home/rnd415/catkin_workspace/build
 Devel space: /home/rnd415/catkin_workspace/devel
 Install space: /home/rnd415/catkin_workspace/install
 Packages "RPLidar_Hector_SLAM" not found in the workspace

I don't know why ros is unable to find the package
I tried to sourcing the environment using
source /catkin_workspace/devel/setup.bash

but it does not change the error. How to resolve this error ?

A:

The name of the directory != of the package(s).
The repository is called RPLidar_Hector_SLAM, so git will clone it into a directory RPLidar_Hector_SLAM.
However, the repository contains two sub directories (which happen to contain packages with the same name):

hector_slam
rplidar_ros

those are the packages.
--only-pkg-with-deps only accepts names of packages, not of directories.
Note btw that both hector_slam as well as rplidar_ros are standalone packages that are normally hosted somewhere else. The NickL77/RPLidar_Hector_SLAM repository places them together, but does not track upstream. And it contains a snapshot of both packages of already 2.5 years old.
You may want to make sure you are not missing important bug fixes.
