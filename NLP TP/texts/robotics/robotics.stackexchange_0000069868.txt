Q:

Mac OS: ROS Build Errors (Indigo)

I'm using this: https://github.com/mikepurvis/ros-install-osx
Trying to install Indigo. (I got the same error for Jade - after failing I uninstalled Brew, deleted directories)
OS X Yosemite, ver 10.10.5
brew --version : 0.9.5 (git revision d430d; last commit 2015-10-05)
pip --version : pip 7.1.2 from /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages (python 2.7)
Any help highly appreciated.
Thanks in advance.

A:

Hey, thanks for trying out the Mac build. I'm pretty sure this is a regression, so I've responded to the discussion on the Github ticket. Let's continue the conversation there.
