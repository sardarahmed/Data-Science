Q:

orrosplanning test failure

Hi, all,
I downloaded openrave_planning stack and try to run the test file.
rosrun orrosplanning ik_openrave.py

Got the following error:
import orrosplanning.srv 

ImportError: No module named orrosplanning.srv`

Seems orrosplanning.srv is missing. Thanks for any suggestions.
ps: I didn't find orrosplanning.srv in /home/fei/openrave_planning/orrosplanning/srv, so do I miss some file.

Hi Fei Liu,
I am studying orrosplanning. But when I rosmake it and met the following errors at "xmlreaders-core.cpp", at line 98 in openrave package: no member DEBUGGING at Assimp:Logger... But I have installed the newest version of Assimp-dev 3.0. Could you help me about that?
Many thanks,
Haibin

A:

have you made everything inside openrave_planning?
roscd openrave_planning
rosmake

you are welcome! openrave updates very often, so every time after I update, i rosmake everything again.

Thanks for your suggestion and time. I just re-rosmake it and it works. It is amazing, but I did rosmake it before I use it.

hmm... i don't have that file either, but i could run rosrun orrosplanning ik_openrave.py without any problem... and your PYTHONPATH is NOT the same as mine, are you sure you included openrave's python libraries?
Comment by Fei Liu on 2011-06-23:
Yes, I have rosmake it. Could you check if you have the orrosplanning.srv under ../openrave_planning/orrosplanning/srv? I doubt I'm missing something.
