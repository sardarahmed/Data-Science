Q:

Does ROS have convenience function calls to convert from world XYZ to camera XY using the camera_info message?

The information is available in the camera_info message, but using standard functionality to convert would be much less error prone, and much less sloppy. Does such functionality exist?

A:

The image_geometry package contains helpers to do this.
There is a tutorial for how to project the XYZ origin of a reference frame into an image, so it should be an excellent example for what you described.
