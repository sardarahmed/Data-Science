Q:

visualize_velocity_profile.py not working in teb_local_planner?

$  
rosrun teb_local_planner_tutorials visualize_velocity_profile.py

Output:
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named visualize_velocity_profile.py below                 /home/chacha/glocal/src/teb_local_planner_tutorials
[rosrun] Found the following, but they're either not files,
[rosrun] or not executable:
[rosrun]   /home/chacha/glocal/src/teb_local_planner_tutorials/scripts/visualize_velocity_profile.py

A:

Hi @anirudhyadav1001!
The error happens because your file doesn't have "execute permissions".
In order to solve that, you can give "execute permissions" using the command below:
chmod +x visualize_velocity_profile.py

Now, if you call rosrun teb_local_planner_tutorials visualize_velocity_profile.py again it should work.
If you prefer, I've created a video where we give and remove "execute permissions" to confirm that this is the reason behind the error.
Cheers.
