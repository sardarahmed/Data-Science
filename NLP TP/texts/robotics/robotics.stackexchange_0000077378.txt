Q:

ROS indigo installation fails on Raspberry pi 2 and 3

I tried to follow the instructions below to install ROS indego on raspberry pi 2 and 3,
http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Installing%20ROS%20Indigo%20on%20Raspberry%20Pi
Both failed. I used latest image from raspberry website.
Raspberry pi 2 failure - Failing while installing liblz4-dev.
apt-get source -b lz4 command just runs for a very long time and gives below error
Read : 66 MB   ==> 59.22%   ^CMakefile:226: recipe for target 'test-lz4-basic' failed

make[1]: *** [override_dh_auto_test] Interrupt
debian/rules:33: recipe for target 'build' failed
make: *** [build] Error 1
dpkg-buildpackage: error: debian/rules build died from signal 2

Raspberry pi 3 failure - Failing during python installation stage,
sudo apt-get install python-pip python-setuptools python-yaml python-distribute python-docutils python-dateutil python-six
Error message
sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)

Do we have any recent image of raspbian Jessie with ROS Indigo installed?

A:

Just asking:
Read : 66 MB   ==> 59.22%   ^CMakefile

That ^, is that a control character (ie: the ctrl in ctrl+c)? I'm asking because make then reports [test-lz4-basic] Interrupt.
