Q:

local_planner seeing invisible wall

As seen in the image, the robot is detecting a curved wall in front of it and is stopping the route. However there isn't any wall in that position, just the ones on the sides, as seen on the map. What could it be?

Again, there is nothing in front of the robot, but it is seeing a wall
I'm also receiving these warnings:
[WARN] [1683209662.283217847]: Map update loop missed its desired rat e of 5.0000Hz... the loop actually took 0.2276 seconds.     
[WARN] [1683209662.457042787]: Control loop missed its desired rate o f 5.0000Hz... the loop actually took 0.2017 seconds.

I don't know if it has something to do with it, as I have been receiving this warnings way before this problem.

Thanks for the headsup! It's fixed now.

A:

We found out that the prohibition areas plugin were consuming too much of our robot, removing them stopped that problem. (Prohibition areas made our Raspberry CPU go to 100%, while without it it wont go past 25%..).
Probably sometimes it would freeze and not compute its odometry correctly, therefore thinking that it was seeing a wall when it wasn't.
