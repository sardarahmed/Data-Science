Q:

segmentation fault in gazebo

I use ubuntu 14.04, ros indigo, verion 1.11.9.
I run this command:
roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch
Sometimes I have a segmentation fault (core dumped). Then I try to rerun the command. It can work as usual or fail again. Usually after three or four rerun it works correctly. You can see the error below (or on the picture 2.png). I have no idea how to repeat this bug, but it appears quite often. Do you have any ideas how can I fix this problem?
Iâ€™ve seen some questions about segmentation fault but there was no answer which can help.

Maybe try cross-posting on http://answers.gazebosim.org/.  Also cut and pasting text in here instead of screenshots will make it easier for others to search for the same problem.

@lucasw Thanks. I have edited the question.

A:

I've seen this behavior on many machines that do not have nvidia cards (or proprietary nvidia drivers not installed/used). There doesn't seem to be much you can do about it apart from re-launching till it works AFAIK. See also related Gazebo tickets: startup errors on some gpus, segfault of tests in intel video cards.

I am facing the same issue, I have NVIDIA graphics card with proprietary drivers. Still the issue persists.
Did anyone find a solution?
