Q:

Error in amcl node while configuring navigation stack simulation

I have configured the navigation stack to a mobile robot model. When i tried to launch the below file got a following error. I am sure the error is with amcl node because i checked other nodes, launch file works fine without the amcl node.
<launch>
  <!-- Load the TortoiseBot URDF model into the parameter server -->
  <param name="robot_description" textfile="$(find jmbot1_description)/urdf/jmbot1.1.urdf" />
  <!-- Start Gazebo with a world containing a large building-->
  <include file="$(find gazebo_ros)/launch/willowgarage_world.launch"/>
  <!-- include file="$(find gazebo_ros)/launch/empty_world.launch"/ -->
  <!-- Spawn a TortoiseBot in Gazebo, taking the description from the
       parameter server -->
  <node name="spawn_urdf" pkg="gazebo_ros" type="spawn_model" 
    args="-param robot_description -urdf -model jmbot1.1 -x 8 -y -8" />
 
<!-- Convert /joint_states messages published by Gazebo to /tf messages,
       e.g., for rviz-->
  <node name="robot_state_publisher" pkg="robot_state_publisher"
        type="robot_state_publisher"/>
  <node name="map_server" pkg="map_server" type="map_server"
        args="$(find mapping)/src/maps/willow.yaml"  />
  
<include file="$(find amcl)/examples/amcl_diff.launch"/>

  <node pkg="move_base" type="move_base" respawn="false" name="move_base" output="screen">
    <rosparam file="$(find jmbot1_description)/src/costmap_common_params.yaml" command="load" ns="global_costmap" />
    <rosparam file="$(find jmbot1_description)/src/costmap_common_params.yaml" command="load" ns="local_costmap" />
    <rosparam file="$(find jmbot1_description)/src/local_costmap_params.yaml" command="load" />
    <rosparam file="$(find jmbot1_description)/src/global_costmap_params.yaml" command="load" />
    <rosparam file="$(find jmbot1_description)/src/base_local_planner_params.yaml" command="load" />
  </node>

 
</launch>

Error:

[ERROR] [1454003234.548580927,

though the message notifier is in use

I have verified the rqt_graph and here is it for ref

A:

I'm guessing you are using this URDF from your other question.
Then, the solution is simple. You don't have a link which is called base_link, only one which is called Base_plate.
You need to configure the navigation (move_base, amcl, the different costmaps, etc.) to use you frame Base_plate (or change the link in your URDF).
Check out the Tutorials on the ROS wiki, especially this one about how a usual setup for navigation is with regards to URDF and TF.
