Q:

Multiple robots in Gazebo

I am working with a simulated robot in Gazebo that comes from a urdf.xacro
I expect to have multiple copies of it.
The thing is that I want to change the origin of my robots not manually (when I launch them). I know that there is a tag inside the robot.urdf.xacro file that specifies the origin, but I want to know if there is any parameter which I can modify without having to rewrite the urdf file.
Can you help me?
Thanks
