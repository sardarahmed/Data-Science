Q:

ATLAS control reverse engineer on ROS-Gazebo

Hi everyone, My name is Diego Cifuentes and I am working on the implementation of a control system for stability in biped robots, currently. I am using the platform ROS (Robot Operating System) and the simulator Gazebo. Could someone advise me on some files in programming ROS. I need to reverse engineer the file extension (. Launch) static and dynamic control of the ATLAS platform (biped robot). Help me, please. Any suggestions.

A:

Your question is extremely vague and hence it is hard to give you an/any answer.
Both ROS and Gazebo offer a lot of on-line documentation and tutorials (ROS wiki, Gazebo wiki). I suggest you start there in order to learn the basics of both tools. This shouldn't take you too long.
Afterwards, feel free to use ROS and Gazebo Answers for further help. But please remember to ask specific questions, then it is more likely you will get an answer.
Good luck!
PS: Look at this tutorial for a roslaunch-quickstart (uses .launch files). However, I still recommend to go through the other tutorials as well.
