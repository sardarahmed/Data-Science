does rospy support scripting in jython?

I am trying to integrate a dialogue classifier in rospy on the NAO robot. I am planning to use the jython script for the stanford nlp parser but i dont know if rospy will support this script. will it?

A:

You problem is not correctly formulated.
CPython (the classical interpreter) and Jython are two interpreters.
I.e. they both are programs implemented in two different languages.
Compatibility between all interpreters is mainly insured but there are some
slight differences which are listed here:
http://www.jython.org/archive/21/docs/differences.html
In anycase, they both interpret Python files (or modules). As rospy is written in Python you
should be able to use rospy with Jython. Again the best way is to try to import the module
and see what happens.
