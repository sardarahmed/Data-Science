Q:

Multiple solutions from IK solver?

Is it possible to obtain multiple IK solutions for all the joints of an arm from the IK Solver (pr2_right_arm_kinematics/get_ik) for one specific pose of a link (i.e. r_wrist_roll_link)?

A:

Yes, this is possible. You can call the service multiple times with a different state in the ik_seed_state each time and it should give you different solutions.
