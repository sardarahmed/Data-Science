Q:

Is an update from Groovy to Hydro necessary to use Kinect?

I got a kinect and I am trying to follow the documentation http://wiki.ros.org/openni_launch/Tutorials/QuickStart
However, I get the following output.

$  roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch

[openni.launch] is neither a launch file in package [openni_launch] nor is [openni_launch] a launch file name

I am currently on Groovy. Should I update to Hydro? If yes, How?
Or is it related to some other problem?

A:

The OpenNI packages are available for Groovy. Try installing them with sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-openni-launch.
