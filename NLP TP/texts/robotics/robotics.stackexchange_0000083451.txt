Q:

Import error catkin_pkg while importing rosbag, roslib and rospy

I am novice to ROS and I followed the ROS installation tutorial to install ROS kinetic. After installing, I open python to import rospy, roslib and rosbag, but it throws the following error:

import roslib
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/roslib/__init__.py", line 54, in <module>
    import roslib.stacks
  File "/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/roslib/stacks.py", line 46, in <module>
    import roslib.packages
  File "/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/roslib/packages.py", line 49, in <module>
    from catkin.find_in_workspaces import find_in_workspaces as catkin_find
  File "/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/catkin/find_in_workspaces.py", line 36, in <module>
    from catkin_pkg.packages import find_packages
ImportError: No module named catkin_pkg.packages

I again installed catkin_pkg using the following command but nothing happened:
  sudo apt-get install --reinstall python-catkin-pkg

Can anyone suggest me where I am going wrong?

Please tell us how you installed ROS: using apt-get or building from sources, on which Linux distribution this is and which "ROS installation tutorial" you followed (link).

Also: do you source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash before starting the python interpreter?
Comment by Ashutosh Mishra on 2017-10-20:
Yes I did source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash and I followed the following link for installation: http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu

Please post the output of python -c "import catkin_pkg; print(catkin_pkg.__file__)".

Thanks a lot, this link helped me https://answers.ros.org/question/126471/cmake-failed-catkin_pkg/, particularly installing pip install catkin_pkg

A:

As the comments on the referenced question mention you should not install catkin_pkg via pip. This is why you have the problem in the first place. And when the next version is released as a Debian package you will have the same problem again since your old pip package overlays the new Debian pkg.
