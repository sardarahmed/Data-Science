Q:

OpenNi Skeleton Tracking - Save calibration data

Hello,
i use the openNi skeleton tracking. I achieved good results by saving the calibration data of the first Person, and the loading the data for all other Persons. Is it possible to save/load the data to/from a file or something like that? I found nothing like that in the API...
cheers,
Thorsten

A:

you can use Bags if you want to store ROS messages, if thats what you want. If its just some bunch of params then you could just write your own file for saving and loading.

Bags are the solution in ROS, for OpenNI native solution I suggest you ask this on their forums.

I know about bags, but that's not the solution... The Problem is in the OpenNi API...
