Q:

Which stack is has file libgazebo_ros_openni_kinect.so?

I am running simulation TurtleBot (roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_empty_world.launch) and taking error "Failed to load libgazebo_ros_openni_kinect.so: libgazebo_ros_openni_kinect.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory". Where is that file to find?
