Q:

Differential Drive ROS Plugin stops responding after reset_simulation or reset_world

This is a cross-post with one at answers.gazebosim.org, but it's not getting much traffic over there so I thought I would try here as well.
I have a basic differential drive robot that uses the differential drive ROS plugin that stops responding after I call reset_simulation or reset_world. I'm using ROS Hydro and Gazebo 1.9. For context, I am trying to collect data on several sets of trajectories (100's of trajectories total), which is why I would like to be able to reset the simulator and drive the next trajectory automatically.
As far as I can tell, this has nothing to do with any code I have written. When I start up Gazebo and the model loads in an empty world, the model will respond to commands sent on /cmd_vel, even using rostopic pub, so I know it's not any problem with code I have written. After using rosservice call /gazebo/reset_simulation or reset_world, the position of the model is reset correctly and the simulation continues to run, but commands sent to /cmd_vel are ignored.
One hint that might be helpful, is that if I call reset_simulation, the /odom topic is no longer published to either, but if I call reset_world, the /odom topic continues to be published (and it indicates a tiny amount of movement in the model).
I'm not sure if this is a bug, or some sort of problem with the way I am specifying my model (it's a pretty simple model, so that seems unlikely), but I have replicated it on two different computers.
Has anyone else run into this issue? If so, how did you resolve it? If it is in fact a bug, where should I submit the bug report?
Thanks in advance for your time.
