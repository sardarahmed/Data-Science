Q:

rqt_plot not found

Following the ROS tutorial, when I'm trying to plot the position of the turtle, I get the following error:
$ rosrun rqt_plot rqt_plot --args /turtle1/pose/x:y
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named rqt_plot below /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/rqt/rqt_plot
[rosrun] Found the following, but they're either not files, 
[rosrun] or not executable:
[rosrun]   /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/rqt/rqt_plot
[rosrun]   /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/rqt/rqt_plot/src/rqt_plot

Any ideas why this might be happening?
By the way, rqt_gui works fine.

A:

rqt_plot is a plugin for the gui.  If you run rqt_gui, there should be a 'Plugins' menu item in the main window that lets you select a plugin to display. You can then specify the topic in the text box in the panel that comes up.
EDIT: To get more plugins for rqt, just apt-get them, as in the guide here.
