Q:

Ros enabled plugin examples use c++11?

I am following:
http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?cat=guided_i&tut=guided_i6
I keep getting " ‘thread’ in namespace ‘std’ does not name a type " make errors that refer to the code in the guide:
private: std::thread rosQueueThread;
in my CMakeLists I have
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} ${GAZEBO_CXX_FLAGS}")
I am using gazebo 1.9.6 and ROS hydro
It seems like these examples are using c++11?
Are there some ROS enabled plugin examples that do not use c++11?
I am clearly missing something here :) Thanks for all the help

A:

Gazebo only supports C++11 from version 5.
This tutorial might be relevant to you, it's listed as working for Gazebo versions 1.9+.
Regarding tutorials organization
The tutorials live in this repository. Anyone can add or edit tutorials from there. Bigger changes to the website organization can't be done directly, but feel free to open an issue with your proposals.
In any case, I actually found this one by googling for "gazebo ros plugin", it was the first link from http://gazebosim.org that came up.
Another hint for finding tutorials is to use the browse view and do a Ctrl+F on the page.

Oh I see. This is exactly what I needed. Is there a way to propose enhancements for gazebosim.org  tutorials organisation? I would have never found that myself haha Seems like older versions of gazebo  are lost in the sands of time
