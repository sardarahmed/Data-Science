Q:

Building my first quadcopter

I am trying to build a quadcopter from scratch. I have selected few parts but I have no idea whether the quadcopter will come together and fly.
I would appreciate your feedback on whether the parts I have selected are compatible (UBEC, Motor). If not, I would appreciate suggestions.
The frame for my quadcopter is in the X configuration and I am making my own. I am expecting the average weight of the quad to be around 800g. I hope the motors and prop combination can hover it well.

A:

So generally for Quadcopter design you want the hover throttle (the point where the weight is balanced with the thrust produced) should be 50%. So if you look at the product page for the motor you posted you will see some measured thrust values

10x4.7 - 11.1v - 21A - 1150g Thrust
9050 - 11.1v - 18A - 900g Thrust
1060 (3 blade) - 11.1v - 23A - 1200g Thrust

with a 9x4.5 prop  your going to get a hair less than the rated thrust for a 9050 (9x5) prop, with four motors you will probably get around 3000g of thrust or, based on a 800g frame a 26% hover throttle, as you can see the motor is capping out at 18A meaning you could go with a 20A esc to save weight. This data is based on a 3s battery so with a hover current draw of 18A*4*.26=18.7A you could get around 7mins of flight time with a 2.2Ah battery (2.2Ah/18.75A)

4 x motors 304g
4 x props 36g
4 x 30A esc 128g
1 x 2.2Ah 3S battery 163g

this is already 632g pretty close to 800g this is without a flight controller or misc connectors receiver frame etc... is it possible? yes but expect it to be a little heavier.
