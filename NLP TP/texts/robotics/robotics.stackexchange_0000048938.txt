Q:

Catkin BFL build fails - 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'rfind'

Hi guys,
Thanks for reading my question.
I'm attempting to install ROS on Ubuntu 12.04 on a Pandaboard ES REV B.
I've followed the manual here to install from source.
At the moment, I am at step 3.1.3 Building the Catkin Workspace.  I run the command
$ sudo ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install-space /opt/ros/groovy

from my directory:
$ /opt/ros/groovy/ros_catkin_ws 

pandaboardalpha@pandaboardalpha:/opt/ros/groovy/ros_catkin_ws$ sudo ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated  --install-space /opt/ros/groovy
Base path: /opt/ros/groovy/ros_catkin_ws
Source space: /opt/ros/groovy/ros_catkin_ws/src
Build space: /opt/ros/groovy/ros_catkin_ws/build_isolated
Devel space: /opt/ros/groovy/ros_catkin_ws/devel_isolated
Install space: /opt/ros/groovy

I just wondered if anyone else had this error.  The bfl package actually installs properly, since I found it in /opt/ros/groovy/ros_catkin_ws/build_isolated.
I guess the problem is in the generation of "env.sh", but I don't know enough about it to know.
The end goal is to install openni on the board an interface with the Kinect, so if there's a simpler better way to go about it, I'm all ears!
Thank you for reading this far!!!
Best,
Nathan

A:

ok, the bug is actually in catkin 0.5.63, we're about to release a fix I think.

YES - I have 'build' and 'devel' folders appear also.  Will run more tests and update soon.  Thanks!
