How to install nav2d packages

I have installed the nav2d from http://wiki.ros.org/nav2d by using: sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-nav2d
and then I have to install additional packages, but it dos not work!
I use for example:   sudo apt-get install stage_ros
but get this output:
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package stage_ros
Can anyone help to how can I install these packages ?

A:

You should not install dependencies manually. By using "apt-get install" all dependencies should be installed on your system. The correct package name for Stage is ros-indigo-stage-ros.

From Synaptic Package Manager was p2os_urdf package missing. Now I can run the simulator but it shows the error. ERROR: cannot launch node of type [p2os_urdf/p2os_publisher_3at]: can't locate node [p2os_publisher_3at] in package [p2os_urdf]

p2os_urdf is optional, because it's not released into indigo. You can either get the source code from github, or just uncomment the part from the launch file. (It's only used to show the pioneer-model in RVIZ)
