Q:

RTABMAP Navigation without providing a map

Hello!
I have been searching but haven't found out how the navigation stack works when no static map is given. My questions are:

Can Rtabmap be run without a static map? If yes, how is localization done?
How are you able to specify a goal position for the robot without a map?
How is global planning done without knowledge of the environment?

Thanks!!

A:

rtabmap is a tool. It's not used for "standard" navigation. It's purpose is to build a map using sensors on the robot. Localization is often done by odometry from wheel encoders, or sometimes by gps when outdoors. It's an on-going research problem on how to correct the localization drift once enough data is gathered.
