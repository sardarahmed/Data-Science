Q:

Provide empty string as roslaunch argument substitution

I have a default.launch file with some arguments and default values (strings).
I would like to substitute a default value with an empty string while launching, e.g.
roslaunch pkg default.launch arg1:=""

But the substitution is ignored. Also ignored are:
roslaunch pkg default.launch arg1:=''
roslaunch pkg default.launch arg1:=" "

etc.
Working substitutions are:
roslaunch pkg default.launch arg1:="!"
roslaunch pkg default.launch arg1:='test'

etc.
How can I provide an empty string as an argument substitution?

I've messed with this for a while and can't get it. You can set an empty string as the default value and that works. What are you trying to achieve with this? Would an empty string default work for you?

Thank you for your feedback. E.g. I have an argument which defaults to /sonar, because that's the default sonar topic. An empty string disables sonar processing. I guess the easiest workaround would be creating a new launch file.

I opened an issue at GitHub.

A:

A friendly GitHub user reminded me, that in bash you use quotation marks to group space-separated strings as a single argument, so everything ROS receives is roslaunch pkg default.launch arg1:=.
To keep the quotes, you can use single quotes around the double qoutes:
roslaunch pkg default.launch arg1:='""'
