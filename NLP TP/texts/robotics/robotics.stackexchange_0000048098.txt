Q:

roslaunch external program

Is it possible to run a non-ros program from a roslaunch file? For example, I would like to run the system installed version of Gazebo.
I looked in the roslaunch documentation, and couldn't find a solution.

A:

AFAIK it's not possible. Depending on how much you need it, you could create a ROS package with one bash script sytem_run.sh or similar, that just runs whatever binary + args is passed as params.
