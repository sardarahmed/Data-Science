Q:

Multiple Robotino co-ordination

Hello, I am new to ROS and just I have just managed to install and run the robotino-ros-pkg in my ubuntu VM. I am working on multiple robotinos and I needed to create a static map for them to run in. I was following the gmapping tutorial and I was able to launch all the nodes, and also open rviz successfully. But before launching rviz I get the following of errors in the gmapping launch terminal
libGL error: pci id for fd 24: 80ee:beef, driver (null)
OpenGL Warning: Failed to connect to host. Make sure 3D acceleration is enabled for this VM.
libGL error: core dri or dri2 extension not found
libGL error: failed to load driver: vboxvideo
Inspite of these errors rviz opens up but I am not able to move the robotino around with the keyboard as suggested in the tutorial.
The RobotModel section in the Displays Menu has error status but I do not have enough points to make an upload, but all the subsections inside RobotModel are marked in red and the following message is displayed alongside
anglebracketusb_link No transform from [anglebracketusb_link] to [map]
base_link No transform from [base_link] to [map]
and so on for command_bridge_link, kinect_link etc.
I need to create a static map with static obstacles and targets to create a co-ordination mechanism between the two robotinos, any kind of guidance is appreciated.Thanks in advance.

A:

Fixed after Ubuntu upgrade. All the errors disappeared. Robotino movement only possible when the terminal running teleop node launch is on top
