Hello EGYRos,
although I am not familiar with the Turtlebot2 Ubuntu Package (maybe you are referring to the turtlebot ROS package?) and cannot find the package named turtlebot2 I would like to point out that there is a /scan topic on your list.
Try:
rostopic info /scan

I am guessing you will find that messages being passed in this topic are of type sensor_msgs/LaserScan.
If you look at the depthimage_to_laserscan package you will find that it publishes laser scan on topic /scan.
If you would like your laser scan to be published on another topic, you can remap it:
rosrun depthimage_to_laserscan depthimage_to_laserscan scan:=laser/scan

However, that would be a quick fix. I am guessing that /laser prefix is here because of the laser namespace and maybe it would be better practice to include is as a namespace tag in your launch file. An example of setting namespace in launch file can be found here.
Furthermore, I can see you are using RGBD camera and depthimage_to_laserscan package to obtain laser scan like measurements.
Just a heads up, depthimage_to_laserscan is a lazy subscriber meaning it won't subscribe to a camera image topic and camera info topic unless there are no subscribers to /scan topic. The easiest way to ensure that there is a subscriber is to simply visualize it in rviz.
If you have any further question, feel free to ask it.
