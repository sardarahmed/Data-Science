Q:

Moveit2 Tutorial - Move Group C++ Interface. Not Avoiding the Placed Box

The tutorial runs flawlessly with no errors or failures, however when the box is placed in the world. The robot does not seem to care that it is there and rams right into it.

Has anyone else had this happen or seen this and have a solution?
