Q:

How to simulate food items in gazebo

We need to work on project which involves PR2 to pickup food items from a container[bowl] using a fork/spoon. But since we are very new to ROS/Gazebo, we are not sure about which type of food we can simulate on gazebo [i.e rice,fruit pieces,cereals etc].
Does anybody know of exiting food item models on gazebo or how difficult is it to create such models?

A:

Give Blender a try. It's simple and easy to use. It can export to all ROS-support mesh types to be used in Gazebo. You won't be able to simulate the texture of foods (Gazebo bodies are rigid), but you can certainly create the shapes in no time at all.

Thanks, guess will have to approximate food items to rigid shapes.
