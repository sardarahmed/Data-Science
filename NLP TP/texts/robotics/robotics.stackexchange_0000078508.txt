Q:

Publish Joint position step by step

Greetings,
I need an advice about how to perform my robot simulation. I have a node that subscribe a topic and use the data subscribed to create a vector with all the angle that a joint has to reach through the final joint angle. I have three different joints, which is the best message to publish that contains the three joint angles? How can I publish them step by step. How can I make the second node that subscribe these joint angles?
Thank you

A:

You need to create a URDF description of your robot, with links and joints for any moving or fixed relationships between the various reference frames. Then you should launch robot_state_publisher and joint_state_publisher to supply frame transformations as requested. In particular, you should configure joint_state_publisher to listen for the topics on which you will publish the joint states.
Presumably you'll either write a custom node or use a package like moveit to calculate and publish the required joint angles.
To actually perform the joint movements, you'll need a custom node that listens for the joint states and talks to your hardware, unless there is an appropriate package already available.
You should probably read these:

URDF tutorials: read the tf tutorial and then 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, and 4.5.
robot_state_publisher documentation
joint_state_publisher documentation
