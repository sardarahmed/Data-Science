Q:

tf tree in namespace

I'm trying to see my tf tree (rqt_tf_tree, tf view_frames, etc.) for a namespaced robot. I can't seem to get the system to behave the way I want it to. I have tried setting the ROS_NAMESPACE environment variable to my namespace, and then running rosrun tf view_frames and rqt_tf_tree, but it simply shows that no tf tree exists. I can see the tree exists in RViz, as well as by echoing /namespace/tf and /namespace/tf_static. Any ideas?

A:

NVM, figured it out.
Just needed to remap /tf and /tf_static per here.
E.g. rosrun tf view_frames /tf:=/namespace/tf /tf_static:=/namespace/tf_static
