Q:

Install Err no package conf file message_generation

Hello,
I am trying to install groovy on OSx 10.8.2, following this guide
hxxp://www.ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/OSX/Homebrew/Source
when i configure the build this happens
-- +++ processing catkin package: 'std_msgs'
-- ==> add_subdirectory(std_msgs)
CMake Error at build/devel/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:71 (find_package):
Could not find a package configuration file provided by
"message_generation" with any of the following names:
message_generationConfig.cmake
message_generation-config.cmake

Add the installation prefix of "message_generation" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
set "message_generation_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
files.  If "message_generation" provides a separate development package or
SDK, be sure it has been installed.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
std_msgs/CMakeLists.txt:4 (find_package)
-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
Can someone please help?

A:

I had the same problem while installing groovy on Arch Linux.
I fixed it by cloning into the repository (and message_runtime) in groovy_underlay thusly:
cd ~/groovy_underlay
git clone https://github.com/ros/message_generation.git
git clone https://github.com/ros/message_runtime.git
