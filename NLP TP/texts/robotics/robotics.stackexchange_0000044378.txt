Q:

Plans to extend Gazebo world editor?

Hi there,
are any plans to extend the Gazebo world editor in the short term future? To support loading of arbitrary mesh files (through drop-down menu for instance) and saving of the created world configurations for instance?

I guess there are plans, at least according to the version 1.0 design specification.

Thx again Lenz, I overlooked that. Not sure marking this as a correct answer does not work for me.

Ahh, wow, but also just realized that that specification is about 1.5 years old. Is anyone from the Gazebo core development around and could confirm that it is still in place?

hi there, yes we are specifically working on improving the ui.  as of now on dev branch off mercurial, one should be able to click-spawn object in gui, move it around and save the world file.  also working on extending ui in various ways, e.g. save/resume state, etc..  we'll keep everyone posted.

John if you need beta testers/help with the code let us know where the repo is and how we could help. Sounds very, very interesting.

I'm also offering help with code/testing.
