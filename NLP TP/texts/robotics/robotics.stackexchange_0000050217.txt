Q:

[rospy] Disable message queue

Hi,
I have a some computation that takes a while connected to topic. I wan't that next message for computation is as fresh as possible. I have tried setting the queue to zero which results in error and setting it to one doest much help.
sub = rospy.Subscriber("~input",i nput_cb, queue_size = 1)

Test output:
[INFO] [WallTime: 1365585376.358492] msg is 0.2299852 s old!
[INFO] [WallTime: 1365585377.532643] msg is 1.3721399 s old!

A:

I'm not sure what's wrong with that code, but you can achieve what you want to do by using rospy.wait_for_message instead of a Subscriber.
