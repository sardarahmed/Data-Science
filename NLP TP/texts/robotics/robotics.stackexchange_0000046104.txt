Q:

Custom ROS Variant

Can I declare my own variant in rosdistro/releases/groovy.yaml to install only the packages I want?
Why would I want to do this? Not everything historically works/compiles on OSX and I would like to select which packages I install instead of the historical "ROS-Full". I am also doing work with Debian on Raspberry Pi and would like to do something similar.
Example use case:
variants:
ros-base:

actionlib
catkin
common_msgs
gencpp
genlisp
…
kevin-varient
actionlib
catkin
vision_opencv
tf
….

If "yes," then how can I do this? Is it something like:

fork rosdistro
make changes to rosdistro/releases/groovy.yaml similar to above
edit /etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d/20-default.list to point to my fork on github
rosinstall --catkin ~/ros "http://github.com/whatever/groovy.yaml"

A:

Variants are changing drastically in Groovy.
You should now be able to define a catkin metapackage containing only a package.xml file listing the desired dependencies.

For non catkin based things variants can only be setup in the ROSDISTRO.rosdistro file, aka groovy.rosdistro file.  If you submit a custom variant as a ticket on the ros trac we can add it.  Looking forward as @joq mentions a variant will simply be a released metapackage with the common toolchain.
