Q:

Gazebo on Windows 10 error when running

I've managed to build Gazebo as per the instructions (although it has taken me every evening for nearly a week hint for others use CMake version 3.2.3, I had problems with versions above and below that).
When I attempt to run the server I'm getting the output below. Does that provide any indication of what the specific problem could lie other than most likely something to do with Ogre?
I am now in the process of downloading and building the Ogre samples to make sure they run on my machine but I thought I'd check if the console output provided a likely pointer to the Gazebo problem at the same time.

A:

I stumbled across the log file in C:\Users\username.gazebo\ogre.log and saw the attempt to load dll's from C:\Users\username\gz-ws\ogre_src_v1-8-1-vc12-x64-release-debug\build\install\Debug\bin\Debug (the path provided in the install instructions).
Changed the paths in the plugins.cfg files to the location I did the Gazebo build:
PluginFolder=F:\gz-ws\ogre_src_v1-8-1-vc12-x64-release-debug\build\install\Release\bin\Release
And now gzserver runs!
Running the gzclient still gets a crash but I'll look into that separately.
