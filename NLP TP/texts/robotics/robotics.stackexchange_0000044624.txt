Q:

rosserial Fuerte install help [Solved]

EDIT: Managed to download from source and install without issue. Had to restart as updates were preventing connections.
Hey
I am currently trying to install rosserial for ROS Fuerte, and I keep getting that rosserial can not be found.
From everything I have seen it should exist, however following instructions from http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Arduino%20IDE%20Setup do not seem to be working.
Trying to download from debs I get the following.
robot@robot:~$ sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-rosserial
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-diamondback-rosserial
Trying to install from source, I am new'ish to Ubunutu so this error I think is as simple as me missing something.
robot@robot:~$ hg clone https://kforge.ros.org/rosserial/hg rosserial
abort: error: no host given
What steps am I missing to download rosserial correctly?
