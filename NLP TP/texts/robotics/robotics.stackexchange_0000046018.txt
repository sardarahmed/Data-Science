Q:

generating documentation with doxygen: encoding problems

When I try to generate the doxygen documentation of my C++ Code I get the error explained below. Does anybody know how to avoid this problem? Does this mean that my doxygen documentation on C++ files is bad-written? Thanks in advance

$ rosrun rosdoc rosdoc mypackage

A:

I expect that this is a problem with unicode, or the lack there of, in the xml parsing. \xf1 is the ~n as in your name and I expect you used it in the author or maintainer field.  I'd try removing the character and trying again.

That was the problem. I removed (sadly) the ñ in my name and worked.  Thanks! :-)
