Q:

Laser Positioning on robot

I have a laser pushed forward to the front of my robot. I hit stuff when I navigate, so I'm trying to fix that... How do I make the tf understand the laser is pushed forward?
Also, I want to reconfigure the footprint of the robot. Any help?

So I found this launch file:
<launch>
    <!-- publish the static transform from the center of the robot to the laser rangefinder (required for slam_gmapping) -->
    <node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="base_link_to_laser" args="0 0.1778 0 0 0 0 base_link laser 100" />
</launch>

Any idea how to adjust it?

A:

You need to either use a static_transform_publisher as this tutorial shows or create a URDF file as these tutorials show.
Edit: You can find the documentation for static_transform_publisherer here. The numbers specify the position of your sensor in the robot's base, format is x, y, z, yaw, pitch, roll.
