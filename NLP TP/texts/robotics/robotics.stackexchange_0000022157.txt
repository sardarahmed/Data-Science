Q:

Small AGV robot for ROS application

I am looking for an off-the-shelf small AGV which runs or could be used with ROS. It may include some basic sensors like a camera, an IMU, an Ultrasonic range finder, etc.
Really appreciate all the valuable suggestions from the community.

A:

The turtlebot-3 is a good option. It comes in two variants and has basic sensors ideal for teaching/learning ROS. Clearpath has several options ranging from small to large robots. These are the ones I am familiar with. If you are looking beyond these: ros-robots has an official list of robots with intended capabilities listed out.
Also, there is the option of learning ROS in simulation using either Gazebo or something like the construct.
