Q:

Specifying constants in VehicleStateCommand not working as expected

I'm using the Lexus2016RXHybrid vehicle in the LGSVL simulator as described in these instructions, along with the lgsvl_interface and rosbridge.js built from the 0.2.7 branch.
When sending this message on the CLI:
 ros2 topic pub /lgsvl/vehicle_state_cmd autoware_auto_msgs/msg/VehicleStateCommand "{blinker: 3}" --once

I was expecting the right blinker to flash since uint8 BLINKER_RIGHT = 3, but in fact the hazard lights flash.
Here is the message interface:
$ ros2 msg show autoware_auto_msgs/msg/VehicleStateCommand
# VehicleStateCommand.msg

builtin_interfaces/Time stamp
uint8 blinker 0
uint8 headlight 0
uint8 wiper 0
uint8 gear 0
uint8 mode 0
bool hand_brake false
bool horn false

### Definitions
# Blinker
uint8 BLINKER_NO_COMMAND = 0
uint8 BLINKER_OFF = 1
uint8 BLINKER_LEFT = 2
uint8 BLINKER_RIGHT = 3
uint8 BLINKER_HAZARD = 4

Thanks for the report! As this bug is confirmed to exist, I've created an issue over on the Autoware.Auto Gitlab: https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.auto/AutowareAuto/-/issues/384
Since we're currently working on making sure that interactions work correctly in the simulator, this should be addressed shortly.
