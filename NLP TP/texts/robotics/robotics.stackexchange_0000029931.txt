Q:

Converting from RGB to depth

hello,
i know  that given a (u,v,depth) in the depth image it is easy to retreive the corresponding rgb pixel by unporjecting the depth pixel and projecting to RGB image using the [R T]
now my question is, is it possible to do the inverse ? ( having an rgb pixel, retreive the corresponding depth pixel?) and if yes, how ?
thx

A:

openni_camera already provides what you are looking for by default in its current version!
If you have a look at the rgb and depth image you will find that the depth image is already transformed and projected to camera coordinates of the rgb camera:

Note that you can turn this off by changing the setting for depth_registration after running:
rosrun dynamic_reconfigure reconfigure_gui

Make sure to have a look at the wiki page as well.
