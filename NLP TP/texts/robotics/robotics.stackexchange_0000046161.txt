Hello, i'm trying to update my simulator gazebo to fix the contact sensors problem, i'am working with ubuntu 12.04 and ROS fuerte, i'm following the Overlay_intallation, but when i try to update the repository i obtain this:
jose@ubuntu:~/fuerte_workspace/sandbox$ rosws set simulator_gazebo --hg https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/simulator_gazebo/tags/simulator_gazebo-1.7.6/simulator_gazebo

     Add new elements:
  sandbox/simulator_gazebo      hg  https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/simulator_gazebo/tags/simulator_gazebo-1.7.6/simulator_gazebo   

Continue: (y)es, (n)o: y
Overwriting /home/jose/fuerte_workspace/.rosinstall

Do not forget to do ...
$ source /home/jose/fuerte_workspace/setup.sh
... in every open terminal.
Config changed, remember to run 'rosws update sandbox/simulator_gazebo' to update the folder from hg
jose@ubuntu:~/fuerte_workspace/sandbox$ rosws update simulator_gazebo

A:

There were some server issues in the last few days.  The 404 errors suggests that the files it was looking for were unavailable.  I'd suggest trying again.
