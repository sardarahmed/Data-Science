Q:

How to make rviz2 startup navigation automatically

Hey, in my project, I open multiple instances of rviz2, one for each robot. Every time, I need to press the "Startup" button in Rviz for the map to show and I can publish an initial pose from a seperate script.

I want this to happen from the launch file and I thought the autostart launch parameter would do this, but it does not, or maybe I'm doing something wrong.
There also does not seem to be a difference in the .rviz configuration file after pressing startup.
Any ideas?

A:

I think autostart launch parameter should be good enough, can you share you launchers?
You can base your launcher on this one here: https://github.com/SteveMacenski/nav2_rosdevday_2021
Concretely this part:
bringup_cmd = IncludeLaunchDescription(
    PythonLaunchDescriptionSource(
        os.path.join(nav2_launch_dir, 'bringup_launch.py')),
    launch_arguments={'slam': slam,
                      'map': map_yaml_file,
                      'use_sim_time': use_sim_time,
                      'params_file': params_file,
                      'autostart': 'True'}.items())

Yes, mine looks the same with autostart set to True.
My problem was that I have separated the global planner from the rest of the nav stack and launching that and rviz on a separate machine from the simulation.
After enabling autostart on the simulation machine, it worked...
I wonder what lifecycle node is needed for rviz to do it?
