Q:

Using the Planning Comptonents Visualizer to Control the hardware

Is it possible to use the Planning Components Visualizer to directly control the arm?
Or is there something else that exists with similar functionality?
I want to be able to move around the physical arm rather than just the visualization of one.

A:

The arm navigation warehouse viewer does exactly this and a lot more.  The tutorial on it is a little out of date, but still should largely work: http://www.ros.org/wiki/arm_navigation/Tutorials/Warehouse%20Viewer .
Make sure to update your debs as we just released the arm_navigation_experimental stack with some important bug fixes.
Look particularly at Section 4.2.3 . This script now creates a planning_scene_warehouse_viewer_<your_robot_name>.launch file in your auto-generated arm navigation application directory which you can run directly.  Running alongside a running system should just involve filling out topics for your controllers and selecting the "Use Robot Data" flag.
We'll be updating the tutorial soon.
