Q:

ROS installation and usage of nmea_navsat_driver for GPS receiver?

Hello, I'm currently trying to set up a GPS receiver and base station my boss purchased to work in ROS. It is a trimble Ag GPS 542 GNSS receiver (http://ssmgps.com/pdf/AGPB_AgGPS542_BaseAndReceiver_ROW_16502.pdf). It looks like the deivce can work in NMEA-0183 sentences, and thus that it should be compatible with the nmea_navsat_driver ROS package, found here: http://wiki.ros.org/nmea_navsat_driver, but I am encountering some installation issues.
First off, the package is in python, which I've never worked with in ros before (just C++ before now).  Is it a problem to have one node in a project with several different nodes be written in python, while the others are in C++? And if not, what's the general installation procedure for python packages?  I git cloned the source into my catkin_ws, and then ran the lines
python setup.py build
python setup.py install

without issue.  However, when I now to try to test out the package with
rosrun nmea_navsat_driver nmea_serial_driver _port:=/dev/ttyUSB0 _baud:=38400

I get the error
[rospack] Error: stack/package nmea_navsat_driver not found

no matter where I am in the file tree.  This makes me think I have goofed up the installation somehow.
Anyone have any advice?

Inside the driver go to this folder :
roscd nmea_navsat_driver/scripts/

and then make all the files executable by
chmod +x *

A:

Turns out I needed to extract the package into catkin_ws/src rather than just catkin_ws, because the latter is not in my ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.
Although upon doing this I have now encountered new errors, which I made another question for here:
