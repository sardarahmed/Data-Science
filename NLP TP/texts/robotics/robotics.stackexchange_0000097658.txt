Q:

Where can I find the list of verbs for catkin?

The official list of verbs for catkin as obtained from catkin -h is
  [build | clean | config | create | env | init | list | locate | profile]

I stumbled upon a few additional verbs:

run-tests : Builds and runs the tests
test: Runs and prints the test results (I think)

I'm guessing these aren't the full list of catkin verbs available.  Where can I find all available verbs?

A:

The "additional verbs" you mention are actually not verbs. They are aliases.
From the catkin_tools documentation (here):

The catkin command allows you to define your own verb “aliases” which expand to more complex expressions including built-in verbs, command-line options, and other verb aliases. These are processed before any other command-line processing takes place, and can be useful for making certain use patterns more convenient.

On my system, running catkin --list-aliases returns:
b: build
bt: b --this
install: config --install
ls: list
p: create pkg
run_tests: build --verbose --catkin-make-args run_tests --
test: build --verbose --make-args test --

Note the last two lines, which are the aliases you mention.
