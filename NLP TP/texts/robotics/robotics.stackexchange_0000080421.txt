Q:

rtabmap frontier exploration

Hello community,
has somebody tried to combine RTABMAP and frontier_exploration ?
How can I solve the problem of discovering an unknown area to build a map first ?
Idea:

discover the area with frontier_exploration and build a map.
navigation in a known environment with discovered map.

Does this make sense ???
Thanks for any hints or feedback.
Cheers
Christian
ps: is google cartographer a complete solution ?

Whether or not Cartographer is a complete solution depends on what problem you are trying to solve.

I'd like to solve the problem: lawnmower at unknown environment.
Starting always at the defined location of the base station and return after work :-)

For the mapping part of that problem, Cartographer will do the job. It's a very good mapping tool. Exploration will need to be handled separately.

A:

frontier_exploration claims to work with or without the /map topic available. RTABMAP can publish a 2D map that could be used by frontier_exploration (the Turtlebot demo does this). Have a look at the frontier_exploration docs, section 2.2, and the Turtlebot demo for RTABMAP.
