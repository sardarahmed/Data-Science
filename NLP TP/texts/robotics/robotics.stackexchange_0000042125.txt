Q:

How to benchmark OMPL-planner solutions?

Hi All,
How to benchmark OMPL-planner solutions if we use the ompl_ros_interface?
I wish there is a standard way to do so as if we use the standalone OMPL (see this tutorial).
What do you think?
How do you usually accommodate such use case?
Thank you.

A:

Sorry for the very late response -- the plannerarena.org website is not fully functional yet (I still need help to work on it!)
However, a benchmarking infrastructure similar to that of OMPL is available for ROS now, as part of MoveIt!, which will be released shortly, once ROS Groovy comes out.
