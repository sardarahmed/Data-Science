Q:

ROS Webcam Stream Really Slow

I am trying to stream the images from my camera to a VM via ROS. Here is my setup:

Raspberry Pi 3B+ with Picamera v2. It is running ROS Noetic with cv_camera_node
An Ubuntu 20.04.1 VM with ROS Noetic. I am reviewing the live stream using rosrun rqt_image_view rqt_image_view

When I tried this, the stream is really laggy and slow. I am barely getting 10 fps. I was able to do camera calibration with it but mapping with it will be really challenging. Is there any way to speed it up. Can I decrease the quality of the camera capture? Any help is truly appreciated.
Here is my launch file:
<launch>
  <node name="usb_cam" pkg="usb_cam" type="usb_cam_node" output="screen" >
    <param name="video_device" value="/dev/video0" />
    <param name="image_width" value="640" />
    <param name="image_height" value="480" />
    <param name="pixel_format" value="uyvy" />
    <param name="camera_frame_id" value="camera" />
    <param name="io_method" value="mmap"/>
    <param name="framerate" value="30" />
    <param name="autofocus" value="true" />
    <param name="camera_name" value="camera" />
    
  </node>
  <node name="image_view" pkg="image_view" type="image_view" respawn="false" output="screen">
    <remap from="image" to="/camera/image_raw"/>
    <param name="autosize" value="true" />
  </node>
</launch>
```

A:

The problem is that you are using VMWare. For some reason, when I used a physical machine with ROS and Ubuntu, it worked! Maybe there is a fix in VMWare. If anybody knows the solution, they are free to explain.
