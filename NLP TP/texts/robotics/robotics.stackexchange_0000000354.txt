Q:

Is subsumption architecture still an active area of research?

I am interested in learning more about subsumption architecture. I have read a number of books that talk about the idea but none of them go into great detail. I have also read a fair number of Dr. Brooks papers on the topic however he hasn't published much on the topic in recent years.
Is this still an active area of research? Are there are any must read papers on the topic?

A:

As you probably guessed from the lack of answers, subsumption architecture is not an active area of research any more. Most papers on this have been published in the late 80's / early 90's.
This doesn't mean that subsumption architecture is dead; it has been very influential in robotics, and it's still used in education for example, but it is just not a hot topic in research any more.
