Q:

Does a static_map costmap continually update from map_server?

Hello,
I have a basic conceptual question regarding Costmap2D. When using a global costmap with the static_map parameter true, I know that it will initialize the map with whatever is stored in map_server.
My question is, does this only happen once, when initializing the costmap, or will the costmap be periodically updated when the map in map_server changes?
Thanks in advance!

A:

Yes, it continually updates, although I've experienced problems in some circumstances (not sure exactly which, it was a while ago).
