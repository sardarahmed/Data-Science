Q:

RosJava and Eclipse

Hello guys!
I'm trying to run a java example interacting with ROS and from Eclipse. I followed this steps (http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosjava/TutorialsRun%20a%20ROS%20Android%20example%20project), and particularly when I type 'rosmake android_tutorial_camera' the output worked, but no .project and .classpath file is created, and hence I can not import the android_tutorial_camera project into Eclipse. Has somebody any idea of this?
Thanks in advance!

rosjava does not support rosmake. The tutorial you're referencing is horribly out of date and I've deleted it. See http://ros.org/wiki/android_core

A:

But still can't put into operation for higher version android 'android_honeycomd_mr2' ...

Really?
Now I can use both 'android_gingerbread_mr1' and 'android_honeycomb_mr2' libraries on eclipse.

Sry ,  now is working because both use same jar files , so when I choose only one as library and masterchooser.jar add to build path every think is now okey ;-)
