Q:

Is there a topic that is published to when a robot gets stuck?

I'm running ROS Kinetic on a Turtlebot Burger 3. It's using the basic turtlebot packages which can be found on ROBOTIS.
Basically, when my turtlebot gets stuck during navigation, I want it to perform some other task (not necessarily related to navigation). I can perform this task without a problem, but I want it to be triggered each time the robot finds itself as stuck. I figured the best way of doing that would be to see if there was anything regarding a robot "stuck" state that gets published somewhere.
Does such a topic exist within the basic Turtlebot3 Navigation package? Or, is there a way to access that information within ROS?
Thanks for your assistance.

How about writing an actionlib client for move_base and wait for the state ABORTED?

A:

I don't think the move_base node has a topic that is published by default when it is stuck, but it does execute recovery behaviors when it is stuck: http://wiki.ros.org/move_base . You could probably write a recovery behavior that either publishes to a topic, or just does the thing you're trying to do when your robot gets stuck.
