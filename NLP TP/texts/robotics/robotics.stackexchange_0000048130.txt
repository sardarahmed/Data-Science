Q:

sbpl installation problem

Hi
I'm trying to install the sbpl package on Ubuntu 12.04.
I installed ros-groovy-sbpl with apt-get but when I run :
$ rosmake sbpl_lattice_planner

I get the following output :
[ rosmake ] rosmake starting...                                                            
[ rosmake ] Packages requested are: ['sbpl_lattice_planner']                               
[ rosmake ] Logging to directory /home/<me>/.ros/rosmake/rosmake_output-20130208-110917
[ rosmake ] Expanded args ['sbpl_lattice_planner'] to:
[]                                  
[ rosmake ] WARNING: The following args could not be parsed as stacks or packages:   ['sbpl_lattice_planner']
[ rosmake ] ERROR: No arguments could be parsed into valid package or stack names.

I tried rosdep update and resourcing setup.bash already.
Thanks for any help.

A:

sbpl_lattice_planner is part of the navigation_experimental stack:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/sbpl_lattice_planner
You need to download that one into a rosbuild workspace to rosmake it.
ros-groovy-sbpl only contains the core c/c++ code.
If you followed instructions that seem to be missing information, please point us to the URL (mask it a bit so that you can post it).
