Q:

Problem pertaining to DepthGenerator

Hi,
I was trying to run the Kinect sensor for the first time but having an error as follows after invoking a command "roslaunch openni_camera openni_kinect.launch":
"[ERROR] [1297966723.977913245]: [OpenNIDriver] Failed to create DepthGenerator: Can't create any node of the requested type!
Please see http://www.ros.org/wiki/ni/Troubleshooting for more info.
[openni_camera-1] process has died [pid 3429, exit code -11].
log files: /home/shah/.ros/log/1f8c4fae-3ac1-11e0-881b-d7b53128cee2/openni_camera-1*.log"
I am aware that there is a post regarding this one and its corresponding solution as in "https://code.ros.org/gf/project/ros/mailman/?_forum_action=ForumMessageBrowse&thread_id=49868&action=ListThreads&mailman_id=39", however after following the steps I'm still trapped there.
Could somebody guide me on this problem..BTW i'm running Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and on 64-bit machine.
Thanks in advance.

Could you add the exact error about the DepthGenerator to the question?

A:

One possible problem is that you do not have the 12V power plugged in.  The device will give this error if the 12V power source is not enabled.

Definitely, the power source is not connected :-( Thanks a lot What is probable problem with this warning when i run rviz: "[ WARN] [1297970327.355692647]: Message from [/openni_camera] has a non-fully-qualified frame_id [openni_rgb_optical_frame]. Resolved locally to [/openni_rgb_optical_frame].  This is will likely not work in multi-robot systems.  This message will only print once." How to resolve it locally? I didn't get it..
