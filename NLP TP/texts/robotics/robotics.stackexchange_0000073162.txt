Q:

how is a rosconsole message making it to /rosout?

I've been reading the rosconsole code and I can't find any publisher to /rosout. rosconsole dependencies are only rostime, cpp_common, rostime and console_bridge. Can someone explain exactly how those work?
I see that rosconsole is a wrapper around log4cxx. It handles the initialization, provides vargs interface, formatting and the logging macros.
I am confused about what console bridge is supposed to do.
There is also the rosout package that dumps the messages on the /rosout topic to a file (which seems redundant to what rosconsole is doing...)
But I can't find a publisher from rosconsole to /rosout

A:

Turns out that ros::init in roscpp sets the global logger object to be a ROSOutAppender which publishes to /rosout.
