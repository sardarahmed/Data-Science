This is kind of a big question, and this forum is specifically for ROS support. Can you describe how you want to use Python and C++ with ROS?

I think this kind of questions would be better in stackoverflow, but if you are flexible about the solution, publishing/subscribing is the way to go.

A:

Usually, if you have two nodes written in different languages, you can have one publish its output to a topic, and have the other node subscribe to that topic.
Trying to call Python functions from C++ is possible, but it's not usually a good idea due to the complexity and the overhead involved.
If you want a more specific answer, you'll need to provide more specifics (and preferably examples) of what you want to do.
