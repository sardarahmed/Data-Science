Q:

gazebo_worlds crashes on startup

I followed the gazebo_worlds installation and run instructions and the screen popped up for one second and went away. I've included the original error & diagnostic info below. I also included glxinfo.
I have an Intel video card. Not sure if it's compatible. Glxinfo says it's Opengl DRI. Glxgears runs fine.

A:

You can try turning on Debug information for Gazebo by editing the CMakeLists.txt and Makefile.tarball and check whether your crash corresponds with https://code.ros.org/trac/ros-pkg/ticket/5170. This should be solved in the latest electric version at  https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/simulator_gazebo/tags/electric
