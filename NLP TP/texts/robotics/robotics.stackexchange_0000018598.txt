Q:

Is interacting with registers the only way software and hardware interact?

I'm aware that memory mapped addresses that point to registers are sometimes used to control hardware devices. Is that the only way they're controlled? I started asking about how software talks to hardware and most people told me about using registers and memory addresses to talk to devices. Is that the only way software and hardware interact? Thanks!

Shortly, that is the correct answer - if you are interested how software will (ultimately) talk to hardware. How hardware can have an impact on software, things get a lot more complicated.
If you want to understand deeply how things happen, you should study how micro-controllers are implemented. Studying the famous 8051 is a very good start, and there are countless books and articles about it. You will have the chance to understand timers, interrupts, ports, buses...
