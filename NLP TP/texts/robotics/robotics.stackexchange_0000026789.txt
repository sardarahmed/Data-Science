Q:

How to set the visual and collision at ones using sdf to use the same geometry and pose

Hi
I like to define the visual and collision apparans of a link at ones. 
Is there a way to define variables? 
Or is there a way to say visual == collision? 
The example shows a link which has the same collision and visual dimensions is it possible to write that shorter:
<link name='Wall_01'>
  <pose>0 0 0 0 0 0</pose>
  <collision name='collision_01'>
    <pose>0 0.05 1 0 -0 0</pose>
    <geometry>
      <box>
        <size>5 0.1 2</size>
      </box>
    </geometry>
  </collision>
  <visual name='visual_01'>
    <pose>0 0.05 1 0 -0 0</pose>
    <geometry>
      <box>
        <size>5 0.1 2</size>
      </box>
    </geometry>
    <material>
      <script>
        <uri>file://media/materials/scripts/gazebo.material</uri>
        <name>Gazebo/Grey</name>
      </script>
    </material>
  </visual>
</link>

Thanks

A:

There have been discussions about this, but no pull requests.
One proposal is to use xacro (gazebo issue #210), which could be used to insert blocks of repeated sdf elements. This would require xacro to be packaged independently from ROS to avoid a gazebo dependency on ROS.
There were some alternative syntax proposals in gazebo issue #427. One of the concerns with expanding the syntax is overwhelming complexity.
Feel free to chime in with either or both of these feature requests.

Using xacro was my final solution
