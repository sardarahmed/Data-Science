Q:

Update to tutorial, ROS/Tutorials/Recording and playing back data

At the Recording and playing back data tutorial (I wasn't allowed to post the link because of low karma) in the section "Recording a subset of the data" the old form of command velocity is used and I just thought there should be a note reminding new users to change to the new form of command velocity. I am specifically referring to the following command line: $rosbag record -O subset /turtle1/command_velocity /turtle1/pose
It should be noted that you can use cmd_vel instead of command_velocity.
