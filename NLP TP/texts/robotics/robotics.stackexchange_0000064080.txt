Q:

Errors at catkin_make for laser_scan_matcher

Good day everyone,
I'm trying to work with Polar Scan Matcher and Canonical Scan Matcher (laser_scan_matcher) from Scan_tools. So far, I've been able to run the demo.launch for PSM, but not (yet) to use my own LRF. Nevertheless, when trying to use the CSM demo, I receive an error as follows:
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [laser_scan_matcher/laser_scan_matcher_node]: can't locate node [laser_scan_matcher_node] in package [laser_scan_matcher]
Reading, I found out that the problem is because there is no executable ready. I tried once more to do catkin_make (I did it once when installing scan_tools), and pay attention to the output. I found this:
-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
See also "/home/antonio/PSM/build/scan_tools/laser_scan_matcher/csm/src/CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log".
make[2]: *** [scan_tools/laser_scan_matcher/csm/stamp/csm_src-configure] Error 1
make[1]: *** [scan_tools/laser_scan_matcher/CMakeFiles/csm_src.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2
Invoking "make" failed
I've also tried rosrun laser_scan_matcher and tried to see the options with tab but none appears.
My settings are ROS Indigo in Ubuntu 14.04.
This is what I've got so far with my little knowledge. I hope someone can help me fix this.
Thank you!

Is there a package.xml or a manifest.xml in the package?

I just got the demo working on my machine with:

$ cd [indigo catkin workspace directory]
 - $ git clone  https://github.com/ccny-ros-pkg/scan_tools.git
$ sudo apt-get install libgsl0-dev
 - $  catkin_make
$ roslaunch laser_scan_matcher demo.launch

Is this what you did?

@dornhege Yes, the package has its proper xml files thank you!
@Angus Thank you so much, you should have written your post as answer! I missed to install the compiling library. I didn't know about it though. Now it's running and time for some tests using the real thing. Thank you!

Awesome! I'll just reply with an answer so we can mark as solved.

A:

As per the comments, the demo seems to work on Inidigo with these commands:
$ cd [indigo catkin workspace directory]
$ git clone https://github.com/ccny-ros-pkg/scan_tools
$ sudo apt-get install libgsl0-dev
$ catkin_make
$ roslaunch laser_scan_matcher demo.launch

The libgs10-dev is the library to compile correctly the package with catkin_make. That was the main problem.
Thank you Angus!

Indeed! Installing the libgsl0-dev solved it for me too using the Hydro branch. Thank you =).
