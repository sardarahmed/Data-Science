Q:

Automating Workstation Setup

I've been hacking at my kernel and breaking my system rather frequently lately setting up a USB3 ROS driver for a new 3D sensor. Aside from perhaps better recovery management, or using VMs, I'd like to find an programmatic way of bootstrapping a ROS environment for my workstation after every time I hose it. I've seen some people use chef cookbooks as means to automate a personalized suppresses, so I think that might be one direction to take.
Does anyone have working examples for quickly setting a Linux system?

Is your question relevant to ROS, Robot Operating System?
Comment by ruffsl on 2015-08-23:
Pardon my first edit being too general, but my environment setup is ROS specific.

A:

I've played with using puppet to setup a basic ROS environment.
https://forge.puppetlabs.com/tfoote/ros
https://github.com/tfoote/puppet-ros
It was test a few months ago. It may need updating for more recent changes to some of the puppet module dependencies.
It's very basic at the moment and not fully parameterized, but is a good starting point for people.
