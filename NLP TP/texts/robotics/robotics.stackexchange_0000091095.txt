Q:

Map_server could not open /home/test_map.yaml

I'm using a package called Chefbot, which has packages to run a differential drive autonomously using SLAM.
However when I run the command: roslaunch chefbot_bringup amcl_demo.launch map_file:=/home/test_map.yaml
I get an error: [ERROR] [1553483186.539747153]: Map_server could not open /home/test_map.yaml.
I read previous questions about the same, and for most of them the problem was solved by adding a '/' before the home directory. But I still get this error.
I've checked that the map test_map exists.
Please help.

Hi,
Can you please edit the question with the output of
ls -l /home/test_map.yaml

Comment by janindu on 2019-03-25:
Because ideally the path should be something like
/home/user_name/test_map.yaml

Thanks a lot! That worked.

No prob.
You should add how you solved the problem as an answer, accept it and close this question.

A:

The path should be /home/username/map.yaml and not /home/map.yaml.
Also make sure there's a '/' before home.
This should do the job.
