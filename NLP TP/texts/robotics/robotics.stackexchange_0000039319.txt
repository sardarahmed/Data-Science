Q:

rviz integration with different frames and sensors

Heyy People,
I am a recent user of ROS and rviz. I am currently using Husky A200 for my project activities and I found rviz to be particularly interesting.
I displayed my Hokoyu LIDAR output on rviz. However, there was still an error shown on the .Global parameters section saying the frame /laser does not exist. This happens further, to any new frame that I wish to see but that does not exist in the drop-down list.
How should I modify rviz so that these frames are visible in the dropdown list or work with no errors? Further, I am wanting to solve this issue in the context of localization and mapping so that I see in real-time the map development using rviz.
My tf frames only consists of the Camera frames from my Kinect as follows:
/camera_link
/camera_rgb_frame ,
/camera_depth_frame
/camera_rgb_optical_frame ,
/camera_depth_optical_frame
Any help in this regards would be appreciated.
Thanks.

What does your tf tree look like? (what frames exist?) If you're not sure, you can use "rosrun tf view_frames" to display the full tf tree.

A:

For each sensor measurement you have, there must be a frame associated to it. And the frames should be connected on a tree. I am guessing that you are missing a link in that tree, to reference your laser frame to the /map or /world frame, for example.
You can create static frame transformations in a launch file, if that is the case:
ROS static transform
