Q:

Autoware.Auto ROS2Bag compatibility with Point Cloud Map Builder

We have a Livox Lidar which we plan to use to map out a route which can be used with the Autoware.Auto track. We noticed that using this tool:  https://tools.tier4.jp/feature/point_cloud_map_builder/ we can convert a .bag to .pcd . Is it compatible with ROS2 bags? Or should we just record it with a ROS1 bag

A:

It is not but it also should not be necessary. See my answer to https://answers.ros.org/question/378637/autowareauto-best-way-to-create-a-pcd-map/ for a tool in Autoware.Auto that will allow you to do this.
