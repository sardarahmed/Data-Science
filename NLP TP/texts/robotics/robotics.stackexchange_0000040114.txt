Q:

Visualizing Kinect Output without a TurtleBot

Hi,
The "Visualizing TurtleBot Kinect Data" tutorial http://www.ros.org/wiki/turtlebot/Tutorials/Looking%20at%20Camera%20Data seems very tided to the TurtleBot - is there a way to visualize the Kinect Camera or PointCloud in rviz without the TurtleBot?
Best Regards,

You need some type of URDF so that RViz knows where the Kinect is so it can draw the point clouds. Then you would do what @Ryan says.
Comment by Ryan on 2012-05-03:
"roslaunch openni_launch kinect_frames.launch" takes care of setting up some static transforms to let rviz draw the clouds.

A:

In three separate terminals, run:
roscore
roslaunch openni_launch kinect_frames.launch
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch

Then, launch rviz with:
rosrun rviz rviz

Once that's up, select frames (any frames) from the dropdown menus beside "fixed frame" and "target frame". Then, add a PointCloud2 display and select "/camera/depth/points" as its topic. That should display the 3D cloud. You'll probably also want to tweak the display options to make it easier to see (changing from an "intensity" colour transform to an "axis" colour transform, for instance).
