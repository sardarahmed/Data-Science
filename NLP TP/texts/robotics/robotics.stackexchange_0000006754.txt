Q:

Why I'm getting very long terms in the inertia matrix (or dynamics model) of the robot using matlab script?

I'm working on the dynamics model of a RRRR articulated robot, I'm following Euler-Lagrange approach and developing my code in m-file in matlab; I'm looking for dynamic model of this form: $$
D(q) \ddot{q} + C(q,\dot{q})\dot{q}+ g(q) = \tau
$$
where $D$ and $C$ are $4 \times4$ matrices and $g$ and $\tau$ (torque) are $4\times1$ vectors; by formulating the kinetic and potential energies;;
The problem is that, I'm getting very long equations, and the term in $D$ matrix are very huge and nonlinear, involving sin and cos; I'm talking about a several pages per equation;
After I published the code - 7 pages - and the output I got around 45 pages in total;
I searched around there was some guy he faced the same problem before, but there was no helpful proposal.
Any Suggestions ?? 

A:

You can use the 'simplify' command , e.g : a=simplify(A*B) .This command is calculating some trigonometric functions thus making your expression shorter .

A:

It really doesn't sound very unexpected for your equations to become this long. Something that might help a little, is using assumptions for defining symbolic variables.
x = sym('x','real');
y = sym('y','positive');
z = sym('z','integer');
t = sym('t','rational');
