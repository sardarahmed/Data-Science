I am trying to follow the ROS tutorial and create my own package. I see the following error when I try to invoke catkin_make:

When you're referring to a tutorial or some other source, please include a link to it

A:

The only time I've seen this error, cleaning my workspace fixed it. I'd also recommend using catkin tools (i.e., run catkin build instead of catkin_make).
