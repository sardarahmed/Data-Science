Q:

rxplot window size

Is there a way to set the number of points displayed in an rxplot window? It looks like by default there's about a five-second window displayed, but I would like it to be more like 30 seconds, displayed in real time.
I expected to find documentation of this on http://www.ros.org/wiki/rxplot but it wasn't there.

A:

Using the "--help" option with ROS command line tools gives you help on available options. Using it with rxplot shows you can use the -p (PERIOD) option to set the period displayed in the window.

Good to know. The -p option was not an obvious guess, I think the help could be a bit more explicit. I thought it controlled the refresh rate or something...

Haven't tried it before, but you can provide a legend for the plotted data similar to the functionality in matlab. I guess most of the time the automatic default legend (topic name) is sufficient.

Thanks! Do you have any idea what the options for "legend" are? That one is a little obscure.
