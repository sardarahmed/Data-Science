Q:

Integreation Method In Dr with 3 Sources

I'm searching a navigation method to find my location while dead reckogning (gps signals jammed) with an imu and gsm based navigation results.
In short i have 3 sources:

Gsm Based Navigation ( gives lat lon data at @5hz, around 100m accuracy)
Imu(gyro+accelerometer)
GPS Receiver

There are filters like kalman, complimentary etc. but many use this methods when they have 2 source (gps/imu)in my case i have 3. What is simplest way to integrate gsm based pos and imu data in dr and should i use a filter or not.
Thanks.

A:

You should definitely use a filter. You need to adjust to the noises. If you can design or know the state space models of the agent and the sensors then KF is the easiest to use.
