Is this any help -- http://sysadminfixes.wordpress.com/2013/03/18/ros-on-beaglebuntu/ ??

A:

If at all possible, you'll probably have a much better time installing ubuntu 12.04 and using apt-get to install ROS groovy as described here.
I haven't played with a beaglebone, but these questions may help, and they suggest that hydro on 13.04 is unnecessary.
