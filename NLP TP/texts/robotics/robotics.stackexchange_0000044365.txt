Q:

Android tutorial teleop problems

Hi!
I am having problems with "android_tutorial_teleop". It compiles ok, but the app crashes when touching the virtualJoysticView.
The problem is that "currentVelocityCommand" is null when setting velocities.
I have tried:
currentVelocityCommand =publisher.newMessage();

as the Issue 109 of rosjava says (http://code.google.com/p/rosjava/issues/detail?can=2&start=0&num=100&q=android&colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Priority%20Milestone%20Owner%20Summary&groupby=&sort=&id=109)
but it doesn't work...
Please, could anybody help me??
Thanks!!

A:

finally it works! i tried:
currentVelocityCommand = publisher.newMessage();

after publisher initialization.
It is necessary to have the master running, the publisher needs to be initialized ok, if not, currentVelocityCommand = publisher.newMessage(); won't work.
