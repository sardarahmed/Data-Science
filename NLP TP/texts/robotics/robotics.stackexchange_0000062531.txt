Q:

movegroup eigen error when doing pick

ubuntu 14.04 trusty
ros indigo
as soon as my pick place node reaches pick the movegroup launch terminal gives this error :
[ INFO] [1410435960.615041253]: Planning attempt 1 of at most 1

i have gcc 4.8 installed and have been to the mentioned website, but not being too confident about what to do, i would like to know if there is a simple fix for this, and if no simple fix is available then what course of action i should take?

A:

This is an instance of a Eigen alignment issue that can occur on systems where data is not properly aligned in memory, which means vectorization won´t work. Read the link  stated in the error message for some further info. You´ll find quite a few other questions regarding this here on ROS Answers , too.
This issue can generally be fixed by modifying source code, but depending on the issue at hand this might not be trivial. Luckily, this error only appears on 32bit (x86) systems, so a relatively easy solution to get rid of it is switching to a 64bit Ubuntu version (not sure about architectures like ARM and others).

would switching to gcc-4.6 and then compiling solve things?

Pretty sure it would not. I´d recommend installing a 64bit system if at all possible, as this takes a relatively short time and is sure to fix the problem.
