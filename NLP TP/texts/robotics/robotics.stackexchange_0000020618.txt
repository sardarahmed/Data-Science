Q:

where can I find a good source to study robotics kinematics and trajectory planning relative to robotic arm manipulator?

I am a student, and I have to study for a Robotics exam which consistes mainly in kinematics for a robotic manipulator and trajectory planning also for a robotic manipulator.
In the part relative to kinematics, I have found many sources to study, but for the part relative to trajectory planning I cannot find a complete explanation that allow me to understand deeply the concept.
where can I find a good source to study robotics kinematics and most of all trajectory planning relative to robotics arm manipulator?
I don't know if this is the right place to ask for this, so if it is not in topic with the Robotics exchange policy please tell me and i will delete the question.
