Q:

Error while building rosjava_core (gradle wrapper)

Hi all,
I am trying to install rosjava_core on fuerte (ubuntu 12.04) using tutorial http://docs.rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/rosjava_core/html/index.html . I have followed the "Installing rosjava_core" sections. Now I am trying "building rosjava_core" and executing first step given "./gradlew install" . It creates a zip file gradle-1.0-milestone-9-bin.zip (which I can see) but then I get error:
Unzipping /home/safdar/.gradle/wrapper/dists/gradle-1.0-milestone9-bin/7ilkmgo2rn79vvfvd51rqf17ks/gradle-1.0-milestone-9-bin.zip to /home/safdar/.gradle/wrapper/dists/gradle-1.0-milestone-9-bin/7ilkmgo2rn79vvfvd51rqf17ks
Exception in thread "main" java.util.zip.ZipException: error in opening zip file
at java.util.zip.ZipFile.open(Native Method)
at java.util.zip.ZipFile.<init>(ZipFile.java:131)
at java.util.zip.ZipFile.<init>(ZipFile.java:148)

at org.gradle.wrapper.WrapperExecutor.execute(WrapperExecutor.java:129)
at org.gradle.wrapper.GradleWrapperMain.main(GradleWrapperMain.java:47)

Any body who already has had such error? or how can I proceed further now?
thanks in advance

thanks.Now it proceeds but I get following error on ./gradlew test: Test org.ros.time.NtpTimeProviderTest FAILED
129 tests completed, 1 failure
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':rosjava:test'.  Do I miss something?

A:

It seems the zip download failed, delete the zip file and try again.

Hi Kruse! thanks,its installed. Now if I execute ../gradlew installApp it builds successfully but I dont see any bin directory because I dont get Talker running if I execute ./build/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub/bin/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub org.ros.rosjava_tutorial_pubsub.Talker  Any clue to run Talker?
