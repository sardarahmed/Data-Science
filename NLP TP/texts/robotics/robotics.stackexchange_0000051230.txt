Q:

RosAria_pose orientation

I am using /RosAria/pose to get position (x,y) and orientation (w).
Does anyone knows how to convert the w to grades?

A:

You mean degrees probably
You need a quaternion to degrees conversion tool. Or use for instance the bullet class.
edit:
  tf::Pose pose;
  tf::poseMsgToTF(odom->pose.pose, pose);
  double yaw_angle = tf::getYaw(pose.getRotation());

from here
