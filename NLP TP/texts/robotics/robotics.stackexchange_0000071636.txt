Q:

Map_server fails to publish transform

Map server node fails to publish transform when i execute the below launch file. All other nodes are functioning properly.
    <launch>
      <!-- Load the TortoiseBot URDF model into the parameter server -->
      <param name="robot_description" textfile="$(find jmbot1_description)/urdf/jmbot1.1.urdf" />
      <!-- Start Gazebo with a world containing a large building-->
      <include file="$(find gazebo_ros)/launch/willowgarage_world.launch"/>
      <!-- include file="$(find gazebo_ros)/launch/empty_world.launch"/ -->
      <!-- Spawn a TortoiseBot in Gazebo, taking the description from the
           parameter server -->
      <node name="spawn_urdf" pkg="gazebo_ros" type="spawn_model" 
        args="-param robot_description -urdf -model jmbot1.1 -x 8 -y -8" />
     
    <!-- Convert /joint_states messages published by Gazebo to /tf messages,
           e.g., for rviz-->
      <node name="robot_state_publisher" pkg="robot_state_publisher"
            type="robot_state_publisher"/>
      <node name="map_server" pkg="map_server" type="map_server"
            args="$(find mapping)/src/maps/willow.yaml"  />
     <include file="$(find amcl)/examples/amcl_diff.launch"/>

  <node pkg="move_base" type="move_base" respawn="false" name="move_base" output="screen">
    <rosparam file="$(find jmbot1_description)/src/costmap_common_params.yaml" command="load" ns="global_costmap" />
    <rosparam file="$(find jmbot1_description)/src/costmap_common_params.yaml" command="load" ns="local_costmap" />
    <rosparam file="$(find jmbot1_description)/src/local_costmap_params.yaml" command="load" />
    <rosparam file="$(find jmbot1_description)/src/global_costmap_params.yaml" command="load" />
    <rosparam file="$(find jmbot1_description)/src/base_local_planner_params.yaml" command="load" />
  </node>

    </launch>

Below is my rviz results where the map's corner is oriented with the origin of rviz grid. I have verified the rqt_graph after launching the file, there is no transform published.

I have added the amcl node to the launch file as instructed in a book and i got into a new error as below. Please find the edited launch file above.

[ERROR] [1453990912.591443071,
49.843000000]: Couldn't transform from hokuyo_link to base_link, even though
the message notifier is in use

A:

The map server does not publish the transform from map to the robot's links.
The map server only provides the map in the respective frame to be used by e.g. the localization.
You need a localization node (e.g. amcl) for this.
