Q:

Is there a public ROS matster available?

Dear All,
Since in our lab, we can not communicate with socket between two computer, is there a public ROS master available? Thus we can use two or more computer in my lab to connect this public ros MASTER,then to communicate with ros message or service.
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://pulbic:11311
Best regards.

A:

As far as I know: No.
It wouldn't also be quite usable, because when everyone uses the same public master, you will have a lot of conflicts.
In addition it will also not solve your problem. The ROS master doesn't route anything. It just provides a central lookup, so nodes/topics/services can find themselves. The connections are made directly between nodes and do not go over the master.
