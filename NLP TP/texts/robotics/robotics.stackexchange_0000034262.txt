Q:

OpenRAVE installation fails

Hello,
I would like to try OpenRAVE together with ROS (Electric), but there is problem with installation.
When "rosdep install openrave_robot_control orrosplanning
openrave_sensors" is executed, i get this error:

Execution failed with OSError: [Errno 8] Exec format error
rosdep install ERROR:
failed to install collada-dom

But collada-dom (libcollada15dom-dev) is installed in my system
(Ubuntu 11.04, x86_64).
When I try rosmake (instead of rosdep install...) it compiles for long
time with some warnings. But after successful compilation, I can't run
any demo... For example "roslaunch openrave_robot_control
schunkarm_sim.launch" gives me this error:

ERROR: cannot launch node of type
[openrave_robot_control/simulationserver]: Cannot locate node of type
[simulationserver] in package [openrave_robot_control]

Is there any solution? Thanks a lot.
