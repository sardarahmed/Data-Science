Q:

URDF surface tags are not propagated to gazebo

I am struggling to set friction to my model in gazebo. Issue is it is frictionless. It is walking in place and cannot move. I set my tags according to this document SDFormat but they are not visible in link inspection in Gazebo. Looks like surface tag is not propagated at all.  I got gazebo 11.10.2 . Abd ros2 humble. Below is the screenshot:

I figured it out. You need to insert all tags inside < gazebo reference="link_name"> tag under < robot> tag and not under < link> tag. Here is document GazeboURDF. Like this works for me:
<robot xmlns:xacro="http://www.ros.org/wiki/xacro">
<gazebo reference="link_name">
    <minDepth>0.01</minDepth>
    <material>Gazebo/Orange</material>
    <mu2>0.23</mu2>
</gazebo>
<link name="link_name">
(other tags ...)
</link>
</robot>
