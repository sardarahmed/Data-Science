Creating GUI for ROS

Dear all, i am a pg student working on robotics, i have configured ROS Indigo in my Ubuntu 14.04LTS, also interfaced and drive multiple servo motors using Arduino using ROS package. But till now, to drive servo motor, i was giving command from the terminal window, which i want to drive from the GUI. For this i have created a GUI window in QT, but how to connect this GUI to my ROS package as well as Arduino IDE, i have wasted my lot time to find this. Can anybody help me to find out the solution for this.

A:

Probably it would be good to make a rqt plugin.
These can be done in Python and CPP.
I guess there is no tutorial but just check for the given plugins:
http://wiki.ros.org/rqt_common_plugins?distro=jade
A good example for a C++ plugin is rqt_imageview, because the most of them are done in python.

Is it possible to write a program in QT and then combining it with ROS and ARDUINO?

It is, take a look at the CMakeLists.txt of the rqt_imageviewer plugin for how to include the QT libraries, you do not have to write a plugin.
