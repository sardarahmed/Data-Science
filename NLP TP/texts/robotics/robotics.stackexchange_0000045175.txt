Q:

Dynamixel motors not found

I'm going through this tutorial about connecting/ running Dynamixel servos through ROS (these are AX-12 servos).
In step 3.Step 2: Create a launch file for the manager node, I created a .launch file as instructed by copy-pasting the supplied code in to a new file named controller_manager.launch.
After executing the command "roslaunch dynamixel_tutorials controller_manager.launch", I receive an error. The error states
[FATAL] [WAllTime: 13151009139.949289] pan_tilt_port: No motors found
The error log file referenced states the same information, the motors can not be "pinged" and therefore the process is killed.
Running the command
ls -la /dev/ttyUSB*
Gives me crw-rw-r-- 1 turtlebot 188, 0 Oct 23 11:18 /dev/ttyUSB0
lsusb gives me
Bus 002 Device 003: ID 0403:6001 Future Technology Devices...
So it looks like the computer "sees" the USB connector. I've even tried a different motor and different power supply...
Any ideas?

I have updated the tutorial to work with Electric and Fuerte version of the dynamixel_motor stack.
