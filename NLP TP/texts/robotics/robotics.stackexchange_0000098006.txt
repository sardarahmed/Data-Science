Q:

namespace name= other name

I was reading the code of a file in the tutorial of MoveIt Ros melodic and I saw this
namespace rvt = rviz_visual_tools;
and it doesn't make sense for me, someone want to explain to me that
note: code line 82
https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_tutorials/blob/melodic-devel/doc/move_group_interface/src/move_group_interface_tutorial.cpp

that line code is in line 82

A:

It's just so you can type rvt::whatever() instead of rviz_visual_tools::whatever() without losing some connection to the fact that whatever() comes from rviz_visual_tools(and avoiding name collisions which I'd guess is likely here with the MoveIt visual tools, but I'd have to dig in the code to be sure.)
You know here for example that WHITE and LARGE come from rviz_visual_tools which otherwise would be hard to know at a glance at that line.
With the namespace alias, it's easy to see.
