Q:

Monitor and control a ROS robot via a server

Hello.
What do you think is the best solution to transparently forward some of the ROS topics of a robot to the special server computer through the Internet? So several operators could (via web interface) view the state of robots and send commands to them (via topics or services).
It can be developed using HTTPS interface, or WebSockets, or raw TCP/UDP; different storages for messages can be used (SQL, MongoDB, Redis). Or maybe some ready solution for such tasks?
Please, make some advises.

A:

rosbridge_suite is a ROS WebSocket server that's very useful for creating web interfaces to ROS systems. On the client side, roslib_js provides interfaces to handle the data from rosbridge WebSockets.

rosnodejs might be more suitable than rosbridge_suite, but that depends on scale of the application and integration requirements.

Thanks for the answer!
rosbridge is a great thing, but it requires the robot to be the WebSocket server, so the user should be in the same local network with the robot, and connect to the robot directly.

What I need, is that robot is connected to some server in the Internet, and any other user (with permissions) can go to this server with a regular browser, and monitor and control it.

gvdhoorn, I don't understand, how rosnodejs can help in this?
