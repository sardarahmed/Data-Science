Q:

How to create a car from scratch in ROS

Hello! I want to create a specific car in ROS - Ford Mondeo and i can't find a something like tutorial or examples of creating cars from scratch (these cars should look well, I mean look like a car, not like rectangle with wheels) and simulate them in rviz. Do you have some ideas which programs or packages I should use.
Thanks a lot

Are you sure rviz is the best tool for your job? It seems to be designed as a diagnostic and monitoring tool, not for photorealism. Might you be better off with a gaming engine like Unity, or some 3-D rendering tool? Why does it have to "look like a car"?

We are working in ROS and we want to present our vehicle to our partners

A:

If you want to make a car robot in ROS that looks pretty like a real car, you need a CAD model of a car that looks like a real car, preferably one with the wheels as separate models. You will then need to convert that model into a format that Gazebo and rViz can understand, such as the STL format or COLLADA .dae files. You can then use that to create a URDF or SRDF by using the CAD models as the visual representation of the links for the robot model. See the URDF tutorials for how to build a URDF file and make it usable in simulation and visualisation. In those tutorials, replace the cylinders and boxes with <mesh> tags that point to your CAD files.
