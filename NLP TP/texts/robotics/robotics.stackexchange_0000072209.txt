Do you know where the instructions for installing the pr2 on indigo are?

It looks like the documentation hasn't been updated in a while, and the pr2-desktop package hasn't been released for Indigo yet. Have you tried installing the pr2-simulator package from debs: sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-pr2-simulator ?
