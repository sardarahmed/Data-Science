Q:

How to declare common parameter

What is recommended ways to set common parameters in ROS?
In some of my nodes, I often want to use the same values for same purpose (e.g. subscribe/publish queue). Right now I'm setting parameters in .launch file. But since parameter comes with node name as prefix (e.g. /nodeNameA/paramNameB), parameters can't be generic enough (is it just because I don't know there's a way to nicely do this?).
Running a node that sets common parameters might be an option but right now I'm not planning to make such a thing, and more interested in better/ideal solutions if any. Thanks.

A:

You can easily declare parameters outside a  tag in a launch file:
<launch>
   <param name="common_param" value="123"/>
   <node name="node1" ... />
   <node name="node2" ... />
</launch>

Since these parameters are not specific to any one node, you may want to resolve them using searchParam() in your code.
