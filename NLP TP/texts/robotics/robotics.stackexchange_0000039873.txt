Q:

spawning a simple_box in gazebo, box oscillates

With electric running on Ubuntu 11.10, if I run the following two commands
roslaunch gazebo_worlds empty_world.launch
roslaunch gazebo_worlds simple_box.launch

I would expect to get a 5cm by 5m by 10cm box spawned at position (1,0,2). Effectively, that is what happens. But then the box starts oscillating around (0,0,2), moving from (1,0,2) to (-1,0,2). I don't understand why this is happening. Is there something I'm missing here?
Thanks,
-J

Yes ! it oscillates as a pendulum !

A:

looking my simple_box.urdf I've got:
  <joint name="my_box_joint" type="continuous" >
    <!-- axis is in the parent link frame coordintates -->
    <axis xyz="0 1 0" />
    <parent link="world" />
    <child link="my_box" />
    <!-- initial pose of my_box joint/link in the parent frame coordiantes -->
    <origin xyz="0 0 2" rpy="0 0 0" />
  </joint>

So looking at the rest of the urdf: the joint is at (0 0 2) and the mass is centered at (1 0 2).   So the mass should pivot around (0 0 2) since gravity is acting on the box.
