Q:

Moveit: Interactive markers missing

I am fairly new to the using Moveit (as well as ROS overall), and did the tutorial on using the setup assistant for moveit. moveit.ros.org/wiki/PR2/Setup_Assistant/Quick_Start.
After successfully creating the package at the end, I then went on to run the demo.launch file that was created after creating moveit package. RVIZ came up successfully with the PR2 robot model showing. However I am unable to use the interactive markers to control the planning groups because there are no interactive markers showing. Can anyone help me understand why the interactive markers are missing?

I think you have the same problem. Check your end effector.

In the tutorial that I pointed out in my original question, step 8 asks to label the end effectors. I took this as defining the end effectors. So my problem still exists after the fact that I have defined my end effectors. Thank you for your suggestion.

I added a comment in the link above; in my case the parent group for the eef definition was necessary.
