A:

I, personnally, found those ressources helpful (but I already had some programming skills) :

http://www.cs.mun.ca/~av/courses/ar/?page_id=36 (no correction but it is a nice exercise to do to better understand how things work)

https://www.cs.hmc.edu/twiki/bin/view/Robotics/SummerStartPage2012 (exercises on Turtlebot 1, still no correction)

Hope that helps.
