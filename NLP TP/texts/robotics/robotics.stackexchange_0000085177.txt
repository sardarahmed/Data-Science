Hi
I'm just starting out with ROS.

When I type his command :
sudo apt-get install ros-<kinetic>-ros-tutorials

I get this result:
bash: kinetic: No such file or directory

Please what can I do?

A:

Are you literally running
sudo apt-get install ros-<kinetic>-ros-tutorials

? If you are, please remove the < and the >, i.e.,
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-ros-tutorials

the entire <distro> part (including angle brackets) is meant to be replaced by the distribution that you're using.

Can you please create a new question for the error from your comment? It's not related to this issue.
