Q:

log4cxx error on node shutdown in diamondback rc3

I installed diamondback RC3 yesterday on a machine that was upgraded from Ubuntu 9.04 to 10.04 over the weekend. (Maybe upgrading instead of a fresh install was a bad idea?)
log4cxx seems to be having a problem. Every time I ctrl+c a launch file that I ran, I get an error that looks like this:
log4cxx: No appender could be found for logger (ros.sbpl_arm_planner).
log4cxx: Please initialize the log4cxx system properly.

or
log4cxx: No appender could be found for logger (ros.planning_environment).
log4cxx: Please initialize the log4cxx system properly.

Is log4cxx set up incorrectly? Has anyone seen this before?

A:

This is a known problem with Diamondback RC3. There is a ticket on the ROS Trac for this.
