Q:

How to release for multiple ROS versions when version dependent patches are needed?

Hello,
due to the recent change in Bullet[1], I have to patch my stack when releasing for unstable
but not when releasing for Electric. The SCM I use for this stack is Git.
Then problem is that even if create.py maintains different branches for each ROS version (unstable and electric in my case), it always update them using the current state of the master branch.
What I would like to do in this case is comitting myself on unstable to handle [1]. Then I would like create.py to use the current state of the unstable branch to create the release.
Is it possible to do so? Is there something I am missing?
Thanks!

A:

The create.py updates the branch defined in the rosdistro file.  If you change the definition in the rosdistro file for each release it will pull from a different branch for the specified release.
For example in electric.rosdistro define the dev-branch to be electric-devel and the unstable.rosdistro file define the dev-branch to be master, etc.

While releasing from a different branch for each distro is the "standard" ROS solution, that is not what external groups like ours want. We need our development trunk to work with two successive distros. Generally, tick-tock makes that possible, though it often means slower adoption of new features.
