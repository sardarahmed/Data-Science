Q:

moveit_setup_assistant cannot launch node of type in indigo

I would like to start with moveit_setup_assistant
roslaunch moveit_setup_assistant setup_assistant.launch

1, I have roscd to the   moveit_setup_assistant pakage,
but fail to roslaunch .
(at that time ,echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH  ---> /root/catkin_ws/src:/opt/ros/indigo/share:/opt/ros/indigo/stacks
)

2,  if I do:
 source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash

(at that time ,echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH  ---> /opt/ros/indigo/share:/opt/ros/indigo/stacks)

then, roslaunch succeeds!
but if I load the urdf file in my workspace( I follow the ros-by-example-2 in Chapter 11),
The weird part is, the pi_robot I would like to load just shows the two wheels in the setup_assistant window,
it seems that it cannot find my own package
Here is the part of error message
"[rospack] Error: package 'rbx2_description' not found
[librospack]: error while executing command"

NOTE:
1, I have add this
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash

to the bottom of the ~/.bashrc
and I have source ~/.bashrc after this so that when I echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATHï¼Œthe result is what  I mentioned in the statement 1 above.
2, Below is the error message for 1st statement,
root@ShawnVM:~/catkin_ws/src/moveit_setup_assistant# roslaunch moveit_setup_assistant setup_assistant.launch

3, I wonder if there is something wrong due to using VM? Something wrong with OpenGL driver?

I wonder if there is something wrong due to using VM? Something wrong with OpenGL driver?

From the error messages you've posted, this is unrelated to you using a VM. Either the nodes (binaries) are really not there, or the search path is not configured correctly.

A:

If you really must build MoveIt from sources, please remember to run
source $HOME/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

before trying to
roslaunch moveit_setup_assistant setup_assistant.launch

Note that you'll have to do this every time you open a new terminal (unless you add it to your .bashrc).

Edit:

I have add this

source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash

to the bottom of the ~/.bashrc But it does not work.

as @mpjansen correctly notes: you generally only want to source a single setup.bash. In this case, source the setup.bash of your own workspace, not the one in /opt/ros/$distro.
And a bit pedantic, but the source-ing probably works fine. Those two lines just don't do what you are expecting them to do (ie: cumulatively add to your ROS package path).

Edit2:

I have done what you said, only

source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

And try again, yet it turns out that

ERROR: cannot launch node of type [moveit_setup_assistant/moveit_setup_assistant]: can't locate node [moveit_setup_assistant] in package [moveit_setup_assistant]

To avoid a lengthy process of trying to find out what causes this: can you please make sure you absolutely need to build MoveIt from sources? If not, please install the binary packages (sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-moveit-X), as that will make things a lot easier.
If you do need MoveIt from sources, please tell us exactly how you created, populated and built your workspace.
Also: what is the output of rospack find moveit_setup_assistant, after you have sourced your workspace?
And (to get it out of the way): you have ran catkin_make (or catkin build) after you cloned the MoveIt git repository to your source space, correct?

I edit the post to add a bit more infomation. Hope I get some hints. Thanks
Comment by mpjansen on 2016-11-09:
I think you only have to add the one line to the catkin workspace:
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

This bashfile will source the installed environment of indigo itself.
Good luck

In official tutorial, it says it would be convenient to do this
echo "source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

Reference to 1.6 Environment Setup, Unbuntu Install of ROS indigo
Comment by shawnysh on 2016-11-09:
I follow the tutorial in ros-by-example-2,
it says there is bug in MoveIt, so it asks me to apt-get install ros-indigo-moveit-full firslty,
and then git clone something, and catkin_make.
There is something wrong.
Comment by shawnysh on 2016-11-09:
I post catkin_make error question  in author's google group and he told me the bug has been fixed, and no need to git clone source package.
So I remove the source package, apt-get remove ros-indigo-moveit-full-* , and then reinstall again.
finally catkin_make no error.

Thanks for your patient reply
Comment by shawnysh on 2016-11-09:
Your recommendation was right, but I missed some key procedure doing so because I am not familiar with the catkin work principle so that I missed the procedure of remove the build and devel

Good to hear you got it to work.
Perhaps consider marking your own answer as the answer, as that was really what made things work again.
