Q:

gazebo_ros_pkgs - Erro

When I do the downloading
cd ~ / catkin_ws / src
git clone https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs.git
the following error occurs when used the catkin_make.

p.s. try https://gist.github.com for posting code snippets, its better than google docs :)

A:

A lot has changed the past week in how Gazebo and gazebo_ros_pkgs is installed (SDF has been split into a stand-alone debian).
I encourage you to re-read and redo the instructions on the installation, close this ticket and create a new one if you continue to have issues.
