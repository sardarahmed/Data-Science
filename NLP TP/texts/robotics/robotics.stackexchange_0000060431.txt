Q:

Record tf_static with rosbag

Hi all,
I'm trying to record all my topics into a bag, running rosbag record -a. However, rosbag doesn't record the /tf_static topic.
How can I arrange this?
Thanks

A:

I think rosbag only records topics that are actually publishing messages. From what I can tell, /tf_static is only used by new tf2 publishers, and very few packages currently make use of it.
I would verify that there are messages published on /tf_static before worrying that they're not being recorded.
If you do have a node publishing messages to /tf_static and they're not being recorded, that's probably a bug in rosbag.
