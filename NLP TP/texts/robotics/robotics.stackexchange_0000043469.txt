When I try to run the follower program on my turtlebot, everything goes fine, until it hits the section above; then it freaks out and restarts the program again, until it runs into that section again. What does this mean? How do I fix it? Thanks!!!

Also, when I run kinect bringup, then start rviz, I can view through the camera on the kinect, but the point cloud and laser scan do not work. Not sure if that helps but...?

A:

According to what I learned yesterday, this failure is not ROS related. Lots of people are experiencing the same problem and there is a workaround.
The issue is discussed here in detail.

About the rviz issue, more explanation (preferably a screenshot) may be needed. Do you echo the related topics and not see any output?
