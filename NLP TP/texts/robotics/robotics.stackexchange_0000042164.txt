Q:

SICK-LMS200 on Ros Electric

Way back when I used player, I had to do a delay to give the laser time to start scanning. Assuming I had to do this again, I found this question; however, the answer appears to not work in electric. Any ideas on how I can fix this?
The reason  this answer is not applicable is due to the lack of a
/ros/electric/stacks/sicktoolbox/build/sicktoolbox-1.0/c++/drivers/lms/sicklms-1.0/SickLMS.cc 

directory. Any help?
Thanks,
-Hunter A.

A:

Are you sure that is still necessary? According to ticket/4138 for laser_drivers an initial delay should now be supported by the standard package (added in changeset/38987).

EDIT: apparently those changes are only in the Fuerte version of the toolbox (thanks @Chad Rockey). For Electric, you could do a checkout of the package and apply the specific patches yourself, backporting them. Be sure to checkout the appropriate version of the sources.

How do I configure the delay?
Comment by ipso on 2012-07-10:
Looks like it is just a parameter, so add it to the list of parameters of the node in your launch file?
Comment by Chad Rockey on 2012-07-10:
The parameter for the pioneers and the sick toolbox has only been released for Fuerte.
Comment by allenh1 on 2012-07-10:
We cannot use fuerte because the p2os driver doesn't exist for fuerte yet. Due to that limitation, how should we proceed?
