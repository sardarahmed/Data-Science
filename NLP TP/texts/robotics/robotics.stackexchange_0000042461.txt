Q:

Can we use this system for feature requests?

Will this satisfy the need for a feature request system using the "feature_request" tag?
People can subscribe to the feature request RSS with this link:
http://answers.ros.org/feeds/rss/?tags=feature_request
People can vote on features, comment on them, and tag them with other information too. This way, it's all integrated into the current ROS infrastructure, and doesn't clutter ros-users.

I didn't know about the possibility of subscribing to a tag. In that case, I'm OK with it. But it should be documented... maybe in http://www.ros.org/wiki/Get%20Involved ?

A:

I agree with @dornhege's response, that this is probably not a good format for doing feature requests.
I think that having both support questions and feature requests in the same area would end up in chaos.
I think that there are a few channels for feature requests already in existence.

The REP Process - Mechanism to propose major feature enhancements to the ROS community.
code.ros.org - Bug tracker (and feature requests) for core stacks.
kforge.ros.org - Bug trackers for individual stacks and projects.

Finally, if you want to get into the long-term planning of ROS, I strongly encourage you to join one of the Planning SIGS for determining the direction of development for Groovy and forward.
