Q:

Couldn't find executable named rqt_mypkg

I'm having trouble running my RQT package. The error is:
**Couldn't find executable named rqt_mypkg below /home/ros_user/catkin_ws/src/rqt_mypkg

Found the following, but they're either not files,
[rosrun] or not executable:
[rosrun]   /home/ros_user/catkin_ws/src/rqt_mypkg
[rosrun]   /home/ros_user/catkin_ws/src/rqt_mypkg/src/rqt_mypkg
[rosrun]   /home/ros_user/catkin_ws/src/rqt_mypkg/scripts/rqt_mypkg
[rosrun]   /home/ros_user/catkin_ws/src/rqt_mypkg/include/rqt_mypkg**

The catkin_make command is successful and I even tried adding in syntax errors purposely to make sure that the code was fine.
I'm using the rqt_image_view package with all the files included from the ros wiki site (I made changes to the path for my package name in files where necessary). Does anyone know a solution to this problem?

A:

Assuming from your output that rqt_mypkg/scripts/rqt_mypkg is what you actually want to run, make sure it's executable mode (eg. set it $chmod 755 rqt_mypkg). rosrun is able to find those files but complains that none of them are executable.

Thanks this helped out a lot. I used $ chmod -R 755 /rqt_mypkg
