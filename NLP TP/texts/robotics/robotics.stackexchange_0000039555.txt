Q:

Help needed for gazebo simulation record

Hi Everyone:
Did anyone of you try to record a gazebo simulation into a video?
The only instructions available is
https://alliance.seas.upenn.edu/~meam620/wiki/index.php?n=Roslab.RecordingSimulations
following it, I installed glc-capture but still I have no idea of how to record a simulation.
the format of the command should be:
./glc-capture [capture option]... [application] [application argument]... but for gazebo, I don't know how to fill in the [application]
Any help is appreciated.

A:

To record using glc-capture, launch gazebo prefixed by glc-capture, for example if starting gazebo in commandline, use
glc-capture gazebo empty.world

Or add launch-prefix="glc-capture" attribute to the rosnode that starts gazebo.
alternatively, you can also try recordmydesktop
sudo apt-get install recordmydesktop
