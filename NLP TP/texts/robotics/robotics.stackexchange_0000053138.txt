Q:

what happened to the stack camera_pose in groovy?

I checked the package page for camera_pose stack and it seems that it should still exist in groovy. But when I am trying to install it from debian for Ubuntu 12.04, I cannot find any package named ros-groovy-camera-pose or anything similar.

I would also like to know this and can't find anything

A:

The package seems to be deprecated and broken.  There seems to be a fork available at this location:
https://github.com/jbohren-forks/camera_pose
It seems to be compatible with groovy
