Q:

Unable to get ROS Husky Simulation Tutorial to Work

I have just started using ROS, and have been using the Clearpath Robotics tutorials to get my head around it.
They have a tutorial 'Drive a Husky' https://support.clearpathrobotics.com/hc/en-us/categories/200165835-ROS
I have installed the components and I can load up the Gazebo simulator and RViz, however when I get to the line
rostopic pub /husky/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist -r 100 '[0.5,0,0]' '[0,0,0]'

nothing happens. According to the tutorial this is supposed to make the robot in the simulation move forwards.
This may be something trivial that I have overlooked but I am very new to ROS and have no idea how to troubleshoot the problem. All the answers I have come accross so far just say that entering the command into a new terminal window will work - but it doesn't.
I am using ROS Indigo on Mint 17.1 Rebecca.

A:

Try

$ rostopic pub /husky_velocity_controller/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist -r 100 '[0.5,0,0]' '[0,0,0]'

as rohit.ros stated, this is the topic that has velocity controller.
