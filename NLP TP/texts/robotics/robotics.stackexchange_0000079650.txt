Q:

Unable to locate package ros-kinetic-geographic-msgs

I checked the packages list for kinetic and it does have geographic_msgs listed so it should not be giving this error
I installed ROS on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS following the steps here.
The command I used :
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-geographic-msgs

I'm running ROS 1.12.6, also I've been using my Velodyne VLP-16 to bag the data and display the data in rviz but I'm having problems getting this package.
