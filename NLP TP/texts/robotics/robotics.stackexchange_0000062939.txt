Q:

Raspberry Pi +Hydro + Openni/freenect

Hi All,
I am very new to ROS, raspberry pi and linux. I already install Hydro into my raspberry pi. I can run roscore.
Next I want to run freenect_launch. I can'y sudo apt-get install freenect_stack. It say Unable to locate package freenect_stack. I check with apt-cache search freenect. It didn't have anything about freenect_stack/freenect_launch
When I apt-cache search openni there is nothing. Should I add source.list? how do i do that?
How to i apt-get freenect_stack and use roslaunch freenect_launch freenect.launch ?
Sorry I am very new to all this. Do please link me if already have answered.

Are you trying to connect a Microsoft Kinect to a raspberry pi? What linux are you using in rpi?

Debian. Thanks for your reply. I follow this tutorial to install hydro. http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Setting%20up%20Hydro%20on%20RaspberryPi

If you are trying to connect Microsoft kinect to raspberry pi, it is not possible due to limitations in bandwidth on the rpi.

Are you sure? I search the net, there are some successful project on kinect and raspberry pi

I've got indigo running on a rpi2B (raspbian:jessie) and the kinect works with the freenect drivers. I've read that you can compile openni from github and that works too.

A:

I tried interfacing kinect with a beaglebone black, I could not get the data stream from kinect. Try Odroid it is much faster. If you still want to use kinect with raspberry pi, you must either overclock it or  like this, doing it from scratch. ROS +rpi + kinect cannot be done as it requires more processing power. Most of the projects that people have done would include a desktop pc to which they interface the kinect and stream the control data to rpi to control some actuators.

thank you for your explanation. I think i need to shift my work to using a laptop to process data from kinect and use raspberry pi as a controller.
Do you mind to share me some link about the project that kinect with PC + raspberry

I was able to do it with freenect + indigo + rpi2B
