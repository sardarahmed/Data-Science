Q:

Run and Close a ros package inside python program

Hello,
I have a python program that has a GUI.
I want when a user clicks on a button to execute a ROS package. Also, I have another button, when the user clicks, I want to close the running package.
I do not know how to do that.
I know how to open the program:

    # calibration command
        calib_command_str = "rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --size {}x{} {} {} --square {} right:={} left:={} left_camera:={} right_camera:={}".format(interior_corner_hor_axis, interior_corner_ver_axis, camera_service_check_value, approx_str, square_len, right_camera_image_topic, left_camera_image_topic, left_camera_image_super_topic, right_camera_image_super_topic)
    
        os.system(calib_command_str)

However, I do not how to close it.

A:

In ROS, killing a node is as follows
rosnode kill node_name

What the rosnode kill does is send a SIGINT to the NodeHandle, and what the node should do is deconstruct its classes and free the NodeHandle (in correctly written code).
You can use os.system with it too.
For Custom SIGINT Handler (in C++) you can use this tutorial:
