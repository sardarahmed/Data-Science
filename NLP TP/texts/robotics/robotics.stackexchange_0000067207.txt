thank you ,but I find this tourial  can only reconfigure one node's parameters. what I need is like this:when I press buttom A ,the node a will be launched,and then I press another button B, the node b will be launched.

mm maybe this one?
rqt_launch
You will need to make launchfiles of your nodes then
