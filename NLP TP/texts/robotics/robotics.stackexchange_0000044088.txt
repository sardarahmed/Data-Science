Q:

Creating a map with gmapping using kinect and fake odometry data

Hi,
the title speaks for itself, what I've done so far is creating this launchfile,
which seems to do everything right - at least "rostopic echo /scan" echos something.
<launch>
  <!-- kinect and frame ids -->

  <include file="$(find openni_launch)/launch/openni.launch"/>

  <!-- openni manager -->
  <node pkg="nodelet" type="nodelet" name="openni_manager" output="screen" respawn="true" args="manager"/>

  <!-- throttling -->
  <node pkg="nodelet" type="nodelet" name="pointcloud_throttle" args="load pointcloud_to_laserscan/CloudThrottle openni_manager">
    <param name="max_rate" value="2"/>
    <remap from="cloud_in" to="/camera/depth/points"/>
    <remap from="cloud_out" to="cloud_throttled"/>
  </node>

  <!-- fake laser -->
  <node pkg="nodelet" type="nodelet" name="kinect_laser" args="load pointcloud_to_laserscan/CloudToScan openni_manager">
    <param name="output_frame_id" value="/openni_depth_frame"/>
    <remap from="cloud" to="cloud_throttled"/>
  </node>
</launch>

Furthermore I followed the instructions to create fake odometry data.
found here
This also seems to work....so I tried this, but all I get is "Waiting for map".
Please feel free to ask for further information, if needed.

Give this a try. You don't need odometry for it.

Maybe I should have mentioned that: The fake odometry data are just needed for tests - the robot I want to use publishes odometry data. Any ideas why my solution does not work?
thx
