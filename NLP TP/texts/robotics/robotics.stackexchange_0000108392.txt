Q:

GPS timestamp vs ROS2 time

I'm using an ardusimple board, it has an ublox f9p receiver. I'm using kumar driver t get /fix topic
I fuse GPS data with IMU and wheel encoders using two instance of robot_localization package and navsat_node.
The robot runs ubuntu 22.04 and ros iron on a Jetson Nano without internet connections. I spend some time to debug a problem, EKF was not consuming GPS data. If I set the current date and time on the ubuntu OS everything start to work ok.
So I would like to know possible solutions for that. Right now I'm setting date and time manually looking at my cell phone to get current data, but I would like to automate this process.

A:

Jetson Nano doesn't have a Real Time Clock so you can't get right date and time when you shutdown and restart it.
Here are some solutions :

Add a RTC to your jetson nano
Use GPS time as source of truth and set time on your device using "date" CLI
