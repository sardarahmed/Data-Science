Q:

installing gazebo in a overlay

hello, i trying to install a different version of gazebo like a overlay, i create my workspace and run the following lines:
rosws set --svn simulator_gazebo https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/simulator_gazebo/tags/simulator_gazebo-1.7.6

and the
rosws update

but i obtain this:
virtualtouch@ubuntu:~/fuerte_workspace$ rosws update 
[simulator_gazebo] Installing https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/simulator_gazebo/tags/simulator_gazebo-1.7.6 (version None) to /home/virtualtouch/fuerte_workspace/simulator_gazebo
svn: OPTIONS of 'https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/simulator_gazebo/tags/simulator_gazebo-1.7.6': could not connect to server (https://code.ros.org)
Exception caught during install: Error processing 'simulator_gazebo' : [simulator_gazebo] Checkout of https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/simulator_gazebo/tags/simulator_gazebo-1.7.6 version None into /home/virtualtouch/fuerte_workspace/simulator_gazebo failed.

ERROR in config: Error processing 'simulator_gazebo' : [simulator_gazebo] Checkout of https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/simulator_gazebo/tags/simulator_gazebo-1.7.6 version None into /home/virtualtouch/fuerte_workspace/simulator_gazebo failed.

i dont know if the url adress of the code is wrong, someone could help me?...
im working in ros fuerte with ubuntu 12.04
thank you!!
EDIT
it works, but when i run:
rosmake simulator_gazebo

i obtain this error:

This code block was moved to the following github gist:
https://gist.github.com/answers-se-migration-openrobotics/174693426ccf435cb0b6332298364eeb

Any idea???
EDIT:
Now i get this error:
