A:

Follow the tutorial in Publishers and Subscribers to learn how to publish a message.
After that, follow these simple steps.
Step 1 : Read integers from file and store them in an array / vector
Step 2 : Advertise a publisher to a topic of your preference with message type std_msgs/Int64.msg
ros::Publisher pub = nh.advertise<std_msgs::Int64>("topic_name", 5);

Step 3 : Iterate through your integer array/vector and publish them.

Reading from a file depends on the programming language and perhaps the platform.
Clear examples are included here : http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/files/
Good luck! And sorry it took me 4 days to reply. It was a long weekend here in Aus and I took some time away from all my gadgets.
