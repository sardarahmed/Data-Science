Q:

Dynamically reconfiguring parameters from other nodes

Hello everyone!
So, I'm running nodeA with a dynamic_reconfigure server, that's working just fine. I'm using rqt_reconfigure and everything's ok. Now I have a new node, nodeB, from where I want to modify parameters in nodeA. I've figured out there are 2 topics: /nodeA/parameter_descriptions[dynamic_reconfigure/ConfigDescription] and /nodeA/parameter_updates[dynamic_reconfigure/Config]. So, I've created a publisher that complies with that interface and now I'm publishing to that topic. I can publish exactly what I want to the updates topic (if I echo it, I get the values I want for each parameter), but the callback that should be called in nodeA is not getting called, ergo ignoring the updates. It's important to say that this callback works just fine when modifying parameters using rqt_reconfigure.
Any ideas? Thanks!

A:

Dynamic reconfigure clients use a service interface, the topics are just for feedback.  Take a look at http://wiki.ros.org/dynamic_reconfigure/Tutorials/UsingTheDynamicReconfigurePythonClient and #q12276 .
