Q:

ROS Tutorial Typo

On
http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/MultipleMachines
at the bottom of the page, the tutorials refers to

( export ROS_PI=machine_ip_addr)

instead of what is probably  meant to be

( export ROS_IP=machine_ip_addr)

A:

I have fixed the typo.
In the future, you can register a ROS wiki account and fix typos and other errors yourself.
