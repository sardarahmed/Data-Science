A:

When it's said that odom is useless as global frame it's because of the drifts. If your robot drifts then odom will know that you drifted but since odomis your global frame then "all your world have drifted" too. It's just a problem of frame of reference.
That's why the frame map is used as global frame. Each drift caught by odom is sent to map thanks to tf and the transform between map and odom will tell you how the robot drifted so you will know where you actually are.

Thank you for your response. I have a subquestion. I had posted this question, the tilt in the figure is due to drift in robot? as you are saying the world gets drifted. Is it due to that? Let me know. Thanks.
