Q:

roslaunch dynamixel

Hi again, here i'm still got problem changing my friend's ros-files electric structure and i want to changed it to indigo.
i've download and install the dynamixel driver by sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-dynamixel-controllers ros-indigo-dynamixel-driver ros-indigo-dynamixel-msgs ros-indigo-dynamixel-motor and connect RS232 (for TTL) to AX12+.
Now i got this error when i write roslaunch <my_package> ZMP_dynamixel.launch:
core service [/rosout] found
process[dynamixel_controller/dynamixel_manager-1]: started with pid [7803]
process[dynamixel_controller/dynamixel_controller_spawner_ax12-2]: started with pid [7804]

Permission denied for device plugged in, try $ sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0.

I tried it. But, it said no such file or directory

You should try to list all the plugged in serial communication devices ls /dev/ttyUSB*  or all devices like ls /dev/*. Another way is to add the user to the group which handles that device sudo usermod -a -G groupName userName

A:

hi, had the same problem. go to home directory, give command : chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0
this temporarily gives permission to execute ttyUSB0 file by all users , try executing dynamixel_manager.launch twice mine didnt work the first time
