Q:

how to install package for visualation msgs

Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "visualisation_msgs" with any of the following names:

    visualisation_msgsConfig.cmake
    visualisation_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "visualisation_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "visualisation_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "visualisation_msgs" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  using_markers/CMakeLists.txt:7 (find_package)
