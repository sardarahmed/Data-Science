Q:

Assigning parameters in perpendicular axes: D-H is a must

So I was given a course assignment to assign frames and write D-H parameters for this robot using only 5+1 frames (with Frame $\{5\}$ at $P$ and Frame $\{0\}$ at $O$).

And I assigned them like this:

My question is:
From Frame $\{1\}$ to Frame $\{2\}$, what are joint distances $a$ and $d$?
The best answer I could get was 0. But obviously it should be zero for one axis and $a_1$ for the other. What's wrong?
I have read a similar question here. But the answer points me to another method which is impossible for me.
Edit:
No matter I put $a_1$ in $a$
$$(\alpha,a,d,\theta)=(-90^\circ,a_1,0,\theta_2-90^\circ)$$
or in $d$
$$(\alpha,a,d,\theta)=(-90^\circ,0,a_1,\theta_2-90^\circ)$$
The joint distance $a_1$ does not appear in $z$.
What it gave out is
$$\left( \begin{array}{cccc}
\sin{\theta_2} & \cos{\theta_2} & 0 & a_1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
\cos{\theta_2} & -\sin{\theta_2} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{array}\right)
\text{    or    }
\left( \begin{array}{cccc}
\sin{\theta_2} & \cos{\theta_2} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & a_1\\
\cos{\theta_2} & -\sin{\theta_2} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{array}\right)$$
Obviously, $a_1$ should appear in $Z$-translation instead!

A:

I found this video helpful when learning about the DH method.
DH is all about describing the differences between coordinate systems using rotation and translation about/along the X and Z components of the coordinate system.
EDIT
It seems that your frames {0} and {1} are not in the correct location if your wanting to follow the DH convention. When your on a rotation (pivoting) joint (such as the first joint), you should move up the coordinates to the next joint. That should make joint distances a and d be 0, allowing the DH convention to sufficiently describe the differences in frames.
