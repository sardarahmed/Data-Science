Q:

cant move turtle in turtlesim with key inputs

I am trying to go through the tutorial. I am on " Understanding ROS Topics". I can get the turtlesim open but when I try to move the turtle, nothing happens. No, keyinputs appear in the terminal. I am getting the following error in the "roscore" terminal.
Couldn't find an AF_INET address for [IP_OF_TURTLEBOT]

I have looked around a lot and cannot find the answer. Can anyone help me?
