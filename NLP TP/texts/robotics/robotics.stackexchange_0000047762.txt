Q:

Set rqt_gui Perspectives from Command Line

I'm currently writing a script to start rqt_gui with just the right preferences without any setup. So far I've been able to get the rviz preferences to be correct by copying a saved .vcg file to the ~/.rviz/ directory, where it stores such settings. I was hoping I could do something similar for rqt_gui.
My question is how do I make rqt_gui recognize a .preferences file from the command line? I know how to start up rqt_gui using the -p command to set the startup perspective, the problem is getting rqt_gui to recognize this perspective when opened for the first time.

Years later though, this thread might be a duplicate of https://answers.ros.org/question/79141/rqt-loading-with-requested-perspective/ where you'll find more discussions.

A:

A few year later (hoping that someone will find this useful):
<launch>
    <node name="my_rqt_dashboard" pkg="rqt_gui" type="rqt_gui" respawn="false" output="screen" args="--perspective-file $(find my_pkg_with_rqt_config)/rqt_config/my_dashboard.perspective"/>
</launch>

I made this as a chosen answer as it's more direct (and systematic, non-manual) solution.
