Q:

How to filter Gazebo log output

For testing purposes, I am running Gazebo sim (i.e. 'new Gazebo') with logging enabled:
gz sim -v 4 world.sdf

This works, but there's a lot of irrelevant debug output (e.g. gui, simulationrunner, SystemManager, etc).
Is there a way to filter the log output?
In other words: is there an equivalent command for Gazebo sim, to following ROS 2 command:
ros2 run <package> <executable> --ros-args --log-level DEBUG --log-level rcl:=INFO

which configures loglevel 'debug' for all loggers, except for the rcl logger which gets loglevel 'info' (and hence does not output (many) messages).

A:

I believe there's only a global setting (-v 4). One thing that might be useful is that you can run the server and the gui in two separate terminals with gz sim -s -v4 world.sdf and gz sim -g respectively with different verbosity flags.
