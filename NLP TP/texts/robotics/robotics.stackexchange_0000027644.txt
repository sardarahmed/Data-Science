Q:

Hi, is there any existing plug in which allows a model to follow a particular path? Or anything close to constraining or planning path of a model

Suppose I have to move my robot from A to B then C, and under certain constraints on velocity acceleration like dynamic properties? Does there exist any plug in which does the same or anything close to this??

You might want to take a look at motion planning in ROS (http://moveit.ros.org)

You can also look to the move_base package : http://wiki.ros.org/move_base
Then you add a gazebo_ros plugin like the diff_drive plugin to your model.
