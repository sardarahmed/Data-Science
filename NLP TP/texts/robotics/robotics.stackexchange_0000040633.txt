A:

If you run
rosrun gazebo spawn_model
then you get some description of the parameters
-[urdf|gazebo|trimesh] - specify incoming xml is urdf or gazebo format
-[file|param] [<file_name>|<param_name>] - source of the model xml or the trimesh file
-model <model_name> - name of the model to be spawned.
-z <z in meters> - optional: initial pose, use 0 if left out
