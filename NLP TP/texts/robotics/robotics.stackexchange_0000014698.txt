Q:

Position Sensor

During my design of a simple robotic arm, where I 3D printed most of the parts, then used these HS-422 servos, it turned out that for a better control precision and to be able to apply Inverse Kinematic Modeling on my arm, I need feedback positions from these servo, which HS-422 do not provide.
I want to keep using these Servos because the parts are designed to fit them, what options do I have to include feedback position sensors without changing the servos and re-designing the arm's parts? Or is there any servo with feedback position and close dimensions to HS-422 that I can replace with?

A:

The suggestion posted by N. Staub worked well for me, I was able to perform the hack onto the HS-422 where the min and max readings of the servo potentiometer were [0.34-2.04 Vdc] and by using Arduino MEGA 2560, which has the option to provide an interval voltage reference of 2.56V, as fellows:
analogReference(INTERNAL2V56) #Arduino MEGA Only

With this setup I could get a good resolution of 0-2.56V/0-1023 counts.
For other boards, you can provide an External Aref, using a voltage divider rule, keeping in mind that the max External Aref cannot be more than 5V otherwise you will damage the chip.
