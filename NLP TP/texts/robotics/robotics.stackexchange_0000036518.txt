Q:

(Turtlebot) Easier way to check power button status of iRobot Create

What would be easier ways to check the power on/off on iRobot Create?
If I understand correctly the usage, we often need to check if the power light of Create is on/off on Turtlebot. For ex. power charging doesn't start while the power on unless in passive mode. Also, ROS can't operate it when it's off, which sometimes happen to me even though the light on powering cables for Create is on. Correct me if I'm doing something wrong here, which could be the best answer to this Q as well.
Suppose I'm correct, it's a little tedious to crouch down and look into the thin space b/w Create and Turtlebot's lowest plate to see Creates panel every time. Dashboard is very nice tool, but I think it doesn't provide enough feature yet when it comes to checking if power is on/off.

Thank you. That'd be great if turning battery on/off from remote (by dashboard etc.) is possible (and the ticket page cited doesn't contain anything but it'll get filled right? Just wondering).

I will look into this, I have created a ticket here https://kforge.ros.org/turtlebot/trac/ticket/105. I'm not sure if it's possible but I have some ideas for how to implement it and add it to the dashboard

A:

I have also found that the LED near the power button to not be a reliable power status indicator. It's very easy to add a real power on/off status LED by connecting an LED to the cargo bay connector pin 8 (switched 5VDC) and pin 21 (ground). Be sure to also add a resistor (180ohm to 330 ohm) in series with the the LED to limit current to, and protect the LED.

I have added diagnostics to the turtlebot_node now so that you can see in the dashboard if the node is running.. will be in the next TB release.

Not a bad idea! I've logged this in our feature request hopper.

Sounds awesome. I'm afraid I can't try the similar thing very soon since I'm finishing my contract w/current employer where I use Turtlebots, but this might be something I want to give shot and hope Turtlebot manufacturers to think about.
