Q:

create_cloudsim.py issues

create_cloudsim.py has a couple issues.

It seems to depend on what directory it is launched in.

It is not clear what AWS credentials are needed.

create_cloudsim.py launched in cloudsim-1.0.1/bin: (the requests were made with a valid gmail account and "access keys" from AWS. Names and keys have been changed to protect the innocent)

Can you be more specific about AWS credentials one needs:

Access Keys?
Amazon CloudFront Key Pairs ?
Amazon EC2 Key Pairs ?
Your pointer to "AWS Key Pairs" on
http://gazebosim.org/wiki/Tutorials/cloudsim/setup  Introduction
actually points to #Access Keys, which are only one kind of key pairs.

Thanks,

Hi Chris,
Sorry for the confusion. You need to use the "AWS access keys", AWS provides them on the Access Keys tab on the AWS Security Credentials page. I have updated my answer to your other question.
Using the AWS access keys should help you get your "Unauthorized" problem.
