Hello,
I am using ROS hydro and Gazebo in my research, and I want to install the newest version of Ubuntu 13.10. Do you think I might have any serious incompatibilty issues?

A:

If you don't have very good reasons to use 13.10, I'd recommend using something between 12.04 and 13.04. It's much nicer not to have to install everything from source.
