You question would be more clear if you had a link to the product. Are you referring to these: http://www.smartmicro.de/automotive-radar/products/ ?

They have a ROS1 driver available themselves in the downloads section: https://www.smartmicro.com/downloads
And a ROS2 version is available here: https://github.com/smartmicro/smartmicro_ros2_radars
