A:

This looks like it is trying to use macports, Make sure you added:
export ROS_OS_OVERRIDE=osxbrew:lion

To your ~/.bashrc and that you made it take affect by running source ~/.bashrc or by closing and opening the terminal.
The above line is important because it indicates to rosdep that you want to use Homebrew on Lion rather than Macports to resolve your dependencies.
