Q:

joint_state_controller problem loading

I have a problem when go loading the joint_state_controller.
roslaunch joint_state_controller joint_state_controller.launch
process[joint_state_controller_spawner-1]: started with pid [17618]
[INFO] [WallTime: 1380940721.793944] [0.000000] Controller Spawner: Waiting for service controller_manager/load_controller
[WARN] [WallTime: 1380940752.010181] [8.979000] Controller Spawner couldn't find the expected controller_manager ROS interface.

A:

It appears that you don't have a running controller manager, or you are not launching the spawned script in the same namespace as the controller manager. Is this the case?

Hi Adolfo, thanks for reply.
Look these links, are when I start my project:

The "joint_state_controller" is in the folder "ros_controller", not I created the code in my project folder. I start it there the "joint_state_controller".
Do you give me any tips how to do this?
Best regards.

Not start the controller using: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6844189 
But...,
With my launch: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6844154 
I start the controller using: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6844201 
....and joint_state_controller run.
