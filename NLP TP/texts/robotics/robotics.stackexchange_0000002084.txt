Q:

Fake localization using bag file in ROS

I have a bag file that contains couple of topics needed for localization, odometry data, kinect data and /tf. What I want is watching robot's movement path in rviz after initializing robot position (even I don't know how to initial it). Any help?
All topics:
/scan
/tf
/clock
/map
/odom

A:

Before you run rviz, you need to set use_sim_time to true:
rosparam set use_sim_time true

Now start up rviz, then run rosbag using --clock:
rosbag play bagfile_name.bag --clock

For setting up rviz with the navigation stack, you will want to follow this tutiorial.
