Q:

Why does moveit depend on swig-wx?

swig-wx is deprecated should moveit not depend on Qt instead?

A:

It does not depend on swig-wx. The warning:
WARNING: Package name "swig-wx" does not follow the naming conventions. It should start with a lower case letter and only contain lower case letters, digits and underscores.
Will appear anywhere that rosdep is referenced if swig-wx is installed. The best fix is uninstall swig-wx and its upstream dependencies:
sudo apt-get remove swig-wx
Note: swig-wx is deprecated and will be removed in Hydro.
