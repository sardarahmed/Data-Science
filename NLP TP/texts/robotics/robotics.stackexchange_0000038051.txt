Q:

Messages for velocity and acceleration

Hi all,
is there a message which contains linear and rotational velocities and accelerations on the three axis?
I toke a look in the geometry and navigation messages but I didn't find what I need.
I'm looking for something similar to geometry_msgs::Twist + accelerations.
Thanks!

Hi,
You might take a look at the sensor_msgs::Imu here.
It comes with angular_velocity and linear_acceleration fields.
It doesn't have linear velocities though.
If you are using an IMU, that's what you are looking for.
Otherwise, to my best knowledge, you'll have to make your own msg (see here how to do so).

@Enrique Thanks, actually I have to send the velocities and accelerations of my mobile base. It isn't an IMU. I know how to make new messages, however I was looking for an existing solution in order to reuse as much as I can.

I would recommend publishing both TwistStamped and Imu topics simultaneously, with identical time stamps.
