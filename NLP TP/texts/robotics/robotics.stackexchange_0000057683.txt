Q:

How can I use Qt 5 with ROS catkin?

I'm able to use qt_ros, but it creates package depending on Qt4, but I need Qt 5.1 or older to use QSerialPort. How can I do it? Is it a bad idea?

A:

please see this question
and change
find_package(Qt4 COMPONENTS QtCore QtGui)

to
find_package(Qt5 COMPONENTS QtCore QtGui)

I tried, but it says
"CMake Error at /home/roman/Qt/5.2.1/gcc/lib/cmake/Qt5/Qt5Config.cmake:3 (message):
Qt5 requires at least CMake version 2.8.9
Call Stack (most recent call first):
test/CMakeLists.txt:9 (find_package)".
ROS Hydro Medusa uses CMake 2.8.3...

This was not possible in Qt5.0 and you had to call find_package() seperately like:
find_package(Qt5Widgets)
find_package(Qt5Declarative)
