Q:

How to use OMPL for path planning

Hello,
I have a PGM/YAML set map that was generated from a Hokuyo LIDAR with an iRobot Create, and the objective is to use OMPL's libraries for motion planning in this map. I have the OMPL GUI, but there seems to be no straightforward way to use user generated maps, and all the example maps are in .dae format. ROS tutorials always seemed to talk about PR2 arm navigation.
I would greatly appreciate any suggestions as to how I can start off using OMPL's algorithms for navigation in my own map. Thank you.

A:

You could take a look into moveit. It uses OMPL to do the path planning and is pretty simple to use. Even though I am not sure that a LIDAR will work as a sensor, there are different sensor types accepted
