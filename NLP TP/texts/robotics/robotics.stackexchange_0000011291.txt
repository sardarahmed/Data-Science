Q:

Do I need extra software on the EV3 to use Robotary?

Do we need to install extra software on the EV3 or does Robotary (https://robotaryapp.com/) install programs just like the default LEGO Software.
Thanks, Josh

A:

I contacted the developers and no, you do not need external software, but your mac has to be running for the software to work on the EV3. They are connected via bluetooth or USB.
