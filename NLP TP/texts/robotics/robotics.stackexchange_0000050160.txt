Q:

Some e-mails not delivered to ros-users?

Comparing its lurker and nabble.com, I noticed a couple of emails only appear on nabble. I noticed at least these titles are missing:

A new repository in fuerte to index by zhuangyan Apr 08
A new repository in fuerte to index by dbb Apr 03

And I haven't received these e-mails in my mailbox. I'm not sure what nabble.com does either but why is this?

A:

That's a problem (or maybe a misconception) with Nabble. It pretends to be a forum where you can actively post instead of writing an email to the mailing list. Nabble will then try to send a corresponding email to the list.
But the mailing list will only accept email from subscribed members. Someone posting through Nabble may not be a member, and the mail will bounce.
Maybe a big warning like on http://www.pcl-users.org could help?
