Q:

ROS viso2 visual odometry package outcome inaccurate

ROS viso2 visual odometry package outcome inaccurate
Hi
Im feeding ROS visual odometry package with pre recorded data. Data is 500 pair of synced 1024*768 bumblebee2 output image( also tested other setting as well). Ive using opencv to get u,v and focus length. baseline is provided. they are all correct setting
However the output of the RT matrix was quite inaccurate.
during the rotation period, track is lost entirely.
what else I could do to improve the result. Or what should I do?
By the way, the test image sample provide by libviso2 was great.

@ThomasK Im also using camera a bit tilted down, outdoor in the school scene.  Ok I understand what you said. Ill set different value and give it a try again.

A:

libviso2 works perfectly fine, you just need to tune the parameters to your dataset (e.g. increase the max number of features per bucket for indoor scenes to get more features).
The problem in the other question is caused by a difference in tilt rotation between the camera used to record the dataset (the KIT camera is slightly facing downwards as far as I remember) and the one used to reproduce the results.
