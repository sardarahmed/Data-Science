Q:

Errors while installing Ros-jade

i got an error while installing Ros -jade into Ubuntu 15.04.
I followed  instructions on this website(link text).
I've done up to "$sudo apt-get update"(1.4: Installation ). But after entering command "$sudo apt-get install ros-jade-desktop-full", i got an error "E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)"
What should  I do?

A:

You appear to have a problem with the package runit which has failed to configure. It is not a ROS dependency. You need to fix that package before you will be able to install any packages such as the ROS jade packages.
