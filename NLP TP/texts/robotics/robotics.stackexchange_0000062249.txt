Q:

Fetching the RGB image from kinect

Hello,
I am using kinect sensor for the mapping and navigation in my project, As Kinect also have a RGB camera.
I wanted to fetch the RGB image from the kinect, then do some processing and get the text data in the image using this data I want to re localise my robot.
Is this possible in ros.?
Many Thanks in advance.

A:

Sure! just subscribe to the RGB image topic. Assuming you started the openni with
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch
Just subscribe to /camera/rgb/image_raw topic. The sensor_msgs/Image messages you get can be easily converted to OpenCV with cv_bridge package.

Dear @sumanth, if this answer is satisfactory for you, please, mark it as correct. Also, it would be more appropriate to ask about the package for text extraction from images as a new question, as it could be helpful for other people. Thank you for helping us keep the forum organised.
