Q:

Virtualization on Workstation

For my workstation, I have installed ubuntu 11.04 on a virtual machine running inside Windows 7. Would virtualization of the "Workstation" cause any trouble in communicating to the other "Turtlebot" Netbook in future? Would a new, seperate ubuntu install without virtualizatin be necessary to run ROS without hiccups?

A:

It is possible to get ROS communication working from inside a virtual machine. It's just important to use a bridged network instead of the default routed emulated network device.
