Q:

Creating a dynamixel action client controller (Tutorials)

Hello, I am following the tutorial for dynamixel_contollers as posted on http://wiki.ros.org/dynamixel_controllers/Tutorials/Creatingdynamixelactionclient
When I run "trajectory_client.py", in the console where I run controller_manager.launch show: Incoming trajectory joints do not match the joints of the controller. Exception in your execute callback: not all arguments converted during string formatting.
Also when I run the start_meta_controller before, at the end it appears: all processes on machine have died, roslaunch will exit
shutting down processing monitor complete.
Thank you very much for your attention.

A:

I have already solved it, the fault was in the line: goal.trajectory.joint_names. You have to remove: +char.
