Q:

Can I link to ROS libraries without CMAKE?

Everytime I try to use a library built by CMAKE, I need to also use CMAKE.  I don't want to use CMAKE.  I just want to use the LIB, INCLUDEPATH, and DEPENDPATH variables in my Qt project.  Is this possible?

Please consider rephrasing this in a way that does not read as an attack on cmake.

A:

This post http://jbohren.com/tutorials/2014-02-10-roscpp-hello-world/#create-the-simplest-ros-c-program describes what catkin and cmake are doing under the hood, and how to build a simple ROS node on the command line without cmake.
The ROS packages that you install through apt-get also install pkgconfig files in /opt/ros/<distro>/lib/pkgconfig, if your build system is compatible with pkgconfig.
