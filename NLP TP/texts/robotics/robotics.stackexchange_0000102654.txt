Q:

Connect ROS with RobotStudio via abb_robot_driver

Hello,
I installed the abb_robot_driver node from here in my workspace, it worked without any errors while building.
I am running:

Ubuntu 20.04, kernel: 5.14.0-1054-oem
ROS Noetic

I have now installed Robot studio on a seperate Windows PC, Robot Ware 7 is also installed. I open the robot I want (ABB IRB4600-40/255) and create a controller. It is indicated that the controller is running.
When I now try to use the first example of the abb_robot_driver here which is:
roslaunch abb_robot_bringup_examples ex1_rws_only.launch robot_ip:=<WindowsPC IP>

I get the warning
[ WARN] [1667469851.804625427]: Failed to establish RWS connection to the robot controller (attempt 1/5), reason: 'Failed to collect general system info'

Until I receive:
[FATAL] [1667469856.931221918]: Runtime error: 'Failed to establish RWS connection to the robot controller'

I am pretty sure I did not set up everything correctly, but was not able either to find a tutorial how to do so. Can anybody give me a hint? Thank you.
Cheers

A:

Hi, here is my update: I shut off all firewalls of the Windows PC (I switched to a VM). I was able to ping from both directions this way. I still was not able to connect to the virtual controller of RobotStudio. For that I needed to follow this instuction here. Afterwards I was able to launch the first example of the bringup. I still have issues with the bringup examples but I'll open another question for that.
Thanks for the help!
