Q:

Where does the review status go under catkin?

Catkin complains that the <review> tag is not allowed in the package.xml.
Where should this information be maintained, now?
EDIT: I realize catkin does not support it. It is not needed for building.
The question is where does that information go? Is there now a wiki macro? Are we just throwing it away?
No reasonable user would consider this unimportant.

A:

I believe that information is not maintained in catkin anymore, mostly because it has not proven to be useful. I cannot find the post where this was discussed, though.

I remember the discussion. I can't find it, either. To me, review status is the most useful information about a package: if it has no reviews, it is not worth using.
Comment by KruseT on 2013-02-17:
The value of the tag is worthless, as reviewed packages don't get their tag updated, packages which have been reviewed change and should be reviewed again, but are not, etc... the actual review status would be useful. That can be discussed in Buildsystem SiG, but prepare for disappointment.
Comment by joq on 2013-02-17:
It is certainly not "worthless". The fact that a package that has never been reviewed is valuable information (i.e. don't use it). If the review date is present, but old, that is also useful to know.
Comment by KruseT on 2013-02-17:
As I say, a tag saing "not reviewed" does not mean the package has not been reviewed. It would be foolish to put so much faith into a tag. And "reviewed 2009" does not tell you neither that it has not been reviewed in 2012. also the extend of the review is never known.
Comment by joq on 2013-02-18:
I am not "putting faith" in a tag, just using it as evidence for Bayesian inference. It is quite unlikely that an reviewed package will say it is unreviewed. At the very least, that would be evidence of poor maintenance, and users should avoid it, if possible.
Comment by joq on 2013-02-18:
The wiki Reviews page does document what reviews were done. Reasonable users can draw their own conclusions from the discussions recorded there.
Comment by joq on 2013-02-18:
Thibault, I am confused by your assumption that a package with no 2012 review is worthless. The specific example for this question is camera1394. It is widely used and actively maintained. The last reviews were in 2010. The API and documentation have stable since then. Is that a problem?

This is no place for discussions.
