Q:

PR2 arm planning is not shown in Gazebo

Hi my friends,
I have a problem following the tutorial on Moveit! here
I follow exactly what the tutorial says, the pr2 can plan an arm trajectory and show the animation in Rviz, however when i click the Execute button on the Motion Planning panel, the pr2 in gazebo does nothing. The error message i received from rviz is as follows:
 [ERROR] [1378352167.379469133, 105.504000000]: Unable to identify any set of controllers that can actuate the specified joints: [ l_elbow_flex_joint l_forearm_roll_joint l_shoulder_lift_joint l_shoulder_pan_joint l_upper_arm_roll_joint l_wrist_flex_joint l_wrist_roll_joint ]

But i am sure i also follow the tutorial here to setup the configurations.
Can someone help to solve the problem.
I am running on groovy Ubuntu 12.04LTS.
Thanks a lot in advance!
