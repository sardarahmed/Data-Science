Q:

Disable AVX instructions for entire catkin workspace

I have a multitude of packages in my catkin workspace that all need to be compiled without using AVX instructions. Is there a way to globally disable AVX instructions when using catkin build? It is not an option for me to disable AVX instructions in every single CMakeLists.txt.
My first attempt was to add -mavx to the Make Args of catkin config but that was unsuccessful probably because it is not a Make argument but a compiler option.

This works:
catkin build --force-cmake --cmake-args -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-mno-avx"
