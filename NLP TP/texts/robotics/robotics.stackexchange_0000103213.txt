Q:

How to start 'gz sim' from a yaml launch file?

Hello,
I'd like to start 'gz sim' from my yaml launch-file, I read here that it's easy in python with the ExecuteProcess class.
But when I tried to use
  # gazebo world
  - ExecuteProcess:
      cmd:

I got the error [ERROR] [launch]: Caught exception in launch (see debug for traceback): Caught exception when trying to load file of format [yml]: Unrecognized entity of the type: ExecuteProcess when I launched the file with ros2 launch my_file.yml
I did not found either a doc that help translate from Python class to Yaml.
Linux version 5.19.0-40-generic, Ubuntu 11.3.0-1ubuntu1~22.04

A:

If anyone is interested I succeed with this launch :
  # gazebo world
  - executable:
      cmd: gz sim -v 1 -r my_world.sdf

If anyone knows where to find the full doc of the yml launch file, I'm still interested
