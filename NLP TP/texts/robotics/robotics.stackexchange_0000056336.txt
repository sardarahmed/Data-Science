Q:

how to create new data for ar_pose

I would like to ask if the bagfiles in open for public. Cause the access deny when i tried to download the files.

I am now trying to calibrate my camera (Logitech Carl Zeiss Tessar) under calib_camera2 from artoolkit, it shows the following error
 Using supplied video config string [-width=640 -height=480].

ioctl failed
init(): Unable to open connection to camera.

A:

See https://github.com/LucidOne/ar_tools/pull/4 for a way to fix the access denied problem (the repository has moved)
