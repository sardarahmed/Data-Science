Q:

Indigo is unable to launch RQT_plot

Hello,
I have attempted to launch rqt_plot on my machine running Ubuntu 14.04 and Indigo to no avail. I have also reinstalled rqt_plot and all its dependencies manually. When I attempt to run rqt_plot ROS spits back the following error
merciez@ln14ds7:~/catkin_ws$ rqt_plot
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/indigo/bin/rqt_plot", line 6, in <module>
    from rqt_plot.plot import Plot
  File "/opt/ros/indigo/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rqt_plot/plot.py", line 43, in <module>
    from .data_plot import DataPlot
ImportError: No module named data_plot

I have replicated the same error on three different machines all running Ubuntu 14.04 and Indigo.
Any help is appreciated.
