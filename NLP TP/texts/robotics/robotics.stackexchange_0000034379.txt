Q:

Conversion table b/w older & newer ROS

I'm porting a program that was written 2 years ago based on ROS 0.4 to the newer version, and not to mention seeing a bunch of compile errors due to the API incompatibility. Is there a document that shows conversion between older and newer ROS ? I'm using electric but diamondback would do too.
Thanks.
Update 9/21/11) One example out of hundreds of missing API is deprecated_msgs::RobotBase2DOdom.stall. I'm now using nav_msgs::Odometry in place of RobotBase2DOdom but haven't been able to figure out stall equivalent yet (this isn't a question though).

A new question makes sense. Ken already answered your original question as well as it can be.

@joq thanks. I just updated the question body text (though I wonder if I should ask another question for this particular case).

Just FYI, there should be very little difference between diamondback and electric for most APIs.
Comment by joq on 2011-09-20:
I know of no general document. Each API should describe its own changes over time. Specifically, what compile errors are you seeing?

A:

ROS 0.4 is quite old -- that's a bit long for any docs to exist.  In general, the release notes for each ROS Distribution should provide the major migration notes if you click on the relevant change lists.  For Electric->Diamondback, there's very little changes for ROS code, though thirdparty libraries like Eigen require more significant migration.
