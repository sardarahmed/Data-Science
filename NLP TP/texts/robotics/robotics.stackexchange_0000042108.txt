Q:

Element arrays and nested elements in Gazebo 1.x

I am porting the gazebo_ros_actuator_array plug-in (in the actuator_array stack) to Gazebo 1.x. Unfortunately, according to http://gazebosim.org/wiki/sdf_plugin, plug-ins specified in an SDF file can only have key-value pairs as their parameters. The actuator array plug-in has parameters like these:
<joint>
    <name>camera_servo_joint</name>
    <home>0</home>
    <p>10</p>
    <i>0</i>
    <d>0</d>
    <iClamp>0</iClamp>
  </joint>
  <joint>
    <name>camera_axle_joint</name>
    <home>0</home>
    <p>10</p>
    <i>0</i>
    <d>0</d>
    <iClamp>0</iClamp>
  </joint>
  <joint>
    <name>right_axle_joint</name>
    <controlType>velocityEffort</controlType>
  </joint>

Are there plans to support multiple elements with the same name (e.g. "joint") and nested elements? Currently, my work-around is to add a jointFileName parameter to the plug-in, use the parameter to specify a YAML file, and store the joint information in the file.

who is the intended audience for the XML you posted above?  Is it a gazebo plugin you've written?
Comment by Jim Rothrock on 2012-07-19:
The XML contains parameters for the gazebo_ros_actuator_array plug-in (http://www.ros.org/wiki/actuator_array_gazebo_plugin).

From Nate Koenig on the Gazebo mailing list:
This is now fixed in the dev branch of gazebo. There is also a simple example in <gazebo_sources>/examples/plugins/parameters
