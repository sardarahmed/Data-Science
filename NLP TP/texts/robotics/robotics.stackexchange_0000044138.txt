Q:

kinect and turtlebot and xbox

Hi
It seems if I want to DIY to put kinect purchased together with a xbox on turtlebox, I have to modify the original kinect which involves cutting the power cable of kinect. Can the modified kinect be still used with xbox? Anyone has done this?
Thanks
Jack

A:

Check out Pgs. 17-20 of our TurtleBot hardware manual. It assumes that you've got the AC power adapter for your Kinect (which IIRC is optional). If you've got the adapter, you can modify it in a way where you can put it back together (shown in the manual). If you don't have the adapter, you'll need to get one.
