Q:

projecting the map in rviz using map_server

I want to use map_server as in this link:
wiki.ros.org/map_server
I built my map using mapper3 (basic)
the map should be projected in Rviz grid and should occupy it all, the centre of the map using mapper3 ( basic) should be the centre of the Rviz grid.
The problem is that the map is always shifted (the centres are not the same ) The centre of Rviz grid is the left down corner of the map image ( the image only occupy one quarter of the grid). How can I fix this problem?
Also, I have the error of No transform from [map] to [odom]

A:

One thing you could do is manually edit the origin of the map in the yaml file. See http://wiki.ros.org/map_server#YAML_format
EDIT: Could you update your question to include the launch file(s) you are using. Moreover, what is the fixed_frame of rviz set to?
EDIT2: It actually sounds like there is no transformation from your fixed frame to the frame_id of your map. Try chaning the fixed frame in rviz to map, or whatever your map's frame_id is.

The ymal file has the following
image: testmap.png
resolution: 0.1
origin: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
occupied_thresh: 0.65
free_thresh: 0.196
negate: 0
I tried to change the origin to [-10 -10 0] or tp [10,10,0] but nothing changed, it gives the same result.
