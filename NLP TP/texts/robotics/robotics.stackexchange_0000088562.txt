Q:

openai_ros q-learning example not work

Hi guys, As I'm trying to follow this tutorial from OpenAI_ROS to play around Q learning on a Gazebo simulated turtlebot in a maze. However, I cannot initiate my turtlebot. I have succesfully downloaded and built openai_ros and openai_example_projects in my ROS workspace. I'm using Ubuntu 16.04+ROS-Kinetic + Gazebo-7.0.
Basically, I'm following these steps: 

$ roslaunch gym_construct main.launch to start gazebo simulation (this part looks fine to me). 

$ roslaunch turtle2_openai_ros_example start_training.launch and this will give me following error messages.
[ERROR] [1534517590.397706, 29.824000]: WORLD RESET
[ERROR] [1534517590.399843, 29.826000]: NOT Initialising Simulation Physics Parameters

Hi, I'm one of the developers of the package.
your steps are correct.
I think that you have no error when executing the code and that everything is working. The thing is that, due to going fast in the deployment of the code, we have used ERROR and WARN messages to show different colors of messages for our own debugging purpose. Then we forgot to put it back to normal info messages.
What I mean is that those messages are not error messages, just INFO messages. We are going to change this next week.
So you should have a list of messages like this:
* /turtlebot2/wait_time: 0.1
 
NODES
/
turtlebot2_maze (turtle2_openai_ros_example/start_qlearning.py)

... and so on.
So your robot should start moving and trying actions.
Please confirm that it is working. Otherwise, copy here the whole output of your command.

Yes, you are right. I figured out this a couple of days before but forgot to check this answer back. Thank you.
