I think you should either run roslaunch in verbose mode (-v and --screen options) or read the log files to find out why this happened. Or, simply run the node using rosrun.

-11 is a segfault. You probably have some bug somewhere.

A:

I got this message for wifi configuration. Use GDB to get a backtrace of the process to find out why this happened.
