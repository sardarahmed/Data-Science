Q:

humanoid_nav_msgs not found while building nao_virtual

Hello everyone,
I'm a totally ROS rookie and I have the following problem:

It's my aim to simulate Nao in Gazebo using plain ros_control architecture.

See also: (https://github.com/ros-naoqi/nao_virtual)

My procedure:

I create a Workspace (catkin workspace)
mkdir -p ~/nao_ws/src
cd ~/nao_ws/src
catkin_init_workspace
cd~/catkin_ws
catkin_make

Subsequently:
cd  ~/nao_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/roboticsgroup/roboticsgroup_gazebo_plugins.git
git clone https://github.com/pal-robotics/pal_msgs.git
git clone https://github.com/pal-robotics/pal_gazebo_plugins.git
catkin_make

catkin_make command produced the following error:
CMake Warning at /opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:76 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "humanoid_nav_msgs"
  with any of the following names:

  set "humanoid_nav_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "humanoid_nav_msgs" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.

Invoking "cmake" failed

My Ubuntu version: 14.04 (Indigo)
Can anybody help me further?
Many thanks and best regards

Do you have the humanoid_nav_msgs package?

@BoC: I've changed the title of your question, as your problem does not seem to be with "simulating nao in gazebo using plain ros_control". At least not yet. The problem is getting the packages to compile.

A:

The readme in the repository you link seems to be slightly incomplete.
Unless the packages you cloned to your workspace are completely stand-alone / self-sufficient (which almost no pkg is, as reuse is one of the corner stones of ROS), you'll have to make sure that you have all dependencies of those packages installed on your system as well.
ROS has a tool for that, called rosdep. See #q215059 for an explanation why ROS introduced a 'new tool', and see #q252478 that uses the tool in an example workflow that builds a pkg cloned from a repository.

As these dependencies are not needed by this package anymore, a PR has been opened to update the readme accordingly https://github.com/ros-naoqi/nao_virtual/pull/24
