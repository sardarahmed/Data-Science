Q:

Motion planning collision checking on Gazebo virtual worlds

Hello everyone,
I will create a virtual building in Gazebo with the building editor. Then, I want to do motion planning in that building. In the past, I was carrying out a mapping step in which I was teleoperating the robot and building an octomap from the sensor data. Then I used the octomap for collision checking.
Now, I would like to directly use the environment saved for collision checking or to automatically convert it into an octomap (or just a 3D occupancy grid), so I do not need to manually sense the map. Any ideas on how to do this? Thank you!

No suggestions? Anyone?

A:

I found this gazebo plugin that converts to octomap from a mesh:
