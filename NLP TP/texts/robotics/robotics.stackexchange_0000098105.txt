Q:

Role of Ament in ROS 2 package creation

In the Creating Your First ROS2 Package  tutorial, the command to create a new Python package is:
ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python my_package

I'm confused by the appearance of ament in the above command. Since I am using Dashing, I would not expect to use ament_tools or probably anything with ament in its name, since ROS 2 is now using colcon.
Is this a vestige of earlier releases, or do I have a misconception?

A:

Seems that ament_tools is gone and replaced with colcon but ament is still alive.
