Q:

networking machines connected in series

I have 3 machines that are connected in series.  Machine #1 is running roscore and is networked locally to Machine #2.  Everything works fine between those two.  Machine #3 accesses Machine #2 via a VPN connection, but is not allowed to access Machine #1 directly.  How do I get Machine #3 to see the rosmaster on Machine #1?

A:

This is a routing problem.
Get machine 2 to route the network that machine 1 is on to/from the VPN connection.
Alternatively: get your VPN server to give incoming connections IPs in the range of the network between machine 1 and 2.
