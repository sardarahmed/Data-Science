Q:

rospack became agonizingly slow

Since I upgraded to Groovy, the rospack command has become really slow. This is true even if have no own package tree, just the distribution itself. The rospack profile call runs fast and shows nothing abnormal, but any query takes over a second.
Any ideas what is wrong?
$ env | grep ROS_
ROS_ROOT=/opt/ros/groovy/share/ros
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/opt/ros/groovy/share:/opt/ros/groovy/stacks
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
ROS_DISTRO=groovy
ROS_ETC_DIR=/opt/ros/groovy/etc/ros

$ rospack profile
Full tree crawl took 0.019685 seconds.
Directories marked with (*) contain no manifest.  You may
want to delete these directories.
To get just of list of directories without manifests,
re-run the profile with --zombie-only

A:

As it turns out, rosdep is at least partially responsible. If you are affected, make sure you have upgraded to at least rosdep 0.10.14 and re-run rosdep update for a noticeable speedup.
