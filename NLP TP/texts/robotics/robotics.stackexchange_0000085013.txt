Q:

Is there a possibility in ROS to check that the other machine messages publish in the topic without direct transfer of messages between the machines?

Hi,
Is there a possibility in ROS to check that in the other machine messages publish in the topic without direct transfer of messages between the machines?
I would like to transfer between machines only the information that the message was published in topic without transferring the exact things in it.
I tried to use the «Message Event», but according to traffic of the router, the messages were transmitted completely.

Do you need an event per message, or are aggregate statistics enough?

Statistics is enough, but if it possible to receive an event per message, it would be better.

A:

If you want statistics on topic rate for monitoring and alerting, you may want to set up the ROS diagnostics framework and use the DiagnosedPublisher class from the diagnostic_updater package.
If you want to monitor aggregate statistics on the entire topic graph and you don't need monitoring or alerting, you may want to enable topic_statistics and use rqt_graph to measure the publish rate: http://wiki.ros.org/rqt_graph#Topic_statistics (note that this only works for topics that are actually published and subscribed, because it's per-link and not per-publisher)
