Q:

PCL::MomentOfInertiaEstimation in ROS

Hello, I would like to use the MomentOfInertiaEstimation object from PCL. As I saw in pcl_ros this package only uses 1.7.0 of the pcl library. The object MomentOfInertiaEstimation is available from 1.7.2.
Is there any easy way to get the 1.7.2 version of pcl?
I'm using ROS Hydro
Thanks Johannes

A:

If you want to use a different version of pcl you will need to install it from source as well as any package which depends on it.
