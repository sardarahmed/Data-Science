Q:

no neato laser scan with hector_slam

I am able to get a laser scan in rviz with neato lidar tutorial.  But when I try to get a laser scan with hector_slam there isn't a scan in rviz.  I am trying to use hector_map with out odometer.  I have changed the launch file to reflect that ( I think).  Are there other settings that I will have to change to get a good bag file?
Thanks!

This is the warning that I get: No transform between frames /map and scanmatcher_frame available after 20.002542 seconds of waiting.

Not sure what the problem is but maybe you want to try my launch file. It's working fine over here with XV-11 and hector_slam.
Hmm I cant post it as code because the xml seems to get messed up and I can't upload files yet, so here it is on pastebin:
hector_launch
Before you run it you just have to start your Neato driver manually, didn't include that yet...
Good luck.

Thank you!  I will give it a try.

This is what I am getting with your launch file: roslaunch file contains multiple nodes named [/rviz].
Please check all  'name' attributes to make sure they are unique.
Also check that $(anon id) use different ids.

Did you try to remove anything related to RViz in the launch file to see if it starts then? You could then still record a bag and play it afterwards?
