Q:

How to set turtlebot to point to some orientation when it arrives?

how to set the turtlebot point or not point to a specific orientation when it arrives the goal?
I'm using rviz to set the goal for my mova_base for Turtlebot.
How to configure the amcl files or something others to make the turtlebot point or not point to the specific orientation when it arrives the goal.
Thanks!!

A:

When you set the goal point in rviz, it is an arrow. The turtlebot will point in the direction of that arrow when it arrives at the destination.
If you hold the mouse button while setting the destination in rviz, you can change the direction of the arrow. The goal is not sent until you release the mouse button.
