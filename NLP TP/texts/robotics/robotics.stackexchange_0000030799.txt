Q:

How to add objects to a local household database?

Hi all,
I'm trying to add objects to the household database downloaded from willow garage.
However, i don't know how to add the objects to the database. The API documentation of household_objects_database mention a PLYModelLoader class, but i'm unable to find it in my ROS files.
My ROS version is cturtle 1.2.4 .
Any idea how to do this ?
Best regards,
Guido

A:

You should update to atleast Diamondback, and checkout the source file https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/stacks/object_manipulation/trunk/household_objects_database/src/mesh_loader.cpp
Try using this as a template to move forward.
