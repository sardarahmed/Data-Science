@gvdhoorn I must owe you a beer by now.  Sadly it dies but thank you.  I am still stuck on my bloody wheel issue

I see you've opened an issue there. Please include a link in a comment on your original question to keep issues connected.
Issue: mikepurvis/ros-install-osx#78.

A:

I had the same issue,  I used brew install poco.
Also I was able to get ROS to run on my Mac Sierra with the bare-bone packages installed.(ie. no graphing, visualization)
the tutorial is here: http://qiita.com/YoitsuKamijo/items/246683401e08d785a6ce
