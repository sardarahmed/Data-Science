Q:

tiled floor textures

Hello everybody,
I am trying to put some textures on the ground plane of my world file (I need features for the optical flow). I have a picture of the floor of the arena and I would like to use it as a texture. However, the picture itself is much smaller than the arena and setting the  attribute in the sdf file will stretch it, lowering the overall resolution.
What I would like to do is tiling the texture over all the floor. How can I do it?
Here my material script
material labrob/cobblestone { 
receive_shadows on  
technique   {
       pass 
       {    
        ambient 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 1.000000         
            emissive 0.000000 0.0000000 0.000000 1.000000
            lighting on         
            texture_unit        {       
          texture cobblestone.jpg       
           }    
       }    
   } 
}

Thank you very much
Andrea

A:

You could use scale inside your texture_unit to repeat the texture several times in the same area. The asphalt_plane is a good example, there the texture is repeated 10 times in each direction.
The scale should be [1 1] by default, a scale of [0.5 0.5] would repeat the texture twice in each direction and so on.
