Q:

Gazebo tag  didn't work

Hi all,
I am trying to apply force torque sensor plugin in a fixed joint in Gazebo. I am trying to use the tag
<disableFixedJointLumping>true</disableFixedJointLumping>

But It didn't work.

<gazebo reference="FT_Top_Joint_right">
  <provideFeedback>true</provideFeedback>
  <disableFixedJointLumping>true</disableFixedJointLumping>
</gazebo>

  
<gazebo reference="FT_Top_Joint_right">
      <provideFeedback>true</provideFeedback>
   <disableFixedJointLumping>true</disableFixedJointLumping>
</gazebo>

<joint name="FT_Top_Joint_right" type="fixed">
   <origin xyz="0.00085087 -0.00087515 -0.0030305" rpy="3.1416 5.017E-16 1.5708" />
  <parent link="FT_right" />
  <child link="FT_Top_Plate_right" />
  </joint>

[FATAL] [1483501801.768755712, 0.347000000]: gazebo_ros_ft_sensor plugin error: jointName: FT_Top_Joint_right does not exist

So I found that disableFixedJointLumping didn't work.
I know that the  "disableFixedJointLumping" option has been solved here osrf/sdformat/pull-requests/133/added-urdf-gazebo-extension-option-to/diff, but I still don't know how to update the urdf_parser.
I am using the OS: Ubuntu 14.04 ,   ROS version: indigo  ,    Gazebo version: 2.2

A:

The disableFixedJointLumping option was added in sdformat 2.0, while Gazebo 2 uses sdformat 1.x [1].
If you want to use the disableFixedJointLumping option, please use a more recent version of Gazebo as documented in http://gazebosim.org/tutorials/?tut=ros_wrapper_versions .
