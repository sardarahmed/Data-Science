Q:

How to mount a Kinect with my laptop without any AC Adapter

Hi team,
I would like to use Kinect without any AC Adapter. Turtlebot use use energy from roomba, but I would like to use other platform to navigate so I need to learn something similar to this image:

Notes,
I have seen it stated in a university tutorial that the kinect will operate reliably down to 8V,
This could alow regulated power from a 12v battery,
Haven't tried it myself.
The original turtlebot power gyro board uses a regulator with a enable pin to alow turning it off for charging

A:

Depending on what voltage battery you have I suggest getting a linear voltage regulator. You should not hook the power cable from the kinect directly to the battery, you will get variations in voltage which will break your kinect. This tutorial will show you how to wire up a voltage regulator for a kinect, make sure to buy a voltage regulator that will down convert from you battery voltage, and then connect the power side pigtail to your battery: Tutorial.
