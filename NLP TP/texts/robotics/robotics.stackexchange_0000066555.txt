Q:

Verify loop_rate

I have set a loop rate in the following way:
ros::Rate r(100)
while(ros::Ok()){
    ros::SpinOnce();
    function();
    r.sleep();
}

Is there anyway to verify if I am accomplish this rate or if the function is taking longer than that?
Thank you.

Hi!
If you publish a topic you can verify the loop rate with:
