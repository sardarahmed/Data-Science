Q:

I am getting error when trying to import a python file from another Catkin Workspace

Hi, All. I have a catkin workspace in eclipse and I am writing a Node. But, I need to import a python file from another catkin workspace which contains this file. But, when I try to import it, there is an error that there is no module named like that.
The exact error is like this -
File "src/Ish_odom_out_and_back.py", line 9, in 
from rbx1_nav.transform_utils import quat_to_angle, normalize_angle
ImportError: No module named rbx1_nav.transform_utils
For example,
My Catkin Workspace is like this - catkin_ws_ishan/src/ishan/ishan_nav/src/move.py. ishan_nav is the package name in my workspace.
The file that I want to import is in  - catkin_ws/src/rbx1/rbx1_nav/src/rbx1_nav/transform_utils.py. Here, rbx1_nav is the package. The file That I want to import is transform_utils.py
So, How do I import transform_utils.py from my program in Eclipse which is in another catkin workspace????
Can anybody please help me.
Thanks.

A:

You needed to source catkin_ws before you created catkin_ws_ishan, then source the dependent one.

So, Do I need to create the workspaces again?. Is there any other solution ??

You can delete the build/ and devel/ subtrees, source the other workspace, and rerun catkin_make.
