Q:

Generating PNG images from Kinect data

I'm a complete beginner at ROS and I am using a Turtlebot SDK. All I want to do is generate PNG images from my kinect depth and RGB data.
One way is to modify the code in image_view (which currently has provision to save a frame as JPG by right-clicking the mouse).
Is there a more direct way to do this? Or is there a provision already existing in ROS to do this?

A:

Hi rps2689,
In the same stack as image_view there is another node called image_saver that saves image files without needing to click anything.
This node saves images in jpg format, so if you need them to be in PNG I guess that the fastest way is to modify the filename definition in /PATH_TO_ROS_STACKS/image_pipeline/image_view/src/nodes/image_saver.cpp:
std::string filename = (g_format % g_count % "jpg").str();

for this other:
std::string filename = (g_format % g_count % "png").str();

Hope this helps.
