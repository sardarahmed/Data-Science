Q:

roslaunch error

I am trying to write a launch file which runs the nodes that are crated on a remote system named "turtlebot2" from my host computer "prasanna". When I run i get this error
This is my launch file:
<launch>
  <machine name="turtlebot2" address="10.0.10.28" ros-root="/opt/ros/electric/ros" ros-package-path="/opt/ros/electric/stacks" default="true" user="turtlebot2" password="turtlebot" >
  </machine>
  <node name="openni_tracker" pkg="openni_tracker" type="openni_tracker" respawn="true" output="screen" cwd="node" machine="turtlebot2"/>
</launch>

ERROR:
