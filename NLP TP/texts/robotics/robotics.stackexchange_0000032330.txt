Q:

How to suppress the annoying gmapping messages (related to laser scans)?

Whenever I launch gmapping (even without the option output="screen"), I still get the annoying messages, such as:

Registering Scans:Done

Laser Pose= 0.886656 -0.155651 2.77905

Registering Scans:Done

Laser Pose= 0.886656 -0.155651 2.77905

This is a bit annoying since it fills up the screen with that info. Does anyone know how to suppress these messages?

A:

They are direct printouts to stderr. You could redirect stderr, but the proper way would be to exchange the calls to ROS_INFO/ROS_DEBUG in the source.

printouts to stderr? Does this mean that these scans are erroneous? Why would gmapping output to stderr unless there is a problem?

I'd happily accept a patch that disables those prints or converts them to ROS_* macro calls (the latter would mean building gmapping itself against part of ROS, which is a little strange, but should work).

One informal unix convention (violated by rosconsole, unfortunately) is that stderr is for all logging and diagnostic information, not just errors, while stdout is only for actual "output", e.g., stuff that might potentially be piped to another program.
