Q:

gripper_action_controller configuration

Hello,
I'm using Hydro and I saw that  the ros_controllers package has a gripper controller. I have the wsg_50 gripper and I would like to use it with the gripper action controller but I don't know how to do it. My final idea is to integrate it with MoveIt. Someone could help me?
Thanks!

A:

The gripper_action_controller supports single-actuator position- or effort-controlled grippers. What you need to do to use this controller is to expose the actuated joint of your gripper to your robot hardware abstraction (hardware_interface::RobotHW). The joint should be registered to the hardware_interface::PositionJointInterface if it's position-controlled, or to the hardware_interface::EffortJointInterface if it's effort-controlled.
A high-level overview of the ros_control concepts, including how to expose joint resources to a RobotHW instance can be found in the ROSCON 2014 talk (slides, video).
If you have further, more specific questions, don't hesitate to come back.
