Q:

Kuka youBot melodic ros installation

I'm wondering if one can install Kuka youBot (i.e. the simulation part not the real hardware) in melodic ros. It seems there is no melodic-devel when I try to clone it from their github. When I try it  with kinetic-devel, I get this error
-- Using these message generators: gencpp;geneus;genlisp;gennodejs;genpy
-- Could NOT find brics_actuator (missing: brics_actuator_DIR)
-- Could not find the required component 'brics_actuator'. The following CMake error indicates that you either need to install the package with the same name or change your environment so that it can be found.
CMake Error at /opt/ros/melodic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:83 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "brics_actuator"
  with any of the following names:

    brics_actuatorConfig.cmake
    brics_actuator-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "brics_actuator" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "brics_actuator_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "brics_actuator" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.

I've cloned [mas-group/youbot_description][2] and [mas-group/youbot_simulation][1] in catkin_ws/src and run catkin_make. It seems the drivers need to be installed but they are for older ros versions. Any suggestions? OS is ubuntu 18.04 and melodic ROS, Gazebo 9.

A:

I've solved the problem by installing
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-brics-actuator
