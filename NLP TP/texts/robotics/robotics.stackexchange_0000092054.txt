Q:

How to update from Crystal to Dashing (OS X)?

Hey there-
I'm not able to find instructions on the wiki for performing updates between ROS2 versions on OS X. Can anyone point me in the right direction?
Thanks!
Nick

A:

There's not an "upgrade" specifically. You'll just want to install dashing. https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Dashing/
You can choose to remove and replace your crystal install, or install dashing in a parallel directory and use it there.
If you're looking for what's changed and tips for porting your code there's an overview here:
