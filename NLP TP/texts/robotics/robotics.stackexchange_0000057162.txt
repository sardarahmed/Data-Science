Q:

Knowrob: missing individuals

Dear all,
I correctly installed knowrob and knowrob tutorials. (No warning and errors!)
then when I try to execute the tutorial and specifically to query for the individuals of Drawers, I get:
?-register_ros_package(ias_semantic_map). 
true.

And
?- owl_has(A, rdf:type, knowrob:'Drawer').
false.

While I whould get
 ?- owl_has(A, rdf:type, knowrob:'Drawer').
 A = 'http://ias.cs.tum.edu/kb/knowrob.owl#Drawer1' ;
 A = 'http://ias.cs.tum.edu/kb/knowrob.owl#Drawer103' ;
 A = 'http://ias.cs.tum.edu/kb/knowrob.owl#Drawer109' ;
 true.

I installed Knowrob by source as suggested.
Thank you in advance, I think that @moritz can help me.
And when I run:
nearlab@Bazinga:~/Development/ros_workspace$ rosrun rosprolog rosprolog ias_semantic_map

A:

The output you have posted is much too short, none of the KnowRob files are loaded. Have you run rosmake knowrob and did this work without problems?
