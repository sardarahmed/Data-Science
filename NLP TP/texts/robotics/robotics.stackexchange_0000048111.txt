Q:

D-H table for youbot

I'm trying to do the forward kinematics for a KUKA youbot and am looking for a table of the D-H parameters (so that I can calculate the rotation matrices). Is there a way in Gazebo that will output the rotation matrices directly?
Can anyone point me to one (a table of a way to output the matrices)?
Thank you!
EDIT:
I'm aware of the tf and KDL libraries... the difference is that I'm trying to OUTPUT the matrices (so that I can study them)
Maybe via the urdf? is that possible?

A:

I'm not aware of a way to generate DH parameters directly from URDF.
You can however convert your robot the OpenRAVE format (see for example here on how to do that). Then, you can generate a table of DH parameters using OpenRAVE's GetDHParameters function.

Do you have any examples of how to use OpenRAVE? Specifically that GetDHParameters code?

Hi! i finally got the robot.dae and i cannot find an example about how to use the GetDHParameters function in order to get de dh parameters, do you have an example?, or do you have de dh parameters?

@jesus_hdez_b
Something like:
dh0, dh1, dh2, dh3, dh4 = planningutils.GetDHParameters(myRobot) 

What makes me wonder is the comment:
The coordinate systems computed from the DH parameters do not match the OpenRAVE link coordinate systems.
