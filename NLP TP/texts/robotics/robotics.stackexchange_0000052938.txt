Q:

How to install ROS on pcDuino ? (Lubuntu 12.04 ARM)

Hello,
Last week, I've purchased a pcDuino. It comes with Lubuntu v12.04. In order to download, compile, and install ROS; I'm following the documentation of Pandaboard from this link the Pandaboard source installation
However, when I try to install the remaining dependencies with the
 sudo rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro groovy -y

command.
It gives an error that says "Could Not Detect OS: tried windows,ubuntu,...." I don't know if it's because of the reason that pcDuino uses Lubuntu.
I've searched about this error but there is no certain answer that I've understood.
It would be appreciated if anybody can help me solve this problem or tell me just an easier way to install ROS on pcDuino?

A:

I'm not sure Lubuntu is already supported (as in: rosdep knows about it), but just to get you going: you can use the environment variable ROS_OS_OVERRIDE to force rosdep to use the rules for a particular OS. Just make sure you set it to the right value for your OS. See EnvironmentVariables#ROS_OS_OVERRIDE on the wiki for more information.

I will try that and get back to you. I suppose I should write ubuntu:12.04 correct?
