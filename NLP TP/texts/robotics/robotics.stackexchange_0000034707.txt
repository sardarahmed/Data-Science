Q:

Physics_ODE Install

Hello all,
I have recently discovered that ROS has a patched ode engine.  Installing electric ROS full, revealed the patched opende engine (with the parrallel_step) library.  First I wanted to thank the programmers for this awesome patch.
I am interested in using this package outside of ROS, and it seems that the libraries are very similar if not the same as the ode packages.  Also from the documentation page, I garner that the library can be used apart from ROS.  My goal is to use this ode engine with OpenRAVE in the OpenRAVE environment (I know there is a way to use OpenRAVE in ROS, but I am still learning about that.)  So my question:
I have linked the includes, and the ode-config bin to my /usr.  (I also rebuilt the library because the ode-config bin gave out wrong --cflags and --libs).  Does anyone know if this is enough?  Does anyone have experience with what I am attempting?  Thank you so much!
Constantin

A:

That's the right sort of approach.  You could also consider installing the library so your paths end up cleaner. All the source for how it is compiled is in the physics_ode stack source
