Q:

How do I file tickets with Trac on code.ros.org?

I would like to know how to file tickets with ROS Trac. My issue is that I don't know how to sign up for an account. I went to ROS code site, and it tells me to go to the ROS Tickets Wiki which tells me to go back to ROS code, which quickly becomes circular. I have an account for editing wiki pages for ros.org and (obviously) for ROS Answers, but when I try to use either of those logins for ROS Trac I am not successful. Is there a page where I can sign up for Trac? Thanks!

A:

If I recall correctly, register on https://code.ros.org/gf/ (see link at top right). That registration will then be propagated to any Trac instance managed by gForge (including ros, ros-pkg, wg-ros-pkg, etc).

That's it. Not sure why I didn't see it. Thanks.
