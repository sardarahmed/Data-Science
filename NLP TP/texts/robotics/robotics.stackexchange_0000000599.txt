Q:

Who coined (or popularized) the term "SLAM"?

According to Wikipedia's article on SLAM, the original idea came from Randal Smith and Peter Cheeseman (On the Estimation and Representation of Spatial Uncertainty [PDF]) in 1986, and was refined by Hugh F. Durrant-Whyte and J.J. Leonard (Simultaneous map building and localization for an autonomous mobile robot) in 1991.
However, neither paper uses the term "SLAM".  Where (and when) did that term come from?  Was there a particular author or whitepaper that popularized it?

A:

According to this SLAM tutorial, 

The structure of the SLAM problem, the convergence result and the
  coining of the acronym ‘SLAM’ was ﬁrst presented in a mobile robotics survey 
  paper presented at the 1995 International Sym- posium on
  Robotics Research.
