Q:

gazebo_ros_controller_manager plugin terminates

while launching current shadow robot hand in Gazebo,
there is an error:
[ INFO] [1427997617.853023607, 0.752000000]: starting gazebo_ros_controller_manager plugin in ns: /
pure virtual method called
terminate called without an active exception
Gazebo simulator freezes.
If I launch other robots, there is not error with gazebo_ros_controller_manager.
Is it because of the empty namespace?
