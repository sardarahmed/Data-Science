Q:

What is the need to set the environmental variable HUSKY_GAZEBO_DESCRIPTION?

I was going through the husky_gazebo wiki page.
The second step is this -
$ export HUSKY_GAZEBO_DESCRIPTION=$(rospack find husky_gazebo)/urdf/description.gazebo.xacro

Simply, launching the husky_gazebo simulation using roslaunch works fine -
$ roslaunch husky_gazebo husky_empty_world.launch

Why do we need the second step? Also, do we need to run that step every time before launching the husky_gazebo using roslaunch (third step)?

Hi @skpro19,
The HUSKY_GAZEBO_DESCRIPTION as I see was an old variable to store the location of the Huyky description in old ROS versions of the package. Since the package is now fully integrated with catkin there is no need to set/use that environmental variable since the launch file is already calling the find directive. Maybe the tutorial is a bit obsolete and does not align with the new changes performed in new ROS distributions. But when I checked the package I was unable to find any chunk of code in which that particular environmental variable is used. So I would say that it has any usage now.
Regards.
