Q:

rosnode list for not active nodes

Hi,
I'm creating something like an IDE for ROS. Is it possible to get a list of all available nodes. Something like 'rosnode list' but for the not yet started nodes.
I think 'rosrun TAB TAB ' displays them, but this needs manual input of the TAB-key. Maybe there is a way to use the autocompletion-feature in a shellscript.
Thanks for the help!

A:

You could probably use the completion to make a rospack list-nodes or similar.
Maybe the output of rospack list (only packages) can help you.

Well I guess rospack list-names will do it at the moment. Thank you very much.

Groovy bash completion uses  catkin_find --without-underlays --libexec  to determine the dir for executables of package PKG.
