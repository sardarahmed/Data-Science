Q:

RViz won't refresh my TF tree

If I roslaunch something that broadcasts a TF, then launch RViz, I can visualize the TF in RViz. However, if I then restart the launch file, the new TF is not picked up. I need to also restart RViz to get the new TF.

A:

You need to restart RViz whenever you start a new roscore. RViz looks for a roscore upon startup. After that time, the roscore remains fixed.
This means that if you are using a launch file to launch everything, including the ROS Master, then whenever you relaunch the file you will also need to relaunch RViz. A better way to use RViz is to launch your roscore and RViz separately. Then you can keep them both open for the duration of your session.
