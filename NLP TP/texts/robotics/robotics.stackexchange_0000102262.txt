Q:

base_link not moving while replaying rosbag file in RViz

I recorded a rosbag file with the following topics:
/ssl_slam/trajectory;
/tf;
/odom;
/initialpose;
/move_base_simple/goal;
/tf_static;
My goal is to replay the rosbag file in RViz and see the "map" axes, "base_link" axes, and green trajectory path drawn. Currently I am able to see only the map link axes and green trajectory path; the base_link axes do not move when I select them to be shown under "TF >> Frames". The base_link axes slowly fade away and leave only map axes and the green trajectory. How do I visualize the base_link axes so that they show how the robot actually moved while recording the rosbag file (want to see rotation and translation of the base_link axes).

A:

The base_link TF messages are time-stamped, so you need to make your setup repeat those prior timestamps when visualizing the data.

You tell rosbag to publish to the /clock topic by specifying the --clock option.
You also need to tell rviz to use the /clock topic. You do this by making sure the ros parameter /use_sim_time is set to true before the rviz node is started.
