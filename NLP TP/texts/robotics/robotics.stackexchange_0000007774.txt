Q:

Modeling a robot to find its position

The task of the robot is as follows.
My robot should catch another robot in the arena, which is trying to escape. The exact position of that robot is sent to my robot at 5Hz. Other than that I can use sonsor to identify that robot.
Is that possible to estimate the next position of other robot using a mathematical model. If so, can anyone recommend tutorials or books to refer..?

A:

Assuming a constant update of 5Hz, your sample time is (1/5) = 0.2s. 
Get one position of the target, p1. 
Get a second position of the target, p2. 
Target speed is the difference in position divided by difference in time:
$$
v = (p_2 - p_1)/dT \\
v = (p_2 - p_1)/0.2
$$
Now predict where they will be in the future, where future is $x$ seconds from now:
$$
p_{\mbox{future}} = p_2 + v*x
$$
where again, $p_2$ is the current point of the target, $v$ is the target's calculated speed, and $x$ is how far in the future you want to predict, in seconds.
You can do a number of things from here such as filtering a number of samples in the past, you could try curve fitting, etc., but this is a simple method of predicting future location based on known position updates. 
If you knew more about the path or potential paths your target could take you could optimize the prediction or provide a series of cases, but assuming relatively linear motion this model should hold.
