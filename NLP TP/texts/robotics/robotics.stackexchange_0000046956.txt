Q:

Roslaunch XML boolean operators

I am currently using a conditional line in a roslaunch file as shown below:
<arg name="cond1" value="true"/>
<node pkg="PKG" type="TYPE" name="NAME" unless="$(arg cond1)">
...

However I wish to have this node not load if EITHER cond1 or cond2 is set.  No combination of
<arg name="cond2" value="false"/>
unless="$(arg cond1 or cond2)"
unless="$(arg cond1) or $(arg cond2)"

seems to work, returning the error:
$(arg var) may only specify one arg 

How do I use boolean operators (AND or OR) in the roslaunch XML syntax?
Many thanks

A:

I think the only way to do that is construct another arg that represents the condition you want using the unless/if attribute to create it.
