A:

rosed starts the default editor for your system. You can find out what editor that is by invoking:
$ echo $EDITOR

That is probably vim for you, but maybe it could be emacs or something else. If the result of that call is empty, then on Ubuntu that means vim will be used.
You can google online for how to use that editor, or change the variable in your .bashrc to point to an editor that you prefer (e.g. nano is more self-explaining to novice linux users).
EDIT, with vim, press the Escape button, then write
:wq

The editor should (w)rite and (q)uit then.
