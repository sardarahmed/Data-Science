Q:

the tf between /map and /odom is not static?

Hello everybody! This is a map in RVIZ.
With the robot moving, the tf between /map and /odom is changing. And the tf change is not a gradual process, its change have an interval. In my opinion, the tf betweeen /map and /odom should be static. But it is not. Why? What's the difference between /odom and /map?

Thank you for your attention!

A:

You are seeing the correct behavior. You can take a look at the REP for Coordinate Frames for more information about the frame conventions.
In a nutshell, the odom frame contains the pose of the robot in the world as reported by some odometry sensor. The odom pose is continuous; however, due to errors in odometry, it accumulates error over time.
To correct for the drift of odometric sensors, packages such as slam_gmapping introduce a transform between map --> odom. This transform is the correction that has been computed, based on sensor input such as laser scanners. It is not continuous (it can jump at various time intervals) because slam_gmapping usually computes corrections at a lower frequency.
If you have a perfect odometry sensor and a "perfect" laser, the map --> odom tf will always be 0.

Why gmapping move odom frame can correct the drift of odometric sensors? How to say correct? Thank you~
