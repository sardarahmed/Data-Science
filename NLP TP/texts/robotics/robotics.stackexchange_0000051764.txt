Q:

Raspberry Pi CSI Camera Driver/Support

I am thinking on buying one of the just-released Pi Cameras, a camera that seems to communicate with a Raspberry Pi module through CSI (Camera Serial Interface).
Is there support for the CSI cameras somewhere in ROS already?
Thanks!

A:

I can't find any modules for it.
But the camera code is available so it could be put in a node.
Another option would be to create a mjpg stream as described here. And modify the Axis camera node to work with a non Axis mjpg stream.

Those references will surely be a good place to start. I just bought one and will get my hands on it soon, I might give this development a try. Thanks.
