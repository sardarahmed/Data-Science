Q:

URDF Transmissions

Hi
I have a question about using the  tag in the URDF file. Link: URDF Transmissions
What is your purpose? Should I use it in the URDF file of my real robot? Or should I use it for simulation with Gazebo only
I'm using ROS Kinetics
thanks

A:

Transmission in the field of robotics consists of gear trains, actuators and shafts coupled with the robot links. This allows the transmission to have a desired control of the robot links.  Based on the existing motors and the gear trains we will be able to define the resulting link motion.
You can follow this link for the description on transmission. Transmission can be used in real robot as well as in gazebo. For gazebo, currently, there is only simple transmission available. Hopefully in future, we have it for differential transmission (example: PR2 wrist) as well.
Hope this helps!
