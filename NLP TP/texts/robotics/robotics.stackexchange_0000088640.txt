Q:

can we assign value to the request variable of srv file other then run time?

with an example,
AddTwoInts.srv
int64 a
int64 b

int64 sum
client.cpp
srv.request.a =atoll(argv[1]);
srv. request.b =atoll(argv[2]);
/* which takes the value during run time */
can I assign the value of a and b during writing of the code? pre assign of the value to the variable ?

A:

Yes. Like any other variable, you can assign any value to the service request parameters. (could come from user input, a file, or just a pre-assigned value).
