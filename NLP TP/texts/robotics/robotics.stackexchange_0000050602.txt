Q:

octomap to a 2d map

from ros.org, it said "octomap_server loads a 3D map (as Octree-based OctoMap) and distributes it to other nodes in a compact binary format". so how can i convert those binary format to a real 2d pmg format map.

A:

While not documented anywhere, I have an octo_to_2d utility in the map_tools package of my sandbox repository. This will take a COLOR octomap in .ot format, take a slice at a specified height, and publish an appropriate map. You can then use map_saver to save the map. The source code is pretty self documenting as far as parameters and topics.

The octomap_server should be able to do that out of the box (not sure about color octomaps).
