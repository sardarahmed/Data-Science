Q:

simulated turtlebot mapping itself

Hi,
I am trying to simulate a turtlebot gmapping with gazebo, a la this tutorial
http://mirror.umd.edu/roswiki/turtlebot_simulator%282f%29Tutorials%282f%29Building%2820%29a%2820%29Map%2820%29in%2820%29TurtleBot%2820%29Simulator.html
My issue is that although I have gmapping up and running, I can't get anything close to an accurate map because the laserscan appears to be picking up the bot itself. it places an object where the robot was, and then fails to localize due to the object no longer being there once the bot moves.
Is there any way that I can exempt the robot from the scan?

Will you please post a bag file? I'd like to have a look at this situation... Record the tf, scan, odom, imu topics.

Please post the image of the map in rviz so that i could analyse the issue.

I don't know how to post a bag file, but I will if you tell me how.

Here is a screenshot of rviz.

As you can see, the room is well mapped, but the robot has left little bits of wall along the path that I drove it. For now it is localized properly, but the more I drive, the more likely these artifacts are to mess with localization.

also, note that the little green boxes that represent an object being picked up by the laserscan are also lighting up around the base of the robot. After close analysis the scan appears to be picking up on the four support bars in the robot model

A:

One common solution to this problem is to filter out scans that are less than some minimum distance from the sensor.

Do you know of any good method of doing this? I can't seem to find a parameter or file to change to create this filter.
