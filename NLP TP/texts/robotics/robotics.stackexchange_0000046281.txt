Q:

rosmake openni_camera gives an error

Hi,
i had to reinstall my system. Before, i made a backup of my ros workspace.
After installing ros, i tried my old launch files and they don't work. I solved some errors already.
But, if i try to build openni_camera with "rosmake openni_camera" i get an error:
 
 make[2]: execvp: cfg/OpenNIUnstable.cfg: Permission denied 
  make[2]: *** [cfg/cpp/openni_camera/OpenNIUnstableConfig.h] Error 127
  make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/ROSBUILD_gencfg_cpp.dir/all] Error 2

Can somebody gives me a hint to solve this problem?

A:

Thanks for the fast answer. But the problem was the follow:
I had an old openni_camera stack as backup in my workspace, because I changed there something. And now ROS tried to compile the older version from my workspace. So, I moved it away from my workspace an I am using the actual openni_camera stack now. And it works fine ;)
