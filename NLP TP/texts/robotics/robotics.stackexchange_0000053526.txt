Q:

Error while rosmake ethzasl_icp_mapper

Hi,
I downloaded the ethzasl_icp_mapping from ROS,
git clone https://github.com/ethz-asl/ethzasl_icp_mapping.git
rosdep install ethzasl_icp_mapping, it showed an error that map_msgs was missing. I get the package and then rosdep did not show any errors.
rosmake ethzasl_icp_mapper is giving the errors below.
{-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mkdir -p build
cd build && cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-fPIC" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=.. -DPYTHON_CUSTOM_TARGET=src ../upstream_src
CMake Error: The source directory "/home/sai/fuerte_workspace/ethzasl_icp_mapping/libnabo/upstream_src" does not appear to contain CMakeLists.txt.
Specify --help for usage, or press the help button on the CMake GUI.
Also the folder /home/sai/fuerte_workspace/ethzasl_icp_mapping/libnabo/upstream_src is empty.
Please let me know what can be done.
Thanks ,
Sai

A:

Thanks to Pomerleau, Francois for his reply on GitHub
please have a look at the node documentation on ROS:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/ethzasl_icp_mapping under the section Installation.
The dependency to map_msgs is also written there.
There are subdirectories from external git repositories to fetch. This is
why you need to use the flag --recursive. The command to clone is:
$ git clone --recursive git://github.com/ethz-asl/ethzasl_icp_mapping.git
