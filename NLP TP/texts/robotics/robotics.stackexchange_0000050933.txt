Q:

rosbridge_websocket.launch on fuerte

I tried following this tutorial, but rosbridge_websocket.launch doesn't seem to exist, at least not on fuerte.
Is there another way to get things going in fuerte?

A:

Looks like the documentation on the Wiki is for Groovy.  Try this instead for Fuerte:
$ roslaunch rosbridge_launch full.launch

This launch file also launches a web server (roswww) so you can test rosbridge in your web browser on port 8000.  (You will probably see a warning when running the full.launch file that permission is denied for running the webserver on port 80 so it runs it on port 8000 instead.)

I've tried that out, and it works like you said (including the warning). Thanks much for the help.
