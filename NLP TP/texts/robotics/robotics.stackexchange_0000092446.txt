Q:

Could not load Joint_state_controller because the type was not specified error while roslaunch

Hello,
I have been trying to launch a robot on a world in gazebo 9 using roslaunch. While doing so I have been facing the following error and can not understand the reason behind it.
[ERROR] [1562704670.507021295, 1.372000000]: Could not load controller 'Joint_state_controller' because the type was 
not specified. Did you load the controller configuration on the parameter server (namespace: 
'/spider/Joint_state_controller')?
[ERROR] [1562704671.508187, 2.241000]: Failed to load Joint_state_controller

Here is my control launch file,
 <launch>

 <!-- Load joint controller configurations from YAML file to parameter server -->
 <rosparam file="$(find spider_control)/config/spider_control.yaml" command="load"/>

 <!-- load the controllers -->

I am using ros-melodic with gazebo9. Can anyone please help me in finding the reason behind this error. Thank you.

A:

I am sorry, the answer was simple, I kind of made a typo when loading the joint_state_controller in my control launch file. Instead of joint_state_controller, i wrote Joint_state_controller and that typo has caused the error.
