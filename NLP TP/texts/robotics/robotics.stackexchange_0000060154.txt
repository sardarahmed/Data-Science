Q:

How to subscribe hark_msgs types

i am using ROS Hydro in ubuntu 12.04. and I want to create a subscriber of hark_msgs. whenever I run a simple publisher designed in HARK from batchflow, I am able to view the messages in the terminal (using rostopic echo). When I am trying to  create a subscriber ,I get this message:
Could not find a configuration file for package hark_msgs.

Set hark_msgs_DIR to the directory containing a CMake configuration file
for hark_msgs.  The file will have one of the following names:

hark_msgsConfig.cmake
hark_msgs-config.cmake

(whenever I include hark_msgs in the dependencies, I get the above error.)
I found the folder where hark_msg related (.msg) files are but .cmake files are no where to be seen. Any help would be appreciated.
