Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: gtest for ROS2

Is there a guide similar to this one that I think it is for ROS that explain how to start writing and using gtest for ROS2 applications?
Also, does calling colcon test run the gtest tests?

can you point me where to find that guide?

A:

Hi,
I can't give you a guide  but I can give you examples

https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/tree/master/nav2_system_tests
https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/tree/master/nav2_recoveries/test
https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/tree/master/nav2_costmap_2d
https://github.com/SteveMacenski/slam_toolbox/tree/eloquent-devel/test

Really it mostly looks like gtest, just using ROS as if it were any other arbitrary library.
