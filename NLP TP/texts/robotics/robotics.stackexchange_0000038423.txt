Q:

Is rosdoc exist in electric?

I found when I run rosdoc, it shows:
 sam@sam:~/code/ros/topic/basic_topic$ rosdoc
 rosdoc: command not found
 sam@sam:~/code/ros/topic/basic_topic$

Should I install rosdoc from source?
Thank you~

A:

I'm on diamondback, and there I usually run rosdoc with rosrun rosdoc rosdoc, since rosdoc itself is not in the path the way rosmake etc. is. I hope this applies for electric as well.

It does.

You also need to install the "documentation" stack, e.g. "sudo apt-get install ros-electric-documentation"
