Q:

Failed to load joint-controller

Hi!
Cannot load my new controller to gazebo model.
RXCONSOLE shows this message:
Node: /gazebo
Time: 189.929000000
Severity: Error
Location: /home/robot/peter_workspace/sandbox/controller/src/robocv_controller_file.cpp:MyControllerClass::init:16
Published Topics: /rosout, /tf, /gazebo/paused, /clock, /gazebo/link_states, /gazebo/model_states, /gazebo/parameter_descriptions, /gazebo/parameter_updates,  /joint_states, /mechanism_statistics

No joint given in namespace: '/velocity_controller')

For some reason it refers to location: Location: /home/robot/peter_workspace/sandbox/controller/src/robocv_controller_file.cpp:MyControllerClass::init:16
which is the source file for another controller/
ROSPACK shows that both plugins are registered.
What can be wrong?
