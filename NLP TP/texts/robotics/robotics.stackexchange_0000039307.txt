Q:

ROS fuerte ros/package.h not found

I'm trying out the ROS fuerte beta release, and in one of my packages the file <ros/package.h> is included, which it now refuses to find
fatal error: ros/package.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.
What dependency (ros/system) do I have to add to successfully compile my program?

A:

roslib contains the relevant file, though you're technically using an internal API and your code has a high chance of breaking in the future.
Also, in Fuerte, all of the include files for core libraries end up in the same hierarchy (opt/ros/fuerte/include), so almost any dependency should have given you the include path that you need.
