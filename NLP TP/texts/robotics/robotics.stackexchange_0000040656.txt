Q:

android_tutorial_hokuyo dependency not satisfied

Dear All,
My android_core build fails due to a dependency problem, and I tired everything that I thought might help but unfortunately didn't solve my problem, here is the output of my ./gradlew debug:
:android_tutorial_hokuyo:deployLibs

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Could not resolve all dependencies for configuration ':android_tutorial_hokuyo:compile'.
> Could not find group:ros.google, module:hokuyo, version:0.0.0-SNAPSHOT.
  Required by:
      ros.android_core:android_tutorial_hokuyo:0.0.0-SNAPSHOT

* Try:
Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace. Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.

BUILD FAILED

I appreciate any help that might solve the problem.
Thank you.

A:

You should build google first.
roscd google
./gradlew install
This should fix it.
And then you will probably get the ant errors again but you know what to do with them.
