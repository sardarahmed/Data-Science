Hi, a couple of questions first. Where you able to run the simulator successfully? What topics do you get when you run rostopic list?
tum_simulator replicates the topics created by ardrone_autonomy to match the ardrone_driver node. Let me know so we can go on.

thank you pedro
my response to your two questions is in the   answer below

I don't see in your answer the topic /ardrone/navdata, /ardrone/takeoff, /ardrone/land, and /cmd_vel. Can you confirm if you see them and forgot to include them?

you saw right , they don't exist

What kind of error do you get? Is gazebo gui launched at all? did you install the ardrone_autonomy and tum_simulator from the fuerte branch?

i install the ardrone_autonomy and the tum_simulator , gazebo does work but when i try the take off command listed in the wiki nothing happend

Right, you need to publish to the topics that I mentioned and you don't seem to have in order to make the ardrone move. Try reinstalling the ardrone_autonomy and tum_simulator packages. When you clone them from the git repository make sure you select the fuerte branch

how do i select fuerte branch ??
Comment by slowmed on 2014-12-06:
still nothing pedro ?
Comment by Pedro_85 on 2014-12-07:
You can clone a particular branch from the git repository by using the flag -b <name_of_the_branch>. So it would be: git clone https://github.com/AutonomyLab/ardrone_autonomy.git -b fuerte. With tum_simulator: git clone https://github.com/tum-vision/tum_simulator.git -b fuerte

A:

You can fly with joystick or simply (it is very uncomfortable ) by publishing to topic.
Check section 3.3

actually the command line doesn't work , i tried all the commands listed in the section 3.3 they don't work , and what i want really is to move the drone in the simulator  using  the python programs in the autonavx_ardrone  file
