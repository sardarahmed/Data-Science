Q:

can the ros navigation stack be used without laser scanner

Hello,
I have a simple ros robot, which has odometry, an imu, and robot_pose_ekf, and I am getting almost correct trajectories in rviz. I also wrote a simple python program that gets the current heading and makes the robot move in desired direction for a given distance.
Instead of laser scanner I would like to use a top to down looking camera, and with an aruco marker on the robot, I think I will be able to determine its exact position.
Is there any way I can use the navigation stack, so I can navigate the robot into a desired goalpoint, (like within a constrained environment like a 2x2m box, with no obstacles, and the aruco system giving x,y of the robot visually)
Best Regards.
C.A.

A:

Assuming your Aruco system + odometry/ekf can give a globally accurate localization, possibly - since it is really a full replacement for AMCL at that point. Since you have no obstacle sensors, you're really just using the planners from the navigation stack. You'll need to either create a map image or write a ROS node to publish your fixed map.
One note - you'll need to make sure that your EKF/camera system gives a heading (in addition to x,y).
