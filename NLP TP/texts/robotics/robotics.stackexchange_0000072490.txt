Q:

How to print values in SelfLocalizer.cpp in Nav2d

I'm trying to analyse the Algorithms in SelfLocalizer node which is Particle Filter, Beam range finder, and Field range finder model. I understand the theory behind it but I want to see what is coming out in some of the equations.
I have tried to add std::cout << "TEST" << std::endl; , printf ("%s \n", "TEST");   and ROS_INFO("usage: add_two_ints_client X Y"); in the code, then make the project and then run one of  the launch file. I can see a lot of messages and parameters are printet in Terminal, but not the the one that I was expecting. Can anyone help me with that, or how can I read the value of a specific equation ?

A:

To be able to print messages on terminal, in launch file you should add output="screen" to the relevant <node> tag.
Also you can view ROS_INFO messages on rqt_console.
In reply to OP's comment:
It should be like this:
<node name="SelfLocalizer" pkg="nav2d_localizer" type="localizer" output="screen">
  <remap from="scan" to="base_scan"/>
  <param name="min_particles" type="int" value="5000"/>
</node>

Thanks but it  does not work if it should be like this in launch file:
<node name="SelfLocalizer" pkg="nav2d_localizer" type="localizer">
<remap from="scan" to="base_scan"/>
 <param name="min_particles" type="int" value="5000"/>
output="screen" </node>
