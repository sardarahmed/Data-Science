Q:

rgbdslam on fuerte

Good Morning,
I'm kind of new with ROS, and I'm trying to compile rgbdslam  on my ROS fuerte following this guide:
here's the link
While running "rosdep install rgbdslam_freiburg" I get an error telling me "missing resource rgbdslam".
I read somewhere that rgbdslam is still not supported on fuerte and I was wondering if there is any solution to this...can someone help me? Or can someone tell me when fuerte will be supported?

I'm guessing you skipped a step somewhere, e.g. not working in a directory in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. Could you edit your answer to include more detail of what you exactly did.

A:

It seems that octomap_server can not be resolved automatically by rosdep install. To manually install octomap_server execute the following command: sudo apt-get install ros-DISTRO-octomap-mapping (where DISTRO is your ROS distribution, i.e. fuerte). After octomap is installed, run rosdep install again to resolve the other dependencies.

Unfortunately, there seems to be no rule for ros-fuerte-octomap-mapping, to make it rosdep-able
