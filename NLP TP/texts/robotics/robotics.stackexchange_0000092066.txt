Q:

How to use Baxter in simulation with Rviz and moveit?

I have come across the following tutorials of Baxter.
Baxter Simulator
Baxter with Moveit
However, what I need is a tutorial that will enable me to work with Baxter in simulation as we can do with PR2 in Rviz. I need a launch file that will launch the Baxter Robot in Rviz. We have that for PR2 in this.
This Baxter simulator tutorial is with Gazebo, I want to perform the same tasks in Baxter with Rviz that I did with PR2.
Could anyone share a launch file and an example python code?

A:

The tutorial you are looking for is this one for using Baxter with MoveIt. Follow the simulation tutorial to get Baxter going in Gazebo, then follow the above tutorial, starting from where it says "In another RSDK terminal session, Launch the rviz MoveIt! plugin".
In general, any MoveIt-enabled robot will have a package called something like baxter_moveit_config. This package will contain launch files for starting the MoveIt interfaces, the rviz-based GUI tool, etc.

You also need to put the baxter_moveit_config package in your src folder

@Geoff I am having another issue, the planner is neither working in Rviz if I just drag the interactive marker and then plan nor if I run this tutorial. It keeps failing when I drag the marker in Rviz and then plan and when I run the tutorial code, it keeps saying no motion plan found.

Please ask a new question for that.

You also need to run these two commands in two separate terminals from this
rosrun baxter_tools enable_robot.py -e
rosrun baxter_interface joint_trajectory_action_server.py
