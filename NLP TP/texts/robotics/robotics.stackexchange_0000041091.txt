Q:

find ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

my system is ubuntu11.10,installed with ROS( electric) and openni_kinect.
I want to use the mit kinect demo,then I fellow the guide from http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni/Contests/ROS%203D/Customizable%20Buttons
1.I first perform the General Installation.
2.environment is setup, run:
"rosmake impromptu_buttons"
then, terminal display that:
[ rosmake ] Packages requested are: ['impromptu_buttons']
[ rosmake ] Logging to directory/home/jung/.ros/rosmake/rosmake_output-20120604-205316
[ rosmake ] Expanded args ['impromptu_buttons'] to: []
[ rosmake ] WARNING: The following args could not be parsed as stacks or packages: ['impromptu_buttons']
[ rosmake ] ERROR: No arguments could be parsed into valid package or stack names.
It seems rosmake is unable to find the package.
I should add the path to my ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.
How I add the path?

This is identical to your previous question - you should close one or the other. Also, you might want to indicate what you've tried to do on your own to figure this out. Did you read the documentation I linked to in your previous question? What didn't make sense?

A:

If you were following this tutorial, just put all ros packages in the directory ~/ros_workspace.
However, I recommend using rosws. It provides a more structured way to manage local checkouts of ROS repositories and the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.
