Q:

How do I recover ros root setup.bash?

Hello,
I accidentally deleted the setup.bash and all other root files from "/opt/ros/noetic/".
Is there any way to recover that without reinstalling the ROS?

A:

(I'm sssuming you've installed ROS using apt here)
This seems similar to #q257332, and you could use a similar approach to figure out which package provides those files (or any file really):
dpkg -S /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash

which returns this for me:
ros-noetic-catkin: /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash

you can then reinstall that using:
sudo apt install --reinstall ros-noetic-catkin

Thank you.
This approach correctly restores the files. However, once I didn't have the file anymore, figuring out that it comes from ros-noetic-catkin is not possible without your suggestion. Does it have another method (website or similar) to verified this?

It's a generated file, so I don't believe you would be able to find it anywhere necessarily.
