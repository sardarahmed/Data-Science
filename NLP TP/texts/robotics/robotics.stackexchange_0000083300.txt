Q:

Transform from odom_frame to world_frame

I want to create a dense 3d model of an indoor, gps-denied, scene traversed by a MAV. The map produces its own odometry, which is good enough for navigation but not precise enough for 3d reconstruction. I can extract, out of the images taken by the MAV, precise poses with openmvg, but I'd like to make use of the odometry poses estimated by the MAV. OpenMVG allows the introduction of prior poses to its methods (see here), but they need to be included in the EXIF data of the images in form of GPS coordinates.
So I need to convert coordinates in the odom_frame to coordinates in the world_frame. I could also provide the actual GPS coordinates of the first pose, so that I could place the scene in the world, but that's not important.
I've been searching in ROS documentation and all the transformations I've found seem to be from world_frame to odom_frame, but this task looks like quite simple, so I guess there must be some ROS module which does the job.
What should I do in order to express odom_frame coordinates in world_frame coordinates?

A:

The transform from odom to world is the inverse of the transform from world to odom if you have one you have the other. I'd recommend reading through the tf2 tutorials which can help you learn about working with transforms and coordinate frames.
