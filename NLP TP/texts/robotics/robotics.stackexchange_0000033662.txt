Q:

Couldn't find source file src/talker.cpp(Tutorials\WritingPublisherSubscriber(c++))

I follow the tutorial--Writing a Simple Publisher and Subscriber (C++),when I run make, the console show error(I've added the ros_workspace to my ROS_PACKAGE_PATH):
mkdir -p bin
cd build && cmake -Wdev -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=`rospack find rosbuild`/rostoolchain.cmake  ..
[rosbuild] Building package beginner_turorials
[rosbuild] Including /opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/ros_comm/clients/roslisp/cmake/roslisp.cmake
[rosbuild] Including /opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/ros_comm/clients/rospy/cmake/rospy.cmake
[rosbuild] Including /opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/ros_comm/clients/cpp/roscpp/cmake/roscpp.cmake
[rosbuild] Couldn't find source file src/talker.cpp; assuming that it is in /home/duxiaoshi/ros_workspace/beginner_turorials and will be generated later
-- Configuring done
CMake Error at /opt/ros/diamondback/ros/core/rosbuild/public.cmake:471 (add_executable):
  Cannot find source file "talker.cpp".  Tried extensions .c .C .c++ .cc .cpp
  .cxx .m .M .mm .h .hh .h++ .hm .hpp .hxx .in .txx
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  CMakeLists.txt:31 (rosbuild_add_executable)

I've added the ros_workspace to my ROS_PACKAGE_PATH,why  src/talker.cpp still couldn't be found?
