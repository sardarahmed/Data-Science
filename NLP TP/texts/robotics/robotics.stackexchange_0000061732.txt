Q:

Conversion Position to float

I got in a variable Position (which I get from transform.getOrigin) and I want to convert it in a pair of float.
How can I do that?
I'm in Hydro, Ubuntu 12.04 and programming in c++

Should we guess which programm language you use? I will never understand why people ask questions with that minimal amount of information.

How is this supposed to work? The origin has 3 degrees of freedom and you want to somehow store them in 2 floats?

You could also use the C++ way of casting: float posf = static_cast<float>(position);
