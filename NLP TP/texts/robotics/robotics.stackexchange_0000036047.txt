Q:

ROS application chooser keeps giving me error "The parameters on the server are not set"

Hi all, I've just downloaded the ROS application chooser. Then I ran roscore on my turtlebot and entered the master_uri into the ROS application chooser. But I have the following error when I try to connect to the uri:

Cannot contact ROS master: the
parameters on the server are not set.
Please set robot/name and robot/type

Is there a way to set those parameters? I couldn't set it in the app.
Thanks in advance!

A:

You can set parameter against roscore on turtlebot
rosparam set robot/name pr1012
rosparam set robot/type pr2 

robot/type must be either pr2 or turtlebot, and you can use arbitrarily word for robot/name
