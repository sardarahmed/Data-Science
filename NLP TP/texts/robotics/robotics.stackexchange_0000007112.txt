Q:

What is the RobotC type for motors?

I'm trying to create a function that allows me to more easily start a motor, but I'm running into a problem, I don't know the type to use for the motorName argument. I'm using a VEX 269 Motor. Here's the function.
void runMotor(MotorTypeHere motorName, int speed, int time)
{
  startMotor(motorName, speed);
  wait(time);
}

I just don't know what type to put for the motorName argument. What type would it be?

A:

Looking at some of the docs I see that the startMotor function usually takes values like portN as in:
startMotor(port8,-32);
startMotor(port9,128);

and I am also seeing that some code looks like this:
motor[port8] = -32;
motor[port9] = 128;

so that tells me that since it is an index into an array it must be just simply an int.
Update:
I can see on this page that within VEX it is actually a variable of type tMotor. But it can't work as an index in C unless tMotor is an alias for some sort of int. Ultimately, the best choice would be to use tMotor in your code.
