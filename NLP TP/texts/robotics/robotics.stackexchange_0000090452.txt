Q:

Building ROS navigation from source

Hello all,
I am trying to use parts of the navigation package on my robot. I need to make some changes to the existing local planner and hence would like to build the package from source. I am quite new to this and was wondering if there are any instructions to do that? I am using ROS indigo on Ubuntu 14.04.
I have all my config files, launch files setup as instructed in the ros tutorial. I have mapping and localization set up as well. I have downloaded the whole package from the github repository and used catkin_make to build it successfully. Now should I follow the same steps as the ros tutorial to launch move base or are there any additional steps required?
Thanks in advance!

A:

If catkin_make was successful, then all you need to do is source your catkin_ws via
$ . ~/path/to/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash.
See this answer for general instructions on how to build a ROS package from source.

A couple of important steps from the answer that @josephcoombe linked to are
$ rosdep update
$ rosdep install --from-paths src/ --ignore-src --rosdistro indigo

to make sure that you have all of the dependencies installed before you try to compile.
