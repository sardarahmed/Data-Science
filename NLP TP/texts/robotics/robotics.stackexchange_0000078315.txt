Q:

move group python interface error

terminate called after throwing an instance of 'boost::exception_detail::clone_implboost::exception_detail::error_info_injector<boost::lock_error >'
what():  boost: mutex lock failed in pthread_mutex_lock: Invalid argument
I'm getting this error when i tried to run the python program to move the robot in rviz. And also where is the move_group_interface.cpp file in the pr2_moveit_tutorial package in ros indigo. I wanted to move the pr2 in gazebo also not just in rviz but i'm not finding the cpp file, python file is present their but its not working. What should i do.
I installed the pr2_moveit_package as : sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-moveit-pr2

Hi
@q1
A while ago I ran into the same throw, if you look closely you'll see it happens when your script is terminated.
It is a known bug, please see:
https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/331
See also the note in the tutorials under "running the code"  http://docs.ros.org/kinetic/api/moveit_tutorials/html/doc/pr2_tutorials/planning/scripts/doc/move_group_python_interface_tutorial.html
Hope this helps
