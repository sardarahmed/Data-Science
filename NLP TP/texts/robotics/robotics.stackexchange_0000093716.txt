Q:

How to get distance from detected objects in autoware

Hi all!
When I use Yolo3 algorithm in Autoware with LGSVL simulation, it can detect objects and display on RViz (ImageViewePlugin) through topic /detection/image_detector/objects
How can I get distance from LGSVL simulator to detected objects and display them on RViz?
I checked the following nodes on Autoware:

lidar_euclidean_cluster_detect
range_fusion
imm_ukf_pda_track
naive_motion_predict
costmap_generator
astar_avoid
pure_pursuit
twist_filter

but it does not get the distance.
My environment:

Ubuntu 18.04
Autoware (docker) 1.12.0 melodic.

Thank you very much!
