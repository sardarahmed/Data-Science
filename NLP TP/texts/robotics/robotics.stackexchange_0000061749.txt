Q:

ROS driver for specific GPS receiver?

Hello, I'm currently trying to set up a GPS receiver and base station my boss purchased to work in ROS.  It is a trimble Ag
GPS 542 GNSS receiver.  I tried looking online to see if there were any ROS drivers already written for this specific model, but didn't have any.  I was wondering if anyone knew of any ros drivers that might be compatible with this device, either a specific one or a more general one that could be adapted specifically for use with this receiver.
Thanks!

Here is the info sheet: http://ssmgps.com/pdf/AGPB_AgGPS542_BaseAndReceiver_ROW_16502.pdf

A:

Most GPS use NMEA 0183 that transmits a sentence over serial.  Does it have serial port? If it does, try this nmea_navsat_driver.  According to this manual it uses NMEA 0183.

Ok, I will try this out.  Is it a problem that the project I'm going to try to integrate this into is in C++, while this package appears to be in python?

Not if you are not modifying the code.  If you just use the NavSatFix msg you should be fine.

Cool, not planning on modifying the code (provided it works as is).  However, I am encountering some setup problems that I have turned into a new question here: http://answers.ros.org/question/190089/ros-installation-and-usage-of-nmea_navsat_driver-for-gps-receiver/  If you have time do you know what I'm doing wrong in the installation?  I downloaded it with git clone but can't get catkin_make to recognize it as a new package, or to generate the actual executables I want to use.
