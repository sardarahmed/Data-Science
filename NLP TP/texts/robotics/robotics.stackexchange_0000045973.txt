Q:

can't find a dependency

Hi
I was building a package from a tutorial link text but when I tried doing rosmake I got an error
Failed to invoke /opt/ros/fuerte/bin/rospack deps-manifests trajectory_control_tutorial
[rospack] Error: package/stack trajectory_control_tutorial depends on non-existent package drc_robot_utils

I was already working with the drc robot and I know I have it on my disk.
what should I write instead?
thanks
Nachum
Edit\
Now I tried to run a file that I used before from a package that has that  dependency and I am getting this error-
    Traceback (most recent call last):

ROS path [5]=/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks

what could of happened?

A:

Both errors mean that the package drc_robot_utils was not found. Make sure that it is on your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. You can try if it is by running roscd drc_robot_utils; that should bring you to the package directory.

yes that's what it was. how do I permanently put a path on my ros path? I think I put it by echo "source /opt/ros/fuerte/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
. ~/.bashrc
Comment by Martin Günther on 2012-11-29:
Yes, but after that line you should add the path to the packages in your home dir like this: echo 'export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/nachum/ros/drc_robot_utils:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH' >> ~/.bashrc. You can also use rosws instead.
