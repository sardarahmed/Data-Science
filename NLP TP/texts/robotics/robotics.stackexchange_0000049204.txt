Q:

robotis.launch How to define motor parameters?

Hello,
While working with pi_tracker I have been trying to get some Bioloid Dynamixel ax-12a motors to move with kinect input. I have managed to get input to to move the motors and am now wondering where I can define motor/joint ID's for the robotis.launch parameters.
I am unsure as to whether I am supposed to edit the dynamixel parameters(pi_tracker/params/dynamixels_params.yaml) or add to the robotis parameters(pi_tracker/params/robotis_params.yaml). Or is there another way to define my motor setup so that the proper motor moves?
Thank you for your time.

Hi @Zab,
The robotis package uses another config file in the bin directory of the pi_tracker package called servo_config.py.  I believe that's the one you are looking for.
UPDATE: It turns out that there is also a servo_config.py file in the robotis package directory and that this file will override the one in the pi_tracker/bin directory.  So you need to ensure that both files contain the same parameters.  Two ways of doing this are as follows:
$ roscd robotis/src/robotis
$ roscp pi_tracker servo_config.py .

(That isolated "." at the end of the second line is required.)  This method requires that you execute the above commands whenever you change the parameters in the pi_tracker copy.
Alternatively you could just symlink the two files like this:
$ roscd robotis/src/robotis
$ rm servo_config.py servo_config.pyc
$ ln -s `rospack find pi_tracker`/bin/servo_config.py .

This method will keep the robotis copy synced with the pi_tracker version.
