Q:

librobot_control.so bad plugin info hash

Hello,
I installed the openrave_robot_control plugin under ROS Diamondback and I was able to successfully run "rosmake" on the source. Then I loaded the plugin into my OPENRAVE_PLUGINS environment variable:
export OPENRAVE_PLUGINS=$OPENRAVE_PLUGINS:rospack find openrave/share/openrave/plugins:rospack find openrave_robot_control/lib
The issue comes when I run "openrave --listplugins" and I get the following error:
[plugindatabase.h:832] /opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/openrave_planning/openrave_robot_control/lib/librobot_control.so failed to load: openrave (InvalidPlugin): [void OpenRAVEGetPluginAttributes(OpenRAVE::PLUGININFO*, int, const char*):87] bad plugin info hash
Anyone else experience this?
Thanks,
Chris

A:

Turns out the issue was because I had installed OpenRAVE separately from the ROS stack of OpenRAVE. This occurs because during compilation it looks under /usr/bin/openrave which is not linked to the ROS stack OpenRAVE. After uninstalling the separate version of OpenRAVE and re-running rosmake in the openrave_robot_control directory everything worked perfectly.
