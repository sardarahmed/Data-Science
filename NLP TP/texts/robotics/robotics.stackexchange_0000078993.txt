Q:

Convert the provided calibration data from the standard Velodyne XML format to the node's YAML format

I'm trying to hookup the VLP-16 using ROS and on the Ubuntu 16.04.  Following your steps outlined in the Wiki I' am having problems at step 3.
http://wiki.ros.org/velodyne/Tutorials/Getting%20Started%20with%20the%20Velodyne%20VLP16
rosrun velodyne_pointcloud gen_calibration.py 32db.xml
I can not seem to find the xml file.
Could you provide some help?

A:

I don't know where that tutorial came from. It's not listed in the Tutorials page.
It appears to have been adapted from the 32e tutorial, and not fully converted for the VLP-16. The line you mention refers to a 32e XML file. It should not be needed for the VLP-16.
To view the points run VLP16_points.launch instead of 32e_points.launch.
