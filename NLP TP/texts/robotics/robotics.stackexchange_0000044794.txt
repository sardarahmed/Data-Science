Q:

rviz UDP over unreliable network?

Is there an option for rviz to subscribe to topics via UDP? On our diagnostics side, we have an unreliable connection but would love to get some info out.
Is there an alternative to writing an echo node that subscribes via UDP then relays it to a topic for rviz to open up?

A:

Discovered that the ROS relay has the unreliable option built in, so at least we won't have to write our own relay.
