Q:

homogenous transformation matrix variants

I am working on some manipulator projects and come across a few variants of the homogenous transformation matrix. I've been working on matlab and they give slightly different answers. Assuming both are correct, I would like to ask which one to use and under what circumstances? Are there any conventions that follow along with these trransformation matrices.

A:

On serial manipulator modelling, we commonly use Denavit-Hartenberg system. One important thing you need to know, there are 2 variant of it, that is Denavit-Hartenberg system and Modified Denavit-Hartenberg. The main difference between two is coordinates system attachment to links and order of performed transformation [1].

Denavit-Hartenberg System

Fig 1. DH Coordinate System Attachment
Will have HTM

Modified Denavit-Hartenberg System

Fig 2. MDH Coordinate System Attachment
Will have HTM

And both are correct. My professor recommendation was to use MDH because it use less variable to represent manipulator.
