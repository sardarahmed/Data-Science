Q:

Wiki mirror missing wiki pages

None of the wiki pages seem to be available on mirrors (see this mirror for e.g.). When I try to follow the mirroring instructions, none of the actual wiki pages are downloaded. Has anything changed in the wiki mirroring scheme?

Indeed I do see similar/same even today. Reported https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/mirror/issues/20

A:

I confirm. Mirrored Wikis allmost are empty. I don't remember in which log I saw the error. But it was somehow connected with "/var/www/wiki.ros.org/venv/lib/python2.7/site-packages". I tried to look for a solution a few weeks ago, but I gave up and forgot about this problem for a while. And now I can't remember where that log with errors is.
