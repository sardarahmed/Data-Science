Q:

why Gazebo crash while adding a 3D model? is a robotic arm .DAE

I'm trying to add in "model editor" (custom shapes) a model of a robotic arm but Gazebo crashes when I click in import. why this could happen? is there another way of loading the robotic arm? I tried also with .OBJ

When you run Gazebo in verbose mode, do you see any errors? (gazebo --verbose) I've seen Gazebo crash before with malforned collada files.

now I tried verbose mode and you are right, is not a valid collada.  "Invalid collada file. Must be version 1.4.0 or 1.4.1".
Thanks, i didn' t know about this verbose mode, at least now i know why is crashing. Is there any way to fix this colladas?

A:

As described on the comments, the issue is that the collada file is invalid.
One way around it would be to load it into a CAD program such as Blender and then re-export is as collada in the hope that the program will fix the issues.
