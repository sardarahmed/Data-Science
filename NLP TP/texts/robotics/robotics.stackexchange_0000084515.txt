Q:

Moveit interactive marker missing on new kinetic version

I was using Moveit totally fine on ROS Kinetic (version: 1.12.7). However, after I upgraded to the newer version (1.12.12). the interactive markers just disappear. Anyone has the same problem or know how to solve this? Thanks a lot.

A:

This is a known regression in RViz, not in MoveIt.
Please see ros-planning/moveit#736 and ros-visualization/rviz#1179.
