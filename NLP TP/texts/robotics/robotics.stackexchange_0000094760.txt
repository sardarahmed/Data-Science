Q:

Where can I find a fake localization node (ROS2)?

I am correctly running the nav2 stack, but now I need to provide a localization node for my simulation, in order to make the robot actually move. I want to know if already exists somewhere a node simulating the localization of the robot based only on cmd_vel topic furnished by the nav2 stack.

A:

The answer is no. We have AMCL ported to ROS2 that we utilize in simulation for positioning, as that represents a far more accurate simulation to reality.

if you have a laser scanner on your robot, you can just use AMCL the way you would but a non-simulated robot as well.
