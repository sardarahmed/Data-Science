Q:

Sending data to octomap_server issue

Hi guys!
I'm having some trouble running rgbdslam (on turtlebot w/ kinect) to generate an octomap without using the GUI.
After start the robot and kinect (openni), my steps are
>     roslaunch rgbdslam octomap_server.launch
>     roslaunch rgbdslam headless.launch
>     rosservice call /rgbdslam/ros_ui_b pause false
     -- Then capture some frames moving the robot around my lab --
>     rosservice call /rgbdslam/ros_ui_b pause true
>     rosservice call /rgbdslam/ros_ui send_all

The problem is: After send all the points captured, i'm able to run: rosrun octomap_server octomap_saver file.bt but file.bt only contains the last frame captured.
I think that octomap_server is overwriting the data received, so in the end it only contains the last frame. I've tried to change the parameters a lot, but with no success.
Here are the pictures of octomap_server.launch and headless.launch.
Any suggestion ?
Thanks !

Hi
Your launch-files seem right. I am not sure what the problem is. See my answer to this question.
