Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: vslam beginner

Hello all,
I am using vslam package first time. We have done 2D mapping gmapping to generate a static map. Now, our plan is to generate a 3D static map using a VSLAM. Is it possible to generate a static 3D map using VSLAM? If yes, then what are the steps to do so?
I have gone through SBA and VSLAM packages but unable to understand the process. We have Minoru stereo cam by which we can generate rectified images left/ right and can give it to vslam.
I also tried the sba tutorial. I get below error while compiling the package.
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lsba_ros
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make[3]: *** [../bin/sba_from_file] Error 1
make[2]: *** [CMakeFiles/sba_from_file.dir/all] Error 2

There are two questions here ("how do I use vslam?" and "why won't it compile"?) You should break these into two questions. (Also, there are a great many vslam-related questions here; have you read through those?)

A:

vslam is experimental research code. It is not actively being supported, and should be used at your own risk, but patches are welcome.
If you would like a robust method of localization and mapping with a stereo camera or kinect, use the 2D slam_gmapping stack. See the pointcloud_to_laserscan package from the turtlebot stack and the SLAM Gmapping with Kinect Tutorial for the turtlebot.
