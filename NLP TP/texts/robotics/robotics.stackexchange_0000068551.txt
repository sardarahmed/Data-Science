Q:

parameter_descriptions and parameter_updates topics

Dear friends,
I experiment with hector quadrotor simulation in Hydro. Most of the topics like the one for sonar of the altimeter includes additional topics like /sonar_height/parameter_descriptions and /sonar_height/paramater_updates.
What is the use of these topics in every component?
It can be used in order to change the on fly the parameters of the virtual device or something else?
Thanks for the help!

A:

These topics are used by the dynamic_reconfigure framework to change some device parameters while the node is running.
See: the dynamic_reconfigure wiki page for more details

That's make sense, so I can use them as normal topics when I want to update the device's config when the node is already running - thanks
