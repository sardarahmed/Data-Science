Q:

Waiting for the joint_trajectory_action server

Hey Guys, I am trying to do some demos on a real Pr2, but I cant make it move it arms.
At first, I tried http://wiki.ros.org/pr2_interactive_manipulation
And there occurs no error, robot comes up and on my desktop, rviz shows up all Ok, but then when I try to move its arms to the front or so it doesnt move.
So I tried something even more basic: pr2_props
On Robot
roslaunch pr2_props pr2_props.launch
And on the desktop
rosrun pr2_props hug
But I keep getting this message on a loop:
[ INFO] [1413233159.293564120]: Waiting for the joint_trajectory_action server
[ INFO] [1413233164.293692161]: Waiting for the joint_trajectory_action server
[ INFO] [1413233169.293832716]: Waiting for the joint_trajectory_action server
[ INFO] [1413233174.293930410]: Waiting for the joint_trajectory_action server

Any ideas what it could be?
@pr1023:~$ rosrun pr2_controller_manager pr2_controller_manager list
base_controller ( running )
base_odometry ( running )
head_camera_trigger ( running )
head_traj_controller ( running )
l_arm_controller ( running )
l_forearm_cam_trigger ( running )
l_gripper_controller ( running )
laser_tilt_controller ( running )
projector_controller ( running )
projector_trigger ( running )
prosilica_inhibit_projector_controller ( running )
r_arm_controller ( running )
r_forearm_cam_trigger ( running )
r_gripper_controller ( running )
torso_controller ( running )

these are my controllers. is it how it is supposed to be or am I missing something?

This could be a network problem. Does it work if you run everything on the robot?

Well, tuckarms work just fine. Could this be a network problem just for the controllers? Cause, on the desktop, using pr2_interactive_manipulation, Rviz shows correct information/states of the robot, so it receives data on the network. When I click 'move right arm', however, then it doesnt work.

A:

Your PR2 doesn't seem to be running the expected controllers. The instructions can either be out of date (note that Groovy is already EOL'ed), or your PR2 bringup logic does not coincide with the expectations of the demo instructions. You can query the list of running and stopped controllers by running
rosservice call /pr2_controller_manager/list_controllers
If the expected controllers are there, but stopped, you should just start them, otherwise you might have to load their configuration to the param server, load the controllers, and then start them.

On the PR2, you get much better output by using the pr2_controller_manager: rosrun pr2_controller_manager pr2_controller_manager list
