Q:

Global logger for logging without a node

So far, all the examples I've seen for logging involves  using the get_logger() method of rclcpp::Node, e.g.
RCLCPP_INFO(get_logger(), "my_message");

Is there a global logger that is can be used for logging without having access to a node?

A:

Turns out loggers can be created on the fly with rclcpp::get_logger for your logging purposes.  e.g.
RCLCPP_INFO(rclcpp::get_logger("my_logger"), "my_message");

Also, remember to set the following if you're not seeing any log outputs (took me way too long to figure it out...)
export RCUTILS_CONSOLE_STDOUT_LINE_BUFFERED=1

In newer ROS versions, it should be
export RCUTILS_LOGGING_USE_STDOUT=1 && export RCUTILS_LOGGING_BUFFERED_STREAM=1
