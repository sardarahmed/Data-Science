Q:

rosbag play speed

Hi All
I am using rosbag play --clock myrecod.bag to play file and subscribe these three topics:
"/camera/rgb/image_color", "/camera/depth/image", "/camera/depth/camera_info"
and I want to process each frame of these topics by fovis (http://code.google.com/p/fovis/).my recording file is 20 fps and I have time-consuming calculation on each frame of data. There for I only able to subscribe 4 fps of my recordings.
How can I slow down the play back speed of my recordings file  in order to get all frames?
Thanks in Advance
Ramin
