Q:

Controlling Turtlebot's sound/noise

Is there a way to control/stop/resume the funny sound that Turtlebot makes when it moves (not the one from the motor & wheels but the "computational" one from somewhere on  iRobot Create) ? I suspect it might not even controlled by ROS since I don't see any topic that seems sound related.
I personally like that sound since it's really "robotic", but it'd be nicer if I can turn it off in certain situation for ex. when I create the map of my office.

Update Nov 18) Thanks guys but sounds like the sound I'm talking about is different from what you think of. My turtlebots make this fake, sci-fi, technical sound when it/Create moves. And it looks like it comes from the base not from Kinect.

A:

To shed some more light on the subject. I even went as far as to disconnect the speaker on the Create (cut the wire) in order to reduce any sound coming from the base. Now my turtlebot seems quieter moving forward or backwards. The weird blipy Starwars noises seem to have be fixed by my mod but it still makes the noise when rotating in place, but not as loud as before. I am sure the noise you are describing is not related to the Create's speakers. As strange as that might sound. Im sure its the motors or possibly something to with the motor drivers making noise. You can try taping your speaker up and see if the noise you hear is reduced. I'll take some time and investigate the noises agian, and post some more info. --Atom--
