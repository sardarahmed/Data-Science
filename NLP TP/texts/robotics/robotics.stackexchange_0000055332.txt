Q:

Unmet Dependencies on Lubuntu 13.10 Desktop

I'm a newbie to ROS and Linux.  I have Lubuntu 13.10 installed on my laptop and I want to install ROS.  When I go to install ROS (Precise version), I get "unmet dependencies" and the install fails.
Should I be installing ROS on Lubuntu in the first place?  This is an old laptop so I wanted as thin a version of Ubuntu as possible and I believe that Lubuntu 13.10 (Saucy Salamander) has the same core as Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise).
Am I headed in the right direction?  How can I resolve these "unmet dependencies"?  I believe the "sudo apt-get update" was successful.
Incidentally, these are the unmet dependencies I'm getting:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 ros-hydro-desktop-full : Depends: ros-hydro-desktop but it is not going to be installed
                          Depends: ros-hydro-mobile but it is not going to be installed
                          Depends: ros-hydro-perception but it is not going to be installed
                          Depends: ros-hydro-simulators but it is not going to be installed

A:

I figured it out ...  As I now realize, Lubuntu 13.10 does not use the Ubuntu 12.04 core.  It uses the 13.10 core.  duh.  All I did was to reinstall Lubuntu, this time using the older 12.04 version, which is what ROS Hydro needs to work.  Installation went fine and it seems to be working.
