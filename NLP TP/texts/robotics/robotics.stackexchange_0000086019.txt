Q:

Im looking ROS distro for BeagleBone Black Rev.C

Hello everyone.
For my robotic project im looking distro of ROS compatible with BeagleBone Black RevC. dev. platform. Unfortunatelly when I try install standard Kinetic distro for Debian from here:
http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Debian
the system takes me this:
E: Unable to locate package ros-kinetic-desktop-full

What is going on? Im used wrong version of Debian or something else? Or maybe someone had similar problem with BeagleBone Black?
Could someone help me to find solution of this problem? I would like to use this platform with RPlidarA1 in my robot project bud I can't do anything without ROS.
My kernel and system:
Linux beaglebone 4.4.113-ti-r147 #1 SMP Tue Feb 20 20:44:47 UTC 2018 armv7l GNU/Linux

I think thats the Debian Jessie 8.10 so ROS should been works without problems?
Thanks for help.
Greetings Tom

Nevermind, I thought the BeagleBone had a 64 bit CPU, I'll answer to your question now

So I can't use ROS for this platform?
Comment by VictorLamoine on 2018-03-20:
You can, take a look at my answer, especially the last part!

I just wrote another question before I saw Your answer :)

A:

If I am correct the BeagleBone Rev C has a AM335x 1GHz ARMÂ® Cortex-A8 CPU. This is a 32 bits CPU.
If you take a look at what Debian packages are compiled on the top of the tutorial, you'll see that there is only amd64 and arm64
The BeagleBone CPU falls into the armhf (ARM Hard-Float) category, there is no binary package available for your platform on Debian.
You have two choices:

Compile from source (there is a link
for that at the top of the tutorial
you mention)
Use Ubuntu on your
BeagleBone, binaries are provided for
armhf CPUs platform on Ubuntu
