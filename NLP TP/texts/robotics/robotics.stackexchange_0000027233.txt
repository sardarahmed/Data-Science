Q:

How does gazebo handle damping in Joint::SetForce?

I'm using gazebo's API to apply force to a joint with a non-null damping coeficient (Defined in the SDF). Is it necessary to include the damping effect when I call the method SetForce() ?
e.g   joint -> SetForce ( 0, effort - joint->GetDamping(0) * joint->GetVelocity(0))
Or does Gazebo handle the damping automatically and I don't have to include it?
e.g   joint -> SetForce ( 0, effort )
Thanks

A:

No, you don't have to include the damping effect when you call SetForce. You shouldn't at least. If it's not working like this then submit a bug report and we'll fix it.
Thanks!
