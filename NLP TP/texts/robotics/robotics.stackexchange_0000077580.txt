A:

The .rviz files contain configuration information for RViz (which displays to load, how they are configured, etc).
You can create one by just starting RViz, configuring it as you would like (ie: add some displays, perhaps for Robot Model if you want to visualise your robot's state, etc), then click File -> Save Config As.
