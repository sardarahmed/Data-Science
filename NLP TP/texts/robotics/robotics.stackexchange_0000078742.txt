Q:

how to place a file inside .bashrc

I am following a tutorial on the link https://github.com/birlrobotics/birl_baxter/wiki and I was told as folows:
Finally, after doing catkin_make, place the newly created ~/ros/indigo/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash file inside .bashrc
cd ~
emacs .bashrc
source ~/ros/indigo/rbx_ws/devel/setup.bash

When I run the command emacs .bashrc the emacs editor opens but I am not sure what I am expected to do after that .

A:

Go to the end of the file that you just opened and paste the following:
source ~/ros/indigo/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

then save the file, exit the editor.
Now continue with whatever the documentation tells you to do.

Note that this of course assumes that you actually have a directory ros/indigo/catkin_ws in your home directory and that you built the workspace.
Note also that if you ever delete ~/ros/indigo/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash, every new terminal that you open will complain about ~/ros/indigo/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash not existing.
