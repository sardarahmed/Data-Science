Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: openni_tracker

Hi everybody
1.-I have  installed sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-openni-tracker
2.-I have also installed NiTE v1.5.2.21 Linux-x86, then I have  extracted the file to my Downloads directory, and I did the following:
cd ~/Downloads/NITE-Bin-Dev-Linux-x64-v1.5.2.21

sudo ./install.sh

Then cd /Samples/Bin/x86-Release$ ./Sample-Players
and works fine.
3.-Then I run rosrun openni_tracker openni_tracker
4.- I stand in front of the Xtion pro and I get the following
New User 1
Calibration started for user 1
Calibration complete, start tracking user 1
But I cannot see any image, nothing
Any ideas

A:

As per OpenNI tracker package description: The tracker publishes the acquired poses of different joints like head, neck, ... to the tf tree.
From here, they can be accessed in different manners:

For visualization, you can view them e.g. in RViz as you pointed out in your answer.
If you want to access the transformations from code, have a look at the tf    Tutorials.
