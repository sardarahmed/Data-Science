Q:

Possible to Install ROS on Snow Leopard Using Xcode < 4?

Is it possible to install ROS on OS X Snow Leopard with Xcode version 3.2.6? I realize the installation documentation says Xcode 4 is required, but I was hoping that since ROS predates OS X Lion & Xcode 4, it would be possible to install & use ROS somehow.
I would love to upgrade to Lion, but my Macbook Pro is evidently just a little too outdated to handle it, according to the App Store.
Thanks

A:

You can try the Homebrew installation instructions here:

I cannot guarantee that this will work, but I don't know of any specific reasons it wouldn't.
You will still need to have this line in your ~/.bashrc exactly from the instructions:
export ROS_OS_OVERRIDE=osxbrew:lion

This will fool rosdep into thinking you are running lion.
