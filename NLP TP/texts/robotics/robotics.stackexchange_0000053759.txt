Q:

Why does catkin add the src directory of the workspace to ROS_PACKAGE_PATH and not the devel directory?

If the devel space is supposed to mimic the install space, (as described in http://www.ros.org/wiki/catkin/workspaces), should that not be what is added to the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH? It seems confusing to have the package.xml and .launch files remain in the src directory and the binary targets copied to the devel directory...

A:

I'm not an expert, but this catkin-related REP seems to provide the rationale for this design choice.
Basically, the REP says that it would have potentially broken some override capabilities to add both locations to ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, and it would've been overly complicated to copy all src files to the devel directory on every catkin_make.

Thanks. At least it is not the case that I was just missing something obvious.
