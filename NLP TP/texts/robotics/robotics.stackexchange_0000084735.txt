Q:

`builtin_interfaces` package location

According to the Migration Guide, in ROS2

the types duration and time which were builtin types in ROS 1 have been replaced with normal message definitions and must be used from the builtin_interfaces package

Where are the normal message definitions? I looked here and did not find a builtin_interfaces package.

Very annoyingly, doing a Google search for "builtin_interfaces" (with quotes) does not result in this repo.

I think it might be because it was moved not so long ago, SEO is still catching up. I added a link to it in the meantime: https://github.com/ros2/ros2/wiki/Migration-Guide/_compare/2c4a2a35b690b2ffa44217c376b34d7ec366746d...747c5bf84aea700d7f5207301782d881a825dc20
