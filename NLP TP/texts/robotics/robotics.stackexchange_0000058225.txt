Q:

rviz does not run on virtual machine - Illegal instruction (core dumped)

Hi everyone,
I am using Ubuntu 12.04 32-bit on VirtualBox. I just installed the rviz and tried to run it using "rosrun rviz rviz" command. But the followings will be shown and it doesn't start.
How can I fix the issue?
[ INFO] [1395806079.738572838]: rviz version 1.10.11
[ INFO] [1395806079.739463083]: compiled against OGRE version 1.7.4 (Cthugha)
[ INFO] [1395806080.677327493]: OpenGl version: 2.1 (GLSL 1.2).
Illegal instruction (core dumped)

I may note that I enabled 3D acceleration before turning on the virtual machine, but the system details there is no sign of having a 128 MB graphics card.
Also, I executed the following code, but rviz does not run yet:
export LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1

Thank you

Do other opengl applications work? Try apt-getting mesa-utils and running glxgears to make sure that a simple opengl application works.

No it doesn't run ...
Illegal instruction (core dumped)
What should I do? :(

A:

Guys, I solved the issue partially.
The problem was stemming from lack of 3D support in the Ubuntu installed as virtual machine.
Now, when I execute the command "glxgears" it runs having no problem. But when I execute the command
rosrun rviz rviz

it shows a segmentation fault. How should I resolve this issue?

Do you have anything odd in your rviz config file? If not, you may have to resort to running rviz in gdb, getting a backtrace, and filing a bug here: https://github.com/ros-visualization/rviz

No, I haven't touched the rviz config file. I actually don't know where it is. I'm confused now. I need to work with rviz but I don't know how to ... .
The link you provided doesn't work.

answer.ros.org seems to append characters to the link :-( Copy/paste it manually: "https://github.com/ros-visualization/rviz"
