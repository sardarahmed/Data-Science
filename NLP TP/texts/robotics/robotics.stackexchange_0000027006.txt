Q:

Turtlebot doesn't stop after killing the velocity command

Hi Everyone,
I am running two turtlebots  (kobuki) with gazebo1.9 and I provided command velocities to each turtlebot using “rostopic pub” command. I noticed that turtlebot keep moving after I killed the command velocity using “Control tab  +c”.
I am wondering if this anomaly is due to the inertia values for my turtlebot wheels or something else
Thanks for any help with this issue

A:

Try to send a 0 velocity command.
rostopic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist '[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]' '[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]'

Not sure if this is the right command but give it a try or replace it with the right one and let me know.
Hope that works.

Thanks Ffurrer. I sent a 0 velocity command and the turtlebot stopped. Somebody mentioned the gazebo plugin might not have a timeout on incoming commands when they stop being published it may continue to execute the last received command.
