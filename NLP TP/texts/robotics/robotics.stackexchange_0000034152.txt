Q:

hokuyo_node error code 15->15

Hi,
our hokuyo laser has suddenly stopped working.
On rosrun-ing hokuyo_node the following error message is displayed:
[ERROR] [1315484154.288808300]: Laser returned abnormal status message, aborting: Trouble!! Error Code=[15->15] You may be able to find further information at http://www.ros.org/wiki/hokuyo_node/Troubleshooting/
The mentioned wiki page doesn't cover our error code and mentions that these codes are undocumented. None of the offered solutions fix the error, which has been preventing us from using the hokuyo for a week now.
Does anyone know what this error code means or how to resolve this error?
Thanks in advance

A:

The protocol definition also lists error code 15 as "Others".
So, the hokuyo worked fine and now suddenly doesn't anymore after you power cycled the Hokuyo and rebooted the system it's running on? You can also try another computer to be safe.
Unfortunately, in that case I think there is a problem with the hokuyo itself. You can try checking that the power is OK and data connection is worked. Also see if the output of dmesg shows any errors when you plug it in.
As a minimal test on the software site you can try connection with a terminal program to the device (e.g. gtkterm) and send the V command (basically V). The hokuyo should reply with version information.

sorry for the late answer, no it didnt spin up anymore. We have kindly been lended another hokuyo from our friends in styria, and it works just fine. So to resolve this problem for other users: error code 15->15 indicates hardware failure

That doesn't sound so good. Does it spin up at all? You can hear that.

Dmesg is not reporting any errors. Power is on and data connection succeeds on our windows machine - but it also can't read any data from the laser..
