Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
ros-electric-desktop-full: Depends: ros-electric-slam-gmapping (= 1.2.5-s1326424166~lucid) but it is not going to be installed
Depends: ros-electric-perception-pcl (= 1.0.2-s1323553637~lucid) but it is not going to be installed
Depends: ros-electric-simulator-gazebo (= 1.4.10-s1326937730~lucid) but it is not going to be installed
Depends: ros-electric-navigation (= 1.6.5-s1323562415~lucid) but it is not going to be installed
E: Broken packages
what should I do?
When I tried to install from the source for the setup command :
“sudo apt-get install build-essential python-yaml cmake subversion wget python-setuptools mercurial git-core”

A:

Based on your own answer and the fact that you cannot install the prerequisites you appear to have conflicts in your PPA sources which conflict with standard Ubuntu packages.  You'll have to resolve that before continuing.
