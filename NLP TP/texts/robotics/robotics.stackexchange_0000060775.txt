Q:

Planning Scene/C++ API Tutorial missing part

Hi, as I was reading this tutorial (sorry but I don't have enough karma to post a real link):
xxxx://docs.ros.org/api/pr2_moveit_tutorials/html/planning/src/doc/planning_scene_tutorial.html

I saw that the right way to maintain current planning scene is to use the PlanningSceneMonitor:

The PlanningSceneMonitor is the
recommended method to create and
maintain the current planning scene
(and is discussed in detail in the
next tutorial)

But I haven't find in any of the other Moveit tutorials any reference to that class.
Maybe I'm looking in the wrong place?
Tx

A:

Take a look at the answer to this question:
http://answers.ros.org/question/157716/obstacles-management-in-moveit/
That contains code snippets too. I hope it helps. That tutorial, according to the answer, was never written.
