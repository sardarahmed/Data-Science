Q:

Rosjava subscriber doesn't get any data

I'm trying to use a rosbag as a topic publisher to receive the data on my phone and update the info I have on my app.
I've been looking around and I think the main issue is this console output:
E/UpdatePublisherRunnable: java.lang.RuntimeException: java.net.UnknownHostException: Unable to resolve host "mypcname": No address associated with hostname

Im playing a rosbag from my pc and made sure the topic is working.
I used the debug of android studio and the subscriber gets setted properly, but when I should receive the message the onNewMessage never triggers.
I have setted up the ROS_MASTER_URI, ROS_IP and ROS_HOSTNAME correctly on my pc.
Not sure what to do to solve this and couldn't find a proper answer anywhere.
Thanks in advance.

I do not have a solution but have you...
[1] ..run a 'IsPortOpen' before the error exception.
[2] ...called addMessageListener(MessageListener<T!> { ...   prior to onNewMessage ?

I can't accept my own answer, a pop-up says 10 points are required

A:

SOLVED:
My code was all good and the network configuration before roscore too. The only problem was that I didn't know you had to set up the ROS_MASTER_URI, ROS_IP and ROS_HOSTNAME on every console you are using for Ros.
I was playing the rosbag on a different console (not on the roscore one) and the subscriber was publishing on localhost -> mypcname, which is the default value.
To see if you have setted up your network values try echo $ROS_MASTER_URI.
