Q:

rosserial "ImportError: No module named serial"

I am trying to follow the rosserial tutorial.  I am running Debian 8.5 on Beaglebone Black.  I installed rosserial from source using the following:
git clone https://github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial.git
cd <ws>
catkin_make

This ran fine with no errors, got lots of files and directories with "rosserial" in the name :)
Then I'm ready to test, command (from tutorial) is:
rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyUSB0

result is:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/debian/ros_catkin_ws/src/rosserial/rosserial_python/nodes/serial_node.py", line 39, in <module>
    from rosserial_python import SerialClient, RosSerialServer
  File "/home/debian/ros_catkin_ws/devel/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rosserial_python/__init__.py", line 35, in <module>
    exec(__fh.read())
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/home/debian/ros_catkin_ws/src/rosserial/rosserial_python/src/rosserial_python/SerialClient.py", line 44, in <module>
    from serial import *
ImportError: No module named serial

All help will be appreciated.

A:

It looks like you don't have the python serial module installed; did you install the dependencies for rosserial when you built it?
You can install all of the dependencies for rosserial with rosdep (this should install python-serial):
cd <ws>
rosdep install --from-paths src -i

That should install python-serial, and any other dependencies. If it doesn't, you can install the python serial module by hand with:
sudo apt-get install python-serial

Thanks for your helpful answer.  apt-get install worked for me.  That solved the immediate problem which has now moved on to "ImportError: diagnostic_msgs".  I tried to use the same type of apt-get solution but it didn't work.  Neither could I find good instructions to build it from source.

The real answer here was to use rosdep, because it should install all of the dependencies. Did you try it?
Comment by bsculley on 2016-07-07:
I tried the rosdep install command you cited above, but it failed with:
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
rosserial_python: No definition of [diagnostic_msgs] for OS [debian]
Comment by ahendrix on 2016-07-07:
That's odd. diagnostic_msgs should be part of a standard ROS install; how did you install ROS?

from source, using the instructions here:  https://gist.github.com/mhaberler/621bc9df63a8f5800b64
