Q:

turtle_tf2_broadcaster,turtle_tf2_listener,c++

Hello everyone:
I am practising these two web pages:
http://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20tf2%20broadcaster%20%28C%2B%2B%29
and:
http://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20tf2%20listener%20%28C%2B%2B%29
I met two questions as follows:
If everything went well, you should have a binary file called turtle_tf2_broadcaster in your bin folder. If so......
and
If everything went well, you should have a binary file called turtle_tf2_listener in your bin folder. If so......
What and where is this bin folder?
Also I don't find these two files anywhere:a binary file called turtle_tf2_broadcaster,a binary file called turtle_tf2_listener.
Who can give me a hand? Thank you for your kindness and patience.
