Q:

static_transform_publisher base_link base_laser

hi everyone
Is this line enough in order to use tf package for set  a fixed relation between base_link and base_laser frames in my launch file?
<node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="base_to_laser_broadcaster" args="0 0 0 0 0 0 base_link base_laser 100" />

and do i need other nodes or scripts to set /map frames or others especially when we want to use packages like gmapping or amcl??
thanks:))))

Yes, if you want them to have an identity transform inbetween them (0 0 0 0 0 0).

For gmapping and amcl, which both publish the map->odom transform, you want to make sure you already provide an accurate odom->base_link transform, as well as publishing odometry to the odom topic. More info here.
