Q:

Default sun doesn't do anything

Gazebo 1.3 allows you to grab and move the 'sun' that is included in the default world, but when I move it it seems to have no effect on the lighting, including the shadows that are projected and the light that is cast.  However, when I delete it the scene does go dark.  This seems to be a glitch.

A:

Changing the position of a directional light doesn't affect the shadows; it's only the orientation that matters. Try using the rotate tool instead of the move tool, as shown in this example video.
