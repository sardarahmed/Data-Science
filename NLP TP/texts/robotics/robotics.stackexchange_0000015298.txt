Q:

Can I "shape" the sound of words spoken by Pepper with Phonetic transcription?

I am using Aldebaran/Softbank Robotics Pepper with Choregraphe software. There are some loan words in my dialogs. When Pepper say these words they often don't sound natural.
e.g. the german word Demenz (eng: dementia) The first e is to long. I imagine some synax like that De[0.5]menz or phonetic transcription [deˈmɛnʦ].
Is this possible?

A:

Yes, it's possible to tweak the ponetic proncunciation, see the documentation here:
tts.setLanguage("English")
tts.say("\\toi=lhp\\‘zi.R+o&U \\toi=orth\\")
# Same as
tts.say("zero")
