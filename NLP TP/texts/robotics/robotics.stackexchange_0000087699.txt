Q:

U-Blox: Could not open serial port :/dev/ttyACM0

hello guys, I'm getting this error. Then the process dies. I'm not sure about what could be wrong. Any idea will be very appreciated

A:

In linux first see if your port is being detected:
'lsusb'   with the USB plugged in and out  the list should be longer if it is plugged in.  If you can't see it, then try another cable to see if that fixes the problem.
Next,  try 'ls /dev/tty*'   with the same plugged in and out technique.  The port should show up as noted in the previous answer.
Once you have identified the port, you need to see if it is set correctly in ROS,  this is usually in a param directory, but could be specified in a launch or 'node' directory.
Sometimes you need to set permissions to write to a USB port; you need to add your username to the dialout group.
One final issue is a failed USB device  -   minicom - D /dev/ttyACM0  would test if Linux can talk to that device. If minicom doesn't work, but sudo minicom does, you have the dialout problem.
There, that's my answer, now I am exhausted and need to go to bed! (just kidding)
