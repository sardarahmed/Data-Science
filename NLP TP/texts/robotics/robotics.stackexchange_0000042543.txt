Q:

Not all paths in ROS_PACKAGE_PATH[a series of ros package path] point to an existing directory:

Hi,
I always come across with the problem that  Not all paths in ROS_PACKAGE_PATH [/home/lilimeng/fuerte_workspace/turtlebot:/home/lilimeng/fuerte_workspace/sandbox:/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks:/opt/ros/fuerte/share:/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros] point to an existing directory:

/home/lilimeng/fuerte_workspace/turtlebot

when I install segway_rmp and openni_kinect in my fuerte ROS in Ubuntu12.04. I have tried several times, such as ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/lilimeng/fuerte_workspace/turtlebot, but it didn't work!!!
Looking for your help! I highly appreciate it!

Do all of the paths (specifically /home/lilimeng/fuerte_workspace/turtlebot ) actually exist and you have permissions to read from those paths?

A:

I got the answer, as the /home/lilimeng/fuerte_workspace/turtlebot does not exist. So I just changed to export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/lilimeng/fuerte_workspace/sandbox:/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks:/opt/ros/fuerte/share:/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros.
It finally works
