Q:

Global Pose of Robot in Dynamic window approach

The pose from <nav_msgs::Odometry> is same as the pose from tf::Stamped<tf::Pose> ?
Are these similar. Can I use the pose from the /odom topic in a function which takes a parameter of type " tf::Stamped<tf::Pose> " ?

A:

No, you have to use a transform listener to get the pose as a tf::Stamped<tf::pose> message type. If your function parameter needs nav_msgs::Odometry you use a standard ROS subscriber to get the pose as a <nav_msgs::odometry> message type.
