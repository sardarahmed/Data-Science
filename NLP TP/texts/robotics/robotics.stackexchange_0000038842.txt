Q:

rosjava gradle compilation loop

trying to compile rosjava using gradle following:
http://docs.rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/rosjava_core/html/building.html
i managed to get to fourth step, when i run: ./gradlew rosjava:install
everything seems to compile good, but once i hit
Building > :rosjava:test > 19 tests completed

it seems to freeze, i ran it with ./gradlew rosjava:isntall --debug and it seems
to loop this forever:
23:15:47.667 [DEBUG] [org.gradle.messaging.remote.internal.WorkerProtocol] Dispatching request to worker: [Request consumer: 702b4444-12e7-4914-be76-28b05bff8732, payload: [MethodInvocation method: output()]]

> Building > :rosjava:test > 19 tests completed

using:

managed to compile it with: ./gradlew rosjava:install -x tests

A:

As you said in your comment, a workaround is to use ./gradlew rosjava:install -x tests.
However, please file an issue and specify which test is failing to complete. You should be able to figure that out with ./gradle rosjava:test --info.
See http://code.google.com/p/rosjava/issues/list
