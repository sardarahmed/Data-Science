Q:

NodeRunner.java missing

Hello everyone,
I've been facing a problem for few days that is really driving me crazy. Since I've not found anyone else having this problem, I assume there is something that I'm doing wrong.
So I've downloaded rosjava and rosmake it. Then I ran rosmake on both android_gingerbread and android_honeycomb_mr2 and they compiled with no failures. I've done the same on android_tutorial_pubsub as well. Now I'm modifying android_tutorial_pubsub to code my own program which some of my other friends have done too. Here comes the problem. I don't seem to be able to import the libraries "NodeRunner" and "DefaultNodeRunner". My jar file is simply missing these 2 and copying my friends jar files will fix this issue but will cause more trouble.
I was wondering what is it that I'm doing wrong that I miss these classes.
Thank you so much.

Are you using the deb release or trying to build rosjava from source?

A:

I think NodeRunner was renamed to NodeMainExecutor in newer releases. Correct me if Iâ€™m wrong.

Sort of... There has been a pretty large architectural shift since the last deb release. You are correct that NodeRunner no longer exists.
