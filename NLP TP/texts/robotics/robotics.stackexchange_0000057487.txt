Q:

install ROS groovy and Hydro at the same time

For different projects, I need to have Groovy and Hydro installed in my system. How do I use the catkin_ws and other packages? Do I have separate catkin_ws? Can I rename them separately like catkin_ws_g and catkin_ws_h, or will it create accessibility problems?

A:

Sure, that's no problem. Just install both.
You'll need to have different workspaces though as the code in there will be compiled and linked against the specific ROS distribution.
