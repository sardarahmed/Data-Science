Q:

Recommended system for complex ROS programs + simulations

I am looking to build a new computer to run ROS, rviz, and gazebo simulations. I've previously been working on an underpowered Ubuntu VM. What specs (RAM, CPU, GPU...) would you recommend for complex operations like simulating a PR2 or point cloud manipulations? I definitely cannot spend more than $4,000 so I think dual six core xeon processors are out :-p
Thanks - Patrick

A:

At Willow, our standard dev machines are the Limbo 7000 line from Zareason.  Make sure to get an Nvidia Graphics card, other than that the more upgrades you use the faster it will run. I'd suggest bumping up the memory a little bit, but it's not necessary.
