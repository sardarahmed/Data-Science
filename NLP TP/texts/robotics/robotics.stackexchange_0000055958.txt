Hi, I have the same problem. Do you resolve this problem? Thanks

A:

The stereo_image_proc.launch file must be included in another launch file where manager is defined and a nodelet manager is started. You'll need provide a globally qualified manager name so that all nodelets get added to the same manager, which basically means adding a leading / to the name. Be careful with the namespaces.
For example, you could create a launch file named my_rig.launch:
<launch>

  <!-- Start a nodelet manager; the name must be unqualified here -->
  <node pkg="nodelet" type="nodelet" name="pipeline" args="manager" />

  <!-- Include the stereo_image_proc.launch file and pass in a qualified manager name -->
  <include file="$(find stereo_image_proc)/launch/stereo_image_proc.launch" ns="stereo">
    <arg name="manager" value="/pipeline" />
  </include>

</launch>

This only works if your left and right image topics are named /stereo/left/image_raw and /stereo/right/image_raw, and the images are synchronized and have timestamps that match exactly. If your timestamps don't match exactly you'll need to use approximate sync, which means modifying stereo_image_proc.launch (see the TODO in the file), or creating your own stereo launch file with the correct parameters.
