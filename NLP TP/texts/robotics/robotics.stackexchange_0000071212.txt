A:

Have you check the permission of serial port?
ll /dev/ttyUSB*

If the permission is not to be read,
sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB*

After that,you can start to run the sample.
terminal 1:
roslaunch rplidar_ros rplidar.launch

terminal 2:
rosrun rplidar_ros rplidarNodeClient

And the terminal 2 will show the rplidar scanner's data.
