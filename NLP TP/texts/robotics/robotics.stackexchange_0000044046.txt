Q:

Error compiling ar_bounding_box

Trying to compile ar_bounding_box in order to use roboearth I get the following error:
... roboearth/latest/object_scanning/ar_bounding_box src/ar_kinect_extractobject.cpp:43:34: fatal error: pcl/common/transform.h: No such file or directory
Does anyone know how to fix this ?

Do you have pcl installed?

Definitely

A:

Please always provide information such as the ros version you are using and have a look at the support guidelines.
Assuming that you are using Fuerte, I guess that the package you are trying to compile hasn't been updated yet. I cannot find a file transform.h in pcl so I think that it has been renamed. Try editing the file ar_kinect_extraobject.cpp and change the include line to include transforms.h.  Since the package doesn't seem to be ported yet, I would expect further problems, not just this include line.
