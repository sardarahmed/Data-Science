Q:

Does rtabmap deal with moving objects?

I was reading this guide:
http://wiki.ros.org/rtabmap_ros/Tutorials/HandHeldMapping
I am unsure whether rtabmap supports moving objects (for example, after generating a map, if a chair moves, or if the mapping captured a person who is moving, do these things throw off rtabmap's localization)?

A:

Hi,
If the moved object has a lot of discriminative visual features and it takes a big part of the field of view, it may cause a wrong global localization when seen again in a different location. Example in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8v70DZxLF8. The same problem can happen between locations looking very similar. As shown in the video, it is possible to detect such loop closure detection / localization failures with approaches keeping the map's graph consistent.
cheers
