Q:

The way accept software from packages.ros.org

I found first step of ROS installation is to setup your sources.list, so we can install or update from apt-get command, but I am wondering what's the kind of this repository.
I found Repositories/Ubuntu. I think the ROS one may be extras repository or partner repositories. which one is right. thanks for your help.

A:

Canonical, the makers of Ubuntu, would consider the ROS package repository an "Extras" repository. As described on that page,

There are times when you might want to add extra repositories to your system's software sources (that is, in addition to the repositories provided by Canonical).

That's exactly what the ROS repository is. It's an extra repository that is not provided by Canonical.
