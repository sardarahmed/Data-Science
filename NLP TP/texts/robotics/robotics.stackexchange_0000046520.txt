Q:

Sick lms 200 interface

Hello!
I am very new to robotics society, so I apologize for this silly question. I have a sick lms 200 (laser rangefinder) which is not connected to robot yet. I have just connected it to computer and I am able to get data from it by use of drivers produced by sick company. But, I need to interface with it through c++ or MATLAB. Also my system is windows and not LINUX. I do not have that much knowledge of computer science. The ROS developed code is for linux and The ARIA developed codes for interfacing with sick, seems to be written for a robot mounted sick. Therefore, I am not able to use them, because there is no robot installed yet. I will truly appreciate if anyone could help me on this problem. I am confused and I do not know what to do.
Your friend, Ali

A:

You do not need to have a mobile or other robot to use the ROS interface to SICK lasers.   See http://wiki.ros.org/sicktoolbox_wrapper/Tutorials/UsingTheSicklms for a tutorial on setting up the ROS interface for the laser.
Running ROS on a supported version of Ubuntu Linux is easiest, since most of the ROS documentation, packages, etc. are all for Linux.  See  http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation and click on the Ubuntu link.  On that page note what versions of Ubuntu it says are supported by the current ROS release.
