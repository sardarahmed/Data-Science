Q:

How to build a topological map based on grid map

hi, guys
Recently, I successfully built a grid map based on Gmapping algorithm and marked some grids(x,y coordinate value) which I think should be topological node. Then how to build a topological map using these nodes and grid map? Is there a package to solve this.
Many thanks!
