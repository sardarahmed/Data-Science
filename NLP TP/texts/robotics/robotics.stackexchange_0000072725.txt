Q:

Installing ackermann vehicle package with Indigo

I am trying to install the ackermann vehicle package from the main repository  using
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-ackermann-vehicle

However, I am getting a 404 error

Is this package still maintained in Indigo? or is it obsolete?
Thanks,

A:

It looks like your apt-cache is out of date, and it's trying to download a previous version of the package.
Try updating your apt cache before installing:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-ackermann-vehicle

After updating the apt-cache (apt-get update) the ackermann-vehicle has disappeared, i.e. now I get after
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-ackermann-vehicle

E: Unable to locate package ros-indigo-ackermann-vehicle

(1/3) I'm not sure what happened, but the ackermann_* pkgs came out of wunderkammer, and some time ago all of it was deleted. The ROS Index page shows some info.

(2/3) The github organisation also seems to have been removed. here is the original announcement of the packages.

(3/3) And apparently jbpassot/ackermann_vehicle is a fork (which seems like it is the 'top fork' at the moment).

It looks like the package was removed by the author: https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/commit/4630294aee35d3df3200e58ef1de178fdbe89e1d

Yeah, that's when I noticed it. Does anyone know why?
Btw: here is a (random) fork of steered_wheel_base_controller.

Hm, from the rosdistro PR:

Would it be possible to put a copy of these repos in another organization for archival access?

Sorry, but no, that would defeat the purpose of deleting the repositories.
