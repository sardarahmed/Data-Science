Q:

fuerte rospack package/stack not found

hi, today i found that my "rospack" cannot find any existing package / stack inside my sandbox! My ROS_PACKAGE_PATH is correct, so I don't know what's wrong with my fuerte, and I am using Ubuntu12.04... because yesterday i tried to install Moveit (for groovy) into my fuerte,  does it matter? and I want to know how to fix it!... thanks!

A:

Add it again.
$ rospack profile
$ rospack find package 

It could be that Moveit has overwritten some things in your bashrc but if the rest of the package paths are okay this is not the problem.
