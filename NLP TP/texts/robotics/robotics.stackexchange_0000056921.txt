Q:

UnicodeEncodeError while installing ROS on Debian

Hi all,
I am trying to instal ROS hydro on a Debian system following the guide on the wiki.
When I executed:
./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install --install-space /opt/ros/hydro

I got this error:
==> Processing catkin package: 'catkin'
Makefile exists, skipping explicit cmake invocation...
==> make cmake_check_build_system in '/root/ros_catkin_ws/build_isolated/catkin'
==> make -j4 -l4 in '/root/ros_catkin_ws/build_isolated/catkin'
Unhandled exception of type 'UnicodeEncodeError':

    out.write(line)

<== Failed to process package 'catkin': 
  'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xc9' in position 3: ordinal not in range(128)

Does anybody know what to do here?

A:

I found an anwser:
It has something to to with using a different languages. For now, Japanese systems and French (mine) systems have found to give the bug. You can solve it by putting your system in English for a while.
root@xwzy:~/ros_catkin_ws# env | grep LANG
LANG=fr_BE.UTF-8
LANGUAGE=fr_BE:fr
root@xwzy:~/ros_catkin_ws# export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
root@anoesjka:~/ros_catkin_ws# env | grep LANG
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
LANGUAGE=fr_BE:fr

And then it works.
