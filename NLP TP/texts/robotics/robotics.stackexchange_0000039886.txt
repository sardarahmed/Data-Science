Q:

Does ros need a high performance gpu?

I want to make a robot like turtlebot,with kinect and a netbook,turtlebot's netbook has a discrete graphic.
I want to do 2d or 3d slam and navigation,then is opencv's image processing,does the netbook need a high performance gpu?Or I just need a good cpu?Atom N570 can be ok?
Thank you.

A:

For visualization, particularly of large point clouds (like are generated by the Kinect), you will need a pretty serious GPU.
Otherwise, you don't need a GPU at all. OpenCV, PCL, etc. are CPU libraries (although both have some experimental GPU features), as are all of the various ROS tools. I don't know enough about Atom CPUs to tell you if that particular one is enough; I can tell you that (save visualization), I've used pretty old netbooks with a lot of success.

Thank you!I think I'll do visualization in another PC,but needs data transmission.

If you'll be transmitting the point clouds wirelessly, you'll need a pretty serious pipe. PCL has some point-cloud-compression stuff that helps. (Basically, point clouds are lots of data; you have to pay somewhere).
