Q:

ros_gz_bridge does not publish on ros2 topic

I am running ros_gz_bridge to read some data from Gazebo, in particular I have run:
ros2 run ros_gz_bridge parameter_bridge /model/x500_vision_0/odometry@nav_msgs/msg/Odometry[gz.msgs.Odometry

[INFO] [1706113773.667589591] [ros_gz_bridge]: Creating GZ->ROS Bridge: [/model/x500_vision_0/odometry (gz.msgs.Odometry) -> /model/x500_vision_0/odometry (nav_msgs/msg/Odometry)] (Lazy 0)

The problem is that when I run
ros2 topic echo /model/x500_vision_0/odometry

I do not see any message published on the topic.
I have already checked that the name of the topic is correct, and when I run
gz topic -et /model/x500_vision_0/odometry

I can see the messages exchanged within Gazebo.
So why is the bridge not publishing the messages on the ROS2 network?
EDIT:
Some more info about my setup.
I am working with ROS2 Humble and with Gazebo Sim version 7.7.0:
 gz sim --version
Gazebo Sim, version 7.7.0
Copyright (C) 2018 Open Source Robotics Foundation.
Released under the Apache 2.0 License.

I have installed Gazebo trough the apt package provided with ros2:
sudo apt install ros-humble-ros-gz

The world that I am running is a custom world that includes some static objects and a quadrotor equipped with the odometry plugin.
It all run inside a Docker based on the image osrf/ros:humble-desktop

A:

I solved the issue.
I thought I was working with Gazebo Fortress, but a software I was working with installed Gazebo Garden instead.
When I installed the ros-gz-bridge from the apt repository, it installed only the supported package that is officially supported by ROS Humble, which is the Gazebo Fortress one.
I installed the ros-gz-bridge from sources and now the bridge is working as expected.
