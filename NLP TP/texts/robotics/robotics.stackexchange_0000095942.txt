Q:

Setting ROSCONSOLE_FORMAT in travis.yml?

Travis runs substitutions on dollar signs, so a ROSCONSOLE_FORMAT like the following doesn't propagate properly into the system:
env:
  global:
    - ROSCONSOLE_FORMAT=[${severity}] ${time} ${file}:${line} ${node}: ${message}

It also needs to get put into Docker container/s that travis runs, in commands like
- docker exec ... -e ROSCONSOLE_FORMAT=${ROSCONSOLE_FORMAT} ... ${DOCKER_IMAGE_REPO}:${DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG}

I'll cross post this to an answers site that has travis questions if no one knows here.

A:

Single quotes were it as commented above (triple single quotes also work, double quotes do not work, you'll see a lot of [][:]: or similar depending on the exact format string):
- ROSCONSOLE_FORMAT='[${severity}] ${time} ${file}:${line} ${node}: ${message}'

I made an simple example to experiment with:
