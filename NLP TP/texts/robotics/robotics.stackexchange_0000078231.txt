Q:

unable to load msg: invalid name

Hi,
Using Ubuntu 16.04, ROS Kinetic and Python, I've created a msg in ~/catkin_ws/src/roboti_pi/msg: Num.msg with content:
int32[] data
My code to use this message:
a = Num()
a.data = [1, 2, 3]
This somehow gives an error for Num() so from ~/catkin_ws, I checked as shown at http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingMsgAndSrv with "rosmsg show src/roboti_pi/msg/Num and the result is
unable to load msg [src/roboti_pi/msg/Num]: invalid name [src/roboti_pi/msg/Num]
But what's invalid about it?
Thanks,
hvn
