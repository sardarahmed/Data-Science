Q:

auto-starting new master

Why does roslaunch auto-start a new master for every remote machine?
Things I've tried:
-playing w/ every variation of default tag for machines defined in the .launch
Things that work but extremely painful at our scale:
-hard coding ROS_MASTER_URI in the /opt/ros/fuerte/env.sh
I'm on the latest fuerte.
Cheers,
-Willy

I think this was a bug in roslaunch in Fuerte. I suggest upgrading to a newer version of ROS.

Below you said that it was fixed. Is that not the case?

A:

According to this question this is fixed in ros-comm 1.8.14. Can yo confirm that you have that version or later of ros-comm ? ( dpkg -l ros-fuerte-ros-comm )

Yup. Saw that thread. I'm up to date on all machines:

Any other thoughts?
