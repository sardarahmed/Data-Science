Q:

Kinect ~ Virtual Booth

Is there a way I can crop the tracking area? Like where it only tracks someone skeleton in the specific area, so if someone is in the certain depth and certain X/Y value it will track them. If they walk out it drops that person from being tracked.

This sounds like a NITE question.  I suggest that you ask on the openni-dev mailing list.
