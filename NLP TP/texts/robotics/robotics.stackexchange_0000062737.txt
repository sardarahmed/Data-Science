Q:

rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py _port:=/dev/ttyACM0 on RasPi giving "could not open port /dev/ttyUSB0" error

I have installed rosserial_arduino on my RasPi and my Arduino code for Push Button has been uploaded successfully.
To run the code, I am following the following steps as mentioned in the tutorial:

Startup roscore using roscore
Run the run the rosserial_python serial_node.py using rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py _port:=/dev/ttyUSB0
Watch button status on rostopic echo pushed

Now, the issue here is that when I try step 2 using rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py _port:=/dev/ttyACM0 (my Arduino is on ACM0), the error message I receive is
[ERROR] [WallTime: 1411295710.119812] Error opening serial: could not open port /dev/ttyUSB0: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/dev/ttyUSB0'
For some reason, it keeps taking USB0 as the input even if I specify ACM0 as the port. This error does not occur on my Ubuntu 14.04 distro running Indigo. My RasPi is running Groovy.
I have also added the necessary group permissions (adding user to dialout, etc.) but to no avail. Please suggest methods to solve this issue.

Thanks to ahendrix for having found out the problem. But there is a follow up issue here. Please check.

A:

I think in the Groovy version, the serial port was passed directly as an argument, rather than as a ROS parameter. Try:
rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM0

You deserve a cookie. That worked.
But it gives an error of Failed Packet Flags. Any thoughts?

I think the rosserial message format changed at some point. You should check that you're running a groovy version of the rosserial arduino library and the arduino sketch.

Yeah, I checked that. It's all groovy.
