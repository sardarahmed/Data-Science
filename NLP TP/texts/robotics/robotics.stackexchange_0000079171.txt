Q:

rqt_plot has a Qt4 and Qt5 conflict

The latest update seems to have a problem with qt4 vs qt5 but it could be something else that updated along with all the kinetc updates.
When I try to launch rqt_plot I get the following, the RuntimeError at the end shows up for other projects as well:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/kinetic/bin/rqt_plot", line 6, in <module>
    from rqt_plot.plot import Plot

A:

It is a problem with pyqtgraph. You can use rqt_plot without pyqtgraph. It will use MatPlot then. Uninstall pyqtgraph with:
sudo apt remove python-pyqtgraph

If you want to use pyqtgraph anyways, consider to install the newest version from github as mentioned in this post: https://answers.ros.org/question/236924/pyqtgraph-not-working-in-ros-kinetic/
