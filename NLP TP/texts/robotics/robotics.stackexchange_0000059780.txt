Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Segway Driver

I was able to install the Segwayrmp driver and get it to work properly. But now it is showing a 'checksum mismatch' error.
Any solution to this problem?

A:

If I remember correctly this occurs when there is invalid data sent from the segway device and typically this means some sort of problem with the usb device. I remember debugging this once and finding lots of messages about usb failures in dmesg. If you are using USB to connect to the segway, try passing it through a powered USB hub or rethinking your power system to try and identify places where your could have different grounds.

Additionally. If the checksum mismtach error only shows once, don't worry about it. That's typical. If it shows up more than once, then you probably have a problem.
