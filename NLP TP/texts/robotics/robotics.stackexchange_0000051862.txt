Q:

Change path of rosrun. Couldn't find executables?

I am following tutorials of ROS at the ROS wiki
//www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/ExaminingPublisherSubscriber. 

When I try to run rosrun beginner_tutorials talker. It tells me that:
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named talker below /home/maverick/catkin_ws/install/share/beginner_tutorials

I know that the executable is not in the install folder but rather in devel. How can I make it search for rosrun beginner_tutorial talker in
devel/lib/beginner_tutorials/talker

Additional information: When I ran find -executable -type f the output is given as below:
*./devel/lib/beginner_tutorials/add_two_ints_client
./devel/lib/beginner_tutorials/talker
./devel/lib/beginner_tutorials/add_two_ints_server
./devel/lib/beginner_tutorials/listener
./devel/_setup_util.py
./devel/env.sh
./install/_setup_util.py
./install/env.sh
./build/CMakeFiles/CompilerIdC/a.out
./build/CMakeFiles/CompilerIdCXX/a.out
./build/CMakeFiles/CMakeDetermineCompilerABI_C.bin
./build/CMakeFiles/CMakeDetermineCompilerABI_CXX.bin
./build/catkin_generated/installspace/_setup_util.py
./build/catkin_generated/installspace/env.sh
./build/catkin_generated/setup_cached.sh
./build/catkin_generated/env_cached.sh*

After using the env | grep ROS_PACKAGE_PATH I get:
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/opt/ros/groovy/share:/opt/ros/groovy/stacks

and I have sourced the file using the following command:
source ./devel/setup.bash

Please post more info, i.e. output of $ env | grep ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. Also check whether you did source appropriate setup.bash file or not.

I have edited my question up there and have posted my output to $ env| grep ROS_PACKAGE_PATH . Also I have sourced the file using the command source ./devel/setup.bash

Something doesn't match. Did you source the setup.bash after the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH display? Did you run catkin_make?
Comment by Asfandyar Ashraf Malik on 2013-06-11:
Yes I did all of this. Even after this I am still getting the same errors. When I do roscd beginner_tutorials I get /catkin_ws/install/share/beginner_tutorials$. Why is roscd checking always in the install folder. It should check in the devel because my executables are there. How can I change this.

I had the same error and this is same of the things I did. 1.Delete the build and devel folder with our your working directory. 2.Make sure that all that you have followed the overall order and structure with in you CMakeList http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/CMakeLists.txt 3.Include all the package needed

I'm still having a problem saying
 [rosrun] Couldn't find executable named run_emvs below /home/ubuntu/emvs_ws/src/rpg_emvs/mapper_emvs

I followed the installation guide in here !

A:

The ROS_PACKAGE_PATH is wrong - it should also include the path to overlay, i.e. to your catkin workspace.
If ROS_PACKAGE_PATH didn't change after $ source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash then there is something wrong with your overlay. Try to recreate it.
UPDATE:
This tutorial may also help. In case you are using install space you have to source setup.bash from it.
At any rate it will be better to recreate workspace and try again with $ source devel/setup.sh

Asfandyar, did you resolve the problem. I have been following the same steps but I am unable to do that.
Comment by Abdul Mannan on 2016-11-14:
To me it seems that this method does not work.
Comment by JÃ¤germeister on 2019-02-19:
This isn't the solution. I have both of source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash
source ~/ros_ws/devel/setup.bash these and I still run into the same problem.
