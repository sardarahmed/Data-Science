Q:

Debugger recommendation

Can anyone recommend a Linux-based C++ debugger to use with ROS?  I'm using Ubuntu 10.4 with electric.

A:

I think, there are no options here. GDB is pretty good for it. You can use IDE (KDevelop, as example, it handles with CMake system by default) or graphical front-end (ddd or something like this), if console is too uncomfortable.
