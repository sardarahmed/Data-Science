Q:

How to: Use source installed version of Gazebo

I have ROS kinetic installed with gazebo_ros and all but I have to modify the simulator in order to skip this error.
How can I use the newly source copiled version of Gazebo 7?

A:

you should be able to just install gazebo and export the LD_LIBRARY_PATH accordingly so that the source install version is used. If you build gazebo in a catkin workspace then sourcing the workspace setup file should take care of the paths.

Thanks for the answer. this would work if I am trying to use ros with it? I need to use gazebo_ros, which uses the default version and I don't know how to override it.

That worked, thanks. So my question is answered but I still have to find out how to spawn my robot in there because I cannot for now.
