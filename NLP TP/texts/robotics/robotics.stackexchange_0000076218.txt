Q:

How to change from Python to PyPy to compile ROS Node?

I have a package where the nodes are written in python using rospy and other python modules. But lately i realized that PyPy is a better alternative than the default python interpreter.
Basically, i want to change the interpreter such that when I run
"rosrun pkg_name node_name", it will run using the PyPy interpreter instead of the Python Interpreter. I am guessing that this might be possible if I make some changes in the CMakeLists.txt file. Any help ?

A:

Given that significant parts of the ROS libraries use the cpython API, this would necessitate a significant rewrite to use pypy.
