Q:

GpuRaySensor.hh missing in 1.3?

Looks like GpuRaySensor.hh went missing in Gazebo 1.3. I checked out the lastest source from the repo:
~/src/gazebo$ ls gazebo/sensors/Gpu*
gazebo/sensors/GpuRaySensor.cc  gazebo/sensors/GpuRaySensor.hh

But in my installed (Ubuntu package), there is no more GpuRaySensor:
/usr/include/gazebo-1.3$ ls gazebo/sensors/Gpu*
ls: cannot access gazebo/sensors/Gpu*: No such file or directory

Pretty sure it was there in 1.2 and earlier as I had compiled worked on an extension to the base GpuRaySensor class.
Update
Because I am impatient, I tried pulling in the relevant sources into my sensor that were missing from installed Gazebo 1.3 (GpuRaySensor.hh/.cc, GpuLaser.hh/.cc). But then ran into the following compile error:
In file included from .../plugins/src/GpuLaser.cc:27:0:
/usr/include/gazebo-1.3/gazebo/rendering/ogre_gazebo.h:22:18: fatal error: Ogre.h: No such file or directory

Looks like Ogre.h is in,
/usr/include/OGRE

Not in,
/usr/include

Ultimately is this why GpuLaser didn't make it into 1.3?

A:

Here's a gpu_sensors branch that should at least compile for you.
Opened an issue and a pull request.
It was not merged because we didn't get a chance to remove rendering::GpuLaser dependency on sensors::GpuRaySensor.  Work in progress (see the pull request above).
