Q:

hector_mapping_parameters

Hello !
I used hector_mapping with a simulated robot. Firstly, I used the default values for all parameters specified on the ROS website http://wiki.ros.org/hector_mapping for hector_mapping.
But now, I would like to tune these parameters and I don't understand what the map_multi_res_levels parameter is supposed to do ?
If anyone could help me, I will be grateful.

A:

The slam present in the hector package use multiple maps for position estimation. Theses maps each have different resolution (divided by 2 I think).
So, if you have a resolution of 0.01, and map_multi_res_levels = 3, you will have :

a map with resolution of 0.01
a map with resolution of 0.02
a map with resolution of 0.04

The algorithme will use these 3 maps to compute the best position estimation.
