Q:

Installing tum_ardrone with catkin_make

Hi,
I'm new to ROS and having trouble setting up tum_ardrone for use with the Parrot Drone Quadcopter. I've installed ROS Hyrdro on Ubuntu version 12.04 and followed all the beginner tutorials with no problems. I've installed the pre-requites but when I try to install the tum_ardrone package as told to on their wiki by running, I get problems when running the following line:
rosdep install tum_ardrone

It spits out the the following error.
ERROR: Rosdep cannot find all required resources to answer your query
Missing resource tum_ardrone
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/hydro/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/opt/ros/hydro/share
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/hydro/stacks

The link to the wiki with install instructions is here: link text
The instructions extract is below.
cd catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/tum-vision/tum_ardrone.git -b hydro-devel
cd ..
rosdep install tum_ardrone
catkin_make

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Jonathan

I think the setup instructions assume that you've sourced the workspace before you begin.

Thanks for the help, that fixed the ROS path errors, however it still can't find the resource tum_ardrone when running the line below. Do I have to manually tell rosdep where that folder is or something if it can't find it?
rosdep install tum_ardrone

From the tutorials I have seen using catkin_make though, they never use rosdep. They just git clone the link, go to the catkin_ws directory and then catkin_make. I've also tried this however the make fails as well.

From your catkin_ws directory, you may want to try: rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src instead.

Okay, finally got it working so apologies for the late reply, I will post a solution to my question below in case other beginners have the same problem. Is there a way to not have to source the workspace every time I fire up my computer though?
Comment by ahendrix on 2014-08-21:
You can edit your shell's startup script, (usually ~/.bashrc) to include the source command so that you don't have to type it by hand each time.

A:

If anyone else if having this same problem, I had two issues:

Sourcing the workspace: running the following line before attempting the instructions worked for me and got rid of the missing rospath errors.
source ~/catkin-ws/devel/setup.bash

Running rosdep update after the git clone command - rosdep needed to be update of the package just downloaded into the folder to recognise it was there.

A big thanks to ahendrix to helping with this! Definitely got the ball rolling in the right direction!
