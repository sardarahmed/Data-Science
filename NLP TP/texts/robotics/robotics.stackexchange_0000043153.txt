Q:

how to publish kinect laser scan 2d image in a browser

Hello.. I am interested in publishing a kinect laser scan in a  browser to be broadcast over the internet. Something that is close to a player laser scan image or a rviz 2dnav image would be perfect. I am currently using WebUi to control my turtlebot with button control for cmd_vel and a video cam feed to view the environment. But I would like to transmit the kinect 2dnav scan like in rviz to get a idea of where I might be in a saved map with a view of the current laser scan in the browser. I was thinking about a screen image broadcast of the rviz window in place of a webcam image but I hope that someone on here might be able to point me to better solution.

A:

rosjs / rosbridge are probably your best bet. This uses javascript to talk to a ROS master over the internet. There's a barebones tutorial on how to use the rosbridge visualization stuff here that can probably get you started: http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosjs_tutorials/Tutorials/Visualization

Thanks Jonathan for the reply... I have known about rosjs and all the cool features coming out of the stack. But was intimidated on approaching it on my own but now seems like a better time than ever. Your link is definitely the place to start, do you know of any good examples that might be useful?

You can probably look at wviz: http://www.ros.org/wiki/wviz Unfortunately, their tutorials appear to be hollow.
