Q:

Using MoveIt to solve COM based Inverse Kinematic

Dear ROS users
Is it possible to use MoveIt to solve inverse kinematic of a manipulator based on position of arm center of mass (COM) in task space?
For example, consider a double inverted pendulum. Can MoveIt give us joint angles that sets the total center of mass of robot (double inverted pendulum) to specific feasible point in workspace?
Thanks for your considerations

Hi Masoud,
This is currently not possible from MoveIt! but as the COM and mass can be specified for each link in the URDF and are available on the parameter server, it should be possible. A package that does forward calculation of the COM can be found here, but I haven't used it so I don't know how well it works.
