Q:

What is the fix for 'No p gain specified for pid. Namespace: /gazebo_ros_control/pid_gains/back_right_wheel_joint ' ros melodic?

Hi,
I am using gazebo_ros_control package from ROS melodic. I am geting error like
[ERROR] [1528754765.222507207, 9.660000000]: No p gain specified for pid.  Namespace: /gazebo_ros_control/pid_gains/back_right_wheel_joint 

I believe I may need to change something in yaml file but I am quite not sure what do I need to change. Can somebody please point me out?
Thanks.
