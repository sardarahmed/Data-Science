Q:

Autocomplete rospy

I am learning how to programming in ROS hydro for my master thesis. I want to use auto complete of rospy libraries in an editor. I can enter commands like catkin_make, roslaunch from terminal, it is not problem.  I tried Sublime Text 2 with  SublimeJEDI. I added "python_package_paths": ["/opt/ros/hydro/lib/python2.7/dist-packages"],  line to sublime_jedi.sublime-settings. It didn't autocomplete but when I removed this line and added another folder that contains my own code it autocompletes statement like charm. After that, I tried PyDev.  I added that path as a library folder. PyDev autocompletes but when I traverse in list, Eclipse freezes and stops working. Is there any way to use autocomplete when using rospy ?

I setup Eclipse the way described here and it works great. Have you tried that?
