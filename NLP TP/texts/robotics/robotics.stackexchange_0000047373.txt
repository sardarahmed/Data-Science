Q:

roscd pointing to wrong location

Edit: Ah hah, this turned out to be a package problem, not a rospack problem. Sorry!
I have a package in an overlay. This same package exists in the /opt stacks.  My ROS_PACKAGE_PATH has the overlay before the /opt stacks.
/home/vchwang/ros_workspace/sandbox:/opt/ros/electric/stacks:/opt/ros/electric/ros

However, roscd still points to the one in /opt. As a result, rosmake refuses to build the package in my overlay. How do I change this?
Some more info:
Even after running rospack profile, my rospack_cache claims the package sbpl is in /opt/ros/electric/stacks/arm_navigation/sbpl. If I go into ~/ros_workspace/sandbox/sbpl and rosmake, I get:
[ rosmake ] No package selected and the current directory is not the correct path for package 'sbpl'.

Please try to provide enough information for us to reproduce your error.  http://www.ros.org/wiki/Support You're saying it's doing the wrong thing, and people are guessing in the dark.

if you solved the problem, answer yourself and close the question.

Can you post the whole rosmake message include the shell prompt?

A:

Turns out I was getting the wrong version of the package, which did not contain a manifest file.
