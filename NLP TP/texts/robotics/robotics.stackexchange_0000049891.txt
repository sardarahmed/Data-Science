Q:

ROSARIA Tutorial Groovy catkin_make issue

I've been running through this tutorial for a few days, i'm now seeing a few mistakes I made [not installing the Aria-2.7.2 file and Mobilesim-0.5.0 (as I'm not attached to a robot at the moment)] but I've done all that now(the ROSARIA tutorial should probably point out that you should do that ahead of time but I suppose I just skipped that step). Now when I've made my workspace and I use the catkin_make command in the ~/catkin_ws directory everything runs fine until I get to
    [ 83%] Built target ROSARIA_gencfg
Linking CXX executable /home/****/catkin_ws/devel/lib/ROSARIA/RosAria
/usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible /usr/local/Aria/lib/libAria.so when searching for -lAria
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lAria
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
make[2]: *** [/home/****/catkin_ws/devel/lib/ROSARIA/RosAria] Error 1
make[1]: *** [amor-ros-pkg/ROSARIA/CMakeFiles/RosAria.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2
Invoking "make" failed

and now I don't know what I can do to fix it.
Can anyone help?

A:

Maybe you've installed wrong version of ARIA (32 bit version on 64 bit machine or vice versa). Please, update python-rosdep package (or rosdep through pip) to version 0.10.15. Then run
rosdep update
rosdep install ROSARIA

This should install ARIA automatically. After that catkin_make should work.

I've tried rosdep install ROSARIA
ERROR: Rosdep cannot find all required resources to answer your query
Missing resource ROSARIA
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/groovy/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/opt/ros/groovy/share
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/groovy/stacks
this is what it spits back obviously these paths exist.

also this initial error would be in the tutorial 1.5, the first step. I will have to make sure I have the correct Aria version installed

Alright I made sure the Aria was up to date and the correct version for my computer and everything seems to work now. Thanks!
