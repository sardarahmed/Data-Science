Q:

How to solve '[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named orb_template.py below /opt/ros/fuerte/share/object_recognition_core'?

I try to run object_recognition on fuerte.
When I run:
  sam@sam:~/code/ros/pcl/pcl_3d_recognition$ rosrun object_recognition_core orb_template.py -o my_textured_plane
  [rosrun] Couldn't find executable named orb_template.py below /opt/ros/fuerte/share/object_recognition_core
  sam@sam:~/code/ros/pcl/pcl_3d_recognition$             

How to solve it?
Thank you~

A:

On my installation (checked-out following the instructions for fuerte here: http://ecto.willowgarage.com/recognition/), the orb_template.py resides in object_recognition_capture/apps. D.

Why object_recognition_capture is not a package? That caused me couldn't use rosrun to run orb_template.py.
