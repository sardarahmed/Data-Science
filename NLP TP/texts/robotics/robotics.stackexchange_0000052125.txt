Besides gmapping and RGBD SLAM, are there any other packages you can use for SLAM with the Kinect ?
Thank you

A:

Vslam (http://www.ros.org/wiki/vslam), but I wasn't able to install it. Maybe you'll be luckier! There's also Hector Mapping (http://www.ros.org/wiki/hector_mapping), but I read it doesn't work well with the Kinect (you would need a real laser scanner).
