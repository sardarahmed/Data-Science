Q:

Not able to install ROSARIA on Fuerte on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS?

OS: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64 bit
ROS: Fuerte
I tried following the ROSARIA tutorial on ROS Wiki.
The step where it tells you to use "roslocate info ROSARIA" does not work for me.
Then I use the command given below (on Fuerte):
$rosws set amor-ros-pkg https:_//code.google.com/p/amor-ros-pkg/ --hg
$rosws update amor-ros-pkg

It creates a package "amor-ros-pkg". But I am not able to find the package using rospack command:
$rospack find ROSARIA
[rospack] Error: stack/package ROSARIA not found

However this folder is already in the ros package path:
$echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
/home/swagat/ros_workspace/amor-ros-pkg:/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks:/opt/ros/fuerte/share:/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros

so basically I can not proceed further until I fix these problems.

remove the underscore in the beginning of URL.

Hello,
Try specifying the fuerte branch of rosaria manually:
rosws set amor-ros-pkg https://code.google.com/p/amor-ros-pkg/ --hg -v fuerte
then use rosws update, and confirm changes and follow instructions printed to update.

This worked for me and thanks for updating the tutorial :(http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROSARIA/Tutorials/How%20to%20use%20ROSARIA). I am now able to build ROSARIA Package. Thanks for the help.
