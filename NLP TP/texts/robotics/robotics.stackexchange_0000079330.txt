Mesh information (vertices, links, triangles) from model in Rviz

How could I obtain the mesh information rendered from a model from URDF/XACRO file after being rendered in Rviz?

A:

You can't. That is not supported in RViz.
I'd use a tool like Blender or Meshlab.

Edit: if with "links" you mean nr of links in the model / scene, then counting the nr of TF frames in your scene could give you that information, albeit a bit indirectly.
