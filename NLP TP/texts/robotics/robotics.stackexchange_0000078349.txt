Q:

Conversion from ROS timestamp to ISO-8601 time format

I would like to convert a ROS timestamp like this:
ros::Time stamp = ros::Time::now();

to string in ISO-8601 format.
The best resource I was able to google up so far is this topic:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7960318/math-to-convert-seconds-since-1970-into-date-and-vice-versa
Is there by any chance any function in ROS I can use instead of coding my own convertor?

A:

Something like this should work:
#include "boost/date_time/posix_time/posix_time.hpp"

boost::posix_time::ptime my_posix_time = ros::Time::now().toBoost();
std::string iso_time_str = boost::posix_time::to_iso_extended_string(my_posix_time)

Is it the ISO you are looking for? (Didn't test so please double-check syntax and result)
