Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: error rosrun

Hello,
I wish make this command "rosrun basic_robot_control joint_control" in my folder but when I make this, I have this problem:
[rospack] Error: stack/package basic_robot_control not found
Usage: joint_control loop/one Right/Left ros/file/ros+file [slow/normal/veryfast] [mirror]

[Error] Usage: joint_control loop/one Right/Left ros/file/ros+file [slow/normal/veryfast] [mirror]    (not 1 arguments)

I don't understand what's the problem. Can you help me ?!

A:

Please copy and paste what you are typing as well as state what your environment is.  Your error message and command do not agree. One says "basic_robot_control" one says "basic_control_robot" which is probably one of your errors.  You also appear to be passing the wrong arguments on the command line  (1 arguments vs 4 or 5 arguments.)
