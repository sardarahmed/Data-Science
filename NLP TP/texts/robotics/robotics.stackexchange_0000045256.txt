A:

I found this page.
First you should
$ svn co https://ipvs.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/roboearth/repos/public/tags/latest/re_msgs
and then rosmake that package.
(I already rosmake ths package successfully, so this should work for you. If you had SSL handshake failed issues, you can leave a comment, I met that issue when I was doing the first step.)
