Q:

Does ROS run on Windows?

Considering that 90% of desktops are (still) Windows-based, are there plans on making at least some parts of ROS run on that OS?

A:

Update
It is possible to install and use ROS Lunar on Windows 10 thanks to WSL:

This is the best way to use ROS on Windows right now, though it is not perfect.

Efforts are underway to bring ROS to Windows.  There is already the custom port done by REC and there should (soon) be mingw compatibility coming from an external contributor.  We are working on a longer-term overhaul of the build system to make Windows compatibility possible.  It's a large enough effort that we can't make any promises as to when, but we think there's a large enough community now to make this finally happen.

I believe it's important to recognise that ROSonWSL is not the same as having a native Win32/64 ROS. WSL does not have the same level of access to Windows resources, so 'driver' components wanting to access hw (usb, gpus for gpgpu fi) will not work (easily).
