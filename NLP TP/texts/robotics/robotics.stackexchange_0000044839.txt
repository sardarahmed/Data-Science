Q:

android_tutorial_teleop for TurtleBot

Hi I am trying to develop an application for TurtleBot I am trying to run the tutorial from android_core. First of all, the android_tutorial_pubsub seems to work fine as when I enter my master URI the app does respond with Hello World and the timer.
But then I encountered some problem on android_tutorial_teleop. At first when I touch the virtual joystick I received NullPointerException and the app crashes. I somehow fixed it by adding a line guided by one user here. But then even when I move the joystick around, the TurtleBot is unresponsive. Therefore I am wondering where is the problem? Do I have to run some commands first on the TurtleBot laptop and android_tutorial_teleop doesn't work on TurtleBot? I did follow the tutorial on TurtleBot bringup but to no help so far.

A:

First try running the keyboard teleop from a networked computer. That will help ensure your TurtleBot is operating correctly. Then I suggest digging into the system with the roswtf, rosgraph, and rostopic tools to diagnose the issue.
