Q:

Using ROS messages as types in another message

Hello,
I am a little confused about using messages as data types within another message.  Is this possible?  How does the system resolve the message type? I noticed that the Header message does not require a package name.

A:

Use package_name/MessageName. That external package must have a <depends> in your manifest.xml. If the included message is defined in the same package, you can leave off the package_name/.
Header is a special case.
