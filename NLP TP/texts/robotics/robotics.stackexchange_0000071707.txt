Q:

Launch files not copied into share folder by catkin_make

My launch-files do not get placed into the devel/share folder also I state inside CMakeLists.txt. The 4 files are inside the src//launch folder. 
   # install the launch files
     install(DIRECTORY launch/
        DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_SHARE_DESTINATION}/launch)

Try removing the last "/" in the install line.

A:

Launch files are not copied into the devel folder.
Using the install tag, they are installed in the respective folder in install, if you do a catkin_make install

I see: catkin_make install triggers install inside CMakeList. Still the question how to get them into devel?

you don't need them in devel. You use those from src, if you source devel/setup.bash.
