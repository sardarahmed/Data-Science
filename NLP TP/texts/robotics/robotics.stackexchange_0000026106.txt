Q:

libprofiler and libtcmalloc not found even the library exist

Hi, I'm trying to build gazebo from source. When I try to build, it says that libprofiler and libtcmalloc not found. But when i check, that 2 modules already exist in /usr/lib.
Any hint for this?

A:

You can safely ignore those messages. libprofiler and libtcmalloc are not required packages.
