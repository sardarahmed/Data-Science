Rosbag file location

Hello,
I would like to know where are rosbags saved to access them through my file explorer (if that is possible).
Thank you!

Hi, I found the answer here: http://wiki.ros.org/rosbag/Tutorials/Recording%20and%20playing%20back%20data
So it's necessary to create a directory to store the bag files: mkdir ~/bagfiles

Not really, when you record a bag file it will be stored at the same location as you were when doing rosbag record, the tutorial tells you to create the folder bagfile and then go to this new directory to have your bagfile at this location. If you are not in the folder bagfiles when issuing rosbag record, it won't be stored there.
You can use the argument -o to add a prefix to the bagfile name, if you specify an absolute path from then you can choose the location :
rosbag record -a -o $HOME/bagfiles/

This command will save your bagfile in your ~/bagfiles folder regardless of which directory you are currently in.

Perfect! Now I understand.
