Q:

WSL: Trouble running turtlesim_node

Hi, I get the following error when I'm trying to run the turtlesim_node in the beginner tutorial. I'm using ROS melodic on the Linux subsystem for Windows 10 and using tmux to run my multiple terminal sessions.
Error message:
QStandardPaths: XDG_RUNTIME_DIR not set, defaulting to '/tmp/runtime-user'
qt.qpa.screen: QXcbConnection: Could not connect to display
Could not connect to any X display.

In cases you are not aware of this, if you are looking a ROS installation working on Windows, there is a Windows version of Melodic ready to use. http://wiki.ros.org/Installation/Windows

A:

WSL cannot run graphical applications out-of-the-box. You'll need to install an X server on the Windows side.
People appear to have had success with VcXsrv or xming.

Please note that ROS on WSL is not a supported combination and it's always unclear how well the networking stack is working in WSL. You may run into issues, even with a working X server setup.

Yes, I installed VcXsrv and it appears to work, somewhat. I think I'll have to do some more research to tweak it to work with no error messages. The GUI at least works. Thank you!!
