Q:

How to fix error "E: Unable to locate package ros-lunar-desktop"?

Trying to install Lunar ROS for Uduntu on Dell Inspiron 300 laptop.
Keep getting:
"E: Unable to locate package ros-lunar-desktop"
Followed these instructions from ROS lunar site:

sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'

sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-key 421C365BD9FF1F717815A3895523BAEEB01FA116

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install ros-lunar-desktop-full

Also tried smaller lunars, but they gave same error.  Also, tried:
apt-cache search ros-lunar
To check, to no avail.
Looked up similar issues but solutions were not specific to this issue.
Tried on a different laptop, same model and getting same issue.
New to linux and need help with solution install of lunar ROS please.
Thank you.

Which OS is this? And which version? Can you add the output of lsb_release -a to your question? Use the edit button/link.

Output of lsb_releas -a
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID:   Ubuntu
Description:      Ubuntu 17.10
Release:           17.10
Codename:       artful
OS =  Ubuntu
Version = 17.10

A:

Ubuntu 17.10 is not a supported platform for Lunar. See REP 3 It only support 16.04, 16.10, and 17.04.

Thank you very much!   I see 17.04 no longer exists (end of life).  Any suggestions as to which I should install that will work. This is my first time and I would like to make sure it works with ROS on my system.  Thanks again!

I'd recommend Xenial 16.04 the LTS Ubuntu release
