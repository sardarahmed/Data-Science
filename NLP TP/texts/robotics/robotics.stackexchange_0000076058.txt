A:

I'm guessing -- as you didn't tell us -- that you are trying to follow the Installation/Source instructions for Kinetic (but the initial steps are pretty similar for other ROS releases). If so, I think you've misinterpreted the shown commands.
Step 1.1 (Prerequisites - Installing bootstrap dependencies) asks you to run:
$ sudo apt-get install python-rosdep python-rosinstall-generator python-wstool python-ros
install build-essential

Perhaps the layout could be improved, but that is supposed to be a single line, like so:
$ sudo apt-get install python-rosdep python-rosinstall-generator python-wstool python-rosinstall build-essential

Note python-rosinstall, not python-ros.
There is no package python-ros (at least not in ROS), hence the error message you received.
In general: the wiki prefixes commands with either $ or #. This is standard Linux 'terminology': the $ is for commands executed as a normal user, the # for commands executed as root.
This same formatting also gives you a hint where commands begin and end: everything following a $ or # is a single command, even if it is line-wrapped. In your case there is only a single $, so everything following it should be on a single line.

oh!!! Thank you, thank you, thank you! this is infact totally my misinterpretation.
--- Yes: please change the build from source step to "$ sudo apt-get install python-rosdep python-rosinstall-generator python-wstool python-rosinstall build-essential"

so I cannot build from source with the Indigo release base?

I'm not sure I understand you: what makes you think that?

Yes: please change the build from source step to [..]

I also don't completely understand this: the wiki already has all the packages on a single line, it's your browser that wraps it so it becomes two lines.

yes thanks the wrap occurred at an inconvenient point
and ->
root@ubuntu:~# printenv | grep ROS_DISTRO
ROS_DISTRO=indigo
so I'm good! Thanks!

Good to hear your got it to work.
Comment by mark.douglas@nxp.com on 2016-09-01:
fantastic support!!!
--- I now have been able to run the tutorials (well the ones that don't depend on the pre-built tutorial package) and appear to have a fully running "Bare Bones" install of ROS on the NXP LS2088ARDB (ARMv8 A72) and the LS2080ARDB (ARMv8 A57) targets.

I am not sure what to do about the "$ sudo apt-get install ros--ros-tutorials" package as these are prolly NOT ARMv8 binaries :-)

Very nice. I think the users over at discourse.ros.org/c/embedded would be interested in hearing that. You could perhaps submit a short post detailing any obstacles you encountered, or anything you changed to the installation instructions.
