Q:

audio_common not catkinized?

Trying to migrate to catkin.
I have packages that depend on things in audio_common.
Is audio_common going to be migrated or deprecated?
Are there any good alternatives?
Any information would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Ryan

Not an official answer, but I expect it will be maintained and migrated. There are probably lots of users.

That's fine. I can get along without it until Hydro. Thanks for the info.

A:

@ahendrix recently catkinized audio_common for Hydro, I think he can comment on it when he gets back from Germany.
