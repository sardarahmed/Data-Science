Q:

Can not use xtion pro live

I can't use the xtion pro live with usb ID 1d27:0601 on openni_launch
but the openni sample(downloaded from openni.org) seems to work
does anyone have the same problems?
I attached messages below.

Thanks Alireza, openni.launch seems to work. But there are some diffs between primesense-sensor and ps-engine. Is it occurred problem?
Comment by Alireza on 2012-12-14:
ps-engine deb package which is exist in ROS repositories is especially for kinect sensor!

That link to the OpenNI website is dead.  Google found this on GitHub: https://github.com/PrimeSense/Sensor   Check what version of openni-sensor-primesense-bin you have, mine was already Version: 5.1.0.41-1.1+lucid2
