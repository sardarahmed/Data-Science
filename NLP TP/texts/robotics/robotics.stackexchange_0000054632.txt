Q:

rosmsg show beginner_tutorials/Num canâ€˜t work

In the tutorial Creating a ROS msg and srv ,in the 2.2 chapter, when I input the
rosmsg show beginner_tutorials/Num

I can't see:
int64 num

And when I input the
rosmsg show Num

I can't see
[beginner_tutorials/Num]:

A:

I don't know why your method doesn't work. But I finally figured out the problem. Before inputing:
$ rosmsg show Num. I should input these codes:
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/
$ catkin_make
$ source devel/setup.bash
Then the problem is solved. But I still don't know why.
