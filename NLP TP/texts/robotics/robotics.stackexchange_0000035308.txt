Q:

Is it possible to specify a default ros version with the roswiki macros?

I'm writing ros-distribution-specific wiki pages as shown in the bottom of the post, and I'd like to display by default a page that does not correspond to the latest stable release (in my case i want to display diamondback instead of electric). Is this possible?, and if so, where can I find the relevant documentation?.
TIA.
<<Version()>>

{{{#!wiki version diamondback
<<Include(foo/diamondback)>>
}}}

{{{#!wiki version electric
<<Include(foo/electric)>>
}}}

A:

The default version is currently hardcoded in the javascript.  We don't have cycles to rewrite this right now, but would happily accept a patch to the javascript and wiki macro code that would enable more customized setting.
The code for the javascript is here:

The code for the version macro is here:
