Q:

PCL17 Does not compile

When I try to rosmake pcl17 or pcl17_ros i get the following error:
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lsensor_msgs
I have the sensor_msgs package.  Does anyone have any ideas as to why this would happen?

We need more information. Can you describe what you did step by step? Do you use fuerte?

A:

Not knowing what version of ROS you are using or seeing the full error message, this problem might already be solved here in this answer: How do I use pcl 1.7 with groovy?.

I've just compiled this one git clone https://github.com/ros-perception/perception_pcl.git -b groovy-unstable-devel. You have to change pcl-1.6 to pcl-1.7 in .//pcl/doc/tutorials/content/walkthrough.rst to successfully build other packages that depend on pcl.

Do you have installed sensor_msgs? On Ubuntu you can do this with "apt-get install ros-groovy-common-msgs".

BTW after I compiled PCL, rosbuild cannot compile costmap2d anymore, it cannot find pcl.

@Art: you should use catkin
Comment by Artem on 2013-06-17:
I do use catkin to build catkin packages including pcl. However, rosbuild packages also uses catkin packages.  I don't know why when  I build pcl-1.7, costmap2d does not find it. I don't have the log now,  I rolled back to pcl-1.6 now. Actually, let me try to build pcl-1.7 in overlay workspace.
