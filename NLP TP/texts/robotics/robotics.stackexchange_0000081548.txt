Q:

Is there a way to always supprress desktop notifications in catkin tools?

With catkin tools, I used the catkin build command to build a workspace. When finished building, it displays a desktop notification that looks like this:

I know that the option --no-notify can be used to suppress notifications each time I build, but I'd like to suppress them more permanently so that I don't have to specify --no-notify every time I build.
