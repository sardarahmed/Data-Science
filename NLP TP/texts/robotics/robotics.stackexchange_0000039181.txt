Q:

Cannot launch openni_camera: No devices connected (ROS electric)

I'm using Linux Mint 12 x64 (based on Ubuntu Oneiric) and ROS electric.
I installed the openni_kinect stack using the instructions here: http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_kinect

sudo apt-get install ros-electric-openni-kinect

hg clone https://kforge.ros.org/openni/drivers openni-drivers
cd openni-drivers
make
sudo make install
cd ..
hg clone https://kforge.ros.org/openni/openni_ros 
rosmake openni_kinect --rosdep-install
sudo usermod -a -G video jaustin

I then restarted, made sure the Kinect had external power (got a blinking green light), saw the following from lsusb:

Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub

Bus 002 Device 008: ID 045e:00cb Microsoft Corp. Basic Optical Mouse v2.0

But when I try to start up the openni_camera stack, it does not detect the device:

$ roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch
... logging to /home/jaustin/.ros/log/b8a3ebd8-7a9f-11e1-8f79-0090f5c64449/roslaunch-italy-18810.log
Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.
Press Ctrl-C to interrupt
Done checking log file disk usage. Usage is 
I know there is a related question here. That question was answered, but it's from a while ago, and the answer (basically, "I re-installed ubuntu and it just worked") is not very satisfactory. So I thought it couldn't hurt to bring it up again.
Does anyone have any ideas on things I could try, or troubleshooting steps I could follow? Any help would be much appreciated, thanks!

A:

Figured it out.
I bought a "Kinect for Windows" instead of XBOX 360 Kinect Sensor. Apparently this new version, while it has better hardware, is not yet supported by openni

Is it supported yet? Have you tried libfreenect?
