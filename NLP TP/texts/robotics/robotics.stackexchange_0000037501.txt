Q:

Will ecto nodes be able to communicate over the network?

The ecto framework http://ecto.willowgarage.com/ looks interesting.  Do the developers plan to allow nodes to be located on different physical computers connected by a network?

You can seamlessly bridge ecto graphs to ROS (see ecto_ros).

I see you can do it for many common ROS message types. But can I do it for custom messages?
