Q:

ROS kinetic Instulation Error (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS)

I am new to ROS and Ubuntu so apologies for asking a question on probably a simple fix. I am trying to install the ROS full Desktop with the following command on a dual booted dell precision 5520 with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-desktop-full
After running this command I get the following end message.
53 upgraded, 838 newly installed, 0 to remove and 244 not upgraded.
Need to get 529 MB/530 MB of archives.
After this operation, 2,453 MB of additional disk space will be used.
Do you want to continue? [Y/n]
What do i need to do in order to fix the issue?
If i say yes will this mess anything up?

how to do I perform moderation to the question?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-12-08:
You cannot. That's sort-of the point of the system: you'll have to wait for one of the moderators (ie: trusted site administrators) to log on and verify that you're not a spam-bot, then let your post through.
I've just done that.

A:

The dialog is just asking if I would like to continue. Found a good answer to the question at the following website link. https://superuser.com/questions/287348/why-does-apt-get-sometimes-asks-for-confirmation/287357#287357

Exactly, and just make it extra clear: this is just apt asking you this (ie: the Debian/Ubuntu package manager). It's not specific to ROS or a tool we've created.
