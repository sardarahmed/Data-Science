Q:

Jenkins Build Setup

I am trying to setup Jenkins to build my ros hydro packages.  I have yet to find any useful documentation on integrating ROS with Jenkins.  Can someone point me in the correct directions as to how to setup the ROS Environment and run catkin_make on a package?

A:

The buildfarm documentation describes how to set up a build farm for ROS similar to the current build farm that is run by OSRF.
