Q:

gmapping [SKIP] No rule to make target None

I'm am trying to build gmapping from source and for some reason it's not building the executables....
In a rosbuild workspace I used:
rosws set slam_gmapping --git git@github.com:dawonn/slam_gmapping.git
rosws update gmapping
source ./setup.bash
roscd gmapping
rosmake

[rosmake-0] Starting >>> gmapping [ make ]
[rosmake-0] Finished <<< gmapping [SKIP] No rule to make target None

$ rosrun gmapping slam_gmapping

[rosrun] Couldn't find executable
named slam_gmapping below
/home/dereck/rosbuild_ws/slam_gmapping/gmapping

rosrun gmapping < tab > < tab >

libconfigfile.so       liblog.so              libsensor_base.so      libsensor_range.so     test_map.py
libgridfastslam.so     libscanmatcher.so      libsensor_odometry.so  libutils.so

Any idea what I'm doing wrong here?
Thanks!

It's hard to tell what version of that repository to use. The master branch has a different commit signature than what looks like the latest release, tagged slam_gmapping-1.2.7. You might try that one.

A:

after running rosmake:
roscd gmapping
cd build
make
