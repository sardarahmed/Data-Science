Q:

[rospy] simultaneous subscribe at a given frequency

Hi,
I have 2 publisher who provide me 2 topics in real time, but I would like to write a listener which will, every 2 seconds, store the last topic published from those 2 publishers. And also, I'm coding in python. Do you have any idea?
Thanks and regards
Cyprien

A:

It is not possible to subscribe at a given frequency, you have to filter the incoming messages yourself:
If the topics have to be synchronized, use a TimeSynchronizer for your subscription.
In your callback, check the last time you stored the messages and if it is more than 2 seconds ago, store again and store the timestamp.
If your topics do not have to be synchronized and you just want the output to be logged to a textfile you can use throttle to republish your topic at the desired rate and rostopic for logging:
rosrun topic_tools throttle messages /topic 2.0
rostopic echo -p /topic_throttled > topiclog.txt
