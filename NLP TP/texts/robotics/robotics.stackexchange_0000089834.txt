Q:

Dictionary item in yaml in ros2

Hi ,
I am aware of simple parameters defining in yaml in ros2 but seeking some help to convert below into ros2 yaml .
Please let me know if anyone had handled such type of yaml.
TransferFunction:
  - name: transfer_function
    type: filters/MultiChannelTransferFunctionFilterDouble
    params:
      a: [1.0, -1.760041880343169, 1.182893262037831]
      b: [0.018098933007514, 0.054296799022543, 0.054296799022543, 0.018098933007514]

Thanks.

Can you clarify what you want to change? yaml syntax hasn't changed. The snippet that you're referencing looks like a nodelet yaml config which has been replaced by the concept of components.

A:

its working for me now. I thought the way params declared here will be changed, but its same.
Following code snippet is working for me.  Thanks.
LowPass:
  name: transferfunction_test
