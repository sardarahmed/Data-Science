Q:

Why is analysis required to study robotics?

I am studying Informatics and I am interested in doing a Masters in Robotics and I was checking out some unis and their courses and I saw that Robotics contains analysis and a lot of math.
Why is that?

A:

Math is the way that roboticists translate our understanding of the world into something that a computer can understand. Since this is not how humans do it, this requires a lot of rather difficult math. How would you tell a computer what a pencil is? How does that description change if the pencil is rotated?
Robot control also needs a lot of math. If I move this shoulder joint by 5 degrees how much does that move the hand? If I the robot sees the world through a camera and I want the robot to move an object 5 pixels to the right, how much do I need to move each joint? If the object weighs 5 kg how much torque do I need on the motors to hold it? How do I make sure this works even if I measured wrong and the object is really 6kg?
Also, robots have to deal with a lot of uncertainty. The sensors it uses to "see" the world have a lot of random noise so all the algorithms need to somehow model this noise so the robot can react properly. This involves a lot of probability theory.
Finally, since it's not possible to test every environment you have to use math to prove that your algorithms will always work.
