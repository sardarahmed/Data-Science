Q:

Difference between trajectory_planner.cpp and trajectory_planner_ros.cpp

I am currently trying to work with the trajectory planner in base_local_planner.
But now I am A bit confused, because the two source files trajectory_planner.cpp and trajectory_planner_ros.cpp seem to implement the same methods, or at least have a lot of overlap.
Can someone help me on that?

A:

It looks like trajectoy_planner.cpp implements the basic planning functionality, while trajectory_planner_ros.cpp provides the ROS API/communication part (publishers, subscribers etc.). This way of splitting functionality has the advantage that the planning part can be re-used more easily.

Does trajectory_planner.cpp update/construct/choose the trajectories? What does the global planner will do then?

Yes, this was also my impression. But I was confused that both seem to implement for example checkTrajectory. But the one in trajectory_planner_ros.cpp seems to be only a wrapper.
