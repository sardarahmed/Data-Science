Q:

fuerte's supported python is 2.6 that's not supported on Precise

I noticed (while I'm looking at this question) that official python version in fuerte is 2.6 (link to REP-003), which is no longer supported in Ubuntu Precise (there's a way to install 2.7 though). I'm just curious what was the decision made in this regard? Prioritize Lucid as a earlier stable distro? Is there a link to a discussion?

A:

My interpretation of REP-0003 is that Python 2.6 is the minimum version supported by Fuerte. Probably, that entry should have explicitly stated "Python 2.6 and 2.7". Since Precise came out shortly after Fuerte was released, it's easy to understand how that might have been overlooked at the time.
All Fuerte Precise release testing was done with Python 2.7, so I doubt there are many serious problems due to the newer version, which is highly compatible with 2.6, anyway.

Ah, release timing of fuerte and Ubuntu explains. I also found in the same REP that says "Our intent with Python is to track the minimum version provided in the supported Ubuntu platforms, " so I guess you're right.
