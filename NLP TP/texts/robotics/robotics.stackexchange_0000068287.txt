Q:

I have installed ROS (jade) in ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS. Many of the demo packages mentioned in the tutorial are not being located by the installed ROS

First I used $ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-husky-navigation* and it executed successfully. Then *$ roslaunch husky_gazebo husky_playpen.launch produces following error.
Error:
[husky_playpen.launch] is neither a launch file in package [husky_gazebo] nor is [husky_gazebo] a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file.

Please point to the tutorials your following, and provide full instructions for how to reproduce as well as copy and paste of all the commands your running and their console outputs so we can help you better.

A:

First off, if you installed Jade, by doing "apt-get install ros-indigo-husky-navigation" you are going to get asked if you would like ros indigo to be installed. You can't mix and match distro's and package's when you install debian's say like from apt-get. If your enviornment is sourced to jade, then you should only use jade debian installed packages. If you installed from source, i recommend having one build in a jade catkin ws and another build of same source in a indigo catkin ws.
