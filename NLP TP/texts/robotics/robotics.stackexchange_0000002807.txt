Q:

What are the advantages of optimal control as opposed to control theory?

For a robot, say path planning in particular, what are the pros and cons of choosing classical control theory or optimal control (LQR for example) ?

A:

Classical control theory requires Linear Time Invariant systems. Most robots of interest actually have non-linear dynamics. Of course many optimal control techniques also require linear systems. LQR for instance stands for Linear Quadratic Regulator meaning it takes a quadratic cost function and gives the optimal control for a system with linear dynamics. This is handled in both cases by linearizing the dynamics. In the case of classical control techniques linearizing the dynamics invalidates all the guarantees and the tools for analyzing stability and tuning gains generally don't work. In the case of optimal control methods then generated control will often still be good so long as the approximation error is low. Often it helps to simply try the different methods. Alternatively you may consider non-linear control methods.
