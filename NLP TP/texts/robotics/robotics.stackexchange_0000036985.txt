Q:

rosbag duration

I've been tried to record a bag for a given duration and it seems that the arguments are ignored, so it still records until I hit Ctrl+C.
I'm running this command (but it fails for any topic/s):
rosbag record --duration 10 /camera/image_color

on ros-electric, ubuntu oneiric.
Is this a known bug, or am I doing something wrong?

I want to use it for multiple topics, publishing at different frequencies, so -l NUM_MSGS is useless, as far as I know.

I've just created this enhancement ticket to request this feature.
UPDATE The ticket is now solved and closed!
