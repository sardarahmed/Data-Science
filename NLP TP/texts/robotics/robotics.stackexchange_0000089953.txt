Make sure that you have installed "catkin_pkg", it is up to date and on the PYTHONPATH.

when I typed ~/.bashrc i scrolled all the way to the bottom of the file and saw:
jones@gee:~$ nano ~/.bashrc

export PATH="/home/jones/miniconda3/bin:$PATH"
export PYTHONPATH=/usr/share/doc/python-catkin-pkg (i added this)
#source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash (i added this)

I do not know how to add what is needed in nano file.

A:

Using PYTHON_EXECUTABLE: /home/jones/miniconda3/bin/python

This is the problem.
The ROS Python libraries have only been installed for the system provided Python, not for Anaconda. That is why catkin_pkg cannot be found.
