Q:

laser drivers stack SICK LMS1xx stable?

Hi
Is it possible to move the sick LMS1xx package into the the laser driver stack?
ros.org/wiki/LMS1xx
ros.org/wiki/laser_drivers

contains packages for the hokuyo lasers and packages for sick lms2xx
because i noticed some people think that ROS did not support sick lms1xx

this person did not find the lms1xx driver until he made his own
answers.ros.org/question/29926/made-driver-for-lms151-what-should-i-do-next/
this is where i found the LMS1xx package ros.org/wiki/Sensors
Also I am considering buying a SICK LMS111 for a university project. I am wondering weather the SICK LMS1xx ros node is stable and works for the SICK LMS111?
I noticed in the wiki there is very little documentation (in comparison to the other drivers)

A:

Hi, the question may be old but I'm facing the same problem.
I grabbed the lms1xx package at https://github.com/RCPRG-ros-pkg/RCPRG_laser_drivers
The package is good for Hydro.
It works well.
The problem is still the lack of documentation. And the code seems good only for Ethernet connection, non serial.
