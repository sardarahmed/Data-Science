Q:

How do you convert from a csv to a bag file in ROS?

I see a lot of things for going from bag to csv, but does anyone know how to go from csv to bag? I am running gmapping but data files in the csv format need to be bag files for gmapping to work.

A:

What is the data do you have in CSV format? You can use the rosbag command to create a bag of your own and it is the preferred option. For tutorials to create a map using gmapping, refer this map creation
