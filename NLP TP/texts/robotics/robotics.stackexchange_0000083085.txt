Q:

find_package error while installing iai_photo

I am trying to install iai_photo package.  I have already installed gphoto2 and libgphoto2 libraries and got it working with a sony camera.
Further I git cloned the iai_photo package and tried to catkin_make it. But I get the following error

CMake Error at
iai_photo-master/CMakeLists.txt:17
(find_package):   By not providing
"FindGPHOTO2.cmake" in
CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
asked CMake to find a package
configuration file provided by
"GPHOTO2", but   CMake did not find
one.
Could not find a package
configuration file provided by
"GPHOTO2" with any   of the following
names:
GPHOTO2Config.cmake
gphoto2-config.cmake

Add the installation prefix of
"GPHOTO2" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
"GPHOTO2_DIR" to a directory
containing one of the above files.  If
"GPHOTO2" provides a separate
development package or SDK, be sure it
has   been installed.

A:

Thanks for your answer. I already found the problem. The error was because of wrong name of package folder
