Q:

update source package?

Hi all,
I'd like to apply changes mentioned here: https://github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial/issues/150
and here: http://answers.ros.org/question/197596/a-problem-in-transfering-neagtive-values-to-arduino-via-std_msgsfloat64/
Can someone tell me which package should I update and how to update it ?
I'm using ROS Hydro.
thanks in advance.
regards.

A:

The merge seems to be only merged for indigo. You can try to just build the package from the indigo-devel branch in hydro. If that doesn't work easily, you need to backport the fix manually unless someone else has done that already.
