Q:

Is there a better type of sensor to measure the distance instead of Ultrasonic sensors

We know that the Ultrasonic sensors can't accurately measure the distance to an object that

is more than 3 meters away (the distance may vary on brands)
has it's reflective surface at a shallow angle (the angle may vary on brands)
is too small to reflect enough sound

Also the environmental influences such as air tempereture, air pressure, air currents, humidity, mist and types of gas cause inaccurate measurements. Which sensor should i use to get the best measurements ?

A:

Yes, there are IR sensors as well, which provide ranges up to 3-4 meters Pololu Range Finder. Also, we can find Laser range finders that measure up to 30m distance. But these Laser range finders are expensive in compared to ultrasonic sensors and mostly used for mapping purposes.
