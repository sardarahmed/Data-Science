Q:

Search for topics with specific message

Hi,
My question is the following:
Suppose I have a list of topics and each topic publishes a message of type messageType.
Is there a command that allows me output the all messageTypes that are currently being published?
I know "rostopic info -topicname" will give me information as well as the message a specific topic outputs. Is there a wildcard like rostopic info * that lets me see all the messages that are currently being published?
Thank you in advance,
Panos.

A:

I don't know of a built-in command that does exactly what you want, but you could always combine rostopic outputs using standard command line tools (piping, xargs, etc.).
For example, to get the detailed information about every topic, you could run:
rostopic list |xargs -n 1 rostopic info

Or you could combine with grep:
rostopic list |grep robot |xargs -n 1 rostopic info
