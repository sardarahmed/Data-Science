Q:

hector mapping with fixed laser scanner

hi everyone
I want to use hector_mapping for my robot to do SLAM in uneven terrains. But i am not sure i can use this package if i dont have a stabilizer mechanism for my laser scanner. I mean can i use it just with laser scanner which is fixed in its place and an IMU data?
thanks

A:

Yes you can, the quality of results will depend on the magnitude of the roll/pitch motion of your robot however (if the scans contain not enough information due to looking at ground or sky, things might fail). For a explanation of how to set things up, see SettingUpForYourRobot or some prior questions here ( 1, 2).
