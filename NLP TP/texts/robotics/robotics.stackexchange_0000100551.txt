Q:

ROS2 building with dependencies

Hello,
I'm new in ROS2 and I lost myself in the dependencies tree.
I have a big project I would like to translate to ROS2.
When I create the my_package my_node it creates a standart structure. How can I add there all python files I need?
There's no chance I can run the whole project using only one python file.
Is there some examples I can learn from?
Thank all of you in advance!

Hi,
You can have as many packages, and as many python files you want. All you need to do is structure your workspace correctly.
After creating a package, you can create .py files inside of your_workspace/src/my_package/my_package.
Don't forget to make the files executable with chmod +x, and to include them as an entry point in your setup.py:
    entry_points={
    'console_scripts': [
        ' [executable_name] = [package_name].[executable]:main',
    ],

You can add as many python files as you want this way. I'll be uploading a video tomorrow showing this process in our channel, https://youtu.be/HV7f3ayQMXw, so check it out if you get stuck from what I explained above, and also if you want to see how to add launch files to your setup.py as well.

also for a dependencies tree, don't forget to use colcon
