A:

An easy solution would be to manually starting a tf publisher that publishes the needed transform from the base_link (localized) to the laser scanner frame. See the example launch file below:
<node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="base_to_laser_broadcaster" args="0 0 0 0 0 0 base_link laser 100" />

and you should have your hector_mapping parameters like this :
 <param name="pub_map_odom_transform" value="true"/>
<param name="map_frame" value="map" />
<param name="base_frame" value="base_link" />
