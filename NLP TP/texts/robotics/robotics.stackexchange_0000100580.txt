Q:

Trac_IK plugin for MoveIt group relies on deprecated API

Is there a neat way to handle this warning while using Trac-IK solver with MoveIt Assistant?
IK plugin for group 'right_arm' relies on deprecated API. Please implement initialize(RobotModel, ...).
thanks in advance.

A:

Trac-IK should simply implement the newer API. Apparently they did not do that. If they don't want to use the functionality this is quickly done because RobotModel::getURDF() can just give you the description needed for the old API, but they can likely safe some time by just using the RobotModel MoveIt prepared for them.

@v4hn, thanks for your answer, where can I add RobotModel::getURDF(), to which part of the trac_ik code so it works properly? can you please tell me, thanks in advance.
