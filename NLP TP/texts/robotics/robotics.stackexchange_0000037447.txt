Q:

Object Recognition with Minoru

Hello, I'm using a Minoru 3D webcam for object recognition. Will any ROS packages help in object detection and recognition using point clouds published from Minoru? All the information I get from the forum is about Kinect. I'm not sure if those methods work with Minoru?
If, instead of ROS, I were to use stand alone PCL, how will I be able to use point clouds published in ROS to use in standalone PCL.

A:

There's nothing special about the Kinect that keeps those techniques from working on a Minoru. (Although the Kinect will likely result in better data.)
If you want to communicate between ROS and PCL, see the pcl_ros package; it provides several helpful wrapper functions.
