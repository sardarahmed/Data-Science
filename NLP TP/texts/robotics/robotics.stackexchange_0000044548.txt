Q:

Can the log level of a (python) ROS node be changed dynamically?

I wonder if it is possible (and if not if it makes sense) to change the log level of a python node during runtime.
The node could connect to a special purpose topic where the log level for the node can be announced. This would allow to have a node running without the debug messages being published to /rosout, but if necessary the log level could be switched to debug if the node is not running as expected.
Of course you can always change the init_node line and re-run the node, but in some occasions a more transparent solution might be useful?

A:

Although not currently/officially supported by the rospy api, this can be accomplished through a simple function.  See the accepted answer for Change python node log level while running.

Since this old thread is about ROS1, which is basically frozen for new feature addition, non-complex workaround is probably an acceptable answer and solution. So I marked this as a selected answer.
