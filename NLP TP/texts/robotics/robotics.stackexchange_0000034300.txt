Q:

alternative gyro for Turtlebot

As the Sparkfun ADXRS613 breakout gyro for the turtlebot is not available from sparkfun anymore, I was wondering if the Active-Robots Gyro Breakout Board MLX90609-E2 is an interchangeable alternative?
It seems to have the same sensitivities, rate and required voltages.. Only thing different I see is that the standard capacitor sets it to ~36Hz instead of ~361Hz for the adxrs613. Switching out the capacitor should fix this, is it useful though?
