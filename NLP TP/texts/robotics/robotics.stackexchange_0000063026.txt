Q:

use navigation stack with different method for localization

Hello everyone,
I am pretty sure that it is possible to use the navigation stack (http://wiki.ros.org/navigation) with another localization method than AMCL (http://wiki.ros.org/amcl) since I have seen that people already tried to use hector SLAM. However, I was not able to understand how they realized this "switch". Does anyone have an idea where I should start? I have been using the navigation stack with some success but wanted to try out another localization technique.
Cheers
Marcus

I'm the same question about how to fusion or use AMCL and Hector_mapping

A:

The typical Nav setup has at least three tf frames: One for the map, one for the odometry root, and one for the robot. As described on this page, the link between odom and robot usually comes from the robot's odometry, and the link between the map and the odom comes from AMCL. In order to use an alternate localization method, you just need something else that provides that transform.

Hey David,
thank you for your quick answer. I was already suspecting something like this, since I tried to run my simulation without AMCL and ros demands the transform from base_footprint to map. I was just not aware that it might be that simple.
Thanks,
Marcus

Hey David, I was wondering if we can use the robot_state_publisher instead of multiple tf in Markus case ?

I'm not sure what you're asking. Can you open up a new question instead?
