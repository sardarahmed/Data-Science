Q:

rclcpp ROS2 params yaml file comments

Does anyone know, if there are available comments in the yaml files containing parameters?
I tried to comment some information to keep it for later, but then I got rcl parsing exception.
But maybe I did something incorrectly (I used '#' characted at the beginning of the line).
(I am using launch file if that changes anything)

Note that the names are different from the error output, as I changed them to be more generic there.

A:

Ok, not sure what was the reason for the error, but after some other things on focus it all seems to work fine even with comments.
Thanks for the help anyways.
And thanks @reason_rock for your comment.
