Q:

rosserial helloworld

Hi all,
I am trying to get the example helloWorld working from the rosserial package, and everything went smooth until the command: rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM0
the error msg is: raise SerialException("could not open port %s: %s" % (self._port, msg))
serial.serialutil.SerialException: could not open port /dev/ttyACM0: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/dev/ttyACM0'
I verified on the Arduino IDE that serial port is indeed /dev/ttyACM0
and #include "WProgram.h" has been changed to #include "Arduino.h".
My system is running ubuntu 12.04 fuerte build, and using Arduino 1.0 IDE.
Please let me know if anyone has encountered similiar problems, and how you solved this issue.
Thank you very much in advance.

Thank you for your answer, this issue has been resolved by adding my own username to the dailout group.
sudo adduser  dialout
and after restarting my computer, there was no longer any permission issue involved.
Thanks again!
