Q:

Numpy alternatives for linear algebra and kinematics in python?

Are there any decent python numerical package libraries besides numpy for python? Numpy relies on gfortan which itself must be compiled correctly for your platform to avoid hidden/insidious numerical errors in numpy. 
I need a matrix algebra package to do kinematics, path planning, and machine learning in python that isn't sensitive to  gfortran version and compiler options.

A:

OpenCV is available with python bindings. It's not geared at strictly numerical applications, but it might be sufficient. 
It includes some matrix math and machine learning algorithms.
I can't say you won't ever experience numerical problems, but it's not based on gfortran.
