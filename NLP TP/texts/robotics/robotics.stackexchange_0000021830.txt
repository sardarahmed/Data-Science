Q:

Is this encoder error expected?

I'm working with the iRobot Create 2. When I read the encoder count and sum it for total, I'm able to do so without apparent error. I've used this to 'successfully' estimate position combining with heading from a gyro. However, when I try to estimate velocity from the encoder count, the signal seems pretty noisy.
I'll get maybe 10-15 values that are expected, and then a random outlier or two. For example: If I set the wheels to 100 mm/s and calculate the change of time between cycles (which also appears to agree with the sample time i've set of 0.017s), maybe 10-14 values will be within +-10 of 100mm/s, but then I'll get a one or two values that differ by +-50-100 mm/s.
Is this normal and I'll need to filter for a better estimation, or could there be a possible timing issue? The only thing that really impacts the program speed is the checksum used to initially discard corrupted packets.

A:

I had this problem in my project.  If you are sampling very quickly, then sometimes you get zero ticks and sometimes one.  That causes a lot of noise.  The solution is to only calculate velocity after a sampling time AND minimum number of ticks has passed.  I do that in this project.
