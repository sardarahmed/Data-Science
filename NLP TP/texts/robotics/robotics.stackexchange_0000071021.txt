Q:

rosserial too big for Arduino

I am trying to add a magnetometer to my robot by plugging it into an Arduino and publishing the data using MagneticField message. I can't compile my code for Arduino Uno or Leonardo while at the same time using the Adafruit Magnetometer driver  . I end up with this error message:

Global variables use 2,675 bytes
(104%) of dynamic memory, leaving -115
bytes for local variables. Maximum is
2,560 bytes.

I only defined the necessary variables as globel (ros handle, publisher, message to publish and sensorlib instance). Did anybody figure out a way to work with such sensors on an Arduino and publishing their data using ROS?

Late response, but I guess this is a common problem. This solved my problem: http://answers.ros.org/question/28890/using-rosserial-for-a-atmega168arduino-based-motorcontroller/
Basically you can change the assigned buffer for serial communication by limiting the number of publishers/subscribers and also their length.
