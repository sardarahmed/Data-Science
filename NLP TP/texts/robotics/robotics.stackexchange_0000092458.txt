Q:

[ROS2] How to set the logfile

Hi
I'm using a logger with ROS2 dashing. I couldn't find any explanation, how I can change the logger to log to a file instead of std output and how I can set the logfile.
Any help is appreciated.

That's still a work in progress, see:

We wanted to have it for Dashing, but the log4cxx implementation had issues so we pulled it from the release.
