Q:

dual-boot ubuntu vs. virtualization?

I am new to ROS, and want to work with it via Ubuntu 12.04 on my MacBook Pro MC724.
Is it better to run Ubuntu inside VirtualBox or install Ubuntu and use it as a dual-boot mode?
Thank you

A:

If you'd like to use rviz or Gazebo, I would recommend running ROS natively instead of virtualizing it.
