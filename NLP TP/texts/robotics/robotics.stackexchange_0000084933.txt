Q:

Publish message on geometry_msgs/TwistStamped from terminal

Hi there
I'm back to using ROS after a few years break and would appreciate some help.
I'm trying to publish a message from the terminal but are having trouble getting the arguments right. Could anyone help me with this?
The message is  geometry_msgs/TwistStamped: http://docs.ros.org/jade/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/TwistStamped.html
std_msgs/Header header
  uint32 seq
  time stamp
  string frame_id
geometry_msgs/Twist twist
  geometry_msgs/Vector3 linear
    float64 x
    float64 y
    float64 z
  geometry_msgs/Vector3 angular    
    float64 x
    float64 y
    float64 z

I have tried all sorts of combinations but no luck.
One example:
rostopic pub -r 100 /mavros/setpoint_velocity/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/TwistStamped "{header: auto, twist.linear:[1, 2, 3], twist.angular:[1, 1, 1]}"

A:

After entering this much of the command:
rostopic pub -r 100 /mavros/setpoint_velocity/cmd_vel

You should be able to press Tab a couple times and it will fill in a blank message for you. I don't think you need to specify geometry_msgs/TwistStamped.
