Q:

Is the information on the following link logical?

I cannot comment on the original answer, so I had to ask like this.
I am trying to learn IMU's, accelerometers, gyros etc. for a while.
So I came across with this answer below,
https://engineering.stackexchange.com/a/22182/21263

From the accelerator sensor data, you can only calculate pitch and
  roll. The bellow document from Freescale explains with plenty of
  information what you need:
[AN3461 - Tilt Sensing Using a Three-Axis Accelerometer][1]
Based on the sayings of the document,
$$\tan \phi_{xyz} = \frac{G_{py}}{G_{pz}}$$
$$\tan \theta_{xyz} = \frac{-G_{px}}{G_{py}\sin \phi + G_{pz}\cos
> \phi} = \frac{-G_{px}}{\sqrt{G_{py}^2 + G_{pz}^2}}$$
which equates to:
roll = atan2(accelerationY, accelerationZ)

pitch = atan2(-accelerationX, sqrt(accelerationY*accelerationY + accelerationZ*accelerationZ))

Of course, the result is this only when the rotations are occurring on
  a specific order (Rxyz):

Roll around the x-axis by angle $\phi$
Pitch around the y-axis by angle $\theta$
Yaw around z-axis by angle $\psi$

Depending on the rotations order, you get different equations. For the
  $R_{xyz}$ rotation order, you can not find the angle $\psi$ for the
  Yaw around z-axis.

But I don't see how the order of turn motions matters in case of getting pitch & roll from accelerometer data. Without the histoy of orders, the accelerometer will give specific outputs at specific orientations.
So what I am actually asking is whether the answer I shared is logical or not. Could you please clear the situation for me?
Thanks.

A:

Without the histoy of orders, the accelerometer will give specific outputs at specific orientations.

Correct, but you might define a specific orientation ambiguously, and if you are ambiguous about it then you need to clarify. 
Consider this example: 

Rotate 180 degrees about your head-to-toe axis. Now you're facing the opposite direction as your original pose, then
Rotate forward 90 degrees about your heel-to-heel axis. Now you're laying on your stomach (face-down), with your head pointed opposite of the direction you were originally facing.

Now, keep the rotations the same, but change the order:

Rotate forward 90 degrees about your heel-to-heel axis. Now you're laying on your stomach (face-down), with your head pointed in the same direction as you were originally facing, then
Rotate 180 degrees about your head-to-toe axis. Now you are laying on your back (face-up), with your head pointed in the same direction as it was originally. 

Now, if you had an IMU/accelerometer in your hand, it would clearly give different readings for those two results, but that's because they're two different orientations. You can't just say it's 180 about this and 90 about that, you have to specify which rotation happens first if you want someone else to be able to understand. 
The way I think about it is that the order of rotation is an extra parameter in the description of the orientation. An angle about each of three axes and then an ordering of those axes. Four things to track: x, y, z, and the order in which they're applied. 
If you want to guarantee you're getting a pose right without having to worry about whether you're using the right formula, you may want to consider quaternions. They also happen to have four parameters, but they're not in any kind of sensible units. You can imagine what a 45 degree rotation about an x-axis looks like, but what does a quaternion look like?
