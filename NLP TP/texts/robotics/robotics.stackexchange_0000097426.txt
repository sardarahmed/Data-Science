Q:

Unknown CMake command "add_rostest"

I am following the tutorial on overlaying on catkin workspaces and run catkin as $ catkin_make -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3 but I get
CMake Warning at ros_tutorials/rospy_tutorials/CMakeLists.txt:102 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findrostest.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "rostest", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "rostest" with any
  of the following names:

    rostestConfig.cmake
    rostest-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "rostest" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "rostest_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "rostest" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.

CMake Error at ros_tutorials/rospy_tutorials/CMakeLists.txt:112 (add_rostest):
  Unknown CMake command "add_rostest".

Invoking "cmake" failed

What's wrong here ?

A:

try
sudo apt install ros-noetic-rostest

or replace noetic with whatever version you use.
