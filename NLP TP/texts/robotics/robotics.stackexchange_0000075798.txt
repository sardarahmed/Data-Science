Q:

How to read indoor positioning equipment date by ros

I am trying to read  indoor positioning equipment date to ROS.The indoor positioning equipment called Ubisense which can publish location date(like three-dimensional coordinate x, y, z) to  local area network.So I want knew about how ROS read the  indoor positioning equipment date.

You realize that you ask how to read data from your device without telling which device you have?

My device is a indoor positioning equipment called Ubisense which can publish location date(like three-dimensional coordinate x, y, z),but I don't know how ROS read it.

Could you please update your question? It's completely useless in it's current version.

Thanks.I thought there need a API so I can use directly.

A:

Location date? You mean Location data, right?
In the ROS Navigation Stack, the basic tf is map->odom->base_link, the encoders in your robot can get odometry infomation, from which you can get the pose of base_link relative to odom.
And with Ubisense, you can get the position of base_link relative to map. With this position, you can adapt map->odom to make your robot's position right.
I guess Ubisense uploads the robot position to your computer(which runs ROS) through USB or Serial Port. After reading that info, you need to write a Publisher program to publish your position to ROS(say topic /Ubisense/Pose). This position info should in the geometry_msgs/Pose format.(or other similar format).
And then, you need a tf program which subscribes the topic /Ubisense/Pose, and broadcast the tf map->odom.
Good Luck.
