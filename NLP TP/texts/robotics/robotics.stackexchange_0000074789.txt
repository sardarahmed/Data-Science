Q:

Output Robotmodel Position in rviz

I just started learning ros. I followed the turtlebot tutorial to do robot navigation. But I need to store the trace of robot position to an individual file instead of displaying on rviz. The position is displayed in rviz->robotmodel->links->base_link.
I thought I could find this data in topic list but I did not. What can I do to access those position data?

A:

Probably the display you are using in RViz is TF. So have a look at Tutorials. Particularly, you can use tf::TransformListener to get a coordinate frame transformation between '/world' and '/base_link' frames to acquire robot's pose in global frame.
