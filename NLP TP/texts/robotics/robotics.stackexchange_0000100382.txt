Q:

How should I name my message file?

I am trying to create a cmake dependency that has all my messages, however the following error happens:
rosidl_adapter.parser.InvalidResourceName: 'testMsg' is an invalid message
name.  It should have the pattern '^[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9]*$'

Looks like that the name of my message file is incorrect, but I do not understand what ^[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9]*$' means.

A:

I got the answer,
^[A-Z]

Means upper case letter, and
^[A-Za-z0-9]

Means upper case letter followed by lower case letters or numbers. Thus, my message name was wrong because I was using
'testMsg'

Which does not starts with a capitol letter. This problem was solved just by writing:
'TestMsg'
