Why do we need to source setup.bash once in each terminal while running rosnode?

What is its purpose?

This is a duplicate of at least #q251292, #q188309, #q250823, #q241528, #q269784, #q124131, #q292566 and #q229365. And #q286466 contains even more links to other Q&As which explain this.
It's really nice that @stevemacenski wrote yet another answer, but @Bobby: please try to search for existing Q&As before posting new ones.
Use Google: add site:answers.ros.org to your search query. It should turn up many relevant results.

A:

To put it simply: your computer needs to know where to find the programs to run and where ROS is. This is setting up your terminalâ€™s environment to know where to find the ROS commands and your software packages in the workspace.
