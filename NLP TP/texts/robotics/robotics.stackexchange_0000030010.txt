Q:

Correct settings for RosAnswers email?

I've been getting way too much email from RosAnswers lately, and I'm not sure why.
Here are my settings:

Asked by me: Instantly
Answered by me: Instantly
Individually selected: daily
Entire forum (tag filtered): Instantly
Comments and posts mentioning me: Daily
Email tag filter: Allow only selected tags

And my tag settings....

Interesting tags: urdf robot_model arm_kinematics
No ignored tags

Yet I'm still getting emails about threads that I have not voted/commented on, and do not match my tags.

Re: "problems installing libdc1394v2"
Re: "What packages provide visual odometry?"
And plenty more

My only thought is that possibly any post with the substring LU matches (incLUde, vaLUes), but that doesn't work in all cases.

Are you getting the unwanted emails batched daily or instantly?

A:

I have upgraded to version 0.6.74 and I think that the emails should be fixed.  Please let me know if there's any more problems.
