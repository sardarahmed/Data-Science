Q:

Husky A200, robot_pose_ekf

Hello,
I am working with Clearpath Husky. I would like to merge all sensors over robot_pose_ekf (encoders and IMU). However, when I drive a robot, output from the filter is not correct. It is mostly okay for x axis, but prediction of y axis is not precise at all (robot turning creates a mess).
I would like to ask does anyone here has experience with Husky and if yes, could you please recommend how to configure ekf? I have tried using different covariances, but results are confusing.

A:

I have this problem as well. What kind of surface are you driving it on? I think that the reason the turning is off is due to excessive slip. I am in the process of testing this, so I will let you know what I find out.
EDIT: Once I started using the IMU on the Husky, it started working fine.
