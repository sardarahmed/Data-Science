Q:

Using RPM as a form of Wheel Odometry

I am currently working on trying to create some form of wheel odometry to be used in our system to help determine the pose of our robot. There are no encoders on the wheels but the motor that is used to drive the wheels does report its RPM. I am wondering if there is anyway to use this as an input to the robot_localization node?

How does the motor know what RPM the wheels are rotating at without encoders?

it has a hall sensor internally we just don't have access to it directly we get the value out as RPM

A:

Yes, you can do this. The odometry message is basically the total translation and rotation of the robot as well as its current instantaneous velocities both linearly and rotationally.
You know the speed the wheels are rotating at, and I assume you either know or can determine the size of the wheels. Using this data and the kinematic equations of your robot setup you can calculate the robot's current velocities. You find the overall displacement by multiplying the current velocity by the time step and adding that to the total. Check out this tutorial on how to setup a basic odom publisher.
