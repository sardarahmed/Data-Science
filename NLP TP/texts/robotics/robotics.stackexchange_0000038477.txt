Q:

How should make a broadcaster for Hokuyo utm 30lx?

Hello, I want to make a point cloud with laser Hokuyo utm30lx for this work I'm doing a transformation with TF, but I do not understand how to use the broadcaster with the sensor_msgs, I need an example subscription Hokuyo sensor data for the broadcaster .
I need to get the xyz coordinates of the sensor.

A:

I couldn't clearly understand your question!
but if your mean is , how to broadcast your laser scans tf , i should say you must measure your fixed laser coordinate manually , then set it to your laser scans tf broadcaster . and set frame_id : base_link  (your base tf).
for convert your laser shot to point cloud you can use of laser_geometry node  .
