Q:

Jenkins: Couldn't find any revision to build

My project complies just file, and I am expecting ROS to generate my docs, but I keep receiving a failure!
The console log located here:
http://jenkins.ros.org/job/devel-hydro-ar_sys/61/console
What shall I do?

A:

From the console output you linked to:

ERROR: Couldn't find any revision to build. Verify the repository and branch configuration for this job.

From rosdistro/master/hydro/distribution.yaml:
  ar_sys:
    doc:
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/Sahloul/ar_sys.git
      version: hydro-devel
[..]
    source:
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/Sahloul/ar_sys.git
      version: hydro-devel
    status: developed

The rosdistro doc entry points to a hydro-devel branch, but that doesn't seem to exist in your repository (there is only a master branch).
You should update the rosdistro entries for ar_sys to point to the correct branch. I expect it will start working then.
Your source entry also points to hydro-devel.

Also: have you instructed Bloom to use your source repository as a release repository?
Edit: yes, that is 'wrong'. The Releasing a Package for the First Time tutorial clearly tells you (just above Section 2. Creating a Release Repository):

Next, let's talk about how bloom works. First, bloom requires that you have a separate "release" repository for releasing your package. This repository must be a git repository and is normally hosted. For example, all of the ROS release repositories are in the ros-gbp github organization. These repositories are the result of running bloom on a repository containing one or more catkin packages. We highly recommend that you host your release repository on https://github.com.

(emphasis mine).
Bloom takes all sorts of precautions, but it might clobber branches you have in your source repository, if it needs those for the release process. I'd recommend creating a release repository (as it says in the tutorial).

Thank you, it seems that's it... and Yes, I did that with bloom, is that also wrong?
