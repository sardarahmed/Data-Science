Q:

catkin_make, invoking CMake error in Raspberry pi 2

Hello.
I just installed ROS indigo on my raspberry pi 2 (with the most recent version of Raspbian).
I followed installration guide at ROS wiki.
(http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Installing%20ROS%20Indigo%20on%20Raspberry%20Pi#Create_a_catkin_Workspace)
After all installation steps, except '3.1 Updating the workspace' chapter, I saw that my turtle moved by my arrow keys.
However, when I tried to use 'catkin_make' command at my catkin workspace folder, CMake error occured.
Following is the error message.
CMake Error at catkin/cmake/catkin_workspace.cmake:95 (message):
This workspace contains non-catkin packages in it, and catkin cannot build a non-homogeneous workspace without isolation. Try the 'catkin_make_isolated' command instead.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
 CmakeLists.txt:63 (catkin_workspace)

--Configuring incomplete, errors occured!
Inovking "cmake" failed

One of my college succesfully built catkin workspace with 'catkin_make' command, but he don't remember how he done that.
Do I have to use catkin_make_isolated command instead of catkim_make all the time, while I use ROS at Raspberry pi2 with raspbian?
I'm not familiar with Linux, so it would be great thanks to teach me why does this cmake error happen.

Self simple answering.
'orocos_kdl' and 'python_orocos_kdl' packages are plane cmake packages. Therefore, catkin_make command couldn't build them and gave me error message.
Additional question at here.
Do I need these packages? Where do they come from? Are they necessary packages for ros-comm?

A:

You can solve this by moving the non catkin packages into a folder on their own and installting them. Then you can use catkin_make for the rest of the ROS stuff
