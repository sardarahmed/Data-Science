Q:

rplidar_ros step by step for get map

Hello,
I have a simple question ... i want to get map from RPLidar laser scan but i get confused in google and for now i don't know how i can implement that
i install ros using below command
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-desktop-full

and then run below command for define ros directory and commands for ubuntu(14.04) and it's ok(before that commands not define in terminal such as roscd,roscore,...)
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash

after this step i clone(donwload) ros_rplidar from this web page [ https://github.com/robopeak/rplidar_ros ] , in this page robopeak prepare a tutorial of How to build rplidar ros package but i don't know what is catkin's workspace and why catkin_make don't work for me ? is there any good tutorial about this in step by step because i can't find that.

A:

Hey,
you need to setup a Catkin workspace, there are a list of tutorials for how to use, and setup catkin.
http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials
Once you have done this, you can clone the git repo for Rplidar_ros into '~/catkin_ws/src' folder for example, and then run catkin_make from '~/catkin_ws' folder to build it.
