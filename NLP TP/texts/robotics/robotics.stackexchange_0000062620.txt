Q:

Compile a node using the C++ sound_play API and catkin

Hello,
So, I have been trying for a moment to compile a catkin package written in C++ which would use the sound_play package API, but it seems never to find the header <sound_play/sound_play.h>, even though the sound_play package is installed and works normally through rosrun. I have tried to use rosmake in the sound_play package, and can see that the header is indeed in the right place, but still catkin can't find it. Maybe I am forgetting to add an include somewhere?
This is ROS groovy I am using.
Thanks for any suggestions.

If anyone gets into this situation, I have solved it by taking the headers (sound_play.h and SoundRequest.h) directly from the sound_play package and using them as part of the src of my package. This way, one is able to use their functions and the SoundClient class.

That is probably not a solution we should recommend.

A:

sound_play in Groovy is a rosbuild package. You can only depend on it from other rosbuild packages, not from catkin. Sorry.

Oh, how sad for me haha But thanks.
Would you happen to know any other way for me to either synthesize voice or play sound files using catkin on groovy?
