Q:

How can i convert a .bag file to .pcd

i used ubuntu 16 and wrote in terminal: rosrun pcl_ros bag_to_pcd <input_file.bag>  <output_directory>,
but i'm getting this error:
[ERROR] [1488830410.790465733]: [registerPublisher] Failed to contact master at [localhost:11311].  Retrying...

Furthermore i tried to change localhost with my ip with command: exportROS_MASTER_URI=http://X.X.X.X:11311/,

A:

The error is right there:

Failed to contact master

For rosrun, you need to start a ROS master Otherweise, no subscriptions etc. will work.
Simply open another terminal and type roscore.

I tried this and i'm getting this message:
Unable to contact my own server at [http://IP_OF_TURTLEBOT:37529/].
This usually means that the network is not configured properly.
A common cause is that the machine cannot ping itself.  Please check
for errors by running:
ping ip_of_turtlebot
