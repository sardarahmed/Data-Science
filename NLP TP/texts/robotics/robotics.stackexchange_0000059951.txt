Q:

Inverse Kinematics on Baxter arm

Hey there guys,
I am working on a Baxter and ROS Groovy. I want to make the arm move from point A to point B while keeping the wrist joint fixed. I tried this with the IK Service but it messes up the wrist joint by moving it as well.
Any suggestions on how can I make the arm move from point A to B with a fixed wrist joint ?
Please help !!!

A:

What you request could be achieved using a cartesian path (if you can move between points in a straight line or can already generate some sort of cartesian waypoints) or using constraints while planning using MoveIt!. The latter (using constraints) was not completely implemented last time I read about it. For cartesian planning, this answer is pretty comprehensive.
