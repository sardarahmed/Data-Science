Q:

Error in installing KnowRob (ros-hydro-knowrob)

What I tried :
$ sudo sh -c 'echo "deb packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu precise main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
$ sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-knowrob
Error :
E: Unable to locate package ros-hydro-knowrob
Note
sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-knowrob works fine, but I got hydro.

A:

KnowRob has not been released into Hydro, so it cannot be installed using apt-get. In any case, we recommend installation from source as described here http://knowrob.org/installation

I am getting this error now, after $ rosdep install knowrob
ERROR: Rosdep cannot find all required resources to answer your query
Missing resource knowrob

Plus, I re-installed Ubuntu 12.04 today. Gazebo is giving error as well. In mudworld, all links are not visible.

Then your system is not set up correctly, most probably your rosbuild/catkin setup is wrong. Please try if "roscd knowrob" works, otherwise check your setup here http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/using_rosbuild_with_catkin

Maybe I am doing something foolish. Please help me out.
1.I made a ROS space:
http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment
http://docs.ros.org/independent/api/rosinstall/html/rosws_ros_tutorial.html#rosws-ros-tutorial
2.rosws merge https://raw.github.com/knowrob/knowrob/master/rosinstall/knowrob-base.rosinstall
rosws update
rosdep install knowrob
rosmake knowrob

There are two kinds of buildsystems, rosbuild and catkin. KnowRob still uses the older rosbuild, while the default in hydro is catkin. You can set up both systems to work together,you need to create a catkin WS first and then refer to it from rosbuild (Section 3.3 in the link I've posted).

Okay, Did what you said. Now keys are unresolved. :
ratneshmadaan@ratneshmadaan-Inspiron-N5010:~/rosbuild_ws$ rosdep install knowrob

This is in fact a ROS dependency that you can install with apt-get install ros-hydro-cmake-modules

Got everything. Thanks a ton.
