This could help.

Failed to get param: timeout expired error is sometimes occurred due to timeout between OpenCR and Raspberry Pi. But this problem is simply solved by reboot OpenCR.

Thanks, so how to reboot the OpenCR? Here reboot I suppose it means SW reboot (some command?) but not hardware reboot.
