Q:

How can I get data from my kinect?

Whenever I try using openni_launch, it works normally, however, when I try viewing an image using the kinect's rgb or depth camera, or even recording a simple bagfile with data from the kinect, I am unable to see any picture and rosbag does not record any data, and after a few seconds of running image_view or rosbag record, I got this error:
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'openni_wrapper::OpenNIException'
  what():  virtual void openni_wrapper::OpenNIDevice::startImageStream() @ /tmp/buildd/ros-groovy-openni-camera-1.8.8-0precise-20130418-2203/src/openni_device.cpp @ 224 : starting image stream failed. Reason: Xiron OS got an event timeout!

After searching around and trying various fixes, I figured it might be a problem with openni and started using freenect, however I encountered the same problems, I could not record any data using bagfiles or see any images from the kinect (using rviz or image_view)
Then someone asked me to use something completely unrelated, freenect-glview, however that too gave me a black screen.
lsusb shows that all 3 parts of the kinect are connected and I've been able to control the kinect's motor through ubuntu so I know that there is at least a connection established between both.
Additional Info:

I run ROS on Ubuntu using VirtualBox V.4.2.14 and Windows 7 with USB 2 ports
I am using ubuntu 12.04 and ROS-Groovy (all up to date)
I've had the exact same errors on my Mac OSX Lion
When I try using Rviz with the kinect, VirtualBox crashes all together

I would appreciate anyone's help on the matter.

A:

It turns out VirtualBox was causing everything to not work properly for some reason. Now I'm using VMware and everything's running fine. What confused me was that I was getting errors that I found online and that even after trying every fix I could find some would still be there. Next step is getting XYZ coordinates of a moving robot, I'll start looking for tutorials right away (I'm still new to ros).
