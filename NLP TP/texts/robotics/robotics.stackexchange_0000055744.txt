Q:

catkin: move/remove package and workspace

Hello,
I have a catkin workspace containing some catkin packages. They were created using catkin_init_workspace and catkin_create_pkg commands respectively.
I want to move them all in another directory but I didn't find any tutorial about it. Is there something I have to do before that? Can I simply mv -r this workspace directory?
I have some doubts because using rosrun ROS I can find my packages everywhere and it doesn't ask me for paths, so I thought it could be possible only with some environment settings. I'm cautios about moving workspace, that's why I'm asking here :)
I'm using ROS Groovy and Ubuntu 12.04
So, briefly my questione are:

How to move packages into another workspace?

How to move the entire workspace with all its packages?

How to remove a package?

How to remove an entire workspace?

Thanks in advance.

A:

For removing packages: Just delete them (and rebuild). They'll be gone.
For removing a workspace: Just delete it (there are no other traces).
When moving packages or workspaces to another directory/workspace you should probably clean the build completely and rebuild.

what if my package is build from source(clone from github and catkin_make)? Is it the same way as debian install is?

sudo apt-get remove ros-$Distro-$package_name
