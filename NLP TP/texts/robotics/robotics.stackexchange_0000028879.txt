Q:

Rigidly fixing a model to the world

There are clear instructions here for rigidly fixing a model to the world: http://gazebosim.org/tutorials/?tut=ros_urdf#RigidlyFixingAModeltotheWorld Indeed, this works when you use a link called "world". It does not work if you use another name. Is there specific hardcoded behavior for "world" for some reason?

A:

Yes, the keyword world is used to fix a joint to the world. If you name a model / link world, that should cause problems.
This tutorial mentions the special treatment for the world keyword. The reason why that word is reserved is that we need some way to identify a fixed inertial frame.

Thanks. Do you know of any documentation that explicitly states this name is reserved and explains the reasons why?

I added a bit more context to the answer. I hope that answers your question?
