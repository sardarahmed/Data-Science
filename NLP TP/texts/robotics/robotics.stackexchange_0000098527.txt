Q:

Get ros2 Service Client ID

Hi,
To give some back ground , I have multiple Service Client like this in the picture - 2nd gif. These clients will modify some variables stored in the server. Based on some unique id of the client I would like to maintain some access control to modification the variables in  ros2 Service Server.
Is it possible to obtain the ros2 Service Client ID (unique_id) from ros2 Service Server once it receives the service request ?

A:

Service call back function can be overloaded like this
  void handleSrv(
      const std::shared_ptr<rmw_request_id_t> requestHeader,
      const std::shared_ptr<example_interfaces::srv::AddTwoInts::Request> request,
      std::shared_ptr<example_interfaces::srv::AddTwoInts::Response> response);

requestHeader variable has all the information needed. Similarly for subscriber
  void handleSub(const std_msgs::msg::String::SharedPtr msg,
                                 const rclcpp::MessageInfo& message_info);

message_info variable has all the information needed.
