Q:

How to create push and pull mechanism using Servo

How do I create a push and pull mechanism using a standard hobby servo? Eg. SG-5010
Preferably without the need of 3D printing. 

A:

Really simply - suppose you want to push-pull a switch.
You fix the servo and the switch (or any other manipulateable object) to some base.
Then set the servo to center position, put the plastic cross/handle/other connecting element of servo in place such way, that its end point is in right angle to the switch (and fix it with a little screw to servo). The switch should be oriented such way, that it moves toward/from the end point. 
Then connect the switch and the endpoint with some hard rod (you can use wood or some piece of hard plastics for this. Cut the right shape/lenght with sharp knive). 
Then you loosely screw the rod to the endpoint of servo on one side and the switch (moved to central position) on other side.
then if you rotate the servo toward the switch, it is pushed away by the rod, if you rotate the servo on the othe side, the switch is pulled back.
(It is wonderfull how many mechanical pieces you can do fast with simple piece of wood and sharp knife. Much faster, that to print them in 3D (design included). I do a lot of parts from wood, usually I do not need to re-make them later, when the machine is finished, from any "better material", as the wood is good enought.)
