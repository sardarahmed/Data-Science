Q:

Raspberry Pi openni USB interface not supported

I have managed to successfully install ros groovy on my raspberry pi and openni. Unfortunately when I connect my Asus Xtion to the raspberry pi (with a powered hub), it does detect the sensor, but I receive and error of USB interface not supported. Is there any way that I can fix this error?

A:

I did not get it to work with OpenNI either but OpenNI2 works with some minor changes. It should compile out of the box from my repo using make:
https://github.com/kalectro/OpenNI2.git
I also wrote an openni2_camera package which runs on the raspberry and can stream the depth image as a ROS message with 30fps (when overclocked)
https://github.com/kalectro/openni2_camera
After building OpenNI2 successfully and catkin_make ran through, navigate into OpenNI2/Bin/ReleaseX and call rosrun openni2_camera openni2_camera_node from here. Otherwise it will not find the Openni2 libraries

Could it work only with the Asus Xtion? or could also with the Kinect?

@Kalectro: maybe your openni2 have a problem with calibration, I can not set using my calibration, it still use defaut calibration, but I am working with Linux Arm and the resolution of depth in ARM just 160120, but with rgb it is 320240. Do you know how to I fix it?
