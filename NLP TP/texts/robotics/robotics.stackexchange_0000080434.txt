Q:

catkin_make error when build talker and listener

I follow the tutorials and make talker.cpp and listener.cpp in the dir ~/catkin_ws/src/beginner_tutorials/src. I add the CMakelist.txt like the following lines:
add_executable(talker src/talker.cpp)
target_link_libraries(talker ${catkin_LIBRARIES})
add_dependencies(talker beginner_tutorials_generate_messages_cpp)

add_executable(listener src/listener.cpp)
target_link_libraries(listener ${catkin_LIBRARIES})
add_dependencies(listener beginner_tutorials_generate_messages_cpp)

but when I cd ~/catkin_ws and catkin_make this error happened :
Base path: /home/linux/catkin_ws

So what should I do to solve the problem

A:

Check that listener.cpp is in the specified directory and has the correct name.
