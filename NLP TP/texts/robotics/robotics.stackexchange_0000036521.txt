Q:

/joint_states from rviz with gazebo running

Hi there,
I would like to have the same robot running in gazebo and in rviz. I need the joint_states from rviz but I got the problem that gazebo is publishing them too. is there a way to filter the rviz-joint_states?
thanks

A:

Rviz neither publishes nor subscribes to joint_states. It is just a visualization tool and the robot is visualized based on TF. Can you please provide more information on the display type you are using?
