Q:

how to install rospack/rosstack

Hi guys,
I'm new to ros and installed fuerte(OS Ubuntu 12.04),
the documentation says rospack/rosstack are stand-alone-tools in this version,
but there is no description where to get the tool.
My guess was, that something like "sudo easy_install -U rospack" would do the trick, which it does not.
Any suggestions what I might need to download or what the correct bash-command is?
Thanks

thx Tinne, dunno why, but it seems like I used an outdated installationguide, where ROS_PACKET_PATH was set within the .bashrc :-)

A:

I think you should just set up your ROS environment correctly as explained in http://www.ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Installation/Ubuntu section 1.5.
In that case you should be able to use rospack out of the box.
For your information: after setting up my ros fuerte environment, roscd rospack results in: /opt/ros/fuerte/share/rospack
