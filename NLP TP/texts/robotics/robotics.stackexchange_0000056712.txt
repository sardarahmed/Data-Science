Q:

roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch Failed to set USB interface

Dear all
I have installed
ros-hydro-openni-launch
And when I run the command:
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch

I get the following error:
Image: PrimeSense/SensorV2/5.1.0.41: Failed to set USB interface!

And after running  dmesg | tail
[19250.592329] usb 3-6:  New USB device found, idVendor=1d27, idProduct=0600

[19250.612487] usb 3-6: New USB device strings: Mfr=2, Product=1, SerialNumber=0

[19250.613091] usb 3-6: can't set config #1, error -28

[21923.567674] usb 3-6: USB disconnect, device number 27

Does someone have a clue?
In advance thank you.

A:

I found two possible solutions:

sudo modprobe -r gspca_kinect as suggested here

or deactivating xHCI and EHCI Hand-off in the bios as suggested here

there is also some firmware update from Asus related to USB 3.0 problems

Thank you Zdenek, I solved the problem by disabling the USB3 in the Bios and enabling USB2. I will later on try the firmware from Asus.
