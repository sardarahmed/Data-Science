Q:

ROS navigation to obstacle

When the goal point is designated as an obstacle area, the global planner cannot navigate.
Can you make the Global Planner move as close to the obstacle area as possible?
https://wiki.ros.org/global_planner
I can't find the relevant parameters in global_planner.

A:

According to the link you provided, there's the next parameter:

/default_tolerance (double, default: 0.0)
A tolerance on the goal point for the planner. The planner will attempt to create a plan that is as close to the specified goal as possible but no further than default_tolerance away.

If you mean that the planner isn't able to make a plan to a point inside an obstacle, this parameter should fix this.
