Dear daniel_maier.
Thank you for your answer.
If possible, please fix camera_info in order to use image_proc.

what exactly is broken? If you leave the resolution at QVGA, everything should work with image_proc. I just added a set_camera_info service, so you can send your own CameraInfo msg to nao_camera.py. This service is necessary for camera_calibration, I think. There is an example set_camera_info.py in nao_drivers for how to call the service.

Because camera_info in original program is insufficient, image_proc dosen't publish /imgae_rect_color.

A:

Feel free to try out our new nao_camera.py wrapper in alufr-ros-pkg (http://www.ros.org/wiki/nao_robot).
I think Brown University do no develop software for Nao anymore.
