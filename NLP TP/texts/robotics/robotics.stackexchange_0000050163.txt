Q:

Topological SLAM algorithm?

Just wondering, if there exists any algorithm that builds a map in a topological way (based on landmarks) instead of in a metric way (x,y).  Since the gyro/odom has error anyway, it is not necessary to build a metric map. Even humans will not do this. We recognize landmarks to estimate our location, right? Is anyone aware of this kind of research?

A:

There are a number of topological SLAM implementations in the research community. http://openslam.org/ is a good source for finding these.
Unfortunately, as far as I am aware, none of these have ROS bindings/wrappers available.
