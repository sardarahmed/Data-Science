Q:

What computers are participating in ROS right now?

Having gotten through a particularly annoying troubleshooting session, I think there must be a tool that would have helped me. Along the lines of rosnode and rostopic, I would like to see a listing of what the computers are that are participating, e.g.
computer-a (ip 12.1.2.3, ubuntu 16.04)
  Node one
     Topic X (published)
     Topic Y (published)
 - Node two
     Topic H (subscribed)
compute-b  (ip 12.1.2.4, ubuntu 16.04)
  - Node three
      Topic X (subscribed)

Note specifically the mention of distinct "computers" so that one could tell that topic Y had no subscribers. I am not sure to be honest whether this would have smoked out by config problem but it would seem that something more would have been useful.

A:

I believe you're looking for this:
rostopic list --host

Adding -v gives you something like:
Host [some_hostname]:

  Published topics:
   * /rosout_agg [rosgraph_msgs/Log] 1 publisher

  Subscribed topics:
   * /rosout [rosgraph_msgs/Log] 1 subscriber

Note btw that this is technically not an actual answer to your question: rostopic list will only show the topics registered with a master (and the hostnames/nodes). There can be multiple masters, so this is not an exhaustive list.
"participating in ROS" is also an ambiguous question.
