Q:

How AMCL get encoder information

Hi,
I am working on AMCL recently. I am wondering how amcl receives odometry information from encoder. From the wiki, I found that amcl receives transform between odom and base_link. Is it the way to receive odometry information from encoder? So is there other node broadcast tf between odom and base_link?
Thanks.

A:

Yes. AMCL gets odometry information from the TF transform from odom to base_link.
This transform usually comes from some hardware on your robot, so the node that publishes the transform is specific to each robot. There's a navigation Odometry tutorial which describes how to publish the odometry transform from your encoder values.

Thank you so much. If I understand correctly, the transform between odom and base_link broadcasted by some hardware should be varying as robot moves, right? And I saw that the parent frame of base_link is not odom but base_footprint, so what is the difference between the two frames? Thank you again!

Some robots use different frame names, or they'll have intermediate frames between odom and base_link. In that case the hardware usually publishes the transform between odom and its direct child frame (in this case base_footprint).
