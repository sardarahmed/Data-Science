Q:

base_link to base_footprint transform?

Hi,
I am trying to use robot_pose_ekf for my navigation stack,
I have done every thing according to this thread
but I faced a problem about my transformations!
Robot_pose_ekf is publishing a base_footprint tf, but i dont know how should i connect base_link tf to base_footprint tf. what is the relation between them?

A:

base_link is typically the center of mass or the center of turning for your robot, while base_footprint is located at ground level directly below base_link. base_footprint is a projection of base_link onto the ground.
EDIT:
If your Center of Mass is 0.5m above the ground, you can publish a transform with parent=base_footprint and child=base_link with a transform of 0.5z. If you want base_link to be the parent, you would publish -0.5z.

So how can i implement it? just set its z argument of translation to zero?
