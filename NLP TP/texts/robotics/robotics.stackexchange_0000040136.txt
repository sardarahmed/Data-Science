Q:

Any progress in Using ROS in C#?

Hi,
I have searched the community for some one who had successfully used Ros in C# but i didn't find anyone!
Actually I have to write an API for a commercial Robotic Arm in linux environment which is only have a C# SDK , so i am using monoDevelop for writing C# codes in linux! but according to the fact that our robot is completely based On ROS i have to find a way to communicate with my C# based Arm Controller! currently i am writing a network based protocol for this purpose, but i am still looking for a better way!
So any suggestion would be appreciated!

PLEASE let me know if you have any success with making C# and ROS work together for full ROS functionality.....this would be fantastic for all of us!! When you get this to work, please consider publishing it as part of the ROS repositories so we can all have access.

A:

There is now a C# api, available see: http://www.ros.org/wiki/roscs
