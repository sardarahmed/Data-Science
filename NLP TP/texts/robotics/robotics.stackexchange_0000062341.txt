Q:

Versioning third party package by snapshot date

I maintain release of mavlink package ros.
Upstream developers stopped making releases, it is recommended to use the latest snapshot.
So that the original version is stuck at 1.0.9.
When I release the update, the release number of the package rises, but it hard to track between ros releases (also it confuse users).
I think it is more convenient to use instead of the original version of the snapshot date in the form of YEAR.MONTH.DAY.
But i don't find any related information about releasing snapshots.

A:

Since year.month.day also represents a version number consisting of three parts it is absolutely ok to use that. Important is the order of version number but that is guaranteed with the scheme you posted (obviously day.month.year would be bad).
There are already packages using a similar name, e.g.: http://www.ros.org/debbuild/indigo.html?q=libg2o
