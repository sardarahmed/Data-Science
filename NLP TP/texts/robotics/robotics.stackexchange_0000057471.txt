Q:

library not found when starting youbot_driver_ros_interface

Hello,
I have a youbot running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and ROS Hydro. I installed the ros-hydro-youbot-driver and ros-hydro-youbot-driver-ros-interface packages. When I try to start the ros driver using roslaunch youbot_driver_ros_interface youbot_driver.launch I get the following error message which relates to [1]
    core service [/rosout] found
    /opt/ros/hydro/lib/youbot_driver_ros_interface/youbot_driver_ros_interface: error while loading shared libraries: process[youbot_driver-1]: started with pid [3765]
    libtf.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
    [youbot_driver-1] process has died [pid 3765, exit code 127, cmd /opt/ros/hydro/lib/youbot_driver_ros_interface/youbot_driver_ros_interface base/joint_states:=joint_states arm_1/joint_states:=joint_states __name:=youbot_driver __log:=/home/youbot/.ros/log/cb1447ea-9df2-11e3-9357-0022697f602c/youbot_driver-1.log].
    log file: /home/youbot/.ros/log/cb1447ea-9df2-11e3-9357-0022697f602c/youbot_driver-1*.log
    all processes on machine have died, roslaunch will exit
    shutting down processing monitor...
    ... shutting down processing monitor complete
    done

Note that before I got this error message I also had a different problem with the package: I had to set the ethernet capabilites like described in the building from source section (2.2.2) here: [2] This might be a bug or could be related to this error.
After executing ldconfig /opt/ros/hydro/lib I now get the following error message:

adding export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/ros/hydro/lib/libtf.so"
to zshrc/bashrc also didn't help.

A:

Hi, the debian package for the youbot-driver-ros-interface did not work yet because of missing run time dependencies. WIth the next ROS debian update cycle hopefully this should be fixed.
So far it is recommended to compile it yourself, as described here
The second problem with the error "No socket connection on eth0" is usually due to

forgot "setcap" command for the youbot_driver_ros_interface executable
another port than eth0 is connected (see here)
hardware issue with cabling, emergency stop etc.

If you did the first thing and still does not work, you might want to send a message to hotline@youbot-store.com as it is probably not related to ROS anymore.
