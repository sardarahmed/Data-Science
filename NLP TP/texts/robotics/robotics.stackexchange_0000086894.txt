Q:

Robot following another robot in navigation

I want to make a robot follow another robot which would be controlled by keyboard. Simulation is in Gazebo How can I do that using ROS navigation? Is it possible?
I already managed to make that happen by making two topics. First robot is subscribing to the odometry of second robot and moving to it, but I would like to try that using navigation but don't have any ideas.
