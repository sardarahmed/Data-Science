Q:

Ending nodes/topics from python script

Hello! To preface, I working with a turtlebot3 running ROS on Ubuntu, and working with the package frontier-exploration. I am designing a Python script that will send the turtlebot to its point of origin when the battery is low, and stop when it reaches that point. It operates by specifying a very small perimeter around the bot's point of origin. Now the problem: I want the bot to completely stop moving when it reaches its goal, but I cannot seem to publish a Twist to cmd_vel that will stop the bot. Is there a way that I can shutdown frontier-exploration from my Python script? Thank you!

Can you please update your question with what you've attempted so far (i.e., your code)?

You should post a new question about your inability to stop the robot using commands. Shutting down the node is a heavy-handed way to stop frontier-exploration and there should be a better way. (If there isn't, your question might trigger someone to produce one.)

A:

You can manage nodes from a Python program using the roslaunch API. Keep in mind that this API is listed as "very unstable", although it has been in that state since forever and to be honest I don't think it will change that much from now on.
The rosmon tool might also interest you. It replaces roslaunch, and as well as several other useful features, it provides a ROS service that you can use to start and stop nodes.
