Q:

how to pass parameters to URDF in ros2 launch file?

I know we can do this in ROS-1, but I'm not exactly sure with the syntax in ROS2.
Just a small try I had given:
start_robot_state_publisher_cmd = Node(
    package='robot_state_publisher',
    executable='robot_state_publisher',
    name='robot_state_publisher',
    output='screen',
    parameters=[{'use_sim_time': use_sim_time, 'frame_prefix': 'robot1/', 'robot_description': Command([robot_desc,'tfpre:=', 'robot1/'])}],
    arguments=[urdf])

tf pre is the parameter I'm trying to pass. But, I'm certainly sure there is some mistake with this ,method.

A:

One way to do it is as follow
import xacro
...
urdf = xacro.process_file(file_path, mappings={'tfpre': 'robot1/'}).toxml()
# Use urdf
