Q:

ros.informatik.uni-freiburg.de down?

Hi,
From here, the mirror at   ros.informatik.uni-freiburg.de looks down since yesterday (20180516).
Has it been removed officially, or is it a temporary issue ?

wiki/Mirrors also shows there's something up with it. Perhaps something to ask the maintainer?

A:

I was referring to the binary packages mirror. In the mean time, the package mirror at Freiburg seems to be back up.
http://wiki.ros.org/Mirrors refers to mirrors of the wiki which is a separate issue.

Both hostnames resolve to the same IP, so there would be no difference.
But seeing as it's already up again, doesn't matter.
