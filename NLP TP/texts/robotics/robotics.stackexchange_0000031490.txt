A:

There is a gstreamer node gscam: http://www.ros.org/wiki/gscam
If you can figure out the gstreamer configureation to read from the camera's URI, it should work, though I have to say the gstreamer can be a bit difficult to configure at times. GSCAM_CONFIG would need to contain a gstreamer pipeline string that accessed the IP camera's URI. You'd need the correct gstreamer plugins, and you might find some info on how to configure , rtsp for example, here: http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gst-plugins-good-plugins/html/gst-plugins-good-plugins-rtspsrc.html

Thanks a lot. I will dig into that next week and if I manage it, post my gstreamer pipelinw.

Yeah. Sorry, I should have been more specific, I'll edit the answer.

Sorry to ask, but what do you mean by the "gstreamer-foo" ? I only see gscam in the package. Do you mean I need to somehow work on the system variable GSCAM_CONFIG to get it to connect to my IP camera?
