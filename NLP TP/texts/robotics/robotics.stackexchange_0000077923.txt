A:

This is really a Gazebo question (and should be asked over at answers.gazebosim.org), but 2 seconds googling lead me to github.com/kaustubhhiware/mahindra:

Model demo world for Mahindra Rise Prize

This world contains a small city with white markings along the rod to guide the bot , and also yellow parking slots in some positions.

To run the world , first of all , you must have 3 things installed - ROS, Gazebo(generally preinstalled with ROS) and gazebo-ros packages . You need to type the following in your terminal after changing the working directory to your local directory - roslaunch mahindra mahindra.launch

Is that what you were looking for?
