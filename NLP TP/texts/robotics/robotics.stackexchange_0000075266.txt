Q:

svo_ros + kinetic, no topic publishing

Hi everyone,
I'm trying to run SVO on Ubuntu 16.04 and Kinetic running on my macbook air. Compiling is ok and tracking seems to work good on svo rosbag dataset from what I see rqt_svo GUI ("GOOD TRACKING" displayed).
However, no tf topic nor pose and image are published form svo_ros node. In fact, vo_->last_frame_ always seems null.
I posted the issue on svo github (https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_svo/issues/157) but I re post it here because I think it is more related to ROS.
Because pointers on cv::Mat are involved, I was wondering if the problem came from openCV (version 3 in Kinetic).
What do you think ?

A:

FYI I find a solution to fix the problem temporary (I'm sure there is still some topics not published)
I made last_frame_ public in svo/frame_handler_mono.h instead of protected
Somehow the function lastFrame() always returned NULL otherwise.
Now Rviz displays svo/image and tf properly
