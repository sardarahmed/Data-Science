Q:

Zeromq in ROS as external library

Hi all,
I am trying to use zeromq in ros as external library to communicate with other device(no ros on this device).
For testing i wrote a rosnode with zeromq reciever  and zeromq sender with zeromq  sample code and ran both on my pc .
i am using port tcp://10.64.7.220:9000
If i  start rosnode  first, zeromq sender not able to connect with and exits with below error.
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'zmq::error_t'
  what():  Address already in use
Aborted (core dumped)

If i  start zeromq sender first,  rosnode not able to connect with and exits with error at
zmq_bind (responder, "tcp://10.64.7.220:9000");

I went through ros networking little but i couldn't figure it out why its not working.
thank you.

It was working well now, mistake was i was using trying to bind from both  rosnode with zeromq reciever and zeromq sender i.e zmq_bind() causing problem.  I modified as per sample code in zeromq and its working well.
