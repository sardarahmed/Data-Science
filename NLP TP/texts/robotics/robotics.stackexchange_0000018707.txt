Q:

Manipulability Measures of Serial Robots?

I need to create a dataset of dexterous workspaces for a significantly large number of serial robots with varying DoFs. 
My question is if there is an efficient way of measuring a robot's manipulability. 
Most solutions that I have found are based on inverse kinematics, which in my particular case would take too long. Are there any time-efficient alternatives?

A:

The most common manipulability measure is by Yoshikawa [1] which is purely kinematic, ie. it ignores dynamics such as inertia and motor torques.  It is simply
$$
\sqrt{\det( J J^T)}
$$
where $J$ is the manipulator Jacobian that gives spatial velocity in world coordinates.  The measure says something about how spherical the 6D velocity ellipsoid is.
The measure is a bit problematic because it is a norm of mixed units (m/s and rad/s).  It can be more insightful to take the translational 3x3 part (upper left sub matrix) or the rotational 3x3 part (lower right sub matrix).  This is discussed in ยง8.2.2 of [2].
Using the Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB we can easily compute this measure
>> mdl_puma560  % define a robot model and some poses
>> p560.maniplty(qn)
Manipulability: translation 0.111181, rotation 2.44949
>> p560.maniplty(qz)
Manipulability: translation 0.0842946, rotation 0
>> p560.maniplty(qs)
Manipulability: translation 0.00756992, rotation 2.44949
>> p560.maniplty(qr)
Manipulability: translation 0.00017794, rotation 0

where qr = [0, 1.5708, -1.5708, 0, 0, 0], qs = [0, 0, -1.5708, 0, 0, 0] and 
qn = [0, 0.7854, 3.1416, 0, 0.7854, 0].
We can see that pose qn (elbow up, wrist pointing down) is quite well conditioned whereas qr (arm straight up) is close to singular.
If you have Denavit-Hartenberg models for all your robots then this would be an easy task to automate.
Taking dynamics into account involves measures based on the force ellipsoid and is discussed in ยง9.2.7 of [2].  It requires that you know the inertial parameters of the robot which in general is not the case. Use the 'asada' option to the maniplty method to compute this.
