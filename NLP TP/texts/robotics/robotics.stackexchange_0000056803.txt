Q:

Point center in ufrd model and move_base package

Hello all!
I am would like create my own urdf model. It will be robot with differential drive like in the Pi robot.
But I have a questions:
What will be center of robot? point rotate or geometry center of robot in URDF model? regarding what point set all sensors?
How I can set this model in costmap_common_params file in move_base package? footprint: [[-0.2,-0.2],[-0.2,0.2], [0.2, 0.2], [0.2,-0.2]]  or robot_radius: 0.21?

A:

For a diff drive robot, the typical place for a base_link frame location would be centered between the two wheels (and often projected onto the ground plane, but that's less important). If your wheels are centered on the robot (like a turtlebot) then a robot radius makes sense. If your wheels are offset from the center (like pirobot) then the footprint might be a better option.
