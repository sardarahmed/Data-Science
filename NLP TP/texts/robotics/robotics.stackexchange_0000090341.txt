Q:

How to run rqt_graph in ROS2?

Hi,
I have seen rqt_visualization and found that rqt_graph is already ported for the Crystal. I have run rqt_graph by rosrun rqt_graph rqt_graph command in ROS1 (melodic) but don't know about Crystal.
I have tried ros2 run rqt_graph rqt_graph after building on crystal and source setup.bash but not able to run.
Please provide me guidance for the same.

Assuming you have built the latest state from the crystal-devel branch in the rqt_graph repo have you tried to call just rqt_graph?

Cool, I missed that last update.
Do you plan to release a stable version in a patch for crystal or will it be only in D-turtle?

That depends on the feedback on https://github.com/ros-visualization/rqt_graph/pull/22#issuecomment-460307808

@Dirk Thomas
Yes, I have tried rqt_graph command and it is opening one window like rqt and rqt_plot but specifically for rqt_graph. So, We can access the rqt graph with rqt_graph command with arguments.
Thanks.

A:

rqt_graph has been released for Crystal and will be in the main repo with the next sync. It can be invoked standalone by just calling rqt_graph on the command line.
