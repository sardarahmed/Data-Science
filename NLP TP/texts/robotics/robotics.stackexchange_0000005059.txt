Q:

Implementing a torque-controlled method on a position-controlled robot

I am working with a position-controlled manipulator. However, I want to implement a torque-controlled method on this robot. Is there any way to convert a torque command to a position command?
I try to find research papers on this but I have no idea where I should start or which keywords I should use in searching. Do you have any suggestion?

A:

We find this recent paper by Andrea Del Prete, Nicolas Mansard, Oscar Efrain Ramos Ponce, Olivier Stasse, Francesco Nori quite interesting: 
Implementing Torque Control with High-Ratio Gear Boxes and without Joint-Torque Sensors
The authors presented a framework for implementing joint-torque control on position controlled robots.
