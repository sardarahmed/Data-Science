Q:

How to get the real coordinates from the image coordinates?

Hello dear friends,
I want to calibrate an colored object, so with CMVISION I achieved to calibrate and it gives me the coordinate in the Image, but for calibration I need the Real coordinate, I know that in some how I could use PCL (point cloud library) to get them but I dont know how,
I am new in PCL , so any body can give me a hint to start?, (I am searching in parallel too)
Thank you in advance
PS : I am using a Kinect.

can you have a look at this question and if u have an answer may be provide me with it? http://answers.ros.org/question/189846/working-with-cmvisionblobs/

A:

As an example, I have a node that receives a point cloud, extracts an image and runs a vision algorithm on it, and then retrieves the XYZ coordinates of the detected features:
https://github.com/trainman419/targeting/blob/master/target_detector/src/targets.cpp#L219-L269
The key things to pick out are the conversion from a structured point cloud to an image:
sensor_msgs::ImagePtr image = boost::make_shared<sensor_msgs::Image>();
pcl::toROSMsg( *cloud, *image );

And the return conversion from image coordinates to a 3D point from the cloud:
pcl::PointXYZ p1 = depth.at(x, y);
