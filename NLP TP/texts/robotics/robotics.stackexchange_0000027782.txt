Q:

Shortcut key for right panel

Is there a short cut key to bring up the right panel in the Gazebo GUI?
I've built gazebo from source on Windows and seem to be missing the window expansion icon that controls the right panel visibility.

A:

Have you tried dragging the middle of the dark grey edge of the screen? On Ubuntu three dots show up, but some things look weird on other OS's.
