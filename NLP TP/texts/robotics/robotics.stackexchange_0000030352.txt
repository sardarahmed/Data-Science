Q:

Household_objects_database new entries

I would like to know about the possibility to add objects to the household_objects_database once it is downloaded and run on local machine.
Is it possible for example using rein or other tools from the object_recognition stack?
Thank you so much

A:

https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/stacks/object_manipulation/trunk/household_objects_database/src/mesh_loader.cpp is a good starting place for this task.
Try using this as a template to move forward.
