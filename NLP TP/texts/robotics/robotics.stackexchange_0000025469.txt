Q:

hector_quadrotor_demo goes unstable when robot gets high enough

Related to a ros package, so originally asked on answers.ros.. but can anyone see a reason why a simulation would become unstable and subsequently crash because of the position of a robot in Gazebo?
See video and another video here.
For reference in this is with roslaunch hector_quadrotor_demo outdoor_flight_gazebo.launch and rostopic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist '[0,0,0.1]' '[0,0,0]'

Which version of Gazebo are you using?
Comment by SL Remy on 2012-12-11:
Gazebo 1.6.16 (from ubuntu precise ros-fuerte packages)

Just for clarity, the above version number is not the version of Gazebo. That is the version of the ROS simulator_gazebo package. The actual Gazebo version is 1.0.2.

A:

So far the answer seems related to the controller for the quadrotor.. the problem only appears to occur if both the imuTopic and the stateTopic are subscribed.
Still not sure why.. but when the controller reads data directly from gazebo link->GetWorldPose() and link->GetWorldLinearVel() instead of subscribing to the data that gazebo is publishing, the model is much more well behaved.

Both of those topics are set by default in the quadrobor ubuntu debs.
