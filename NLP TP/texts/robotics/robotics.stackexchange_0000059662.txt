Q:

waiting for the map problem

I follow the tutorial " slam_gmapping Tutorials MappingFromLoggedData " ,
and when I enter this command " rosrun map_server map saver " , I have this message " waiting for the map "
and after there are nothing.
What is the problem, I had forgot a step, or any configuration?
