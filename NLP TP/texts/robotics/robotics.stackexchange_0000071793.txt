Q:

rostopic echo only a msg of topic

I have a topic containing several messages. How can I use 'rostopic echo' to echo only one message.
For example this is my topic containing the following messages:
Header      hdr
int32       runlevel
int32       sublevel
int32       last_seq
int32[2]    type
int32[6]    pos
float32[18]   ori

and I am just interested to see only message pos on my terminal.

Is there anyway to decrease the rate of publishing? It's too fast and I can't see them.
Also is there anyway to plot them?

please update your question, don't post an answer.

A:

Regarding to the documentation of rostopic, this should work:
rostopic echo /my_topic/field_name

one complex example for typical tf messages:
rostopic echo /tf/transforms[0]/transform/translation/x

You can change the output rate (e.g. 1sec) with:
watch -n1 rostopic echo /my_topic/field_name

You can plot topics with rqt_plot

I can confirm that the first version works. I use it frequently.

@ahendrix: You are right. I tried it with tf and I failed to take into account that the field "transforms" is an array.
