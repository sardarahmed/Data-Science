Q:

rosdep key for SDL2 not working

OS: Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS
ROS2 Distro: Humble
I ran this command inside the directory that contains the src folder for all my ROS packages.
rosdep install -y -r --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro=humble

However, I got this error:
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
keyboard_teleop: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [libsdl2-dev]
Continuing to install resolvable dependencies...
#All required rosdeps installed successfully

But the rosdep key I used "libsdl2-dev" is from the official rosdep key github: https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/blob/0bec75fd1305910808b07776fbd1997a8c315998/rosdep/base.yaml (line 4651)
I thought putting the line
<depend>libsdl2-dev</depend>

inside the package.xml file of the package allows rosdep to find and install the necessary dependencies of the package.
Is there something I did wrong? I am new to managing dependencies with rosdep.

A:

You found the right entry. However you should be referencing the parent key, not the platform specific package.
So sdl2 and then on your platform rosdep will determine that it should install libsdl2-dev on other platforms it will resolve appropriately using the other rules.
Our default is to use the Debian/Ubuntu naming policy so most are the same and likely your source of confusion. However this is an older legacy rule so doesn't match exactly.
