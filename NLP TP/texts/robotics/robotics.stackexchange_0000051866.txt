Q:

Callback function when a node is created/destroyed

Hello everyone,
I am developing a parallel solution with ROS, and I want to develop a node that executes certain functions when a another node in the architecture is added or destroyed at runtime. I know that I can do some status polling with rosgraph library, but is there any way to have a callback function when any of the other nodes execute ros::init or ros::shutdown?
Thank you in advance

Sounds like an application for the bond package.

Thank you, with this library I can know when a certain node finishes. Any ideas of how to detect that a new node has been created?

I suppose it could announce itself on a topic, when ready to run.
