Q:

Log scheduling and archival policy in ROS

I am looking for log archival package  which should be able to help me in based on below policy.
(1) whenever log file (system.log) size >30859 or file is 3 day old then it should archive the same with new name system.log1 and again start the feeding the log in system.log file from start after truncating its content.
I am going to write all the debug statements in log file through  ROS c++ code in linux environment.
Any immediate help will be appreciated.

A:

On Linux, a flexible solution is logrotate
It allows logs to be archived based on age and/or size; archives logs may be compressed; versions may be capped: etc
When using log rotate on a running system which is not coded to handle its log files being closed/moved by an external process, use the copytruncate option as it will preserve the open file handle(s) being used by other programs.
