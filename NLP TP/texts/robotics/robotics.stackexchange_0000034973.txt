Q:

Datatype to access pointcloud2

Hello all,
i am working on pobot object detection project and m totally new at Ros.
so far in project we have published pointclouds but can anyone tell me after subscribing to a pointcloud2 message through ros, how to access its data field ( WHERE THE ACTUAL DATA IS STORED)
ROS_INFO("I heard Height[%d] Width[%d] point_step[%d] row_step[%d] data[%d] ", msg->height, msg->width, msg->point_step, msg->row_step);
through this i can access height,width but what is the datatype for data field??

A:

From the documentation on the sensor_msgs::PointCloud2 type, the 'data' member contains the actual data of the point cloud message, and the type is determined dynamically by reading the 'fields' member.
I suggest you determine what sort of data you're hoping to extract from your input point clouds, and use pcl::fromROSMsg() to convert your ros message into a pcl point cloud, at which point you can use the supplied iterators to iterate over your point cloud.
