A:

It depends on what your robot is and what odom data it publishes. Check documentation for the robot you have, or use rostopic list see what topics are available. If you are writing nodes for a self built base then you will need to read the encoders and publish the data on a topic yourself.

I'm working with KUKA Youbot. The main goal is to get the angle of rotation of the motor shaft. The manual for this robot gives information only about how to convey information on the engines. And not a word about how to get it.
