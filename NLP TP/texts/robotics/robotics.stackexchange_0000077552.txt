Q:

Subcribing to the Odometry

Hi, I have a gazebo model which is moved by teleop_keyboard. My model has a node which publishes Odometry values in X and Y and it has nav msgs.. I want to subscribe the turtlesim(topic turtle1/pose) to my model node and make it move in the same coordinates. How can I do this?

A:

Because the nav_msgs/Odometry is a different message type from turtlesim/Pose, you might have to write yourself a node to convert the two.  Before you do that, check to see if there isn't already a topic publishing the pose you want.
Fortunately one of the values of Odometry is a Pose (see rosmsg show nav_msgs/odometry), unfortunately this is a geometry_msgs/Pose rather than a turtlesim/Pose (use rosmsg show [msg] to see what each contains). They are different, most notably the turtlesim Pose does not use a quaternion.
I hope this helps!
