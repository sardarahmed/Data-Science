Q:

saving pcd map for ccny_rgbd package

Hi,
I have tried the instructions on the wiki page of ccny_rgb package.
After running the following sequence of commands,
roslaunch ccny_openni_launch openni.launch publish_cloud:=true
roslaunch ccny_rgbd vo+mapping.launch
the map can be seen in rviz (sometimes it doesn't work but after restarting all nodes, it works) but after running
rosservice call /save_full_map "mymap.pcd"
it gives the following error:
ERROR: Service [/save_full_map] is not available.
However with rosservice list, a different service "/save_pcd_map" can been seen and after calling this service no error occurs but no map is saved as well.
rosservice call /save_pcd_map "mymap.pcd"
Did someone try this or have some suggestion how to save a map for this package? I tried it on Ubuntu 12.04 using ros fuerte.
Thank you in advance,
Zahid

A:

I have tried it earlier and it works fine on Fuerte. You are right, the name of service has changed [Wiki-help needs to be updated].
Here is how to save the Pcd file:
rosservice call /save_pcd_map /home/your_user_name/my_map.pcd

Yes, the service name changed, but I haven't updated the wiki yet. The change was due to the fact that there are now 2 formats for the full map: pcd and octomap, hence the /save_pcd_map and /save_octomap services

true, it works with /save_pcd_map. I have also tried to save the octomap and it works fine as well. Thank you Usman and Ivan
