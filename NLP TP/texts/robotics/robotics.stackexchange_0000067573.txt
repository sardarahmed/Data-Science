Q:

roscore hangs after ubuntu 14.04.2 upgrade

I recently upgraded to ubuntu 14.04.2 through software update manger, when I try and run roscore it it seems to hang in the terminal (i get no terminal output). When i ctl-c to clear I get the following:
^C... logging to /home/dambrosio/.ros/log/d1cb7a66-fa64-11e4-a258-000c29e19f77/roslaunch-ubuntu-3242.log
Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.
Press Ctrl-C to interrupt
Done checking log file disk usage. Usage is <1GB.

When I ctl-c again I get the following:
^CTraceback (most recent call last):

I have tried to re-install ros-indigo-desktop-full and python-rosinstall. Any ideas on what is going on, or what changed?
Thanks,

A:

I have found that this is usually an issue with the ROS_IP and/or ROS_MASTER_URI being incorrect. Make sure that you have these values correctly set in your environment variables. See link below details on setting these in Ubuntu. See link below:
