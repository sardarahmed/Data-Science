A:

It looks like your tex installation has some issues. The error you have to solve is that:
Font bbm10 at 600 not found ==> Fatal error occurred
The thing is, that Opencv2 compiles its entire documentation during a make command. If you find a way to turn that off, please comment. If you just want to make it compile, reinstall your texlive environment
