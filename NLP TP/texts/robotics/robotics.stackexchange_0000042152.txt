Q:

Wireless Network

It looks like you need a Wireless Network in order to operate the turlebot, is there anyway to get around this/use the turtlebot with only one computer?

A:

You can reconfigure the TurtleBot to start without a wireless network with the following:
roscd turtlebot_bringup/upstart
sudo ./install.bash lo

This will have the side-effect of being unable to access the ROS network on the TurtleBot from other computers.
