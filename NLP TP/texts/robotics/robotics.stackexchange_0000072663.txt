Q:

image_view symbol lookup error

Hi there,
Whenever I try to use image_view to visualize a topic published by usb_cam with the following command:
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/usb_cam/image_raw

I get this:
init done 
opengl support available 
[ INFO] [1457614339.953957839]: Using transport "compressed"
/opt/ros/indigo/lib/image_view/image_view: symbol lookup error: /opt/ros/indigo/lib/image_view/image_view: undefined symbol: _ZN9cv_bridge18cvtColorForDisplayERKN5boost10shared_ptrIKNS_7CvImageEEERKSsbdd

The same happens even with the "raw" transport:
init done 
opengl support available 
[ INFO] [1457614438.464431134]: Using transport "raw"
/opt/ros/indigo/lib/image_view/image_view: symbol lookup error: /opt/ros/indigo/lib/image_view/image_view: undefined symbol: _ZN9cv_bridge18cvtColorForDisplayERKN5boost10shared_ptrIKNS_7CvImageEEERKSsbdd

Am I doing something wrong? has anyone got similar errors?
Thanks in advance.

Please provide more information. What commands do you run so that these errors occur?

You are right, I'm sorry I forgot to add the command. Thanks for warning me.

this seems to point to a problem with linking. Did you install 'image_view'  from source or via 'apt-get'? Which OS/ROS-Distro?
Maybe also check if this answer helps...

If you installed via apt-get, you might have to source setup.bash.
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash

@nvoltex Have you solved this problem?I met the same recently,I tried the other methods suggested by others,but all didn't work.

In addition to Ziwen Qin's suggestion, I needed to run sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-cv-bridge. Versions of cv-bridge lower than 1.11.13 appear to cause this problem.

A:

This appears to be a bug with ROS' apt-get image-view program (version 1.12.18): https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/215
I'd recommend running
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-image-view
to pull down the latest fixed package.
