Q:

Google Cartographer Successes on Turtlebot (Or Similar?)

Hi,
I was just wondering if anyone has had any success yes with the likes of TurletBot (or similar robots) using Google's Cartographer .
I've see TRI playing with it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK6s7soVwws
Thanks
Mark

There was also a roscon 2016 video https://vimeo.com/187699364, and a slide around 3:07 showing a link to http://robocup2017.org/eng/index.html, though I don't see code there.

A:

There is a cartographer_turtlebot repo with a dedicated cartographer config for use with the Turtlebot, so that's probably a good place to get started.
