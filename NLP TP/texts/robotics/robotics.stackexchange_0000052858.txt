Q:

Meshes in moveit setup assistant

Hi all,
Pretty quick question: can meshes be used and rendered in urdf files for the moveit_setup_assistant?  I ask because currently, when I try to load a urdf with a reference to a .stl file, I get the following error:
[rospack] Error: no package/stack given
[librospack]: error while executing command
And mesh files don't load.  Does anyone know why this is?
EDIT: I'm actually wondering - is this just a limitation of rviz?  Are there certain ways one would have to have their urdf formatted to make all the meshes appear properly?  Will only certain filetypes render?

URDF can reference to mesh files (example) and RViz can render mesh (example), but I'm not sure about importing URDF that refers to .stl files.

But the following error seems more generic than specific issue of URDF-STL.
[rospack] Error: no package/stack

A:

Did you try sourced the setup.sh in that terminal? I think I had that issue once and it was just that I was forgetting to do so.
