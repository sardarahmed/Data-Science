Q:

Converting ultrasound range to a Laser Scan

In my end of studies project, I have to make a robot that should do mapping and localization using only ultrasounds sensor. So for doing this i should convert sensor_msgs/LaserScan message to sensor_msgs/Range message.
My question: How can i do this ??

A:

If you already have a map, and want incorporate your sensor_msgs/Range in move_base, modify the existing obstacle_layer plugin to subscribe to a topic with message type sensor_msgs/Range instead of sensor_msgs/LaserScan.

Any reason to not just use range_sensor_layer?
