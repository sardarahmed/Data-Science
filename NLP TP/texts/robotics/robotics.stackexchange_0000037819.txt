Q:

Asc Mav Framework can't find fcu_nodelet.launch

I'm trying to roslaunch the starmac package. I've made some modifications to the launch file but I get following error:
while processing /home/bob/ros/stacks/asctec_mav_framework/asctec_hl_interface/launch/fcu_nodelet.launch:
Invalid roslaunch XML syntax: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: u'/home/bob/ros/stacks/asctec_mav_framework/asctec_hl_interface/launch/fcu_nodelet.launch

I took a peek for the file and it wasn't there any suggestions?
