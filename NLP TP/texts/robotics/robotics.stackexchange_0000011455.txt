Q:

Which is best way to calculate inverse kinematics for scara robot?

I am working on scara robot project and I have one big confusion.  I am using simple trigonometric way(tan inverse traingl formula) to calculate inverse kinematics . But lot of people suggested me to use DH algorithm to calculate inverse kinematics .
Which one is better and faster algorithm for scara robot .

A:

The geometric method of computing inverse kinematics (which you are calling the trigonometric way) and the Denavit-Hartenburg method result in the same kinematic equations.  Neither is better, although DH can be generalized more easily to suit a variety of arm geometries.  
Regarding which algorithm is faster, it depends on how you implement the equations in code.   Optimizing the calculations in your software will probably yield performance improvements (I am basing this on assumptions I'm making when reading your question).   But calculating the equations using a different approach should have no impact.
