We're also confused. Please attach your images directly to your question, instead of linking to an offsite location.

Is it perhaps at the top of the screen in the menu bar there? Does it change if you maximize the window? Maybe this: https://askubuntu.com/questions/541449/how-do-i-always-show-menu-items-in-unity#610237

Thanks everybody!

A:

If you're using the Unity window management (default on recent versions of Ubuntu) you need to mouse over the title bar at the top to see the File menu at the top. If you move your mouse to the top of the screen I suspect you'll see it there.

Thanks a lot! The issue seemed to be simple to answer, but so complicated to find answer ^^
