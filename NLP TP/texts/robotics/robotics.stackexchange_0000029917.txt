Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: uninstallation

Does "sudo apt-get remove ros-cturtle-ros" also removes other packages in my home folder? If not, could I just manually delete them or is there a recommended method?

A:

sudo apt-get remove ros-cturtle-ros will remove all cturtle packages in /opt/ros but not do anything in your home directory.
To remove things from your home directory rm -rf ~/ROS or whatever path you want to remove will work.  Or, if you wish, you can delete the directories from a file browser GUI.
Note: There's no undo for rm so make sure you get the path right.
