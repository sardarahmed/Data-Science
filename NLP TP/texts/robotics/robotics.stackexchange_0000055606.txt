Q:

Setting Visual Odometry parameters for Low Frequency

Hello,
I have tried the mono_depth_odometer node for visual odometry using a kinect in different machines. I have seen the low processing capabilities can severely degrade the odometry.
Are there any parameters which can be modified in order to have a faster visual odometry? I have seen the list in http://docs.fovis.googlecode.com/git/group__FovisCore.html#ga113578b67d3e37bc78f1fffd8440e1ff, can those parameters be modified using "rosrun node param:=value"? Any suggestions on which parameters to modify?
Thanks!

A:

Yes, those parameters can be set through rosparam, you'll have to replace hyphens with underscores though (see http://wiki.ros.org/fovis_ros#Parameters).
I havn't played much with parameter settings. My first guess to get a higher rate would be:

decrease feature_window_size (could lead to false matches)
set use_subpixel_refinement to 0 (could lead to worse estimates)
if the features in your environment are small, you could lower max_pyramid_level (could lead to less features)

It is difficult to tune so many parameters at once. I would suggest you try different sets of parameters and compare the output.
