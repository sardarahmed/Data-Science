Q:

Jenkins Build Issues - File INSTALL cannot find /obj-x86_64-linux-gnu

Still having trouble with building packages... This time, it seems that the issue is almost resolved, however. The build seems successful (as far as I can tell); however, the cmake_install.cmake file causes make to fail. Does anyone see the issue?
Install the project...
/usr/bin/cmake -P cmake_install.cmake

Update: So I think I got it. The CMakeLists.txt file had some unnecessary stuff that made this a problem.

Weird, can you post an answer and accept for others who run into this?

Sorry to be unclear... It's still not working.

A:

I am looking at your repository and packages here:
https://github.com/allenh1/p2os/tree/master/p2os_teleop
A few things:

remove all mainpage.dox (this is for rosbuild only)
remove all manifest.xml (this is for rosbuild only)
remove all instances of these lines: (this was a hold over from rosbuild and should not be used anymore)

Example below.
# set the default path for built executables to the "bin" directory
set(EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/bin)
# set the default path for built libraries to the "lib" directory
set(LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/lib)

Specifically for p2os_teleop, you call generate_messages but never declare any messages, you should remove that macro call. I think that will fix the above issue. I opened a ticket to get a better error message here:
https://github.com/ros/genmsg/issues/31
