A:

If you check this tutorial, you'll see that it launches display.launch by using:
roslaunch urdf_tutorial display.launch model:=urdf/01-myfirst.urdf

You need to add the argument model to tell the launch file which model to use, as you can see in the example above (and the tutorial). You haven't added the argument.
