Q:

How can I draw 3D bound box in rviz tool

Hi.
I'd like draw 3D bounding boxes for detected objects (car, people, etc.)

In my googling, there is a visulization_marker in rviz that can draw a line.
However, it looks not a perfect solution to draw 3D bounding box,
Is there any suggested method to draw it.
Thanks in advanced

A:

You could use the BoundingBox-Marker from the jsk_rviz_plugins. image description http://jsk-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/bounding_box2.png
