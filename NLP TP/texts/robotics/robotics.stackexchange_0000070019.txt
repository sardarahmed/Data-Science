Q:

No more prerelease test on the buildfarm?

Hi,
I'd like to make a prerelease test for a package in Indigo on the buildfarm as described at
http://wiki.ros.org/action/fullsearch/bloom/Tutorials/PrereleaseTest?dist=indigo#bloom.2BAC8-Tutorials.2BAC8-PrereleaseTest.2BAC8-indigo.Prepare_the_release
Thus I go to http://prerelease.ros.org. Then I click on "Old Site" (on the top right) and choose "Indigo". I select my package, enter my email address and click on "Start Testing". But then the new page is loaded where the prerelease command is generated to run the test locally.
How can I run a prerelease test for an Indigo package on the buildfarm? Or can this only be done locally?
Thank you for any hint!
Regards,
Sabrina

A:

Yes, you need to run the prereleases locally now. No, there is no build farm available which performs the build for you anymore.
This change was announces in http://lists.ros.org/pipermail/ros-users/2015-May/069430.html

Thank you. I will a look at locally performed prerelease tests.
