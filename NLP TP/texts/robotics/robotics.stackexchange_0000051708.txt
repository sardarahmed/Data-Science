Q:

Source location for installed packages - Groovy

In groovy (maybe only catkin packages) the source code for installed packages do not appear in the package directories (i.e. the directory found using roscd).  I know the source code can be found in the original repository, but this may not be exactly what is installed.  Is there a tarball somewhere that captures the source code for a particular installed version.

A:

I believe that you can find the source code as part of the *-release repositories.
For instance, if you wanted the source code for the 1.9.30 release of Rviz in Hydro for Quantal, you can go to Github:
https://github.com/ros-gbp/rviz-release/tree/debian/ros-hydro-rviz_1.9.30-0_quantal
Bloom automates the creation of the specific branches and tags for the released versions.  This is the source that the buildfarm then uses to generate the debs.
The release repositories will be listed in the rosdistro repository
Edit: Forgot to mention that Github allows for downloading tarballs of git tags, such as:
https://github.com/ros-gbp/rviz-release/archive/debian/ros-hydro-rviz_1.9.30-0_quantal.tar.gz
