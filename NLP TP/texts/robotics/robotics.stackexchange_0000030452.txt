Q:

Could we have a "remove all topics subscriptions" button in Rviz?

Hello,
I am facing a lot the case where I start rviz with an old configuration and have to erase all my previous topic subscriptions one by one.
I know one can save and load configurations but having a simple button that would remove all the topic subscription (or the possibility to select several and remove them by pressing erase) would be a huge time-saver I think.

Hey Raph,
I can't test it right now but I think the function is already there.
At the bottom under your subscriptions click the "Manage" button, and then you will get a window with a "remove all" button.
