Q:

How can I combine two xacros with a common root?

I have two XACROs for two robotic arms and I want them in the same XACRO, so that the URDF generated from that XACRO contains both those arms. The issue is that both the arms' XACROs start from a "Root" and it's not allowing me to do that.
So how can I add the two with both having the same "Root" for reference?

The short answer is that you can't. You can't have two links with the same name.

Thanks @David Lu. I did see that. And have already started modifying the files accordingly. Only issue is that these files rely on lots of "Properties" and trying to duplicate the information is a bit tedious. I keep getting errors. Working on that. Thanks again.
