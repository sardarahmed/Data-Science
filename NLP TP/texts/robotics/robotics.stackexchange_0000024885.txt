Q:

Trouble Downloading Assets in Webots 2023a Version on MacOS

I've recently downloaded and installed the Webots 2023a version on my MacOS. The installation process went through without any issues. However, I'm encountering a problem when I try to install tutorial or demo bots.
When I try to download the assets, the download seems to freeze, showing me a 0% progress, and doesn't progress from there. I've attached a screenshot below to give you a visual understanding of the issue.

Steps to reproduce this issue:

Open Webots.
Navigate to the tutorial or demo bots section.
Try to download the assets.

I have tried the following steps to resolve the issue:

Restarting the Webots application.
Reinstalling the Webots application.
Checking for updates to make sure I'm using the latest version of the software.
Checking my internet connection to ensure it's stable.

None of the above steps seem to have solved the problem. I'm not sure if this is a bug with the software or if there's something wrong on my end.
If anyone has experienced a similar issue or knows of a potential solution, your help would be much appreciated.

A:

This problem typically means that you have a global firewall which prevents you from accessing online GitHub resources.
To confirm this, try to open this URL.
If it doesn't work, then you have a firewall problem. You should try again from a different network location or from a VPN until you see the content of the URL.
Once this works, Webots should be able to download the resources it needs from GitHub and you problem will be resolved.
