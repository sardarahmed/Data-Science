Q:

ROS Real Time Publisher

Hi,
I am new to ROS and am trying to understand how I can use the real time publishers. I followed this link http://wiki.ros.org/realtime_tools
For using this, would I require a RT kernel or the usual Ubuntu kernel would be sufficient?
Thanks in advance.

In short:

would I require a RT kernel

Yes. A real-time kernel would be required.
For some longer discussions about ROS (1) and real-time, see #q206052.
