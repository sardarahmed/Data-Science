Q:

Simulation with a simple car model in Gazebo

Hi,
I'm currently planning to set up a gazebo simulation for an default gazebo simple car model .I haven't had any luck understanding how to go about making the robot move via external commands (keyboard presses, etc.).
The documentation seems to gloss over this, or at least I can't find where it's described. How would I go about making a robot move in the a Gazebo simulation?
Thanks

A:

If I am not wrong, you need to implement a gazebo plugin that basically converts the velocity commands of the keyboard teleop to gazebo joint torques or speeds. For that purpose, I would recommend to have a look at:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/gazebo_plugins
You will find some gazebo plugins available. I think that GazeboRosDiffdrive is specially interesting for you. It implements a gazebo plugin for a differential robot. You would have to do something similar but for a car-like steering model.
Finally, to add Gazebo extensions to urdf files (where I guess you have modeled your robot), have a look at:

I hope this helps.

Hi @gazkune,
first of all, Thanks for your rapid answer. I've been finding in the gazebo_plugins and I've found gazebo_ros_diffdrive.cpp but I don't understand it. Then Where could i find more documentation or examples about it, because I'm novice
Thanks.
