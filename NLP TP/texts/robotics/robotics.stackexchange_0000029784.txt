Q:

Space requirements for a ROS mirror

Could anyone give me an idea what the HD space requirements currently are for mirroring the ROS repository? We are currently considering setting up a mirror and looking at the server requirements.

A:

I'm currently mirroring all debs (x86 & x86-64) for Hardy through Maverick. This is using 33GB of space.

FYI, that should be both arch's, not source.

Is that for just one architecture -- or for both but not source? My copy of HJKLM:{x86,x86_64} comes to 246 GB. Edit: Turns out apt-mirror's "autoclean" wasn't doing anything. Added explicit "clean" lines and switched to packages.ros.org, now it's 24 GB for everything.
