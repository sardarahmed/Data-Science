Q:

Create a bag with multiples topics

I'am newbie in ROS. In fact, I have a folder containing images, a file containing IMU data with its timestamps correspondence. How can i put all of them into a bag with multiples topics.

A:

Take a look at the rosbag Python API example.
That writes two msg types to two different topics (chatter and numbers).
Just make sure to use the correct message types (from sensor_msgs: sensor_msgs/Imu and sensor_msgs/Image), and that, depending on whether the nodes that will be receiving these messages need it, to embed a CameraInfo topic with the intrinsics of the camera that was used as well.
