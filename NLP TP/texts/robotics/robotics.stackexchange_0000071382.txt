Comment by JonW on 2016-01-16:
Your issue seems to match the one in this answer:
rgbdslam-v2-catkin_make-error

A:

In CMakeLists.txt there was an option to disable using sift. In numerous installs I only saw this option a couple of times. I can't remember it off the top of my head but it started with SET had sift somewhere in the line and ended with 1). All you have to do is change the 1 to a 0 and sift is disabled.
