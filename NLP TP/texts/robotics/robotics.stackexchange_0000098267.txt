Q:

rqt_console doesn't display all messages

My post is a duplicate of this post which was closed for unknown reasons. ROS users keep commenting under that post which means that the problem still exists!
Basically, rqt_console does not display all the messages from all nodes even though rqt_logger_level "sees" the nodes and the proper logging levels are set up.
Any solution to this problem?
Is there any workaround?

Hello, I was having a similar issue today. I was able to fix it by going to the rqt_console settings in the GUI, and then switching the Rosout Topic in the drop down menu from /rosout_agg to /rosout.

Could you please show how to fix it in the GUI? I am a beginner. I can not find switching operator.

it worked for me as well. In simple words when the rqt_console pops up there is small setting icon on the top right corner. I changed the /rosout_agg to /rosout first and then run the turtle_sim_node and it worked out.
