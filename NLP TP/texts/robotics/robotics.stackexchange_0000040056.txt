Q:

Android Dependencies problem - Teleop & camera tutorial

Hi there,
I followed this doc rosjava_core and android_core to install a fresh android_core rosjava_core on my fresh ubuntu 11.10. After gradlew instructions, I imported projects into eclipse.
PubSub tutorial works properly but I still have difficulties to get android_tutorial_teleop and android_tutorial_camera tutorial to work.
Teleop app failed on the runtime due to a ClassNotFoundException : org.ros.android.views.visualization.VisualizationView
Camera app throws a ClassNotFoundException caused by org.ros.android.views.RosCameraPreviewView
These classes are declared in the android_gingerbread project, which is set in the "Android Dependencies" of Teleop and Camera projects. According to this android doc "android dependencies" are automatically exported that's why I'm confused now.
I probably missed something because pubsub tuto works correctly and required org.ros.android.views.RosTextView from android_gingerbread.
Thanks for help,
Jérôme
PS : Got the same exceptions when running the apk generated by gradlew

Please, note that teleop depends directly on android_honeycomb_mr2, but android_honeycomb_mr2 depends on android_gingerbread, so teleop depends on android_gingerbread too.

A:

If I'm right, teleop is depending on honeycomb, not on gingerbread.
Thats what is said in the build.gradle of the project.
