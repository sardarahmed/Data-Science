Q:

2dnav_pr2 failed on 2DNavigationStackDemoWithSimple2DesksWorld

In doc page: http://www.ros.org/wiki/pr2_simulator/Tutorials/2DNavigationStackDemoWithSimple2DesksWorld
2dnav_pr2 package doesn't exist,so I can't execute
 roslaunch 2dnav_pr2 rviz_move_base.launch

and
 roslaunch rviz/rviz_move_base.launch

How to solve it?Is there any latest docs?

A:

This tutorial is just outdated (last edit in January 2010). The launch files you are mentioning are not present anymore but I guess they would just start up rviz for visualizing data from navigation. Have a look here for more infos on rviz and the navigation stack.

I think it is a lot of work to keep all tutorials up-to-date so some might always be outdated. If you find problems, you can file a ticket. Since it is a wiki page, you can also edit the tutorial yourself, but I would only do that if I'm totally sure about what I'm doing ;)
