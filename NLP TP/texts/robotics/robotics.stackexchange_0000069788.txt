Q:

ROS example program doesn't work with the Laptop webcam

I have been trying to work with the example program for ROS - OpenCV integration. When I run the program, there is no progress. I am not getting any response. I dont have any external or USB webcam. I have only the Laptop integrated webcam.
In the 'rosnodes list', this node is present. The tutorial doesn't offer any information about the output of the program.
My basic requirement: I need to get the image stream from the laptop webcam in ROS.
I tried  ' rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/image '. A new window pops with no image data in it.

A:

It doesn't sound like you running any ROS node to act as a driver for your webcam.
You need to find a driver node for your webcam, and run it in order to make the webcam topics (/camera/image and others) available for other nodes to use.
Most of the laptop webcams I've encountered are internal USB devices; I suspect yours is as well. You can confirm this by looking for webcams and/or unlabeled devices in the output from the lsusb command.
If you can confirm that your webcam is a USB device, try running one of the ROS driver nodes for USB webcams.
