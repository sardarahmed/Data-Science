Q:

Install ROS hydro from source

It seems that ros hydro has some problems installing from source to Ubuntu 12.04 as indicated in (http://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Installation/Source)
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
libpcl-1.7-all-dev : Depends: libpcl-apps-1.7-dev but it is not going to be installed
Depends: libpcl-io-1.7-dev but it is not going to be installed
Depends: libpcl-outofcore-1.7-dev but it is not going to be installed
Depends: libpcl-people-1.7-dev but it is not going to be installed
Depends: libpcl-recognition-1.7-dev but it is not going to be installed
Depends: libpcl-visualization-1.7-dev but it is not going to be installed
libpcl-1.7-bin : Depends: libpcl-io-1.7 but it is not going to be installed
Depends: libpcl-visualization-1.7 but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

After these errors, I tried to install libpcl by using $sudo apt-get install libpcl-all-dev, but there were other unmet dependencies...
When ROS hydro compile from source, it seems that Gazebo cannot be compiled.
CMake Error at /home/meng/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/share/catkin/cmake/catkin_package.cmake:159 (message):
catkin_package() DEPENDS on 'gazebo' which must be find_package()-ed
before. If it is a catkin package it can be declared as CATKIN_DEPENDS
instead without find_package()-ing it.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
/home/meng/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/share/catkin/cmake/catkin_package.cmake:98 (_catkin_package)
CMakeLists.txt:72 (catkin_package)

Reproduce this error by running:

Command failed, exiting.

Could someone provide some suggestions? Thanks a lot! :)

Could you add what distribution you are running (OS), and which version?

Thanks a lot! I am running on Ubuntu12.04

A:

Try using aptitude to install libpcl-1.7-all-dev .
Aptitude is a smarter manager than apt-get, and can sort out dependency issues such as the ones you are facing.
Here's the command -
sudo aptitude install libpcl-1.7-all-dev

As an afterthought, you could just install pcl by source, but it's a pain, and it takes a really long time. Just saying.
