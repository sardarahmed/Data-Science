Q:

annoying warnings for OcTreeBaseImpl.h/OcTreeIterator.hxx

I'm building MoveIt from source (indigo-devel branch for most packages), and getting this warnings everywhere (because octomap in included everywhere).
Is there a fix for octomap to get rid of them?
I'm using OSX 10.9, and Clang 5.1

A:

I submitted a pull request, and it has been merged.
Of course you ought to have done that last year in the first place ;)
