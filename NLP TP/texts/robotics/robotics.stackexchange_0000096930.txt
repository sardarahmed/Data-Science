Q:

roslaunch: is neither a launch file in package

Hi, I'm using Kinetic and I'm trying to launch other's and examples codes but all roslaunch shows this message:
[*.launch] is neither a launch file in package [nao_description] nor is [nao_description] a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

I used source /home/myuser/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash and roslaunch again, but the problem still.
Someone can help please...?

I get that error when I try roslaunch in the wrong folder, or misspell the file name.
If you're not in the folder of the launch file, you have to use the exact path in the call. Try it first from within the folder containing the launch file.

Things to check

Is the package compiled with catkin_make or catkin build and was that successful?
Can you find it in echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
Can you find it in rospack list | grep <package name>

if I can't find package, but catkin build went well, what can be the problem ? (but maybe I runed catkin build in different package).
