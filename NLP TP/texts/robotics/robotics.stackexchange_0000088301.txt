Q:

How to record data from rostopics using MongoDB

I have installed the mongodb_store package on my jackal clearpath robot (Ubuntu 14.04) running ros-indigo, and I have started the mongoldb_server by running the commands:
rosparam set mongodb_port 62345
rosparam set mongodb_host car-j100-0101
rosrun mongodb_store mongodb_server.py

and in the terminal I get a message saying: "[INFO] [WallTime:...] The Aug 2 08:40:27.317 [initandlisten] waiting for connections on port 62345" and nothing else happens after this. Ideally I want to use mongodb_store to store the data that is being published on all of the rostopics on my jackal.

A:

If mongodb_store is the package documented at wiki/mongodb_store, I believe the sections 4, 5 and further document the usage.
Do the example command lines not work for you?

I tried install mongodb_log from GitHub then using make but it didn't work. Am i able to install through apt-get install ros-indigo-mongodb-log?

So i have installed mongodb_log by doing: sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-mongodb-log but when I run the command rosrn mongodb_log mongodb_log -a as it states on the wiki I get an error saying "Found the following, but they're either not files, or not executable: /opt/ros/indigo/share/mongodb_lg

I've not used this myself, but I believe the script's name is mongodb_log.py. Not mongodb_log. I know the latter is what the wiki states, but installing the pkg and checking myself I only see a mongodb_log.py.
