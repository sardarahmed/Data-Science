Q:

Turtlebot navigation in Gazebo

Hello,
I have previously generated maps using a turtlebot, and have also used AMCL/ navigation stack in the maps. I am now trying to replicate that in Gazebo.
I have seen that turtlebot_simulator as it is doesn't work in Groovy, so I have cloned the turtlebot_gazebo repository and made a package out of it. When ran, gazebo does show a turtlebot, but it doesn't move when commanded and I don't see cmd_vel in rostopic list.
How do I go about getting the turtlebot in Gazebo and then loading my own PGM/YAML maps for navigation? Thanks in advance. I am on Ubuntu 12.04 with ROS Groovy.
Sai

@SaiHV i'm looking for using amcl in gazebo, have you any experience? it's my email maysam.getinfo at gmail dot com

A:

Unfortunately, TurtleBot-simulation is not supported in Groovy (but planned to be ready for Hydro). If you like to use it now, I recommend you use ROS Fuerte.
To stay up to date, follow the development on Github: https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot_simulator
