Q:

RQT ROS2 Galactic not plotting or autoscrolling

Hi guys,
I am getting this weird bug in RQT. I am trying to plot values from two different topics that RQT subscribes to, but the plot stands still. Whatever I do, I am not getting any values plotted, and the plot itself is not moving even though I have autoscroll on. I had the same error using ROS2 Foxy. I did a complete uninstall of ROS2 Foxy and installed ROS2 Galactic, but the problem persists.
In the terminal window where I launch RQT, I get this error message:
Traceback (most recent call last): File "/opt/ros/galactic/lib/python3.8/site-packages/rqt_topic/topic_widget.py", line 453, in __lt__ return self.data(column, Qt.UserRole) < other_item.data(column, Qt.UserRole) TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'NoneType' and 'NoneType'
Has anyone else encountered this error as well?
ROS_VERSION=2
ROS_PYTHON_VERSION=3
ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=0
ROS_DISTRO=galactic
Ubuntu 20.04.3
Linux 5.14.0-1031-oem x86_64

Could you try running rqt --clear-config, and reopening the widget? RQt stores configurations between sessions, and this command clears out those configurations.

A:

Running rqt --clear-config solved the issue!
