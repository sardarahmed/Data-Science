A:

You can try and use the SkidSteerDrivePlugin to drive a pioneer3at.
Looking at the source code, it expects you to publish a pose msg to ~/your_model_name_here/vel_cmd topic

Sending a Pose msg to a vel_cmd topic just seems wrong..

why is it wrong? i want to test my navigation algorithm so i should can control the robot, so i think it is correct . if it is possible explain more about my wrong?

A twist message seems more appropriate for a "velocity command" topic.. maybe these messages don't exist as yet?

yes, you are right, twist message is not exist, just pose message is exist for "velocity command" topic.
