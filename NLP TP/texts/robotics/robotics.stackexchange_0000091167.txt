Q:

Ardupilot + ROS

Hi !
I have made a hexacopter with APM 2.8 and would love to deploy ROS on it using a Raspi. I aim to use opencv with ros to detect landing marker and make it land autonomously. But I don't know what camera to use! Any suggestions on this would be great.
Have looked into mavros_pkg
