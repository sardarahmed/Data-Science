Q:

Why is the turtlebot gazebo kinect not in color?

I noticed that the kinect sensor in turtlebot_gazebo (in the unstable release) produces only black and white images.  The gazebo.urdf.xacro file looks like it is supposed to produce color.  Also, gazebo_ros_openni_kinect.cpp looks like it should be producing color.  Are there plans to get the kinect gazebo working in color soon?

A:

It actually is in color, it just turns the pixels that are beyond the maximum depth of the kinect sensor to a gray color.
