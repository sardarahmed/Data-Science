A:

Parameters are stored centrally on the parameter server and continue to live once whatever set that dies. They usually only contain simple data and can be set during launch. Parameters are usually used as configuration parameters while topics provide streaming changing data.
Technically topics form a direct connection between nodes, while parameters are stored and read from the parameter server.
