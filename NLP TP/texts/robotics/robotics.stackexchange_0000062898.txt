Q:

error in rosdep initialization

When i tried to initialize rosdep,
(xubuntu 14.04 is installed.)
sudo rosdep init

It gives following error
ERROR: cannot download default sources list from: https://raw.github.com/ros/rosdistro/master/rosdep/sources.list.d/20-default.list. Website may be down.

My proxies are correct. Any idea what is wrong?

What do you mean by "My proxies are correct" ?

A:

sudo by default does not preserve environment. You need to use the -E option to preserve the environment which is where I presume you're setting up your proxies. Use:
sudo -E rosdep init
