Q:

Complete ROS uninstallation?

Hi guys,
Even though i have tried to uninstall ROS using sudo apt-get remove ros-groovy-*, still there are some remaining packages like: ros-groovy-bfl, ros-groovy-opencv2 ... etc.
Did anybody know how to completely remove them because i want to try a fresh installation of ROS and i dont want to have something from the previous installation.
Thank you in advance!

I don't know in which situation it actually matters but most times I use purge instead of remove, so the package's configuration is cleaned.

A:

Use
sudo apt-get purge ros-*

It will also remove configuration files. And then
sudo apt-get autoremove

To remove dependencies

I would add:
sudo apt-get purge python-ros*
before running the autoremove command
