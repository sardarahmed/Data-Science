Q:

Do I need a transform for my map?

I'm trying to view my map in rviz and it says "No transform from [map] to [/base_link]".
It also seems to be displaying my map in the YZ plane.
I haven't seen it mentioned elsewhere, though. Am I supposed to provide a transformation for the map?

A:

You will need a transform from the /map frame to /base_link. However, there only needs to be a path between /map and /base_link, not a direct transform. Usually, the transform setup looks something like /map->/odom->/base_link.
These transforms are usually provided by a localization node such as amcl or a SLAM node such as gmapping.

I'm trying to run the navigation stack. As you know, in the navigation stack there is a amcl_node. Well, I publish this node and I can see them in rxgraph, but it is not publishing the tf map -> odom and I receive this error. What I'm doing wrong?? Thanks!
