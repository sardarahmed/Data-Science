Q:

best kinect object detection in indigo

I've seen this question before, but since 2011 the world has advanced. I know for one that roboearth has simply stopped, splitting into two separate projects. Their latest release seems to be in fuerte.
I also know that find_object_2d has a new 3d feature which I aim to test out sometime soon. This DOES exist in indigo. Does anybody else know of any other packages that do 3d object tracking? possibly better than either of these? Does anybody already have experience with find_object_2d's 3D features?
(The reason I mention Indigo specifically is that I plan to use rtabmap in conjunction with whatever object detection I do, and I would like to avoid needing to set up a new ubuntu, groovy, and rtabmap install)

A:

There is a demo on rtabmap integrating find_object_2d (with 3D feature). You can take a look at the bottom of the referred demo launch file. For live object detection using a Kinect, there is an example launch file find_object_3d.launch in the find_object_2d project too.
Cheers

Thanks! Totally skipped over that. Really convenient stuff. Just about to try it out.
