Q:

Differential Drive Robot's Real Time Simulation of Movement in Rviz

Hi All. I have just started learning ROS and I am referring the book "Robot Operating System for Absolute Beginners" by Lentin Joseph. While going through the Chapter 6 of it that explains a Differential Drive Robot's development using ROS, I am running the example project on Melodic ROS. The robot is communicating with PC using Bluetooth and getting the movements based on keypresses. Rviz is also displaying the Robot's projected body. Now comes the real time movement simulation of the robot which I am not able to achieve, so I need to know what exactly the procedure is to get Differential Drive Robot's Real Time Simulation of Movement in Rviz.
Here are the nodes that are running currently:

/robot_bt_driver_node
/robot_state_publisher
/rosout
/rviz
/teleop_keyboard
/twist_to_motors

I know this is a homework kind of question which the forum does not allow, but I was not able to find correct keywords to search for the Real Time Simulation of Movement and hence I am putting a query here.

I think you want to search for "real time visualization of movement" or something similar, since rviz is a visualizer and not a simulator.

Yes, I apologize for using the incorrect word simulation here. Visualization is what I need.

A:

I'm not familiar with the book you're using, but it might be as easy as choosing the right "fixed frame" option in rviz.

@ahendrix: The "fixed frame" solution worked. Thank you. I kindly request to close the ticket now.
