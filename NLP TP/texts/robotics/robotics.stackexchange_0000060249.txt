Q:

what unit of measurement does quaternion ::getangle() returns the angle in?

Hi
I am trying to write a UI to reflect the current orientation of the robot using the tf information published.  While printing the angle value using the getangle() function provided by tf::quaternion i noticed that the value is not in degree. I also noticed from the API that the angle() function returns half angles.
Do anyone knows what unit of measurmen does the getangle() function returns the angle value in?
Thanks
