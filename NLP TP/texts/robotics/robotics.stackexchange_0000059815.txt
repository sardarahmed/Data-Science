Q:

Collect messages

I need to collect messages from a topic, that is, subscribe to a topic, and then do something with some condition about the message is met (a flag on the message) with all the messages recibed previously. Since the callbacks are functions (and well-made functions should't have state), I don't see a straightforward way to do this. So, what can I do?
Thanks

A:

You're gonna have to collect your messages somehow, e.g. in a class that has the callback.
ROS provides a cache that does this by time: http://wiki.ros.org/message_filters#Cache A simple deque might also be sufficient.

In the end I used a class to collect the messages. Thanks
