Q:

install scan_tools packages

Hello
I tried to install scan_tools packages. By the package csm everuthing was fine and compiled it perfectly. But by the second package laser_scan_matcher I got error. I update the workspace and add the package path.Also run the command
sudo apt-get install libgsl0-dev
before istalling the packages . I got this error
 CMake Error: The source directory "/home/freek/svn/POW/ROS/Fuerte/external_packages/scan_tools/laser_scan_matcher" does not exist.
  Specify --help for usage, or press the help button on the CMake GUI.

Any helpÂ¿

Why are you using CMake? Does rosmake not work?

A:

how to find out where cmake is called? I update the package path, so have to correct the source path also?
