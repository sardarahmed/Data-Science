A:

If you want to model a IMU in gazebo is just to insert the next code in the joint where you want to have the IMU and a gazebo topics will be published,
<sensor name='Vilma_IMU' type='imu'>
<pose>0 0.000000 0.5 0.000000 -0.000000 0.000000</pose>
    <imu>
      <topic>__default_topic__</topic>
    </imu>
    <always_on>1</always_on>
    <update_rate>30</update_rate>
    </sensor>

hector_gazebo_plugins does not use the IMU sensor implemented in recent Gazebo versions. You can directly add it as a model plugin without the  tag, similar to the original gazebo_ros_imu plugin in package gazebo_plugins. hector_quadrotor_gazebo contains a urdf description that uses the IMU.
