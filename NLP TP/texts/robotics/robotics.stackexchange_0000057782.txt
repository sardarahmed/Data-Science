Q:

Recommended quadrotor for using hector_slam package

Hi,
Which would be the recommended quadrotor for using hector_slam. I am currently trying the nicely documented tutorial : hector_quadrotor ( link ) . I was wondering on which all quadrotor everyone is using the hector_slam package.
While looking for this answer, I came across these links:
http://answers.ros.org/question/9101/which-quadrotor-has-the-best-ros-support/ 
http://answers.ros.org/question/12412/autonomously-flying-quadrotor/ 
http://wiki.ros.org/MikroKopter/Tutorials/shared_control 
http://wiki.ros.org/Robots#UAVs
http://www.ros.org/news/robots/uavs/
I could not figure out which quadrotor was used for development and testing of Hector SLAM. So with my finding, my best option (might be only) would be Ascending Technologies Pelican. Has anyone tried using Hector SLAM on Pelican ?

According to their paper, hector_slam was developed on a ground vehicle.

A:

There isn´t really a specific platform that I heard about to work best. Ideally, your platform should

have a Hokuyo UTM-30 (or similar)
LIDAR
provide enough computing power (old
Atom Z530 was sufficient, most more
modern options should be sufficient)
provide sensible IMU data (especially
roll/pitch). That´s basically a given
for a quadrotor, as it wouldn´t be
able to fly otherwise ;)

A few examples of (mostly Mikrokopter based) quads running hector_mapping can be found in this playlist on YouTube. Here in Fig. 4 you can see an example of running a bag-file of the CCNY dataset through hector_mapping (originally recorded with a Asctec quad).
