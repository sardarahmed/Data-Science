Q:

problem with rosmake files

I'm using groovy on ubuntu 12.04.
I downloaded rbx_vol_1 package through svn checkout http://ros-by-example.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/rbx_vol_1 ,then I rosmake it:  rosmake rbx_vol_1,  rosmake results as follows,
[ rosmake ] rosmake starting...

A:

Have you read the error message? It tells you that you are missing a package, namely pocketsphinx.
Do rosdep update and then rosdep check rbx1_speech and see what it has to say.
Edit: Hm... not sure why rosdep does not recognize it, but try apt-get install ros-groovy-pocketsphinx and then the rosmake command again.
