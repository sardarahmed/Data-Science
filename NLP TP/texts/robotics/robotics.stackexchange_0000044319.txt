A:

The first link you posted is the page of the openni-contest within which RGB-D SLAM was first introduced. The second link is the wiki page of the RGB-D SLAM package that came out of it.
Also note the disclaimer on http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni/Contests/ROS%203D/RGBD-6D-SLAM :
This page describes the software package that we submitted for the ROS 3D challenge. The current RGBD-SLAM package is located here.
