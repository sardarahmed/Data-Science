Q:

odometry for ardrone

Hello everyone.
I started programming the ardrone using ROS (I'm a newbie to both) and i wanted to implement a basic form of odometry of the kind px = px + (vxcos(...) - vysin(...)), py = ..., using the speed information provided from the navdata. Unfortunately, in this way a lot of error is introduced. Since i've never used ROS, i wanted to know if there is a better way to do this, i mean, if ROS offers a way to keep track of the position of the drone.
Thank you in advance.

Hi Jacky!
you could test one of our odometer wrappers, viso2_ros (wrapper of libviso2) or fovis_ros (wrapper or fovis).
There is also several people working on PTAM for ardrone and various quadcopters.
