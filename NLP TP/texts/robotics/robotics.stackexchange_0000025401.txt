Q:

Pre-SDF gazebo XML documentation?

Is there any documentation of what I assume is the pre-SDF 1.0 Gazebo XML configuration format? The one with XML namespaces like xmlns:controller="http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/gazebo/xmlschema/#controller" and so on.
I have some old models that I need to understand and update that use this format.

A:

I believe that documentation has long since disappeared.
I think gazebo version 1.0 may have been able to convert from the old format to SDF.
Alternatively, you can grab an old version of gazebo from bitbucket and inspect the code.
