Q:

Any attempts to install Gazebo in Cygwin lately?

I know this may be crazy talk, but has anyone tried to install Gazebo in Cygwin lately?
Although I see stale references to installing ROS on Cygwin, I think a couple of people have had some recent success with Groovy.. I also see that people have installed OGRE.
This makes be curious about Gazebo..
What would be the suspected/expected sticking points aka "opportunities for failure"?

A:

I've been helping to get experimental support for OSX as of gazebo 1.9.1; the biggest sticking point that required a major change to the gazebo code base involved supporting Case Insensitive Filesystems, which is now solved and should benefit a Windows port as well.
Dependency resolution is always tricky; we were fortunate to use the homebrew formulae developed by the ROS team for that, although I've heard that OGRE support on Windows is good. Take a peek at the gazebo formula for a brief list of some dependencies, though there are more that are unlisted because they are included with osx.
I haven't used Cygwin in quite a while, but I wish you luck. Please feel free to share your experience here or on the gazebo issue tracker.
