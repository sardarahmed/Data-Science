Q:

ROS and Gazebo: Documentation Soon?

Cross-post from here
Now that ROS and Gazebo are both under the umbrella of OSRF, when will we be getting updates to the ROS.org documentation of gazebo?
The Gazebo website says "Only install Gazebo from here, and only follow tutorials from this website. Documentation on ros.org for Gazebo is old and not actively maintained." but doesn't provide any basic tutorials like how to subscribe to a message Gazebo generates in ROS. (There are Tutorials for making plugins, but not for basic usage)
It doesn't seem like it helps the community at all to have such a fractured approach to documentation.

The latest documentation for ROS integration is here: http://gazebosim.org/wiki/Tutorials#ROS_Integration (thanks to Dave Coleman for writing it!).
