Q:

reload urdf for robot_state_publisher?

I am currently improving the calibration procedure for my robot and create an urdf-file according to some
calibration values. After I have measured a new value (e.g. maximal position for an axis), I update the urdf file and upload it to the parameter server. However, the robot_state_publisher does not reload this parameter regularly so that a change of the robot-description-Parameter is not reflected e.g. in RVIZ.
I currently just kill the robot_state_publisher (and launch it with respawn), but that it's a bit ugly. I don't care if the frames are jumping after the reload, I'd just be happy to have a possibility to specify and update-intervall so that the param is read regularly.

A:

This is not possible another way at the moment.
However, I'd like to see a way to reload this as well (e.g. by calling a service or something).
You could either send a feature request or implement it yourself and send a PR (which might be preferable as currently I don't know who is actually working on this).

Thanks. I'll open a feature request and if others also need it, I\m going to implement it. Issue can be found here
