Q:

How to remap topic in a ROS2 launch file?

Hi everyone,
I am setting up a navigation2 launch file.
I have used this one as a reference, and everything seems to work.
However, I need to remap the /cmd_vel topic. I am not sure what is the syntax to do so in a top-level launch file to have it propagated to a nested launch file.
Thanks for the help

A:

Found an example on the ros2 tutorials (Foxy)
https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/How-To-Guides/Launch-file-different-formats.html

perform remap so both turtles listen to the same command topic

forward_turtlesim_commands_to_second_turtlesim_node = Node(
        package='turtlesim',
        executable='mimic',
        name='mimic',
        remappings=[
            ('/input/pose', '/turtlesim1/turtle1/pose'),
            ('/output/cmd_vel', '/turtlesim2/turtle1/cmd_vel'),
        ]
    )

Invaluable for remapping RVIZ' /initial_pose, /goal_pose, and /clicked_point topics (connected to 2D Pose Estimate, 2d Goal Pose, and Publish Point buttons in RVIZ) that are otherwise permanently outside any namespace applied to an RVIZ node. Thank you!
