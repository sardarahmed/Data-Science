Q:

Unable to setup sources.list ARM

Hey was just wondering if anyone had noticed that the link on install indigo on ARM has a bad URL when trying to add the ros repo to the sources.list .
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.namniart.com/repos/ros trusty main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'

Thats the line i copied, and i was getting this error when trying to wget the key:
ubuntu@tegra-ubuntu:~$ wget http://packages.namniart.com/repos/namniart.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
--2014-12-12 22:26:29--  http://packages.namniart.com/repos/namniart.key
Resolving packages.namniart.com (packages.namniart.com)... failed: Name or service not known.
wget: unable to resolve host address ‘packages.namniart.com’
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
ubuntu@tegra-ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get update
Err http://packages.namniart.com trusty InRelease

Err http://packages.namniart.com trusty Release.gpg
Could not resolve 'packages.namniart.com'
Ign http://ports.ubuntu.com trusty InRelease       
Ign http://ports.ubuntu.com trusty-updates InRelease

I tried on my desktop to see if maybe it was something on my jetson, but i couldnt even just get to packages.namniart.com through my browser.
Anybody know if this is just maintenance?

Sorry; I'm doing some maintenance on my packages server. It should be back online in a few days.
