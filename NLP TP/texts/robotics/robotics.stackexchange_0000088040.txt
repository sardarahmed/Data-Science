Q:

When should roscors's ros_master_uri not just be localhost?

On the computer running roscore, I understand that this is almost always sufficient.
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
Under what special circumstances does that computer need a specific IP address of ROS_MASTER? And does it ever need ROS_IP or ROS_HOSTNAME? My reasoning is that MASTER_URI points to roscore, which is itself, so localhost should always be good enough. I can't think of other scenarios, but they probably do exist!

Are you asking if there are conditions when you should use an IP address in ROS_MASTER_URI instead of a hostname? (E.g., export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.0.0:11311 instead of export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://myrobot:11311.)

Note specifically I am talking about the computer running Roscore. My reasoning is that MASTER_URI points to roscore, which is itself, so localhost should always be good enough. I can't think of other scenarios, but they probably do exist!

A:

Using localhost is not always good enough for your ROS_MASTER_URI. It may be for many situations (especially when only using one computer), but not always. ROS_MASTER_URI needs to be accessible to every computer that you're going to be using and that's just not possible if you set ROS_MASTER_URI to localhost because every machine will be looking for roscore at its own localhost instead of the one that you intend.
Therefore, if you're going to be doing anything over a network, the address needs to be accessible over that network.

I believe @pitosalas is wondering whether there are any situations in which you would configure ROS_MASTER_URI with a different value than localhost for the master itself (ie: the machine running roscore).
