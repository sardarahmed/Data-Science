Q:

Some packages could not be installed

Hello
Windows user here which is taking a daring step into the world of Linux. I am trying to install diamondback under Ubuntu 10.10 OS which is not going my way. I keep getting messages about dependency problem but no information is given about what it needs. So fare I haven't found any logs which might help solving the problem.

A:

Thanks for the info. I found a old version of ros for Ubuntu 10.04. I do not know if this made a conflict. I removed everything related to ros in synaptic packet manager and all update entry's related to ros under Software Sources. After this everything went fine when I followed the install guide again.
