Q:

Determine tool frame (aka measuring tool center point)

I've been (unsuccessfully) looking for a package that could work out the tool center point point of a tool attached to the flange of an industrial robot. Some controllers (e.g. ABB's IRC5) contain an implementation of a 4-point method to determine the TCP and it would be very useful if a similar process would be available in ROS directly.
Does anything already exists in this direction? And if not, does the 4-point method cited above have a more official name or theoretical background I could look up?

A:

See whether Jmeyer1292/tool_point_calibration works for you.
A more generic suite of calibration tools can be found in Jmeyer1292/robot_cal_tools.
