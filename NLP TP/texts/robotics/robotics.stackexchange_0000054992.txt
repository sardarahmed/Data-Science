Q:

cmd_vel(geometry_msgs::Twist) to ackermann_msgs

Hi all.
I'd like to translate /cmd_vel(geometry_msgs::Twist) to ackermann_msgs::ackermannDrive.
Linear speed is same in two msgs.(linear.x = speed)
How can I covert angular velocity to steering angle?(angular.z --> steering_angle)
Are there nodes for it? I couldn't find to translate from angular velocity to steering angle.
Could you please let me know equation and necessary parameters?
Thanks.

Hello Park, I try doing a similar thing. Would be glad if you could help me out. Cheers Marco

A:

Not sure if you still need to know, but ...

Theta_dot would be angular.z and phi is steering angle
