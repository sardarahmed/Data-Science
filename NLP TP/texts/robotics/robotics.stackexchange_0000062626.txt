Q:

Catkin insists on using em.py 3.4 and nosetests 3.4, when configured to use python 2.7

When I call catkin_make like this
catkin_make -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python2 -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/python2.7 -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/libpython2.7.so

I see this in the output
-- Using PYTHON_EXECUTABLE: /usr/bin/python2
-- Using Python nosetests: /usr/bin/nosetests-3.4
-- Using empy: /usr/lib/python3.4/site-packages/em.py

Naturally my build process fails because the python 2 executable cannot interpret these versions. How do I force catkin to use the python 2.7 versions?

A:

Creating a symboilc link from the 2.7 to 3.4 package helped me. I know this is not a perfect solution,but it works for now.
ln -s /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/em.py /usr/lib/python3.4/site-packages/em.py
Hoping someone with a better knowledge could provide a more concrete solution

This is an option, but it also means you cannot use the 3.4 version for anything else anymore, right?

Yes, it does
