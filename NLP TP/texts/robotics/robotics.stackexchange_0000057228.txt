Q:

Recommended ROS Version for Kuka Youbot

Hello,
which Version of ROS would you recommend for the KUKA Youbot.
The manufacturer ships it with ROS Fuerte, which seems to be quite old. I have seen that there are packages for ROS Groovy and also for ROS Hydro. Is it save and recommended to update?
I am currently testing ROS Hydro on a youbot running Ubuntu 12.04 and will report my findings.

could you elaborate this a bit more? Are there many people already using ROS Hydro? Have you made the best experiences using ROS Hydro?

There was a release and all the repos are moving to hydro-devel.
You can also find the driver wrapper in hydro :

There are Hydro packages. Wiki pages of the most of packages weren't created (now I have done), which can be why it was a bit hard to find ROS packages.
