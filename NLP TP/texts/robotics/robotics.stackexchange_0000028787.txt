Q:

Custom models disappearing

Hello,
I'm using Parrot's Sphinx (https://developer.parrot.com/docs/sphinx/whatissphinx.html) which is based on Gazebo 7.
Somehow, when I add my own models, sometimes they disappear and collect themselves at (0,0).
There is no error / warning messages on the terminal.
Here's a video showing the issue:

This doesn't happen with the default models (tested with beer, cinder block, and cardboard box models).
What's happening???
Here's the sdf of one of my models;
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<sdf version="1.5">
  <model name='tc6_big_target'>
    <link name='tc6_big_target'>

What am I doing wrong here?

Probably there is something wrong in your sdf file.

A:

Whenever this happend to me, the problem was the physics configuration of the model. If you set extreme values (too big or too small) the physics engine will run into some computational problems.
How did you arrive to the inertia matrix for the model? Look at every place where you set some physics parameter (mass, inertia, friction, force limits etc.) and check, whether it might cause problems to the physics engine.

The issue seems to disappear after removing the < pose > element under < inertial >. Probably exactly as what you @kumpakri mentioned.
Anyway, I got the inertia matrix as a result of converting the Solidworks model into sdf, as shown in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkEyL1UWDNI
