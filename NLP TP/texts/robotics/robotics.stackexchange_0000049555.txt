Q:

error in build a package

Hi, i has a package in my home named navibot , it's CMake is :
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.4.6)
include($ENV{ROS_ROOT}/core/rosbuild/rosbuild.cmake)

# Set the build type.  Options are:
#  Coverage       : w/ debug symbols, w/o optimization, w/ code-coverage
#  Debug          : w/ debug symbols, w/o optimization
#  Release        : w/o debug symbols, w/ optimization
#  RelWithDebInfo : w/ debug symbols, w/ optimization
#  MinSizeRel     : w/o debug symbols, w/ optimization, stripped binaries
#set(ROS_BUILD_TYPE RelWithDebInfo)

rosbuild_init()

#set the default path for built executables to the "bin" directory
set(EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/bin)
#set the default path for built libraries to the "lib" directory
set(LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/lib)

#uncomment if you have defined messages
#rosbuild_genmsg()
#uncomment if you have defined services
#rosbuild_gensrv()

#common commands for building c++ executables and libraries
#rosbuild_add_library(${PROJECT_NAME} src/example.cpp)

rosbuild_add_boost_directories()

rosbuild_add_executable(navibot src/navibot_v1.1New.cpp)
  
#target_link_libraries(example ${PROJECT_NAME})

when building it i get 1 failure :

**I tried to add in cmake file

rosbuild_add_boost_directories()

and

rosbuild_link_boost(navibot thread)

but the same fail happened again
where is the wrong ??**

A:

It doesn't look like your error is related to boost, but rather to a failure to find the TurtlebotSensorState message.  See this part of your build log:
/home/salma/navibot/src/navibot_v1.1New.cpp:13:119: fatal error: /opt/ros/electric/stacks/turtlebot/turtlebot_node/msg_gen/cpp/include/turtlebot_node/TurtlebotSensorState.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.

Check to make sure that you have the turtlebot stack installed, and that it's listed in the dependency list for your package.

How I can install turtlebot stack? I echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, result is:
/home/mai/catkin_ws/src:/opt/ros/indigo/share:/opt/ros/indigo/stacks
