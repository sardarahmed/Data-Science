Q:

What are the JointStateHandle units?

Hi,
I'm using ros_control c++ interface and JointStateHandle to update the motor feedback values. My question is about the units used in the parameters of the following line:
hardware_interface::JointStateHandle state_handle_1(right_joint, &pos_[0], &vel_[0], &eff_[0]);

I suppose that vel_ has the unit [rad/s]. But what unit does pos_ have? Is it [m] or [rad]?

A:

This message type can describe both linear and rotary joints, so the units used will depend on the type of joint.
If it's a rotary joint the units are radians, radians per second, and Netwton metres.
If it's a linear joint the units are metres, metres per second, and Netwtons.
Hope this helps.

Yes it helps. I tested it with my rotatory joint and it is rad/s, rad and Nm.
