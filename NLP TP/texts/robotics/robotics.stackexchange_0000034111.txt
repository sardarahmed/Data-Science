Q:

Will the RosSerial client reconnect?

Will the rosserial client, in particular, rosserial_arduino, reconnect and republish topics if it loses its connection to the master?
For my use case, it would be nice if my Arduino would reconnect automatically when I restart ROS on my computer.

A:

The rosserial_python node will automatically resync topics with the Arduino whenever it A) starts up, or B) decides the connection has failed. This is currently done by using the ros::Time synchronization call as a keep alive, if no calls show up in a given time, the connection is restarted (this can take up to 5-10s currently).
