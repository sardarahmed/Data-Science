Q:

How to draw robot manipulator diagram

I've been seeing a lot of these diagrams online and wondering how can I replicate this myself. Is there any easy-to-use software package that will allow me to draw these diagrams quickly and accurately? Ideally, I would be able to draw joints, links and label, angles and lengths of the robot manipulator.

A:

There is no specialized tool to draw it, but you can draw these with generic software.
You can get very similar diagrams from PowerPoint or Inkscape. Furthermore if you use Latex, here you can find an example using Tikz.
