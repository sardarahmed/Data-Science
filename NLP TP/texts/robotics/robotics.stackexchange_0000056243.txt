Q:

Use ardrone_autonomy library in qtcreator

Hi there,
i have a problem with subscribing to ardrone/navdata, because the library ardrone_autonomy/Navdata.h can not be found. I tried to include it with this line:
#include "ardrone_autonomy/Navdata.h"

and I also tried to include it in my project- file as a file, but it did not work.
How do i include this correctly to my project?

A:

add ardrone_autonomy to your manifest dependency , that should allow you to use the header file
