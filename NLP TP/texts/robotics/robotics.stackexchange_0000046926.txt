Q:

Can I run a bash script using roslaunch?

I read http://answers.ros.org/question/12327/is-there-a-way-to-wait-for-certain-topics-to-be-published-in-a-launchfile/ and http://answers.ros.org/question/33772/run-shell-command-from-launch-script/ questions and I am confused. I see people mention the possibility of running bash scripts via .launch files but I can't find any documentation describing how to do it. Is it even possible?
(I'm trying to delay the launch of a gpsd_client node because during startup it scans and usurps other serial ports.)

A:

Yes, This is possible. Place your shell script inside a ROS package. Use chmod to make the script executable. You can then run it from a roslaunch file similar to any node (any executable for that matter):
<node name="foo" pkg="YOUR_ROS_PACKAGE" type="YOUR_SCRIPT_NAME" />

Can anyone add to this how this works in the context of catkin?  Where should the script go within the node directory, do there need to be CMake commands to install it to a predictable place?

lucasw, have you figured out the answer to your question? if so, could you please post it?

I think best practice is to put it in scripts/ alongside python files, and install it the same as a python file would be installed.

I now it's an old thread. lucasw, if you can read this, can you explain me in details what have you done? Thank you!

I think you just need install(PROGRAMS scripts/foo.sh  DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_BIN_DESTINATION})

Thank you for your reply! I tried something similar but it doesn't work. Did you tried and reached your goal? My script it's not a .sh, it has no extension. Thank you again!
EDIT: I tried copying the content of the script in a new script with .sh extension, i'm getting:
[test.sh-3] process has died [pid 3316, exit code 1

You'll probably need to ask a new question and put your test.sh script and the launch file launching it into it (and link to it from here), though it looks like your script did in fact run when launched, though maybe it didn't do what you want it to?

It didn't run at all, it has to do some elaborations to a .txt file and then print results on the terminal. Maybe i have found a workaround, i used the command:
system("terminal command for launching the script");

It is a c++ command that gives to the terminal the command that you  want.
