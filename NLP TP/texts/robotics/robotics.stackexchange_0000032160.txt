Could you also tell what kind of data you are searching after? Perhaps some users have this laying around.

A:

There are conversions between ROS data types and some mrpt data types in the mrpt-ros-pkg repo
The documentation is quite spares, but I do remember seeing conversion methods which you could use in a custom program.
