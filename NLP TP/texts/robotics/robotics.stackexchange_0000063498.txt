Q:

roscore warning

hi everyone
when I want to run roscore i see a message like this in terminal:

WARNING: disk usage in log directory
[/home/mohammad/.ros/log] is over 1GB.
It's recommended that you use the
'rosclean' command.

Of course i have no problem with running master and it works fine. Should i do something necessary for not seeing again this message?
thanks:))
