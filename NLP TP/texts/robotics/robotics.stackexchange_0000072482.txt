Q:

Do I have to add my workspace to the ros environment every time I start the terminal?

I have started working on the tutorial and in the third tutorial (Creating ros package) I was instructed to add my workspace the ros environment. Suppose I have created the package and added my workspace to the ros environment  then I closed the terminal and the system, so the next time I open the terminal and my workspace using ($ cd ~/my_workspace), do I have to add my workspace to the ros environment again.

A:

If you are working under Ubuntu, to avoid having to add your workspace manually to the ros environment you should add the following line to the file ~/.bashrc
source ~/my_workspace/devel/setup.bash

This will automatically load your workspace every time you open a new terminal.
Hope this helps

I had the same problem like ATOM, so I also added you given line to my system-wide bash.bashrc-file.
But it says, that I don't have permission to save it. What can I do? Thanks in advance!

To modify the system-wide bashrc file you need root privileges. Try using sudo.
