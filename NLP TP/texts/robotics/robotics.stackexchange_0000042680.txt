Q:

robot_self_filter + rgb pointcloud

Hi,
if I use robot_self_filter to filter points from kinect colored pointcloud the resulting output is without color. Is it error or feature? Is there way how to filter colored pointcloud without loosing color? I'm using ROS Electric.
Thanks.

A:

I would consider that a bug. Best if you file a ticket for that.
Btw. you could also try the realtime_urdf_filter package that should be much faster since it is based on OpenGL rendering.
