Q:

Poor performance of cartesian controller in the x direction on pr2

Hi everyone.
I am using this controller for pr2 arm control, with the example configuration. The arm moves quite well in y and z direction, but does really poorly in x direction (approaching/leaving the robot body), which means that it can only reach some specific points, but cannot move continuously in this direction. I tried to adjust some parameters, and it turns out that the arm can move continuously, but when I want it to move along x axis, its y and z positions also change severely.
The thing is that I do not really care about the orientation of the end effector, and it seems that the capability of moving continuously in x direction depends on the commanded orientation. I wonder if there is some parameter I can adjust to address the position error and ignore the orientation error. I would also appreciate it if someone suggests a better cartesian controller. Thanks.

OK I have figured it out. The thing is that I have set the goal position in a wrong scale... so that it tries to reach positions that are far away from its body. That's why y and z directions work well but x does not. Hope it helps if anyone encounters the same problem.
