Q:

Get state of all links in a model in gazebo?

I know that I can get a list of all link states in gazebo by calling
rostopic echo -n 1 /gazebo/link_states

But what about getting link states for only a specific model I'm interested in?
Also, what is the syntax for specifying a link name? I used
 rosservice call gazebo/get_link_properties '{link_name: link1}'

but got an error instead. Is there a way for me to specify the robot name as well?

A:

The correct sintax to get the state of the link you are interested on is:
rosservice call /gazebo/get_link_state 'link_name: MODEL_NAME::LINK_NAME'

Link names are prefixed by model name, e.g. pr2::base_link.
The same for the second command, the correct sintax is:
rosservice call /gazebo/get_link_properties 'link_name: MODEL_NAME::LINK_NAME'

I forgot one important thing: the link has to be the root link of the robot.
