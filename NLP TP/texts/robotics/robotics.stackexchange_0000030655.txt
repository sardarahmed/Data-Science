Q:

Trouble setting up Ubuntu repositories for ROS

Ok so I'm realativly new to the whole command line/terminal thing. So I was working through the instructions here: http://www.ros.org/wiki/Robots/NXT/diamondback
I got to the step about the repositories and I'm not sure how to change them. I know it says to go to the Ubuntu page for help on doing this, but that link does not really provide me much help.
So if any one else has installed ROS for the NXT on Ubuntu would you be willing to share your information with me and help a newbie out?

A:

There's a lot of information on that page.  A simiple way to do this from their page is to use Synaptic.

From the main menu open: System > Administration > Synaptic Package Manager
Inside Synaptic: Open Settings >> Repositories
Make sure that "restricted," "universe," and "multiverse" all have checkmarks next to them.
