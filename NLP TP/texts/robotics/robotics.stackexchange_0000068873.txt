A:

I know that I had to do a bit of fiddling with some USB settings when I first set mine up. It was a while  ago so I don't remember everything, but I know that I have to run this command before I launch the freenect_stack:

sudo bash -c 'echo -1 > /sys/module/usbcore/parameters/autosuspend'

In addition to that, if you still see no devices connected, try unplugging the kinect from your laptop and plugging it back in and waiting about 5 seconds. Does the kinect for windows have a power adapter? If it does make sure that you have that plugged into the wall too or it won't work. The USB on your computer is not enough to power all the hardware in the kinect.
