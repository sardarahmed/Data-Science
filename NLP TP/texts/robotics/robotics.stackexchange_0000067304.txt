Q:

Installing ROS on AWS EC2 Instance with Ubuntu Desktop GUI

Does anyone have an installation procedure for ROS onto an AWS EC2 instance that utilizes the standard Ubuntu Desktop GUI? I have found several  discussions online about using a VNC solution, but in talking to AWS, they are saying that any of these solutions of using a GUI will slow the system down significantly. I don't understand why the GUI is different and slower than a Window s Server GUI accessed through RDP.

A:

You can install GUI on EC2 linux instances and use VNC to connect to it from a variety of devices.
see this link for setting it up on Ubuntu.
