Q:

utm_odometry_node frame convention

Hello,
I'm using the utm_odometry_node to input the position of my robot to another node.
If I'm right the convention used in the /odom topic is:

X axis points backwards

Y axis points right

Z axis points up

But I need this to be in standard convention, this is: X forward, Y left, Z up.
Any suggestion on how this can be done is appreciated.
Thanks,

A:

Usually GPS receivers do not provide orientation, thus there is no information about where is front of your robot. The coordinate frames you described are both correct right handed frames. The first one is just rotated around Z-coordinate by pi.
If GPS coordinates are augmented with orientation from some other source, then you may need to check the transformation between child_frame_id (usually base_footprint) of utm_odometry_node and base frame of your robot (usually base_link).
Also, note that all coordinate frames in ROS are relative and depend on coordinate frame that you consider as fixed frame.
