Q:

measurement model of the accelerometers in IMU

I am new to IMU. About the measurements from IMU, different materials give different explanations.
From the link:
https://www.it.uu.se/edu/course/homepage/systemid/vt14/tokp2.pdf

Here the b maybe indicate body frame of IMU. Maybe e indicate earth frame. 
I can't understand the rotation matrix R(be) in the second equation means. 
Is R(be) from camera-IMU calibration to represent the extrinsic paramter between 
camera and IMU. Is the measurement from the accelerometer expressed in the IMU frame or not?

A:

There's no camera. An IMU doesn't have a camera. $R^{b\mbox{e}}$ is the rotation matrix that describes the orientation of the sensor body $b$ with respect to the Earth $\mbox{e}$. The equations are simply stating that the sensors are outputting the body forces $f^b$ and body angular velocities $\omega^b$, plus some sensor bias $\delta$ and some sensor noise $e$.
The accelerations on the sensor body, in the body frame, are equivalent to taking the body acceleration in the Earth's frame, $\ddot{b}^\mbox{e}$, and the gravitational acceleration in the Earth's frame, $g^\mbox{e}$, and transforming them from Earth frame to body frame with $R^{b\mbox{e}}$.
