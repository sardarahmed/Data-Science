Q:

How to install package from source in groovy?

Hi all,
I'm just starting out with ROS, and I'm trying to install some ROS packages, but there is no .deb file available, so I cant use apt-get. For example, package tf2_web_republisher. How do I go about installing from source? I've read posts such as:
http://answers.ros.org/question/61693/individual-package-install/
http://answers.ros.org/question/36784/how-to-install-a-stack-and-package-manually-in-fuerte/
but they use the command rosws. I believe this uses rosbuild. Since I'm using groovy, I'd like to build it using catkin. Can someone kindly guide me how to install packages from source on groovy using catkin?
Thanks!

A:

Are you sure this package has been catkinized ? If it has not, you'd better just use rosbuild.
If it has been catkinized, you can just download it in your catkin workspace and do a catkin_make. This should work.
If you want it to be in a specific directory, you can create a new workspace where you place this package, and use catkin_make -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.

Thanks for your quick answer Lucile! After performing catkin_make, do I have to do catkin_make install?

If you use the -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, I think you will need to, but I am not sure. In the source installation tutorial I used (http://www.ros.org/wiki/turtlebot/Tutorials/groovy/Installation) they used make install in build folder.

I went ahead and did catkin_make install anyway. Thanks!
