Q:

Create Data Conversion Package C++!

I have a problem with this tutorial about creating a header file. I do not understand what I should do and how should I do that. Can anyone give a clue? Or some links where I can learn about these header?
In this tutorial we need to have some knowledge, but where are the tutorials that have taught us about those header file. Nowhere was the header file mentioned (or I missed it).
Thanks for any help.

a Header file is a General C++ construct and not (directly) related to ROS.
What is your exact question here?

The question....
I think there is no one question. Is the expression of a misunderstanding the tutorial. I am a newnewbe so I expected to follow some clear instruction (as it was untill that tutorial). But I got lost whit this 'header file'. I don't know where should I put it,...

... if it has some standard type, if it belong to 'learning_tf2' package, etc.

A:

The tutorial you're attempting is an intermediate level, I would not advise you to start here if you're not familiar with fairly complex C++ projects already.
There is a good tutorial here that explains why and how c header files are used in projects. If you can have a play around with the examples shown here in a separate (non-ROS) project to get used to working with .c and .h files then this ROS tutorial should make more sense.
