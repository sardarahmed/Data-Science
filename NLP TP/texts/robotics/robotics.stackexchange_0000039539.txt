Q:

Bug in ROS_INFO_STREAM?

I have a stringstream that I'm using to store some debug information.  Every so often, I try to print it out.  I have found that
string s = ss.str();
ROS_INFO_STREAM(s);

works just as expected, the contents of ss are displayed in a message.  But an operation that I feel should be identical,
ROS_INFO_STREAM( (ss.str()) );

results in nothing at all being displayed,
except of course the usual ROS_INFO header "[ INFO]..."
Any ideas on why this could be?

A:

Probably a bug in the implementation of the macro ROS_INFO_STREAM. Bug reports should go to the corresponding bug tracker, for rosconsole use the trac here.
