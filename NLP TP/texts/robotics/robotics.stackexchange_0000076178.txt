Q:

Any idea on performing localization & mapping using a Velodyne VLP-16 LIDAR?

I am new to ROS. I want to do the SLAM for a humanoid robot with Stanley Innovations's RMP-220 V3 Base Platform and Velodyne VLP-16 LIDAR. Do I have to use an IMU? to perform this?
I am using ROS Kinetic. I have found out that Velodyne drivers support have released only till ROS Indigo. Using Kinetic will be a problem?

A:

It works on Jade and Kinetic, if built from source. Binary packages are still pending.
