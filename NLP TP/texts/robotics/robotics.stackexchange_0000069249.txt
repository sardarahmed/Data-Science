Q:

Which packages publishes imu?

Hi all! I'm at my last stage of my project now.
I'm using hector_pose_estimation that subscribes to /imu topic. Which package that publishes /imu should I get?
Thanks!

A:

Well, this obviously depends on the IMU that you have.
The respective IMU driver will publish the /imu topic then.
Check out the imu_drivers WIKI page or any of the IMU specific driver packages (e.g. the razor IMU).
