Q:

What is the best way to determine the time it takes a service to return?

Hi,
I am using ROS Melodic on Ubuntu 18.04
Is there some ROS function that returns the execution duration of a ROS service?
Or is the easiest way to get the execution duration to ros::Time::now() before and after the service is called and then finding the difference?
Thanks

Not that I know of (as in: this specifically).

That could certainly work.
Another approach would be to use a profiler, perhaps something like swri-robotics/swri_profiler (but there are of course more).

Thanks for the reply. I will have a look at profilers
