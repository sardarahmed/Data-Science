Q:

ethzasl_ptam + Kinetic input image problem

Hi everyone,
Here below is a capture from usb_cam/image_raw and the same picture but from ethzasl_ptam calibrator

I'm using ROS kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04 and modified ethzasl_ptam to compile it with opencv3.
Any guess ?

A:

Ok so I was giving the wrong image format. Giving a mono image through image_proc solved the issue _
