Q:

#include "drive_base/Drive.h" problem to find

Hi there, now I have a problem to find the "drive_base/Drive.h".
I don't know how to use the "drive.h" and where to put it.
I used a node in the ros, the drive.cpp to move my .model, but
still the same :(

"drive_base/Drive.h: No such file or directory"

A:

It's spelled driver_base/Driver.h. You need a dependency on the driver_base package, in the driver_common stack.
