Q:

getting linkage error : X11

Getting linkage error: XInitTreads unresolved in libsl_zed.so
In the past I was able to simple put the X11 linkage in my CMakeList and that worked but now this seems to  have stopped working. Any ideas what can be causing this issue. I should also mention that this is being compiled on the Jetson tk1 (arm7).

It looks like you're trying to compile this package: https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-ros-wrapper and you've opened a ticket there with more info: https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-ros-wrapper/issues/23

It looks like your version of libsl_zed.so might have missing dependencies or might have become broken during a recent update. Is libsl_zed.so something that you installed and built from source? Have you upgraded your system recently?
Comment by rnunziata on 2016-03-05:
I did a general update of the system before taking a new version of zed-ros-wrapper. Prior to that it compiled  . Not sure if libsl_zed.so was updated at that time. I did open an issue on this on github and also send an email to zedlabs tech support. Have not heard back yet on either.

If libsl_zed.so had a missing dependency should not including the link library as I have done resolve the reference? I was wondering if there was a circular reference somewhere.

A:

Problem determined to be zedlab s issue with the Jetson TK1.
