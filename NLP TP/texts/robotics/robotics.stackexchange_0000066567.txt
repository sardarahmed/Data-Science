Q:

About turtlebot_2dnav

Hello,
I'm trying to implement the backend for one web application that use the NAV2DJS from Robot web tools, I made a launch file in order to have all the nodes required, but it gives me this error:

[ WARN] [1427214700.876816371]:
Waiting on transform from
base_footprint to map to become
available before running costmap, tf
error:

In order to try only this part turtlebot_2dnav (having on mind the nodes already used by the webpage), this is the order of launching nodes
$ roscore
$ roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch
$ roslaunch openni_camera openni.launch
$ roslaunch control turtlebot_2dnav.launch

Where turtlebot_2dnav.launch file is:
<launch>
  <arg name="image" default="/camera/depth/image_raw"/>
  <node name="depthimage_to_laserscan" pkg="depthimage_to_laserscan" type="depthimage_to_laserscan" args="$(arg image)"/>

  <!-- Map server -->
  <arg name="initial_pose_x" default="0.0"/>
  <arg name="initial_pose_y" default="0.0"/>
  <arg name="initial_pose_a" default="0.0"/>
  <arg name="map_file" default="/home/robot/Desktop/gamma/map_sample/office.yaml"/>
  <node name="map_server" pkg="map_server" type="map_server" args="$(arg map_file)"/>
  <include file="$(find turtlebot_navigation)/launch/includes/amcl.launch.xml">
    <arg name="initial_pose_x" value="$(arg initial_pose_x)"/>
    <arg name="initial_pose_y" value="$(arg initial_pose_y)"/>
    <arg name="initial_pose_a" value="$(arg initial_pose_a)"/>
  </include>

  <include file="$(find turtlebot_navigation)/launch/includes/move_base.launch.xml"/>

</launch>

The actual graph of this part is:

you can take a look here: Frames I cannot post images because I don't have enough karma

I make a little package that satisfy this requirement, for further info: turtlebot_2dnav.
