A:

As you know,  the answer for your question is described on this page ( http://wiki.ros.org/fuerte/Installation/Overlays ).

rosws init ~/fuerte_workspace /opt/ros/fuerte

This command creates the files setup.bash, setup.sh, setup.zsh and the hidden file .rosinstall in the directory ~/fuerte_workspace.
I also answered your question on this page( http://answers.ros.org/question/155786/install-face_recognition-pakage/ ). Didn't you look at it?
