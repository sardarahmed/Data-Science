Q:

Pan-Tilt Unit-D46-17 ROS Driver

In my ROS application I need to use the FLIR Pan_tilt Unit-D46-17 since it is the only one available  and I did not find any driver. I know this hardware is quite old. However, has someone implemented it already?

It doesn't seem to publish /tf messages which is a bit sad. Is there anybody who has patch the driver?

Since it is putting out joint_states, the usual way would be to have a URDF and use the robot_state_publisher to get TF
