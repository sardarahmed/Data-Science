Q:

how to change the plugin's param in launch

Hello!
I find that image_transport provides only one param (image_transport)for us to choose different compressed plugins. And if I set image_transport to compressed, I could change the param jpeg_quality with the help of rqt_reconfigure, but now, I want to change this param in launch file instead of rqt_reconfigure, how could I do?
Thanks first!

A:

Reconfigure parameters can be used like all other parameters in a launch file.
EDIT:
Let's say you have a node called foo in the package foo_pkg and want to change the jpeg_quality of the compressed image to 50 then the launch file should look like this:
<launch>
<node pkg="foo_pkg" type="foo" name="foo" >
    <param name="image/compressed/jpeg_quality" type="int" value="50"/>
</node>
</launch>

Thanks for your answer. If the parameters were defined in the inheritance class, I could reconfigure them in lanch.But the problem is that they are defined in the base class. How could I reconfigure  them in the launch file?
The instance of this problem is the jpeg quality in the image_transport.

Edited my answer with the solution to the problem. You can just specify the relative params like in the answer. That will lead to the param /foo/image/compressed/jepg_quality to be set.
