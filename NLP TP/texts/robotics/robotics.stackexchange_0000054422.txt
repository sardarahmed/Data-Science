Q:

Rviz hydro cannot launch node robot_state_publisher

Hello,
I tried to complete this tutorial: gazebosim.org/wiki/Tutorials/1.9/Using_A_URDF_In_Gazebo
When I'm launching:

roslaunch rrbot_description
rrbot_rviz.launch

I got this error:
  ERROR: cannot launch node of type [robot_state_publisher/state_publisher]: robot_state_publisher
    ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/hydro/share/ros
    ROS path [1]=/home/wojciech/catkin_ws/src
    ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/hydro/share
    ROS path [3]=/opt/ros/hydro/stacks

Rviz launches but there is some worns and errors:

FIXED FRAME: No tf data.  Actual error: Fixed Frame [link1] does not exist

No transform from [camera_link] to [link1]

No transform from [link2] to [link1]

...

My configuration:

ROS Hydro

Ubuntu 13

I will be grateful for your help,
Wojciech

A:

You need to install robot_state_publisher:
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-robot-state-publisher

I had this same problem.  Why is ros-hydro-robot-state-publisher not installed with ros-hydro-desktop-full?
Comment by Dirk Thomas on 2013-09-27:
Until now robot_state_publisher was not part of any hydro metapackage. That has been changed recently (https://github.com/ros/metapackages/commit/4df7e45085a5c7e840323f5f871f860961b525a5) and will included in the next sync.
