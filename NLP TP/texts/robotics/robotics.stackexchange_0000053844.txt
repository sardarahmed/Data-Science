Q:

KDL, undefined reference to KDL::Chain

Hello everyone!
I am having problems when trying to compile with rosmake a KDL example (the one found in the KDL website). I always get this output when doing rosmake
undefined reference to `KDL::Chain::~Chain()'
and a lot more of undefined reference... i did everything i could.. followed the ros instructions in order to get kdl up and running but i cannot get it to compile!
Note: i included the find_package(Orocos-kdl) in the CMakeLists but the problem persists...
Any help will be appreciated!
thanks in advance,
Franco

A:

I managed to get it compiled and linked!
For everyone:
in the CMakeLists:
add:
project(prueba_kdl)

find_package(Eigen REQUIRED)
include_directories(${Eigen_INCLUDE_DIRS})
find_package(Orocos-KDL REQUIRED)

rosbuild_add_executable(prueba_kdl src/prueba.cpp)
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} orocos-kdl)

Cheers
Franco
