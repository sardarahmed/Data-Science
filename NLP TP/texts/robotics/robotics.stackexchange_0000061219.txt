Q:

Another problem with installing packages on Mac OS X

Hi,
This time, the problem is with building hector_pose_estimation_core package:
-- Build files have been written to: /Volumes/Data/ZProjects/ROS/catkin_ws/build_isolated/hector_pose_estimation_core
==> make -j2 -l2 in '/Volumes/Data/ZProjects/ROS/catkin_ws/build_isolated/hector_pose_estimation_core'

A:

You'll probably have to go through theses errors one by one. Maybe open an issue at https://github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/hector_localization and ask for help if you are stuck.
To debug, it helps to run (fill in your proper parameter for ...):
VERBOSE=1 ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated ... --pkg hector_pose_estimation_core -j1

Thanks. I did open an issue.
And your suggestion helps... I was waiting for all the previous (227) packages to build before hitting the error;-(
Comment by demmeln on 2014-07-28:
I further suggest to you to separate the core ROS install from additional packages like hector_.... Build a workspace with desktop_full, maybe even install into /opt/ros/hydro if you like, and then build additional packages in a new WS on top of that.
Comment by Rasit on 2014-07-28:
Good idea!... Doing it now, while waiting for suggestions from hector people.
Comment by Rasit on 2014-07-30:
Can I send an email for some specific questions?
Comment by demmeln on 2014-07-30:
It would better to update your question here in this forum with more details and specific questions. That way others can jump into the discussion and benefit from the outcome. Use pastebin.com for longer build output to keep the question concise enough.
