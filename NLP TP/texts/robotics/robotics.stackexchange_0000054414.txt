Q:

How to translate jointstate to tf

What is the procdure to translate joint state given as process_value to a TF message between joined links. Is this documented anywhere. Are there helper functions to take (process_value, process_value_dot) to twist..etc?

A:

The robot_state_publisher should be what you are asking for, if I understand your question correctly. Using a URDF robot model uploaded to the parameter server and joint states it receives via a topic, it publishes tf. This tutorial explains how to use it.

Still I do not think it should be that difficult to create a tf from a joint state if you know the control state and the links involved but maybe I am wrong on that point.

Actually that isn't difficult. It's the standard ROS way. You could do that yourself, i.e. make a node that subscribes joint states and computes the robot's kinematics from that, but in that case you'd replicate the robot_state_publisher functionality.

There use to be helper functions eg. Twist t = s.twist(q,qdot);  But I can not find them.

I don't know about this one, but a good guess would be to look in the tf namespace; there are a couple.
