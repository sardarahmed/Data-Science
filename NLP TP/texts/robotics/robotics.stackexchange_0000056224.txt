Q:

Publisher for ardrone

Hi there,
i have a problem with publishing sth. to the ardrone. I am using ROS Hydro and this is a part of my code for one of the publishers i am using:
(in the header-file)
ros::Publisher land_pub;
(in cpp-file)
ros::NodeHandle nh;
land_pub = nh.advertise<std_msgs::Empty>("ardrone/land", 1);
(with a button-klick of my joypad i want to publish this message:)
std_msgs::Empty emptymsg;
land_pub.publish(emptymsg);
But when i am using "rostopic echo ardrone/land" (or takeoff) nothing is published and my ardrone does nothing... but if i am publishing under this topic via terminal it works... could anybody help me solving this, please?
