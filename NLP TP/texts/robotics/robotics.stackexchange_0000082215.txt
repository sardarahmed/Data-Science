Q:

pr2_arm_navigation_tutorials

http://wiki.ros.org/motion_planning_environment/Tutorials/Making%20collision%20maps%20from%20self-filtered%20tilting%20laser%20data
In these tutorials, the pr2_arm_navigation package is being referenced, but I cannot find it anywhere. Where can I get it from? I am currently using indigo. I am trying to learn how to add objects to the planning environment to test planners with collision avoidance. If there is another tutorial with packages that are available, could you point me to them? Thanks.
