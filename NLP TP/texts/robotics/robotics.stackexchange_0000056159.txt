Q:

How to exchange data between nodes?

I want to send data from one node to another. For example: One node is publishing data to the topic /mobile_base/commands/velocity and other one is subscribed to /mobile_base/events/bumper. Both the subscriber & publisher are working fine.
What I want to do is to make the robot move backward once the bumpers are pressed. I do not know how to send the event of bumper pressed to the other node.
The solution I thought was of using pipes or sockets or shared memory to exchange data between two nodes.
Is this the right approach? Or does ROS has a builtin method for that?
Thanks in Advance.

A:

Hello, you should create an intermediate node wich subscribe to /mobile_base/events/bumper and publish on /mobile_base/commands/velocity. In this node, create your reactive behaviour.
No need of pipes and sockets, the publisher/subscriber mechanism is develloped to allows the communications.
