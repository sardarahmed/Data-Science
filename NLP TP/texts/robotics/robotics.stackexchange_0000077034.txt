Q:

How to run "tf view_frames" for a remapped tf

I remapped /tf to /tf_0, but I can't get rosrun tf view_frames to show me the tree for /tf_0. How to do it?

Can you upload a picture of how the tf tree looks like after mapping and the launch file which you did remapping? Also, is there any data from /tf_0?

A:

You can use normal command-line based remapping:
rosrun tf view_frames /tf:=/tf_0

should do it.

Somehow it seems to be this mysterious thing to people, but tf is 'just a topic' :).
