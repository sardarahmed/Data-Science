Q:

DRCSIM: Time sync and coordination

Cross posted to theroboticschallenge.org forums.
Can we get an ntp/ptp server operating on the simulation computer that the field and OCS computers can sync to?
Can we add wall clock to the API clock message?
Together, these will allow us to keep track of the delay between time stamped messages and the time on receiving computer.
On the actual system it would make more sense to have the robot sync to the OCS (assuming it has GPS/internet time server connection), but may be simpler to have the simulation cloud provide service here.

We are also very interested in this feature. See the following open issue on the drcsim bitbucket:

This doesn't address second part of adding both sim and wall time to the clock message.  It would seem we would need both keep track properly
