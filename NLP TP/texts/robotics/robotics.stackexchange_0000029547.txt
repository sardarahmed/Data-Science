Q:

How do I find people around me who use ROS?

I live in a medium-size city.
Is there a way for me to find other people in my area that use ROS?

A:

We could always crowd-source the problem and have everyone add their location to one map.

Your crowd-sourcing solution sounds pretty good. It shouldn't be hard to do too considering location is one of the fields in profiles on this site.

That's really cool David. I didn't know you could do collaborative stuff with Google Maps :)

I suggested Alex's idea in the feedback link here at answers.ros.org, but have no idea if anyone reads those suggestions. I think it would be really cool to map all of this info.

People do read those :). I don't know if anyone actually acted on it, especially since not everyone actually fills in that field. If WG were to create a map, it would probably be better to geolocate all of the IPs that fetched from packages.ros.org (and get all that info for the mirrors as well).
