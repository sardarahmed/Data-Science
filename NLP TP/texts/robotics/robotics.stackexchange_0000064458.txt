Q:

What ROS Java Architecture can support?

Hello everyone,
I am new to ROS Java environment, base on what I have seen so far I want to confirm with the community what ROS Java architecture can support.

Is ROS Java environment use a hosted container architecture?  What I mean is that, after I create my ROS Java code / bean I have to deploy into the ROS container in order for it to run?

If this is the case, is it possible not to use a hosted container architecture to run my ROS Java code?  Can I run my ROS code standalone outside to ROS container to interact with the ROS Core?  I need to deploy my Java code into another Java container environment, which does not allow me to deploy to ROS container environment.

Thanks,
Mason Tran

A:

The rosjava implementation does not require hosted container architecture. Generally it's built into freestanding executables.
