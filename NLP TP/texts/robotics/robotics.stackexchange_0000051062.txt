Q:

rosmake rosbuild_genmsg

Hi,
I have a small issue.
I just included in my src/file.cpp the lines
#include "sensor_msgs/PointCloud.h"
#include "hokuyo_listener_al/PointCloudWithOrigin.h" then I uncomment the line rosbuild_genmsg() in CMakeList.txt and I create the folder msg under my package directory.
Then I run rosmake  hokuyo_listener_al (which is my package name) and I get the following error:
fatal error: hokuyo_listener_al/PointCloudWithOrigin.h: No such file or directory
I have in my manifest.xml depend package="geometry_msgs", depend package="sensor_msgs"
Any suggestion?
In advance thank you :)

Is 'PointCloudWithOrigin.h' the result of your PointCloudWithOrigin.msg or a custom header file written by you ?

it is part of the prairiedog http://code.google.com/p/prairiedog/source/browse/?r=7 open source.

A:

Well, I found the mistake, I just forgot to add the file PointCloudWithOrigin.msg in the msg folder.
