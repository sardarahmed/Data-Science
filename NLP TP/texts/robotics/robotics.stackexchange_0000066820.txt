Q:

Problem with Gazebo model data base

I am working with Hydro version in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. The time I am launching the Gazebo Simulator with Summit_XL with cube as an obstacle in the terminal it is showing "Unable to get model name[http://gazebosim.org/models/wooden_peg_board]". I have done the ROS update but still it is the same. Is there currently any problem with the Gazebo Simulator data base or I am missing any update operation for the Gazebo Simulator?

A:

The file you are looking for is at http://old.gazebosim.org/models/wooden_peg_board/
This looks like a mismatch between versions of gazebo and ros.
