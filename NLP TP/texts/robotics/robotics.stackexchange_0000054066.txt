Q:

cannot find my package in apt-get

Hello,
I programmed my own ros package and did all the steps described here to share it. The package is even built on the farm. Still, when I do sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-te [tab] the auto complete does not offer my package. What have I done wrong?
Thanks!

A:

This only indexes your package for the documentation. You should be able to find the entry in the wiki.
To get it via apt-get you need to release your package: http://wiki.ros.org/bloom
