Q:

error: ‘options’ does not name a type

Hello,
I am using ROS 2 Galactic on Ubuntu 20.04. I am trying to create a callback group using the tutorial on ROS2 documentation. I am getting this error
error: ‘options’ does not name a type

This is how I am defining my group:
rclcpp::CallbackGroup::SharedPtr my_callback_group = create_callback_group(rclcpp::CallbackGroupType::Reentrant);
rclcpp::SubscriptionOptions options;
options.callback_group = my_callback_group;

I have also tried:
auto my_callback_group = create_callback_group(rclcpp::CallbackGroupType::Reentrant);
rclcpp::SubscriptionOptions options;
options.callback_group = my_callback_group;

I still get the same error. Thanks.

A:

I found out my problem, I was trying to define this options.callback_group = my_callback_group; after my variable declaration in my class declaration. When I added this in my constructor it worked for me. Thanks for you help
