Q:

Writing rviz plugin in python

I'm new to ROS and rviz.
I want to write a new tool rviz plugin like the one in this tutorial (adding a new tool on the tool bar), but in python rather than C++. My plugin tool needs to be able to create a line by dragging the mouse across the display in rviz. (I'm just practicing to write a simple tool here.)
I couldn't find any helpful resources or documentations on writing rviz plugin in python, nor a plugin written in python that I can reference on. Does anyone know any tutorial or resources or a sample plugin that might help?
Thanks!

Afaik, it's not possible to write RViz plugins in Python (or at least, not without instantiating a Python interpreter in your C++ plugin class and then using that to run Python (but even that would need bindings of some sort)). Let's hope someone responds to your question that proves me wrong.

A:

There  is an old Tutorial on how to do it the other way around. Using import librviz Python bindings to get Rviz`s 3D visualizer and adding your functionality. The tutorial displays a grid of variable line width.
