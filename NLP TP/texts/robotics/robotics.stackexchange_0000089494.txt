Q:

Could NOT find roscp (missing: roscp_DIR)

I'm new to ROS, and I got errot when trying to make workspace with catkin_make.
Can you tell me how to solve this problem?
CMake Error at /opt/ros/melodic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:83 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "roscp" with any of
  the following names:

    roscpConfig.cmake
    roscp-config.cmake
