Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Arm project

Could you suggest a project to make a moveit / ros compatible arm?
I can 3D print parts and I have already spare components in my shelfs.
Thanks

Thanks for the answer, the one you've pointed out is something I'm definitely considering.
In addition to that I've identified also

and this

What do you think?
Cheers

The first looks quite promising but for axis 4 5 6 you nee special parts. The last one need quite mutch print time I think. But the one I pointed has also mutch Plastik.
