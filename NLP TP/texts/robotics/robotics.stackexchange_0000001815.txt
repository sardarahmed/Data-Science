Q:

Roller Screw drive - axial movement instead of friction

I need an equation or a some hints to solve the following problem.
Imagine a roller screw drive. I apply a torque of T to translative move my load mass M. I assume my screw has an efficiency of 90%. Now an additional axial force affects my mass in the opposite moving direction. Is this force completely transformed into torque (of course considering the efficiency) or is it possible, that my whole roller screw is moving, because it is not fixed? I just found papers/books/articles for movable slides/loads, but fixed shafts. But in my case motor and shaft are part of an osciallation system.
I'm not a mechanical engineer, so I'm sorry if the answer may is trivial.
I made a little sketch now 
The process force Fp is pushing my mass, most of the force is transformed into a load torque Tp which acts against my drive torque TD. Some of the energy is lost by friction. The question is, if there is also a partial force Tp? which is affecting the bearing and therefore exciting my chassis.

A:

OK.  as drawn, ignoring mass and accelerations, the force $F_p$ will appear as a torque on your ball screw.
However, the total force on the ball screw, and hence the torque, depends on the mass of the thing you're moving with the ball screw interacting with gravity (if it's being moved in anything other than a horizontal plane), and on whether or not the whole assembly -- frame and load -- is moving at anything other than a steady velocity.
On a bad day, your mass-spring-damper system will have an overall resonance that interacts with your control system, making oscillations happen where you never expected them.
