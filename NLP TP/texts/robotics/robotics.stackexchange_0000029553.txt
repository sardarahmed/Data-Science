Please remember to accept answered questions.  Only the original poster can do so.

A:

Do you mean computer platforms, or hardware platforms? The only official computer platform that is supported right now is Ubuntu. (http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Installation)
ROS can be used with numerous robot platforms, some of which are the PR2, iRobot Create, Lego NXT, Segway RMP, Arduino, Beagleboard, ArbotiX, Nao, and Qbo. You can see a complete list of all of the packages available here: http://www.ros.org/browse/list.php, there may be an existing package for your platform!
