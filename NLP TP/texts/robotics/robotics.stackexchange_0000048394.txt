Q:

Error compiling package with custom messages

Hello, everyone,
I'm having some difficulty compiling a package that I've created with custom message.
When I run cmake . at the head of that package's directory, I get the error
 Assertion failed: file
  '/home/poofjunior/Projects/ICEX/src/external_sensor_interface/msg/data_logger_measurement.h'
 does not exist.  Message: message file not found

inside of the msg directory in my package, I have a file titled data_logger_measurement.msg but indeed, the file in question, which is the .h file, does not exist in that msg directory.
Isn't this message auto-generated?
Oddly enough, I have been able to run this package before, and I'm slightly convinced that it may be an issue with how my workspace is setup.
Many thanks in advance!

A:

The header files for messages are autogenerated.
See http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingMsgAndSrv
If you use catkin, also see: See http://answers.ros.org/question/55339/catkin-generate_messages-before-building-library/
For more help, explain more about your workspace setup,and post your CMakeLists.txt

Aha!  It was my fault after all!  In my CMakeLists.txt for that package under the add_message_files section, I mislabeled my extension with a *.h extension instead of a *.msg extension. Thanks for the hand, though!
