Q:

Covnert geometry_msg/StampedPoint to Stamped pose

Hi guys.
I'm trying to convert point to pose.
But i don't know how to do.
I saw topic_tool package, but the only example is about stg_msgs. I can't find parameteres that i need. :(
And i also saw 'covert pose to point' (https://answers.ros.org/question/249104/convert-geometry_-msgspose-to-point/)
The answer is so simple. But it's not for me.
Thanks you for your interest, Ray.
(edit)
Code
rosrun topic_tools transform /clicked_point /clicked_pose geometry_msgs/PoseStamped \
'geometry_msgs.msg.PoseStamped( \
header=m.header,  \
pose=geometry_msgs.msg.Pose( \
  position=m.position, \
  orientation=geometry_msgs.msg.Quaternion( \
orientation.x = 0.0 \
    orientation.y = 0.0 \
orientation.z = 0.0 \
orientation.w = 0.0 \
)))' \

--import geometry_msgs
Error

A:

You can use transform from topic_tools. It is quite useful yet handy tool for which you have to care about. You can see the details of paramters here.
Here is an example to use in launch file:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<launch>
  <node name="diagnostics_stamped" pkg="topic_tools" type="transform"
    args="/diagnostics /diagnostics_stamped diagnostic_msgs/DiagnosticArray 
   'diagnostic_msgs.msg.DiagnosticArray(header=std_msgs.msg.Header(
    stamp=rospy.Time.now(), frame_id=m.name),
    status=[diagnostic_msgs.msg.DiagnosticStatus(
    level=m.level, name=m.name, message=m.message, hardware_id=m.hardware_id, values=[])])' 
    --import diagnostic_msgs std_msgs rospy"/>
</launch>

To run an from terminal an example can be seen here

Thanks for your help. But i'm still stuck.
I face problem that i don't know how to write orientation part. I cannot find any reference about orientation.
I want to put all 0.0 values in orientation. So I made some simplse code. But i got error msg about syntax.
Could i get some advice about my code? (i upload my code)
