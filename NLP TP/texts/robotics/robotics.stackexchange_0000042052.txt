Q:

[rviz] Unable to create the rendering window

Hi all, I want to run the simulation
http://www.ros.org/wiki/urdf/Tutorials/Building%20a%20Visual%20Robot%20Model%20with%20URDF%20from%20Scratch
but as soon as i run command
roslaunch urdf_tutorial display.launch model:=01-myfirst.urdf
it gives me errors as listed below
process[rviz-3]: started with pid [8013]
Config file '/home/sanket/.rviz/config' could not be opened for reading.
Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
rviz::RenderSystem: error creating render window: std::exception

log file: /home/sanket/.ros/log/5e4ebc6c-c928-11e1-950f-848f69c0fd9c/rviz-3*.log
i don't know whether my rviz is missing some files or is it related to system requirements of my laptop

Could you please reformat your question? Using code formatting or blockquotes makes console output much more readable (see here for some pointers). Thanks.

A:

It seems your X configuration is not properly set up for 3D accelerated OpenGL operation. GLX is the 'OpenGL Extension to the X Window System', which is required for this.
It seems you have more problems with this particular machine / setup? I noticed this question, which seems to be related.
I'd first sort out the OpenGL / Xorg setup on the machine (without involving ROS or rviz) and then try to tackle the rviz problems.
