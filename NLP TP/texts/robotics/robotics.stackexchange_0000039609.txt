Q:

gazebo_gui missing icons in fuerte

The gazebo gui is missing the icons to play/pause, create new boxes, etc.
Maybe this has something to do with the warning I get:
libpng warning: Application built with libpng-1.2.46 but running with 1.5.4
I don't quite understand this, since I have libpng12-dev version 1.2.46-3ubuntu1.3 installed.
I also get a debug message, but it is probably unrelated to the icon problem:
Dbg pluginPaths and GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH doesn't exist.Set GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH to Ogre's installation path. ...or are you loading via SystemPlugins?
I launched gazebo via roslaunch gazebo_worlds empty_world.launch
I understand this is not the final release of fuerte yet, but it seemed best to use ros answers to "report" this issue.
Version/system details:

Ubuntu oneiric x86_64
Lenovo T420 with Intel sandy bridge mobile graphics (or nVidia NVS 4200M optimus)
installed ros-fuerte-desktop-full
ros-fuerte-simulator-gazebo 1.6.5-s1333786104~oneiric

A:

After upgrading to precise everything is fine, no warning and icons are there again.
I can't check anymore, but I probably somehow ended up with an additional libpng previously.

I just faced the same problem. Could you please explain what exactly you have upgraded? I have checked, I have libpng12-0 and libpng12-dev installed

I'm now running Ubuntu Precise 12.04 with the normal ubuntu packages built for precise and it works there. But I don't know what exactly was the issue on Ubuntu Oneiric....
