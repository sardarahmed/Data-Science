Advantages and/or disadvantages...relative to what? Many papers have been written comparing robot software (search) -- reading just a few would be tremendously educational.

A:

I think the following pages do great at explaining the advantages so I'll just provide links:
http://www.ros.org/is-ros-for-me/
http://www.ros.org/core-components/
http://www.ros.org/integration/
As for disadvantages, many of them are being addressed in ROS 2.0, you can read more about that here (specifically this article).
Personally, I'd add that it not being cross-platform is a disadvantage. While there are ways to use it with Windows, OSX, and even Andriod, those operating systems are not currently fully supported.
