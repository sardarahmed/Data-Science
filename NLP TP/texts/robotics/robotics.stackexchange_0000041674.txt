Q:

Creating Object models for 3D Object Recognition

I am trying to create 3D models of objects for the 3D Object Recognition techniques presented in the following tutorial. I get the feeling that something similar to what I am looking for is done in the first steps of this tutorial but is glossed over.
I am wondering if there are any prebuilt packages either through PCL or ROS that cover this or if someone could point me in the best direction for getting started with doing this on my own.
My general thoughts were to use a rotating surface and to have it rotate the object while a kinect would capture information about the object and stitch together the various point clouds that would be generated.
Any input as always is more than welcome!

Hi,
You should give a try to roboearth: http://www.ros.org/wiki/roboearth
One of the tutorials (and there are only two) is exactly about recording and creating models. It is straightforward. In addition, roboearth uses pcl extensively in creating models. While you explore this, also think about adding new models to roboearth database (which is also explained in the same tutorial).
Hopefully this helps.
