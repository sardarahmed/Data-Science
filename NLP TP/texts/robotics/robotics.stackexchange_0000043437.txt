Q:

how does viso2_ros work? (monocular odometry)

Hi everybody,
I'm testing viso2_ros package (http://www.ros.org/wiki/viso2_ros), in particularly, VisualOdometryMono class and its functions.
Does anyone provide me any information about monocular odometry algorithm working?
Is it based on "A Robust Visual Odometry and Precipice Detection System Using Consumer-grade Monocular Vision" written by Campbell,Sukthankar,Nourbakhsh,Pahwa (http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1570639).
