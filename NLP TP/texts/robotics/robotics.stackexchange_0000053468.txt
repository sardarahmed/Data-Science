Q:

Any ROS node for people (legs) tracking?

Hello all, I would like to provide turtlebot with a decent people tracking capability, first for turtlebot_follower but maybe also for other more sophisticated behaviors. After a fast survey, I found the following packages:

http://www.ros.org/wiki/people_tracker        uses OpenNI skeleton tracker
http://www.ros.org/wiki/ppl_detection         also full body, only until electric
http://www.ros.org/wiki/lidar_tracking        laser-based, not robust, cannot find code!
http://www.ros.org/wiki/cyphy_people_mapping  also full body, make a map following people

So none of them is useful for the standard turtlebot configuration, as it can only "see" the people's legs. I have also searched for papers; there're tons of them, but I didn't find a reasonably recent opensource implementation.
Any suggestion? Thanks!

What about http://ros.org/wiki/srs_leg_detector ? No idea if it works or not... But maybe you can give it a try.

Thanks. I completely failed to locate this package!

Please let us know if it works ;)

My fork of the people stack.
I intend to push this stuff into the main people stack with debs but haven't had time to polish everything.
