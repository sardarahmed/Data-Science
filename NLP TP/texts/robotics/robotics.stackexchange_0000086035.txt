Q:

ROS gpsd client Subscriber node (fix)

I want to write subscriber node for ROS GPSD client which is publishing GPS coordinates on topic "/fix". I don't know exactly what would be the right code and what changes I have to make in CMakeList.txt and package.xml. Below is the code
#include <ros/ros.h>
#include <sensor_msgs/NavSatStatus.h>  
#include <sensor_msgs/NavSatFix.h>
using namespace gps_common;
void callback(const sensor_msgs::NavSatFixConstPtr& fix) {
  if (fix->status.status == sensor_msgs::NavSatStatus::STATUS_NO_FIX) {
   ROS_INFO("No fix.");
   return;
 }

 if (fix->header.stamp == ros::Time(0)) {
   return;
}
printf("\n Latitude = %f and Logitude = %f ",fix->latitude, fix->logitude);  
}

int main (int argc, char **argv) {
 ros::init(argc, argv, "gps_collect");
 ros::NodeHandle node;
 ros::Subscriber fix_sub = node.subscribe("fix", 10, callback);
 ros::spin();
 return 0;
}

Have you gone through the tutorials? These cover the basics (subscribing, publishing, etc.) pretty well. Are you getting any errors that you can post? I can't imagine that this code compiles with return statements in a void function.

Also, in one of your includes you're mixing " with <.

And just to make sure you've seen it: gpsd_client. There's nothing wrong with wanting to learn how to do something yourself btw.

A:

The code is fine and its working.  Thanks

To whom are you addressing this comment? @jayess was right: before you edited the code in your question text, there was mixup with " instead of < in one of your #include statements.

If you've resolved your problem then please post the solution. If not, then please turn your answer into a comment.

If I am working on ROS and dont know to deal with syntax error then I would say I need to learn basic C/C++. Anyways I never had these brackets error, those were bcs of copy and paste. The problem here was I have to make few changes in CMakelist.txt and Package.xml file.

The above code is solution for capturing GPS Coordinates from fix(ros gpsgd client topic); Extra things you need is the right CMakelist.txt(add sensor_msgs) and Package.xml. Thanks and sorry for inconvenience
