Q:

Laserscan to PointCloud

Hello folks
I need to convert the Laserscanner data from my Hokuyo Laser Range Finder into a PointCloud.
I know there is a package called laser_assembler which should do this.
But i can't manage to make it working. There's a launch file in the test directory, but this one didnt what i expected.
What I need is a launch file, which converts the laserscanners topic /scan to a pointcloud topic /scan_pointcloud for example, so I can visualize it in Rviz as a first step.
I will appreciate any kind of help!
Regards,
Timo

Do you need a single scan as points or multiple merged ones? The latter is what laser_assembler does. Converting a single scan is rather simple. For visualization in rviz, just use a LaserScan display.

I don't need merged ones. Just the actual ones, but not as polar coordinates. I need them as Cartesian coordinates. I know, I can visualize just the laserscan topic in Rviz. But I need them as a pointcloud. In a later approach I have to detect circles in the pointcloud, thats why I need Cartesian coordinates.

In that case I'd suggest to just to that manually in the code, unless that is something that you cannot change and needs pointcloud input. Then you could just write a simple node that does the conversion.

Ok, I managed to run the assembler and the periodic snapshotter. But it only gets new points after about 4sec. But I cant find the variable to change, which makes the snapshotter publish the points more often.

A:

A simple converter node is available via the hector_laserscan_to_pointcloud package. It should be pretty straightforward to use and do what you request.

Hi Stefan
I cant find this package on http://www.ros.org/browse/list.php, how can I incorporate this package to my hydro ros?

The laser_geometry package has the core functions for doing this: http://wiki.ros.org/laser_geometry
