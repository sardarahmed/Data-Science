Q:

creating a custom message type including an image

I'm trying to define and use a custom message type. This message will include a few primitive data types as well as a sensor_msgs/Image.msg type for transferring the image. I have not managed to work out how to define this last element yet.
Do I need to update the package dependencies somehow? What type name would I use for this.
I'm assuming this is even possible, if not would I need to make a copy of what's in the sensor_msgs/Image.msg instead.
Thanks

Please add whatever you currently already have, how you configured your CMakeLists.txt and what errors you are getting. Composing custom messages out of others is a typical use case that should-just-work if you set things up correctly.

A:

Thanks for the reply gvhoorn. I've managed to get to the bottom of this one now. I couldn't find any description of the syntax of the type name for messages from external packages. Through trial and error I worked out I needed to write this:
sensor_msgs/Image <variable name>

Now everything is working properly!

That is actually documented: from wiki/msg - Field Types:

When embedding other Message descriptions, the type name may be relative (e.g. Point32) if it is in the same package; otherwise it must be the full Message type (e.g. std_msgs/String).

You're right. Not sure how I missed that the first time around!
