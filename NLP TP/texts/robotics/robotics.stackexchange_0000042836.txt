Q:

Problem with stereo and monocular calibration on openni_kinect

Hello, Im trying to get my kinect stereo calibrate so I was following this tutorial:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/camera_calibration/Tutorials/StereoCalibration#Before_Starting
but when I try $ rostopic list, it doesn't show any of the /my_stereo.../   and when I tried
rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --size 8x6 --square 0.108 right:=/my_stereo/right/image_raw left:=/my_stereo/left/image_raw right_camera:=/my_stereo/right left_camera:=/my_stereo/left
I got:
"Waiting for service /my_stereo/left/set_camera_info ...
Service not found
Waiting for service /my_stereo/right/set_camera_info ...
Service not found"
I also tried the Monocular Camera calibration on:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/camera_calibration/Tutorials/MonocularCalibration
and got the same problem
"Waiting for service /camera/set_camera_info ...
Service not found"
with $ rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --size 8x6 --square 0.108 image:=/camera/image_raw camera:=/camera
What im doing wrong? What should I do?
Im working on ubuntu 12.04 and ros fuerte.
thanks!

A:

The kinect is not a (traditional) stereo camera, so the stereo calibration will not work. There is a wiki page which details how to calibrate a kinect properly.
There isn't quite enough information to figure out why the set_camera_info service can't be found. Could you edit your question to add the exact command you're using the launch the camera driver?
