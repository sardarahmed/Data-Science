A:

ROS actions are intended for robot-actions that are expected to take a "longer" time. They provide a status where you can past the current expected status of the action (e.g. percentage or similar). For services, you will only get a result but no periodic status feedback. Furthermore, ROS actions offer the possibility to cancel the current action.
