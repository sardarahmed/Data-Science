A:

By default, there will be no display types (except maybe a grid). You need to click the "Add" button under the list of displays and add relevant displays for your robot. You may also need to adjust the global frame in "Global settings". See http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/DisplayTypes for a list of display types available.
