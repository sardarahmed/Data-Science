Q:

creating rostopic

Hi,
I am confused in how to create ROSTOPICs. In case of ROSMSG,one has to create a msg folder and then .msg file .Does one has to do the similar process for creating ROSTOPIC ?

A:

A topic is "created" (and will show up when using ROS introspection tools such as rostopic) as soon as a publisher or subscriber to that topic is created within a ROS node. From the Python and C++  creating a publisher/subscriber tutorials:
C++:
ros::Publisher chatter_pub = n.advertise<std_msgs::String>("chatter", 1000);

Python:
pub = rospy.Publisher('chatter', String, queue_size=10)
