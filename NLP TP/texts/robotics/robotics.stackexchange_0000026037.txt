Q:

how to delete object in gazebo

Hello:
I have a question about how to delete object in gazebo. I am able to use: "gzfactory spawn -f model.sdf" to spawn object but I don't know how to delete object using a command instead of using GUI and right click to delete the object. Anybody know how to do that? Thanks!
Best wishes
Cherry

A:

Try:
gzfactory delete -m model_name
where model_name is the name of the model you want to delete

HI, thanks. I have another question. Because I am doing this in a loop. So I would like the model to be spawned and deleted multiple time. After I spawned the object twice, then I cannot deleted in the scene, although on the left in the model list, the object's name disappeared there. Do you know how to do the delete and spawn multiple times?

HI, I just figured out it was the rendering problem. I don't actually need to see the object in the scene as long as it exists in the collision model.

How it is possible to delete model from launched ROS gazebo package? Because it crashes on deleting last model
