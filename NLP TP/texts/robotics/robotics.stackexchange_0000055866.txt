Q:

setTransform return unhandled

In tf2_ros/src/transform_listener.cpp line 123 in TransformListener::subscription_callback_impl(...) the call buffer_.setTransform returns a boolean. If I've read things right it appears like that the return value should be checked, and handled in some way (error message if false??)

A:

In general it's very unlikely to happen and there's not much else to do about it if it fails.
The only thing I could see is to add a debug output there if it fails. I'd merge a patch for that.

I think that it is reasonable to add debug output in there. If for some reason it does fail I think its better to know about it than not.
