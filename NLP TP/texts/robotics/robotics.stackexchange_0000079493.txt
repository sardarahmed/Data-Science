Q:

ros_arduino bridge vs ros_serial

Which is best for for what? What are the differences between them? Basically what my requirment is that i want to use arduino just as a bridge which connects sensors and motors with the ros node running in the main computer, so that the nodes which requires high processing power can be run on main computer. I am using ros arduino bridge right now. And if i use ros_serial does it communicates with pc faster? For example i may be reading encoder in arduino board and than calculating the encoder position in itself, than publishing it which a node in pc will be subscribing. So which package makes arduino and pc communicate faster?

Please see http://answers.ros.org/question/215309/rosserial_arduino-vs-ros_arduino_bridge

A:

ros_serial ist more vertatile then then the bridge, but is uses more code space on thr Arduino, in my optinion the bridge was faster.
but for special needs the  ros_serial is the better solution.
