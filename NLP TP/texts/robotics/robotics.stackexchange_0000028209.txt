Q:

What is the relation between gazebo and ignition library?

I know that my question sounds very generic.
I'm new to gazebo and I'm using version 7.8.
I have worked with some examples that use the transport layer to advertise a topic and publish Vector3 msg from the math library using Gazebo (only).
Can I use instead Vector3 or the transport from ignition library and everything work as before?
Is this still true if I want to use it with ROS?
Hope that made clear what I ask. Ignition library looks very nice by the way :)
Thanks!

A:

gazebo 7.x uses gazebo topics instead of ign-transport topics. There is plan to replace the gazebo transport layer with ign-transport sometime in the future. If you're using gazebo through ROS, you can just publish to the ROS topics provided by gazebo_ros_pkgs.

So, as far as I can understand,  gradually some areas will move to ignition such as transport, math. (yes. I already use math from ignition)

Correct. This tutorial gives some more context: http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=install_dependencies_from_source&cat=install
