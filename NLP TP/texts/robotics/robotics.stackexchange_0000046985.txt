Q:

rviz/gazebo path plot

Hi everyone!
I'd like to plot the path followed by my robot (a p3dx) during the simulation. Is it possible to do it in gazebo or with a rviz plugin?
Any suggestion?

A:

The hector_trajectory_server node does what you request. It publishes the path traveled as a nav_msgs/Path which can easily be visualized in rviz (but not gazebo). See also this Q/A very similar to yours.
