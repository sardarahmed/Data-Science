Q:

Publish initial pose

Is there a better way to publish the initial pose to AMCL other than creating a publisher and delaying a few seconds before publishing it?  How do I know it got it?  How do I know if AMCL has even started yet?

A:

If you just want to make sure that it gets it once it starts, I suggest using a Publisher with a latched topic. That way, whenever amcl gets around to subscribing to the initialpose topic, as long as your node already has published it, amcl should get it.
See the roscpp docs for information on how to make a latched publisher in C++.
