Q:

Rosjava build problem

Hello,
I have been working with rosjava and i had some troubles on instalation/build.I have been following the rosjava tutorial from the ros website and i got this error running the third instruction : ./gradlew test :
org.ros.time.NtpTimeProviderTest > testNtpUbuntuCom FAILED
java.lang.AssertionError at NtpTimeProviderTest.java:64
129 tests completed, 1 failed
:rosjava:test FAILED
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':rosjava:test'.

There were failing tests. See the report at: file:///home/eduardo/fuerte_workspace/rosjava_core-groovy-devel/rosjava/build/reports/tests/index.html

Try:
Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace. Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.

BUILD FAILED
Total time: 30.957 secs
If anyone could help with this will be gratefull
Thanks

A:

You installed the Groovy ROSjava version on Fuerte? Could be that that is the cause of the problem. There is no Fuerte version any more, but fortunately Martin GÃ¼nther has made a fork, see here: http://answers.ros.org/question/65674/rosjava_core-in-fuerte/
