i have used benchmark in movei for single query.
now i want to compare PRM with RRT. how can we define multi-query?

A:

Good day,
you can use the benchmarking tool to compare both planners in single query applications.
PRM constructs a graph-structure (roadmap) of the free configuration space. Instead of exploring the c space every time you plan a path like RRT does, PRM is able to use the generated roadmap of the first query.
I found this Issue (Nr. 1026) on Github. Also, there is this post about the same topic.
It seems that the reusability of roadmaps generated by planning algorithms like PRM is not yet implemented in MoveIt.
