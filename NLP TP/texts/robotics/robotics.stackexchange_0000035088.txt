Q:

Code completion for Eclipse with PCL on ROS electric

I would like to use PCL with ROS, but it seems that my eclipse is not automatically configured for PCL-related services to use code completion. The general ROS code has no problem at all. I am using ROS electric anyway. Hopefully any eclipse user/developer can guide me on this.

A:

I had the same problem, using electric, and I finally solved it, I can't tell exactly how, but I'll tell you the steps I followed
1- Remove everything in folder CMakeList and file CMakeCache.txt
2- If you called on the that package "make eclipse-project", then remove .cprojet and .project files
3- My dependancy in manifest.xml is as follows:

and yes I know there are some redundancies, but maybe this is what helped in my case
4- After that call the following inside your package:
rosmake --pre-clean --rosdep-install
5- Finally call:  cmake -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles"
6- Then import the project into eclipse. In my case it worked
Good luck

if you already have imported  the project under eclipse, then please remove it before applying these steps
