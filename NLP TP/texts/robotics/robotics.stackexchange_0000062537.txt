Q:

Problem when compiling hector_quadrotor

I used the source code method to build the "Quadrotor outdoor flight demo" as the ros-hydro-hector-quadrotor-demo cannot be located. However, I cannot proceed with installation as I always encountered the following error message when doing "catkin_make", as shown in the following. The OS I am using is Ubuntu 14.04 and ROS Indigo.
viki@c3po:~hector_quadrotor_tutorial$ catkin_make

set "hardware_interface_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
files. If "hardware_interface" provides a separate development package or
SDK, be sure it has been installed.
