Q:

Is there another stereo processing node in ROS but stereo_image_proc?

Hi,
to compare performance and results I am looking for another node but stereo_image_proc doing stereo image processing.
Curious about your answers,
Sabrina

Sabrina,
you can browse all the existing software directly on the ros website: here.
I had a quick look and found these packages that could potentialy do the trick:

bumblebee_stereo
stereo_image_proc_gpu
stereo_gpu
stereo_anaglyph
stereov4l2
sparse_stereo

Hope it helps

A lack of documentation can be a closed-source issue as well ;). As good maintenance and support are important criteria for me I can't consider undocumented packages.

I guess this is when the open-source side of ROS kicks back :) You might want to try compiling the packages and try running some nodes. I usually get the main points of a node by looking at his subscriptions and outputs directly in the code or via rxgraph.

Thank you for your answer. stereo_anaglyp seems to create cyan-magenta 3D-images. I assume that the *_gpu packages use a graphical processor unit to run the computation but this is not what I am looking for. Unfortunately there are no wiki pages for the other packages you mentioned.
