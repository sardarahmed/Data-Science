Q:

How can I create a service on rosjava?

Hello all,
I'm creating and Android app to remotely operate the turtlebot_panorama app through service calls. I don't know how to make gradle to compile my .srv file.
As a dirty workaround, I copied the .srv file on
rosjava_core/rosjava_bootstrap/src/test/resources/test_ros/srv/
and let gradle compile it together with the whole rosjava_core. This works fine but...
Thank you a lot

A:

You simply need to rebuild the rosjava_messages package. For Eclipse, it depends highly on your setup. You may need to regenerate your project as well.

Hi, I've succesfully created a service (using your suggestion). I'm trying to use this package on the rosjava_tutorial_services package, but the compiler says that the custom_msg package doesn't exist. Do you have some suggestion on how to build the project in a correct way?
