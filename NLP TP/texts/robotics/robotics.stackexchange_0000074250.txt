A:

You should post here the package file and the cmake file, it seems like you didn't write them correctly. Anyway make sure you have these in the package.xml:
  <build_depend>pcl_conversions</build_depend>
  <build_depend>pcl_ros</build_depend>
 
  <run_depend>pcl_conversions</run_depend>
  <run_depend>pcl_ros</run_depend>

and then in the CMakeLists.txt file you should have something like this:
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
  pcl_conversions
  pcl_ros
)
target_link_libraries(executable_name
  ${catkin_LIBRARIES}
  ${roslib_LIBRARIES}
  ${PCL_LIBRARIES}
)

I hope this helps

CMake Error at /opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:83 (find_package):

Add the installation prefix of "pcl_ros" to CMAKE_PRE

now this error is coming.
Comment by marcozorzi on 2016-06-02:
Then try to add this one to the cmake file
## System dependencies are found with CMake's conventions
find_package(PCL 1.7 REQUIRED COMPONENTS)

Then give it a catkin_make clean and then again catkin_make an let me know.
Of course I am assuming that you have pcl 1.7 installed correctly

pcl 1.7 is installed, but still getting problems.
