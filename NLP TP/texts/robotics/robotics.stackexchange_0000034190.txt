Q:

pr2_odometry errors when making pr2_mechanism_controllers

I'm trying to use pr2_gazebo.  I get the following errors when making pr2_mechanism_controllers.  Is pr2_odometry stable?
/home/ros_stacks/pr2_mechanism_controllers/src/pr2_odometry.cpp:392: error: ‘class controller::OdomMatrix16x1’ has no member named ‘cwise’
/home/ros_stacks/pr2_mechanism_controllers/src/pr2_odometry.cpp: In member function ‘controller::OdomMatrix3x1 controller::Pr2Odometry::iterativeLeastSquares(const controller::OdomMatrix16x3&, const controller::OdomMatrix16x1&, const std::string&, const int&)’:

A:

Problem solved by installing wg_robots_gazebo all at once.  Thanks to joq for the tip in an earlier (indirectly related) post.
