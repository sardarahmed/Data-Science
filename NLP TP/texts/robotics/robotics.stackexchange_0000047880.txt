Q:

InvalidROSPkgException when running roswtf: no manifest file in roscpp

I am trying to run roswtf as described at the end of the  beginner tutorial, but it complains about roscpp not having a manifest file:

What could be the cause of this?

Hi,
Try executing roswtf command again after sometime in cd ~/catkin_ws. No errors and warnings this time in static checks summary. I also faced similar problem but when i re-ran it , it went fine. Hope works for you as well.

You're right, re-running it several times seems to get rid of the problem! I still don't understand why the problem occurred in the first place, however :D

Yeah, but if you go through http://www.ros.org/wiki/Manifest and http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/windowsazure/jj151528.aspx , and get to know the importance of manifest files, I guess while we run any command like roswtf above,  it was searching for manifest.xml file which is not present in

at the mentioned location, but package.xml is present. As the XML manifest can be any file in the archive as long as the relationship points to the XML manifest file and the XML manifest file conforms to the schema. So, dynamically establishing this relationship takes a while. Hence, rerunning

enables it to read through package.xml which is present. And it runs successfully.

@ROS-freak Yeah, that sounds logical enough.
