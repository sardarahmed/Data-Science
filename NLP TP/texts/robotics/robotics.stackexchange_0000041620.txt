Q:

Laser based localization in a map without movement

Hi,
I am looking for an implementation of a localization algorithm that calculates the best fitting robot position based on a laser scan and a know map. The navigation stack expects odometry measurements and do not support an initial estimation without any movements?
Best wishes from Germany
Enjoy the weekend

Are you attempting to publish an odometry message or are you trying to provide the initial estimation?

I want to provide an initial position estimation.

A:

In fuerte, you can check out the FLIRTlib stack: http://kforge.ros.org/projects/startuploc/services/git/ .  It's not released yet, but the code and launch files are documented.
