Q:

How to install Ros Groovy Beta 2

Hey,
I'm trying to do a fresh install of Groovy Beta 2 on Ubuntu 12.10, like documented on the wiki.
sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-desktop

The problem is that now there is no package ros-groovy-desktop as it was in Beta 1.
Is there any new package to install it, or do I have to install all packages manually?
Thanks.
