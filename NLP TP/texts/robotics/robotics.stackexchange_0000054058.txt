Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Roboteq AX2550

Hello,
Does anyone know if there is a package for the Roboteq AX2550 motor driver that is compatible with Groovy or Hydro? I've been looking around, but all I can find is an old package from Electric that I can't get working. If anyone can point me in the right direction it would be appreciated.
Thanks

A:

Nevermind, a catkinized version of serial_utils and ax2550 has been developed and released for Hydro by wjwwood on github. Here is a link to the issue thread: https://github.com/wjwwood/serial/issues/40#issuecomment-24708776
