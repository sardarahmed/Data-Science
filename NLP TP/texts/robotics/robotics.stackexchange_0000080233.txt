Q:

[Moveit!] 3D navigation for robot without arm

I know Moveit! is the most used for robot with arms or quadrotors. My robot has no arm and only can move by wheels. It can navigate by 2D navigation stack(costmap_2d) now. Maybe my robot will has arms in the future, therefore I want to use 3D navigation stack(Moveit!). Can I use Moveit! to do 3D navigation even the robot without arm?

Whats the problem with navigating your robot in 2d e.g. from the table do the fridge and do only the short range arm operations in 3d?

I just survey the feasibility by using the 2D navigation with Moveit!. My robot has no arm.

BTW, my robot is differential drive robot

A:

Now I just survey the feasibility by using the 2D navigation with Moveit!, because my robot has no arm. I just want to know whether moveit! can do 2D navigation as costmap_2d.
I find someone said that the Moveit! cannot do 2D navigation now and developer should write the navigation planner for 2D navigation. Therefore I start to doubt the 2D navigation function of Moveit!.  In addition, I find lots of moveit! tutorials and simulation videos only present the arm motion planning but no 2D path planning.
