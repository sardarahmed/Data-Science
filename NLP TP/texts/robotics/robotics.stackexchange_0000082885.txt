A:

Essentially you'll want to make an URDF file for your robot (URDF stands for Unified Robot Description Format). You can learn how to do that using these URDF tutorials.

Thank you for your answer
it's for visual robots, I think this is not my case, I need to integrate a real robot like Adept Cobra this is just an example. it already has a program to use it but I would like to integrate it with ros.
thank you

@nachatad URDF files are for more than just visualization. You can use them to publish the tf of your robot (which is useful for many things) via robot_state_publisher. You'll probably want to take a look at the link that @Airuno2L posted

You also define motors, transmissions, controllers, sensors, etc in the URDF. It is how your robot will interact with ROS.
