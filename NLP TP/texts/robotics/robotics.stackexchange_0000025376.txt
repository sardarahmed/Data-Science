No one is here to answer it =(

A:

Hi Skhan,
sorry for the late reply, one way to do this is to create a model plugin, for example, see this tutorial on how to create a model plugin.  In the plugin update loop, you can get the force torque information from one of the joints in the model by calling:

    physics::JointWrench wrench = this->model->GetJoint("...your model joint name...")->GetForceTorque(0u);

On the SDF side, in your model, you must set <provide_feedback> to true for this to work.

you can also create a contact sensor as described in this tutorial: http://gazebosim.org/wiki/Tutorials/1.5/sensors/contact

http://www.gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=contact_sensor&cat=sensors is the new link to the sensor contact tutorial, the above wiki link is dead now.
