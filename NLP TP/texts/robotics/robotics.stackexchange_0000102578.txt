Q:

navigation stack error

I launch navigation launch file with all the parameters and when i press the 2D pose estimate in rviz i get this error :
 Ignoring initial pose in frame "odom"; initial poses must be in the global frame, "map"

I don't really know what it means and i don't why is this happening . Do you need any of the param files to investigate  this error ? let me know .

A:

This question with its answers seems to be connected:

https://answers.ros.org/question/81836/intialpose-is-in-what-reference/

[Initial pose in RVIZ] is being sent in the frame that you set as the fixed frame in rviz.

and

The pose sent is in reference to the fixed frame in RVIZ - and therefore, you should almost certainly have your fixed frame set to /map as AMCL is determining the transform from base_link->odom->map, and the pose you send should be where base_link is in terms of map (so that the initial_odom->map transform can be determined)

Can you check your fixed frame in RViz?
