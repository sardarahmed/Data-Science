Q:

How can geometry_msgs::Point use push_back()?

Hello, guys.
I'm trying to study rviz with tutorials provided by ros wiki.
I built a sample of document using catkin_make, saw the result.
On the line of this sample codes,
...
visualization_msgs::Marker points, line_strip, line_list;
...
for(ellipsis) {
    ...
    geometry_msgs::Point p;
    p.x = (int32_t)i - 50;
    p.y = y;
    p.z = z;

    points.points.push_back(p);
    ...
}
...

How can the variable of geometry_msgs::Point type use push_back()?
I saw it's msg header on the link
It is just msg consist of 3 variables of float64 type.
The function, push_back(), It appears to be used like push_back of stl.
Could you tell me how this works?

A:

visualization_msgs/Marker contains a points field, which is of type geometry_msgs/Point[]. That is an unbounded array (== list) of geometry_msgs/Points.
Lists in the ROS msg IDL are mapped to std::vectors for C++ (see wiki/msg - Message Description Specification - Array handling).
And std::vector has a push_back(..) method that in this case will take geometry_msgs/Point.
