Q:

Trajectory Rollout paper

Hello,
On the wiki page for base_local_planner, there's a link link to a paper discussing TR. The link's broken; can anyone point me to a copy of this paper?
Thanks,
Rick

Ok, now I feel really dumb: I had actually found that page but didn't notice the "cached" link. Thanks!
