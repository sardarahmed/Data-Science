Q:

Can I add a link to a tool I've made?

Hi there!
I've followed information given there: http://wiki.ros.org/docker/Tutorials/GUI but it doesn't provide an out-of-the-box solution.
So I decided to build a small tool to easily create and use a dockerized ROS box and I would like to share it: https://github.com/pierrekilly/docker-ros-box.
Is it worth mentioning it on the wiki page? I think that could bring some people to the project and help improving it.
Thanks!
Pierre

A:

Sure. The wiki is just that: a wiki. So it needs people like you to keep it up to date.
Just make sure you do it in such a way that it's clear that there is no 'official' way to do things, and that you're providing just one additional approach.
Register for an account, request write access and that should be it.
Thanks for making the effort to contribute, that is the only way we keep this community going.

Related: take a look at Singularity. Similar functionality to Docker, but no root permissions needed and makes things like sharing your home dir, access to GPUs/other hw etc much, much easier.

Awesome! I've updated the page: http://wiki.ros.org/docker/Tutorials/GUI
This is my first contribution to the ROS wiki so any feedback will be very welcome!
Thanks!
