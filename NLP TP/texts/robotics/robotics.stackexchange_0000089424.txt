Q:

ROSLaunch: [] is neither a launch file in package [] nor is [] a launch file name

Hello,
I'm new ROS user. I've already installed the OS, but when I type "roslaunch kobuki_node minimal.launch --screen" it gives me an error.
I'm using Ubuntu 17.10 Artful Aardvark (amd64)
This is coppied from my terminal:
sgzhelev@Lenovo-Legion-Y520-15IKBN:~$ roslaunch kobuki_node minimal.launch --screen

RLException: [minimal.launch] is neither a launch file in package [kobuki_node] nor is [kobuki_node] a launch file name

The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

Thank you for all advices!
-- Steve

First thing to check: have you sourced the correct setup.bash before trying to run roslaunch like this?
Additionally: did you install the kobuki packages from sources (ie: did you have to run catkin_make first) or did you use apt-get install ..?
Comment by sgzhelev on 2018-10-28:
Yes, I have sourced the bash file and I used apt-get install, not catkin_make.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-10-28:
Then do you have the kobuki packages installed? They do not come with a default installation.
What is the output of dpkg -l | grep kobuki (add that to your original question, use the edit button/link)?

I will try that later because now I'm trying with Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial and ROS Kinetic.

When I type  dpkg -l | grep kobuki  the terminal is not showing anything. It's going on new row and waiting for a new command.

A:

I should've paid more attention:

I'm using Ubuntu 17.10 Artful Aardvark (amd64)

together with the Melodic tag and:

I used apt-get install [..]

is the cause here.
None of the Kobuki packages have been released as binaries for ROS Melodic yet.
Unless things have changed very recently, you'll need to build all of the turtlebot (2) stack from source on Melodic. That is possible, but you can/may run into some issues while doing that (see #q305453 for a recent Q&A about that).
The simple packages (such as kobuki_description) will build without issues, but as ROS Melodic uses Gazebo 9 (instead of Gazebo 7), you'll run into issues getting things like kobuki_gazebo_plugins to build.

Yesterday, I have tried to install ROS from source, but Ubuntu freezed, maybe is becouse, like you said  Melodic is not finished yet. Now I'm trying with Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial and ROS Kinetic, because at school I have successfully installed it on 16.04.

No, that is most likely not the cause.
The base Melodic release is "finished", it's just that not all packages available in Kinetic are available on Melodic.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-10-28:\

Now I'm trying with Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial and ROS Kinetic

So do you have Melodic or Kinetic installed?
Comment by sgzhelev on 2018-10-28:
I've got two laptops. The first is with Ubuntu 17.10 and Melodic and the second is with 16.04 and Kinetic.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-10-28:
Final comment: try to always use binary packages when installing ROS. Installing from source is almost never necessary or desirable.
Comment by sgzhelev on 2018-10-28:
Thanks for the answers but do you know where is located the log file?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-10-28:
Which log file?
Comment by sgzhelev on 2018-10-28:
Never mind... It all works now. I just had to install node... Thanks for your help and have a nice day!
