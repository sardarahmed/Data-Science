Q:

catkin_make can't seem to find package joyConfig

Hello,
I've attempted to install ROS on the raspi via the tutorial using the recommended ros-indigo-comm package via rosinstall_generator. In my catkin_ws I have these roscomm files (which all seem to build during a catkin_make... however the bluerov_apps cmake seems to be giving cmake errors such as sensor_msgs missing. So I rosinstall_generator that package as well but then run into pcl_conversions followed by a pcl_config missing error. I am just wondering if I followed the wrong path here because of the variety of errors.
EDIT: I commented out the pcl_conversions build dependency but now having issues with not being able to find joyConfig.cmake. With a little searching, I was able to find it in /opt/ros/indigo/share/joy/cmake... If i do an echo on $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH it has /opt/ros/indigo/share as a path...so why can't it find it and how can I point it in the right direction?

A:

I had a similar issue, simple solution (maybe not the cleanest) install all pcl and joy related pkgs, like:
$ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-joy*

The *Config.cmake missing error massage suggest that the linker can't find some pkg.
