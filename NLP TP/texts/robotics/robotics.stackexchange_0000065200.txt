Q:

Problem installing ar_tools in Catkin

Hi there!
I have a question about the installation of ar_tools stack in catkin.
I will create an example empty project, with ar_tools stack. Following the tutorials..
$ source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ catkin_init_workspace
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/
$ catkin_make
$ source devel/setup.bash

Once the project have been created and initialized, I get the source https://github.com/xqms/ar_tools (because dont exists a catkin branch in https://github.com/LucidOne/ar_tools source):
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone -b catkin https://github.com/xqms/ar_tools

And now, if I try to compile the project:
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/
$ catkin_make

I get this error message:
-- +++ processing catkin metapackage: 'ar_tools'
-- ==> add_subdirectory(ar_tools/ar_tools)
-- +++ processing catkin package: 'artoolkit'
-- ==> add_subdirectory(ar_tools/artoolkit)
-- +++ processing catkin package: 'ar_pose'
-- ==> add_subdirectory(ar_tools/ar_pose)

  Did you find_package() it before the subdirectory containing its code is

I have tried to compile by hand artoolkits, but nothing happens.
Thank you for your help.

A:

It just happened to me today also, and I had to compile artoolkit separately first.
 $ catkin_make --only-pkg-with-deps artoolkit

I don't know the reason, because I've had compiled ar_tools before without experiencing this.

I tried what you said, but even after compiling artoolkit separately, when I compile ar_tools I get the same error with ar_pose again.
