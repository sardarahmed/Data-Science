A:

Your setup sounds like it is pretty close to the standard setup of the Turtlebot. This tutorial provides a quick overview of how a map can be generated with the Turtlebot. Of course, your hardware setup differs, so you'll probably want to read some other Turtlebot tutorials from here to get a better understanding of how everything works.
That being said, mapping using the Kinect + gmapping can be relatively brittle depending on the environment you're operating in.

thanks for your response , can I use hector slam for this ?

hector slam does not work well with the Kinect as it has a too small FOV and too much noise. Making it work would require significant code changes.
