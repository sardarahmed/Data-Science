Q:

How can I activate/deactivate sensors in Gazebo?

Is it possible, from ROS, to send a message to Gazebo to turn on/off a sensor by name?
Peeking at the source code, I see the sensors themselves have a setActive(bool) function. Is there an existing way to access this via messages, or would I need to write my own SensorPlugin?

A:

A sensor will turn off when the <always_on> SDF element is false, and there are no subscribers to the sensor's output stream.
If you want to control a sensor, then you'll have to write a sensor plugin.
