Q:

amcl does not need odometry data?

I'm reading amcl document on ROS Wiki. In its subscribed topics there is not odometry topic, why? It works only with laser?
**Subscribed Topics:**

scan (sensor_msgs/LaserScan)
tf (tf/tfMessage)
initialpose (geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped)
map (nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid)

A:

amcl receives its odometry informations through the /odom -> /base_link transform. (Or whatever you have set as odom_frame_id and base_frame_id parameters)
This means that you need a node (typically your hardware abstraction) that accumulates odom information from your base-robot and publish the aggregated pose as a transform.
So no, laser only will not be sufficient.
