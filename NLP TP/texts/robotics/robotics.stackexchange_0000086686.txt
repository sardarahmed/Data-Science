Q:

gazebo_ros_pkgs is installed, but directory is empty

I was following this vid tutorial on YouTube on controlling joints. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qCh-p-hzCM. After I typed out the URDF, config and launch files, I ran the roslaunch command from the terminal. I get the following output.
... logging to /home/varun/.ros/log/2244837a-447c-11e8-a7c2-7c67a2be706c/roslaunch-varun-5577-22296.log

I get this error saying 'Controller Spawner couldn't find the expected controller_manager ROS interface.' Many people who experience this error had forgotten to install gazebo_ros_pkgs, but I had already installed it today. The urdf file searches for a file called libgazebo_ros_control.so, so I thought it would exist inside the gazebo_ros_control folder in gazebo_ros_pkgs. But to my surprise, gazebo_ros_pkgs was empty, except for the existence of a launch.xml file. Repeated attempts to remove and reinstall the packages were in vain, as it would still remain empty. I think the missing contents of this folder are the problem, but I haven't seen any error where it states that libgazebo_ros_control.so is missing. I find this very strange. What could be the problem?
I'm running ROS Indigo, Gazebo 7 on 14.04

A:

Afaik, gazebo_ros_control is not a dependency of gazebo_ros_pkgs, but needs to be installed separately.
After installing that, the library should be located in /opt/ros/$distro/lib.
If you feel this is a problem with the video you watched, then I suggest contacting the author(s) as it would be something that needs to be fixed.
