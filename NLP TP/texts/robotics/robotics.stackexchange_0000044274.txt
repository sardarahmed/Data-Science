Q:

[solved] Scrambled image using gscam

I am trying to access canon vc-c50i on a pioneer. The onboard computer has Ubuntu 10.04 and diamondback installed in it. P2OS controls are working fine for the camera. I checked ptz functions.
I tried using gscam to get the video from the camera and see it in image_view.
$ roscd gscam/bin
$ export GSCAM_CONFIG="v4l2src device=/dev/video0 ! video/x-raw-rgb ! ffmpegcolorspace"

$ rosrun gscam gscam

I am getting scrambled image in image view. I am accessing imageview using
$ rosrun image_view image_view image:=/gscam/image_raw

Cheese is also giving me the same video. Could someone help in this regard?

update 1:
I tried with player and I am getting the video stream properly.

update 2:
sorted with this environment variable setting. removed the device specification.
export GSCAM_CONFIG="v4l2src ! video/x-raw-yuv, width=320, height=240 ! ffmpegcolorspace"

Instead of changing the title to include "[solved]" we have a mechanism for accepting the solutions to questions where you answer your own question, and then accept the answer. It'd be great if you could do that!
