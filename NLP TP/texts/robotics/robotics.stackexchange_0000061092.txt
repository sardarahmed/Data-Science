Q:

Aborted (core dumped) Error

I'm subscribing to RBG kinect topic (/camera/rgb/image_color) and depth topic (/camera/depth_registered/image_raw) and I try to blend the two images like this

using this code that I get from opencv doc:
double a = 0.5; double b; 
Mat blend;
a = ( 1.0 - b );    
addWeighted( cv_ptr_kinect_rgb->image, alpha, cv_ptr_kinect_depth->image, 0.5, 0.5, blend);
cv::imshow( "Linear Blend", blend);

but I get this error message:
 /usr/include/boost/smart_ptr/shared_ptr.hpp:418: T* boost::shared_ptr<T>::operator->() const [with T = cv_bridge::CvImage]: Assertion `px != 0' failed.
    Aborted (core dumped)

I don't really know what going wrong !?

One of you image pointers is probably null.

I don't think so because I can visualize the two topics before blending them. (I post the topic that I use)

Then "something else" is null. You should check the stack trace in a debugger to see where the null access is caused.

How can I do that ?
Comment by ROSkinect on 2014-07-23:
@dornhege you are right this error comes from a null pointer. Thank y'll
