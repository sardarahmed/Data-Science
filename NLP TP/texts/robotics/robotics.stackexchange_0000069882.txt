Q:

Error with osm_cartography on ROS indigo

I install osm_carography using "git clone" since my work space, and when i execute the example (viz_osm.launch) ,show me the next error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/home/andres/ros_ws/open_street_map/osm_cartography/scripts/viz_osm", line 65, in 
import osm_cartography.cfg.VizOSMConfig as Config
ImportError: No module named osm_cartography.cfg.VizOSMConfig
Please can somebody help with an error?

A:

Some things to check:

Did you build your workspace after cloning the source?

Did you source devel/setup.bash from the workspace after building it?

UPDATE: this is a catkin package, you don't build it with rosmake. Instead:
$ cd ~/ros_workspace
$ catkin_make
$ source devel/setup.bash

After that you can run the program.

Hi joq,
I made this:

cd ~/ros_workspace.
git clone //repository/package_name\.
cd package_name.
rosmake.

To update the package later on, run the commands:

roscd package_name.
git pull.
rosmake --pre-clean.

Please, How do you install the osm_cartography package?
Regards
