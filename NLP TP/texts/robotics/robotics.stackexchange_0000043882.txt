Q:

Pointcloud_to_Laserscan correctly installed?

Hey guys,
I'd like to use the pointcloud_to_laserscan package to downgrade
the PCL-Data, that I get from a Kinect, and use the 2D-Scan for the navigation stack.
Right now, I'm not sure, if I installed pointcloud_to_laserscan correctly.
I have downloaded the files(http://bilibot-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/.../Pointcloud_to_Laserscan) and have run rosmake(no errors).
The auto-fill-in function of rosrun works fine - I can find the package.
Eventhough the "nodes" I could launch are a little awkward - "CloudScan.cfg" and "libcloud_to_scan.so" do not seem correct.
cliffs:
-tried install PCL_to_Laserscan
-rosmake without error
-package found by roscd, rosrun, etc
-nodes seem wrong(*.cfg and *.so)
Edit:
So, the nodes seem fine - how do I run them?!
CloudScan.cfg just creates some reconfiguration files and
with libcloud_to_scan I get some memory error -
guess the translation is segmentation fault.

A:

The "nodes" are OK. rosrun just looks for anything executable, including libraries and the .cfg script.

Well, you shouldn't/can't run those as ROS nodes. The package you linked to actually provides two nodelets, so you'll need to load them as such. Here is an example: http://answers.ros.org/question/9450/how-to-setup-pointcloud_to_laserscan/
