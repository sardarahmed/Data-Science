Q:

Will layer standoffs cause problem with YDLIDAR X4 for SLAM?

I want to mount my EAI YDLIDAR X4 360 Degree 2D LIDAR on one of the lower layers of my home robot.  The LIDAR claims minimum ranging distance to be 0.12 meters (12cm), so if there are standoffs that hold the upper layers 1-2 cm from the unit will it cause a problem with localization or mapping?

A:

It should not be a problem.
If it causes any issues, you can use laser_filters, more specifically look here: http://wiki.ros.org/laser_filters#LaserScanBoxFilter
This will remove all points within a box, by setting it to NaN
