Q:

Can map_server connect to costmap_2d directly with message or service?

Hi, all, I want to implement a node that implementing some functionalities based on the map which have to use the costmap_2d. I hope that costmap_2d should received the message from map_server. However, I found there is no direct message exchange betweer map_server and costmap_2d, i.e. not topics or services between them. It seems that the move_base node has to launched beforehand.
Does somebody know that there is some direct way to connect them by launching only map_server and costmap_2d node?

A:

You should be able to create an instance of costmap_2d that directly subscribes to the map. If you're using Hydro or later, make sure you are using the StaticMap layer. If you are using a version earlier than hydro, make sure ~static_map is set to true.
