Hello,

A:

One possible solution is to add a new field to the pcl::PointCloud datatype (that is, create a custom point type in PCL).
There is a tutorial on how to do this on the PCL website:
http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/adding_custom_ptype.php
Then, you would simply publish this new pointcloud with an additional custom label field.
