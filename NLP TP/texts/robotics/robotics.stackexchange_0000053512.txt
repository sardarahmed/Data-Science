Q:

How to use navigation stack in catkin workspace?

Hey folks,
I'd like to follow the simple goal sending tutorial but I can't compile my node because catkin can't find move_base. I understand that it's due to the fact that the navigation stack isn't catkinized yet.
But doesn't that mean that I cannot under any circumstances create a move_base goal sending node as long as I'm bound to a catkin workspace, at least unless I catkinize the navigation stack myself? I don't have the faintest idea on how to do that.
I'd appreciate any kind of help.
Cheers,
Hendrik

A:

Navigation has been catkinized for Hydro. You can check out the latest source to your catkin workspace.

Could you give me a little more detail on how I do that exactly? I'm still learning...

I see you have since asked this as another question, which has been answered. Is that sufficient? http://answers.ros.org/question/73102/need-some-advice-on-how-to-use-hydro-navigation-in-groovy/

Unfortunately not, but I think it's better to continue in the other thread. It's more specific... I'd happily see you take part in helping solving my problem. ;-)

I'll try, but William knows more about it than I do. Back-porting code to an earlier ROS version can be difficult. Is it possible for you to move up to Hydro, instead?
Comment by William on 2013-08-16:
Yeah, I have been trying to answer the less direct, more generic question of resolving dependencies in your workspace, but my recommendation for your particular problem would be to upgrade everything to Hydro. It will be much easier.
Comment by Hendrik Wiese on 2013-08-16:
Yeah, that's planned for as soon as Hydro is officially released. We don't really have the courage to migrate before Hydro is considered stable. However I guess I'll give it a try in a backup environment.
Comment by joq on 2013-08-16:
It's pretty stable now, for most uses.

Okay, I'll give it a try. Fingers crossed!
