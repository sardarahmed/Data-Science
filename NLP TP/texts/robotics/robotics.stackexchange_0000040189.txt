Q:

Rospack error after switching to fuerte

Hey guys,
i recently installed Fuerte and tried to build a package (including services and action-file) that i use in Electric. I get the following error:
  (...)
  [rosbuild] Building package morsetesting
  [rosbuild] Cached build flags older than manifests; calling rospack to get flags
  Failed to invoke /opt/ros/fuerte/bin/rospack cflags-only-I;--deps-only morsetesting
  Package geometry_msgs was not found in the pkg-config search path.
  Perhaps you should add the directory containing `geometry_msgs.pc'
  to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
  No package 'geometry_msgs' found
  
  
  CMake Error at /opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros/core/rosbuild/public.cmake:129 (message):
  (...)

It says it cannot find geometry_msgs, but if i do a "rospack find geometry_msgs", it returns the path to the geometry_msgs ROS package that only contains the msg-files. Shouldn't it return the patch to the python-files that are now in /opt/ros/fuerte/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/geometry_msgs/? Or am i missing something here?

After switching back to Electric it works find after a "make clean". I use a fresh shell for everything at the moment as recommended..

Okay, i found out something interesting. I had an overlay of common_msgs that somehow caused to fail using rosws. When i removed common_msgs using rosws remove, i could build the package again...
But adding an overlay of common_msgs reproduces the same error ( No package 'geometry_msgs' found ).
I'll open a new question for this issue...
