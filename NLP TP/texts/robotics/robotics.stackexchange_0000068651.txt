Q:

How to build a library on ROS?

I installed lsd_slam and ros-indigo. To use lsd_slam library, I downloaded source code and run rosmake lsd_slam.
I try to modify content of this library files. I add below line to 248th line in main_on_images.cpp under lsd_slam/lsd_slam_core/src. Then I run rosmake lsd_slam to build.
    printf("getCurrentPoseEstimate\n");

I run lsd_slam with dataset using below command :
rosrun lsd_slam_core dataset_slam _files:=<files> _hz:=<hz> _calib:=<calibration_file>

I don't see getCurrentPoseEstimate message. How can I build a library after modifying source code on ROS?

rosmake is enough. I don't delete this question to help other users.
