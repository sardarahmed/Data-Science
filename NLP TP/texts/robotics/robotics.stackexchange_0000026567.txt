Q:

Unable to install or run rospy

I've just installed the latest drcsim. From what I've read, a way to use python scripts is included in the ros package it comes with, rospy.
However, when I try to use rospy, the terminal does not recognize the command, when I searched for it with which rospy, nothing came up.
For some reason, rospy is not be included in the drcsim package, how do I go about installing it?

Hi, have you sourced the needed files?
you have to source the drcsim setup.sh
source /usr/share/drcsim/setup.sh in every terminal
if this does not source the ros files you might have to source them manually too.
source /opt/ros/fuerte/setup.bash
if you are using this frequently you should at the source command to your .bashrc files

Files were already sourced in the .bashrc files, this is not the issue.

A:

Issue has been resolved. Apparently, latest modifications has changed rospy to rospython, so I can use that to launch my script.
