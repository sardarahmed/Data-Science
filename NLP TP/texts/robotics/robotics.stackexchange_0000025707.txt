Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Two left feet?

In the drcsim-1.3.1 .dae files, it appears both feet have the same Y dimensions:
relative to 0 0 0 (the joint):
min   -0.0825   -0.0616   -0.0811
max   0.1794    0.0627    0.0105
So each foot is about 1cm wider to the left, relative to the joint.
Let me know if I have interpreted this incorrectly.
Chris
