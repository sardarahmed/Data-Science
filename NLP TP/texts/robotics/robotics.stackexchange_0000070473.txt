A:

This error is telling you that there isn't a file named exaple1_b.cpp in the src directory in the chapter2_tutorials package.
Does that file exist?
It looks like you're following a tutorial or working from a textbook; it would be helpful if you included a link to it in your question.

Please, in future, also provide a more meaningful question title and more information in your question. Not just the pure error message.
