Q:

Warning on advertise of std_mgs/Empty

Recently (maybe since some update...), whenever I advertise a topic of topic std_msgs/Empty I receive WARNING:

Advertising on topic [/topic_name]
with an empty message definition. Some
tools (e.g. rosbag) may not work
correctly.

Can I safely ignore it? Was does it mean? I often use std_msgs/Empty as kind of signal for nodes to perform long running calculations to update their state.

I have also just run into this problem, a recent update seems to have changed functionality.

I just opened an issue https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/issues/344

A:

The bug responsible for this warning has been fixed in gencpp. Please update your packages - ros-hydro-gencpp needs to be version 0.4.16 (or newer).
