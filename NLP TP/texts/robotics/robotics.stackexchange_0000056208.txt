Q:

robot_self_filter in hydro

I have a pointcloud from a laserscan and would like to filter out all points which belong to my robot itself. This could be done by the robot_self_filter, but as far as I know the whole arm_navigation stack which also includes this filter is deprecated since groovy. Is there any equivalent filter functionality in its successor MoveIt?
