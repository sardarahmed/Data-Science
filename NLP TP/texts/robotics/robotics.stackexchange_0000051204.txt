Q:

can't run catkin_make on ros-fuerte

I have installed ros-fuerte. The package 'ros-fuerte-catkin' is installed. But I cannot build my application using catkin_make:
source /opt/ros/fuerte/setup.bash
source /usr/share/drcsim/setup.sh
catkin_make: command not found

when I'm trying to install:
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-catkin

ros-fuerte-catkin is already the newest version.

I'm not familiar with catkin on Fuerte, but the wiki says:
Comment by Boris on 2013-05-17:
Note for ROS Fuerte Users: An experimental version of catkin was released with ROS Fuerte that is quite different from the version in Groovy. Those using ROS Fuerte should continue utilizing rosbuild.

So it may not has this functionality at all, i.e. catkin_make.

A:

If I recall correctly, Fuerte did not yet have catkin, therefore catkin_make does not work. Try rosmake, assuming you have rospackages.

Fuerte had an early version of catkin, but I don't think catkin_make was available.
