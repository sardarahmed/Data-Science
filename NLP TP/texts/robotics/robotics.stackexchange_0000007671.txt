Q:

Kinect VS Stereo cameras

As I'm advancing in my project I realized I need better hardware, particularly for video input and processing.
From an intuitive feeling sounds like stereo cameras offers a more powerful and flexible solution, on the other hand the Kinect looks like a great out-of-the-box solution for depth sensing and it also takes away a lot of computational complexity as it output directly the depth.
So I would like to know what are the upsides and downsides of the 2 solutions and if they have any well known limitation and/or field of application and why.
Thank you 

A:

Kinect:
Pro:

cheap
already calibrated
active system (works also on textureless surfaces)
dense stereo

Con:

defined range (low maximal range)
does not work good outdoors in direct sunlight

Stereo:
Pro:
- adjustable (different camera, different baseline possible for different ranges)

higher framerate possible
works outdoors

Cons:

hard to built right (cameras must not move at all)
higher computational load
no dense 3d (does rely on texture)
