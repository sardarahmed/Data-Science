Q:

How nanorobots are programmed?

I was thinking about the possible ways to program nanorobots, it can't be done with the regular tools.So I'm curious to know how professionals program nanobots?
Any complementary articles, extra readings are welcomed.

A:

For anyone having the same question, I have found the answer :

The development of programmable nanobot arch-types offers an
opportunity to consider tools for programming nanobot cocktails.
Inspired by modern software development environments, which separates
high-level programming languages from specific CPU details, we aim to
allow medical professionals to directly program treatments in Athelas,
a medication programming language.  the design of Athelas is
motivated by  the  success  of  rule-based  systems  at  capturing
expert  knowledge  [6,  7].   A  compiler  (Bilbo)  translates Athelas
programs to nanobot specifications, which implement the program.  The
compiler relies on a library of generic nanobot arch-types, and
specializes them to create the specific roles needed for the swarm.
