Q:

Stage SimulatingOneRobot tutorial - is there still a teleop_base package?

In the stage SimulatingOneRobot tutorial, it mentions to install teleop_base.  I couldn't find that package, does it still exist?
I managed to control the erratic robot via:
$ roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch

So it looks like the  stage SimulatingOneRobot tutorial should be updated to use this command, or whatever the most appropriate command for controlling the erratic robot.

A:

Possibly related answer. Substitution is suggested.
I also found that someone this on github.
I haven't tested neither of them but HTH.
