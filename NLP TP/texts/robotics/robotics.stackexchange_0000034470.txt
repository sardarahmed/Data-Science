Q:

get trouble in running roscore

I'm a beginner. I entered "roscore" in the terminal, but I couln't get response when entering other command.
The response I got after I entered "roscore" as follow.
llq@ubuntu:~$ roscore

A:

roscore blocks your current terminal...
You have to use another terminal for your commands.

Hi! Chrimo, thank you very much.  I'm new to the English website, so it took me several days to get used. Actually, I solved the problem a few days ago. But I didn't realise that I haven't submitted the question until this morning, just because I haven't logged in. I'm really please to join here.
