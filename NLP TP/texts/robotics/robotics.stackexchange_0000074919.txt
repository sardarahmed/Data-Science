Q:

What is meaning of Operator's topics?

What does the blue and the green line means in Rviz while using tutorial2 for autonomous not manually (joystick) ?
According to http://wiki.ros.org/nav2d/Tutorials/RobotOperator The blue line is  the input command. The input command /cmd has messeage content of (Velocity, Turn, and Mode), But /Operator/desired message is complete different !?

A:

These are just visualizations of the input and have the type: nav_msgs/GridCells. They show the trajectory the robot would follow given this command. In fact, only the turn is visualized, not the velocity and mode.

From /cmd topic, turn has only one parameter, but /Operator/desired shows x and y. Is it because operator node convert the value of turns into locations in x and y ?

Yes, the turn is the angle that the robot will turn around. So -1 is a left turn in place, 0 is a straight move and 1 a right turn in place.

Thanks a lot for all the help during my semester Sebastian :) My exam is over now and in future I will see if I can buy or make a robot, then can run with ROS then it will be fun to implement nav2d :D
