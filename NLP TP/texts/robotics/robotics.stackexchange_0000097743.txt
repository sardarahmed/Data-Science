Q:

How to navigate this track?

Given a track with no walls/boundaries what is the best way to navigate it? There are no color differences b/w what we can drive on and what we can't. Just a white line. What is the best ROS Package for this kind of navigation and are there any examples? We have a 2d lidar and a stereo camera if it helps
Track example:

Our track is bigger, wider and more one dimensional in routes but the challenge is the same

A:

Using a form of lane detection and following would help a lot to be able to maintain the robot on the path.
You can try playing around with the turtlebot autorace package, has a lot of interesting things and can help you learn!
You can try following this tutorial: https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/overview/
