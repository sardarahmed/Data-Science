Q:

How to walk path from footstep_planner with Nao?

Hey,
I'm just learning how to use Ros for a Nao. I followed the tutorial about how to get the footsteps planned but how is it possible to let the Nao walk this path ?
Is there any implementation within the humanoid_navigation or do I need to use the normal navigation stack to work with the published topics from the footstep_planner ?

It looks like you can use the nao_walker.py script from the nao_driver package just by sending humanoid_nav_msgs/StepTarget messages on the cmd_step topic.
@jbohren: Great, thank you...
But there are still some problems left: How do you convert the path (type: nav_msgs/Path publisher: footstep_manager/path) into the single steps (type: humanoid_nav_msgs/StepTarget subscriber: cmd_step) ?
And how does it work to really walk the path? Nao seems to be pretty inaccurate when it is about moving. How is it possible to compensate this? In the video it seems to be too accurate to be just calculated prior to the start...

You can see the footstep-based command interface in nao_walker.py here.
Once you verify that this works, you could help out the community by adding this functionality to the wiki page for nao_driver here.
