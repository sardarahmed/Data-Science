Q:

Does the roomba 564 has a gyro?

Hi,
I'm running the turtlebot, but not ont the iRobot, I'm useing a roomba 564. The thing is that when I try to calibrate it says all the time:
Still waiting for imu
Obviously there's nothing beeing published on the topics /imu/data or /imu/raw. I thinks this topics are related to the gyro. Is that correct?
I believe, as a conclusion of what I've exposed, that the roomba that I'm useing doesn't have a gyro. Can somebody confirm that? If that's true, how would you solve that?
Thanks.

A:

The gyro is part of the Turtlebot power board, not the roomba/create itself. You can find more details about the power board at turtlebot.com.

You can set the has_gyro parameter to false and then the calibration will run.
