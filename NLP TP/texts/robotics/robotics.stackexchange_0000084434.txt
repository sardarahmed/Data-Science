Q:

hector quadrotor - amcl navigation

Hi all!
I would like to implement the 2d navigation (fixed altitude)  of amcl (like turtlebot3, that I used a lot)
on a simulated quadrotor in Gazebo.
The map is known (already built).
How can I send 2d navigation goals to the quadrotor?
Any help?
Thanks

A:

Take a look at the navigation tutorials. If you get amcl working with your drone, then I can't imagine that it would be any different than how the tutorials describe.

Thank you!
I already tried some package from Wil Seby (https://github.com/wilselby/ROS_quadrotor_simulator) but I had some problem using it from 'high level'.
Do you think that build it from zero is a good idea?

What do you mean by "high level" and "build it from zero?"
