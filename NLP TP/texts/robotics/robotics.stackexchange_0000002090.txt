Q:

Wifi to pass through aluminium

I am about to make an rc car which uses a wifi connection. The body for the car would be made from aluminium and the wifi receiver will be placed inside this aluminium casing. 
How do I make sure that this will work?
Would I be forced to change my material or can I just make an extension for the receiver and make sure it is out of the casing? 
If so , would that really help me?

A:

You can use an external onmidirectional wifi antenna, like these on ebay.
If your wifi chip does not have a U-FL connector, you can use a SMA to U-FL adapter or directly a SMA Antenna.
