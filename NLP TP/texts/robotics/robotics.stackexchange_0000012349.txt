Q:

How to work with arduino softwareserial communication?

This is my first project using Bluetooth module HC-05. I am using two of these modules. One is connected to an Arduino Nano(slave) and another one is connected to an Arduino Uno(master). I have paired them through AT commands.
For testing, I was giving a pulse in pin 7 on the Nano. If there is a pulse, then slave will send character "1". If not, then it will send "0".
In the Uno there is an LED connected to pin 13. If the master receives '1', then the LED will on and if receives '0', the LED will remain off.
here is my source code ----------
slave code=>

master code=>

The Arduino IDE isn't showing any bug, but the code is not working at all. Although I am giving a pulse in pin 7 of the Nano, the LED is remaining off in the Uno. I am at a loss now. I have a lot to do after this and my project submission is knocking at the door. Please help me as soon as possible.

A:

I had connected some pins the wrong way.
I had connected the "EN" pin with 5V even after pairing. I was out of my brain. As soon as it came to my sight I disconnected the "EN" pin from 5V. After a few seconds it started to work....
