Q:

How to create a sensor from scratch

I would like to create a sensor package for a custom made sensor.
Is there any tutorial on how to create such a package?
The sensor is a ring of IR transmitter and receiver.

Do you want to know how to create a package (like coding the package) or how to add it to the ROS packages ?

I would like to create a sensor like these examples: http://wiki.ros.org/Sensors
After creating it, I would be implementing it on the robot that I have.

As I don't want to post a link for an answer, I will just put this here.
Tutorial for Custom Sensor Module Design

A:

The first page of Tutorial for Ros...
There is everything you need there...

Creating a ROS Package
Building  a ROS Package
Understanding ROS Topics

When you don't know something, try searching on the wiki first, there is a lot of information there.

What I meant in my question is the philosophy behind creating such a driver/package for the sensor. i.e. where do the authors start from? I have done the tutorials before.

Ups sorry I misunderstood your question...

This does not answer the question at all. THe Question clearly emphasizes sensor packages. Should not be marked as the correct answer
