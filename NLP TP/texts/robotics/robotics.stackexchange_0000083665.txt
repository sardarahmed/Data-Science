Q:

Pass known map to ROS navigation stack

Hi there, I've been using the ros navigation stack with the turtlebot, but right now it's doing SLAM and constructing the map as it goes, is there a way to pass a known map to the map_server? Any tips or examples on how to do so?

Yes.
See wiki/turtlebot_navigation/Tutorials - Autonomous Navigation of a Known Map with TurtleBot fi.
