Q:

What is an ideal way of debugging a segmentation fault in ROS?

Hi,
I generally use gdb to debug my run time errors in my C++ programs. But in ros as it spins n waits for the msgs in topics, the gdb doesn't really work well. So I want to know if there is another method to debug the ros codes when they run into segmentation faults.
Thanks,
Karthik

A:

You can launch nodes directly in gdb, here is some more info:
