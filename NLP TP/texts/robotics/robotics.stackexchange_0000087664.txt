Q:

Subscribe to actions on keyboard (press key)

Hi, 
I want to receive messages in ROS that tell me which key was pressed on a keyboard that is connected with the PC. I found several examples for other input devices and also some of them treated the keyboard but just with the up and down arrows. Could you tell me if there is a way to receive also messages when the other keys were pressed (like a letter)? Are there preinstalled nodes/programmes?
 
With best regards,
Rick

A:

You'll want to write:

a keyboard publisher node that publishes key-presses as strings

e.g. this one: https://github.com/ros-teleop/teleop_twist_keyboard/blob/master/teleop_twist_keyboard.py

a subscriber node that subscribes to the key-presses topic.

(or you could handle it all in one script, but this is a more elegant approach)
