Q:

ROS buildfarm CI fails with "UNSTABLE" status?

E.g. in this PR ROS buildfarm CI failed but I cannot find anything actually failed in its CI output, where the build result is unstable. While I understand that unstable is not ideal at all, I'm confused if it's still in releaseable condition or not. Particularly in the case of the same PR, ROS pre-release test passed (its result on Travis CI).

A:

If you go to the page of the unstable build (http://build.ros.org/job/Lpr__openni_camera__ubuntu_xenial_amd64/2/) you will find that it has compiler warnings. That make the job unstable which on Travis GitHub is interpreted as a failure. Since that didn't prevent to build the Debian packages the release builds still pass.

Thanks (I guess you meant the CI on ROS buildfarm, not Travis, since what failed is on buildfarm). A dumb question: should the CI fail for compiler warning like the case above?

No, warnings as well as falling tests only make the Jenkins jobs unstable.

Let me rephrase since I might have not been clear; Do you have any idea why GitHub shows red cross while Jenkins finished with unstable for the cited PR? Is that how the Jenkins' result supposed to be handled? This may be pure Jenkins-GitHub question but I'd appreciate if you could share insights.

I updated my answer. Yes, GitHub interprets an unstable Jenkins job as a failure.
