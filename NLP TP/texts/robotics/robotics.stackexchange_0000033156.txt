Q:

wge100 (Global Shutter Ethernet Camera) how can I buy them?

I see that the camera_drivers stack has support for Willow Garage's wge100 Global Shutter Ethernet Cameras that come on the PR2's arms. Does any one know which cameras are these (hardware-wise)? or How can one buy them?

A:

The wge100 cameras were developed at Willow for the PR2.  We do not sell them individually.

I'm sure they could turn into an individual product that Willow Garage could sell to poor people who cannot afford a PR2.
