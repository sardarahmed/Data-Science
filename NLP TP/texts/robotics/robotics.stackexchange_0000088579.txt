In addition to my comments in the referenced answer: The sphinx extensions should be usable without limitations, right? Means the non-default docstring styles (NumPy, Google) should be supported via napoleon. Autogeneration via sphinx-apidoc should be usable as well. Right?

Any documentation tool can be used without limitations in your package.
