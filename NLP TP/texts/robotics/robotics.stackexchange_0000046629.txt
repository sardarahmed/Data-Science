Q:

How to evaluate the performance of the pose estimation of Hector_Mapping

Hello
I would like to know how to evaluate the estimated pose of the hector mapping. Im using IMU and Laser range finder as a sensor package. So, is there any method to valid/evaluate the performance of the estimated pose by hector_mapping. How to know if the estimated pose is accurate?? Any explicit or implicit method of the evaluattion of the hector_mapping pose???
Thanks

A:

There are some approaches to evaluate SLAM algorithms.
The most basic measure is: Make a map an look at it.
There exist some quantitative methods:

Some can be found in the program of a SLAM evaluation workshop.

You can find some information for using relations as an evaluation measure.

The Robocup Rescue League uses mapping fiducials to see how good a map is.

Ok. Thanks. . Just a comment, IS there to find a documentation how the robot pose in Hector_mapping was obtained?? I used the pose of the hector _mapping to obtained other parameters like velocity, so would like to know more about iAlso to understand the relations of the sensor sources and the pose

My sensor package consist of IMU and laser range finder

Sure, they list the paper on the Wiki page.
