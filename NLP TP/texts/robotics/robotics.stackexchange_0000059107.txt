Q:

rospack depends1 error, rosdep version?

I am trying to install Hydro on Ubuntu 12.04. I follow the directions straight through, everything seems to install perfectly fine. I make my way through the tutorials until I make it to creating an ROS package. (I'd include the link to the tutorial here as the tutorial itself recommends, but I have insufficient karma to do so).
When I try to run the line " $ rospack depends1 beginner_tutorials "
It throws an error, telling me that my rosdep version needs to be at least 0.10.40. (Sorry I'm on a different computer right now...I will try to reproduce the full error message and post it here in an edit ASAP).
I check my rosdep version with " $ rosdep --version ", and it tells me that I have 0.10.27 installed.
First, I'm very confused: following the tutorials from installation all the way here lead me to install versions that are already out of date and can't work. Did I miss something? I spend the next few hours trying to install some kind of newer version of rosdep, but I think there is something majorly wrong with my python installations (I have a couple versions and I haven't tightly controlled PYTHONPATH, etc. -- I'm new to python and basically never use it).
So bottom line, 3 questions:

Did I miss something in the installation tutorial that would automatically install the proper rosdep version?

If not, can the tutorial change to address this issue somehow?

Can anyone recommend a tutorial on proper installation (and removing improper installation!) and PYTHONPATH setup for the python version that ROS Hydro needs?

EDIT 1: The full error message:
$ rospack depends1 beginner_tutorials
ImportError: No module named rosdep2.rospack
ImportError: No module named rosdep2.rospack
[rospack] Error: could not find python module 'rosdep2.rospack'. is rosdep up-to-date (at least 0.10.4)?

EDIT 2: I added to PYTHONPATH
PYTHONPATH=/opt/ros/hydro/lib/python2.7/dist-packages:/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/rosdep2
because I found rosdep2/rospack.py in that folder. Now I get a different error:
 $ rospack depends1 beginner_tutorials

EDIT 3
I tried searching for the EDIT 2 error message. This is a python problem that is described as "two pythons compiled with different numbers of bytes for unicode characters." Best explanation I've found: http:// stackoverflow.com/questions/16871799/trying-to-import-a-module-undefined-symbol-pyunicodeucs4-decodeutf8.
So I recompiled my python 2.7.6 with --enabled-unicode=ucs4 and the error has now changed to
ImportError: /usr/local/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload/_io.so: undefined symbol: _PyLong_AsInt

What options were the ROS modules compiled with? I apparently need to manually set up my python 2.7.6 with these options.

The latest rosdep version is 0.10.27. Can you please post your exact error message? I guess the error message just said "at least 0.10.4".

What instructions are you following? If you follow these instructions http://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Installation/Ubuntu line for line it should work fine.
For us to help you more. You need to provide a lot more details about what steps you are following.
Comment by mechanicalmanb on 2014-05-01:
Those are the exact instructions I used. Line by line.
Comment by tfoote on 2014-05-01:
You're doing things that are much too complicated. You must have state on the system which is not standard. I notice /usr/local in your tracebacks suggesting you've installed custom modules. Are there other modifications to the system?

I had installed python 2.7.6 and python 3.4 with default options before attempting to install ROS hydro. I agree with you, I think that there are some serious low level conflicts going on here that are beyond my skill. I installed Ubuntu 14.04 and installed ROS Indigo first, which works fine so far.

A:

I got the exact same error after installing Indigo on Ubuntu 14.04. All I have done so far is follow exactly the instructions for installing ROS Indigo and the first few pages of the tutorial.
$ rospack depends1 beginner_tutorials 
ImportError: No module named rosdep2.rospack
ImportError: No module named rosdep2.rospack
[rospack] Error: could not find python module 'rosdep2.rospack'. is rosdep up-to-date (at least 0.10.4)?

I ran rosdep --version and I have 0.10.30. I also ran rosdep update but to no avail. Any help would be appreciated.
EDIT: The only other program that had been installed on my Ubuntu distribution was the anaconda ipython distribution. This seemed to be what was causing the problem. I ran $ rm -rf ~/anaconda to remove it and now
$ rospack depends1 beginner_tutorials 
std_msgs
rospy
roscpp

is function. So the problem was that https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZX4ooRsWs.
