Q:

Don't understand how to parse URDF file

Hello all,
I am using Ubuntu 12.04 with ROS Indigo.
So I am following the URDF tutorial (Create your own urdf file) but after I create my .urdf file I don't understand how to parse it.
The file is located in

/home/<user_name>/ROS/catkin_ws/src/learning_urdf/urdf/robot.urdf

where:

catkin_ws -- my ROS workspace
learning_urdf -- a package I created
for this tutorial

the code in the robot.urdf is
<robot name="test_robot">
  <link name="link1" />
  <link name="link2" />
  <link name="link3" />
  <link name="link4" />

  <joint name="joint1" type="continuous">
    <parent link="link1"/>
    <child link="link2"/>
  </joint>

  <joint name="joint2" type="continuous">
    <parent link="link1"/>
    <child link="link3"/>
  </joint>

  <joint name="joint3" type="continuous">
    <parent link="link3"/>
    <child link="link4"/>
  </joint>
</robot>

and finally I run the command:
check_urdf robot.urdf

and get this error:
Error:   Error document empty.
         at line 72 in /build/buildd/urdfdom-0.2.10+dfsg/urdf_parser/src/model.cpp
ERROR: Model Parsing the xml failed

Looking more I found this but still not sure what to do. Do I need to run a command similar to this

rosrun xacro xacro.py rospack find pr2_description/robots/pr2.urdf.xacro
-o /tmp/pr2.urdf

Do I need to first convert it to a xarco or somthing?
Where does to urdf file need to be for the command to run?

A:

You can run check_urdf /home/<user_name>/ROS/catkin_ws/src/learning_urdf/urdf/robot.urdf to parse your file. Path of your urdf file should be supplied or you should be in the same directory before running check_urdf.
