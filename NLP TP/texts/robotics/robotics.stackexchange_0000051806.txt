Q:

XCode and ROS integration

I am trying to set up XCode to work with ROS. To do so I am following this tutorial
OSX tutorial
However, at the very beginning of this manual I am running into a problem.
When I execute this line
   roscreate-pkg --xcproj cocoa_tutorial roscpp std_msgs

I got this error
Usage: roscreate-pkg <package-name> [dependencies...]

roscreate-pkg: error: no such option: --xcproj

Any ides how to fix this? Or better how to integrate ROS and Xcode?

A:

The problem of integrating XCode and ROS is solved, however when I run the code I get asserts.
roscreate-pkg  is deprecated instead create a project with
catkin_create_pkg <package_name> [depend1] [depend2] [depend3]

This method works if you already have package that you want to develop in XCode. To integrate XCode and ROS firstly generate Makefile for your package
catkin_make --force-cmake -G"Unix Makefiles"

then follow this procedure
Porting Unix to Mac
finally,
In menu Product -> Scheme -> Edit Scheme 
select Run tab and specify path to your binary file 

UPDATE
An easier solution would be
generate Xcode project directly by `catkin_make -G"Xcode"`

then open Xcode from console by `open /Applications/Xcode.app your_project.xcodeproj`  

finally,   In menu Product -> Scheme -> Edit Scheme 
    select Run on the left, then select Info Tab at the top, and choose a binary fine in Executable.

I'm starting down the ROS + IDE road so thanks for this! I'm curious, what made you choose Xcode over something like Eclipse?
