Q:

Rosbridge server release for ROS 1

I recently detected that there was a bug in the rosbridge server package when closing sockets.
Library Version: ros1
ROS Version: noetic
Platform / OS: Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS
I saw that they fixed the bug  (https://github.com/RobotWebTools/rosbridge_suite/issues/721) and merged (https://github.com/RobotWebTools/rosbridge_suite/pull/722)
The current release candidate for the ros-noetic-rosbridge-server package is  0.11.13-1focal.20220107.015434
Is there any chance that these changes will be reflected in a new release?
Thank you!
