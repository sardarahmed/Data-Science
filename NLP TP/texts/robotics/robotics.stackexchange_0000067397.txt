Q:

sbpl_lattice_planner in ROS indigo

Hi all,
As far as I know, sbpl_lattice_planner has not been updated for ROS indigo. Are there any plans to update it for ROS indigo in the near future or should it be considered as deprecated?
Update: Both the versions of sbpl_lattice_planner mentioned in the answers are working but in both cases, I am having some problem in linking sbpl_lattice_planner with sbpl. I have installed sbpl using sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-sbpl. Then, when I run roslaunch sbpl_lattice_planner  move_base_sbpl_fake_localization_2.5cm.launch, stage opens up with the map but then I get the following error:
[ INFO] [1430936937.523934202, 1.100000000]: Name is SBPLLatticePlanner
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'SBPL_Exception*'
[move_base_node-3] process has died [pid 32285, exit code -6, cmd /home/namankumar/catkin_ws/devel/lib/move_base/move_base __name:=move_base_node __log:=/home/namankumar/.ros/log/beecc1ea-f41d-11e4-ade8-d4bed9838fa3/move_base_node-3.log].
log file: /home/namankumar/.ros/log/beecc1ea-f41d-11e4-ade8-d4bed9838fa3/move_base_node-3*.log

Does anyone have any idea about why is this happening?
Thanks in advance.

Thanks @Stefan! Your version is also working but I am having some problem with linking sbpl_lattice_planner with sbpl. I have updated my original question. Do you know why is that happening?
