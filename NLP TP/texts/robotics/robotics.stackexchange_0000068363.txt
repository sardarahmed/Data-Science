Q:

Can't creake a package on fuerte

I want to run this example.  To do, I should create a package. But I can't create the package on ros-fuerte.
There are two ways package build type named catkin and rosbuild. Which one I should?
I tried both of them. My fuerte workspace is under home folder. Using catkin;
fuerte_workspace$ catkin_create_pkg using_markers roscpp visualization_msgs
Created file using_markers/CMakeLists.txt
Created file using_markers/package.xml
Created folder using_markers/include/using_markers
Created folder using_markers/src
Successfully created files in /home/user/fuerte_workspace/using_markers. Please adjust the values in package.xml.

Next step is :
You should be able to build the code with:
 $ cd %TOP_DIR_YOUR_CATKIN_WORKSPACE%
 $ catkin_make

I don't have any catkin workspace(or I can't find it). So, I tried to create a workspace using this [guide].(http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace).  But catkin_init_workspace doesn't work. Error message is fuerte_workspace$ catkin_init_workspace command not found .
How can I create a package on fuerte?
EDIT
I tried rosbuild+fuerte. The guide says that
Before getting started, let's create a scratch package to called using_markers, somewhere in your package path:
roscreate-pkg using_markers roscpp visualization_msgs

I tried roscreate-pkg using_markers roscpp visualization_msgs command, and I got an error. Error mesaage is below :
fuerte_workspace$ roscreate-pkg using_markers roscpp visualization_msgs
Traceback (most recent call last):

A:

I guess this error now comes from missing python-setuptools. Try:
sudo apt-get install python-setuptools

Then, call roscreate-pkg again.
But I'm with cyborg-x1 on this: Don't use Fuerte anymore. If you are on 12.04 and cannot upgrade due to whatever reason, try to go to Hydro at least.

I tried this command, everything is up-to-date. 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 181 not upgraded.

I use lsd_slam, it tested only fuerte(ubuntu 12.04) and indigo(ubuntu 14.04).
Comment by mgruhler on 2015-06-30:
Well, I suggest you upgrade the 181 not upgraded packages anyway ;-)
But then I don't know what could be the problem.
maybe try:
sudo apt-get install python-pkg-resources python-setuptools --reinstall

You might also give pip a shot.
pip install -U setuptools --upgrade
Also, fuerte is EOL. Is there a particular reason you're sticking with Fuerte?
