Q:

Hector Navigation and Arduino

Greetings!
I am new to ROS and i am implementing hector_slam and hector_navigation.
So the hector_navigation hector_exploration_controller publishes a cmd_vel message.
In arduino how can i access this data. How do i subscribe to the message and extract the data?
Thank you for any help you may be able to provide.

A:

I made a very simple example of a 2WD robot with a Pi2 on it than can be controlled via ROS some time ago, see here: simple_2wd_robot.
On the ROS side, it listens to '/cmd_vel' here. The left and right motor commands are then computed on the ROS side and sent via rosserial_arduino. On the Arduino side, they are received and used here. This is a very simple implementation that runs open loop. For accurate control, you'd probably want encoders on your wheels.

Hey @Stefan Kohlbrecher my hector exploration controller is sending cmd_vel values in bursts and the arduino does not read all the values because the cmd_vel values come in so fast. Is there a way to change how the values are transmitted? Is it intended to be sent out in bursts?
