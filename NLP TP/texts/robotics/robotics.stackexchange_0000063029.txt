Q:

Question of controlling multiple ARDrones in tum_simulator

Hi guys,
I am currently working on the package of tum_simulator, I would like to spawn multiple ardrones in gazebo and control them seperately.
I managed to fix all the topics, tf and two ardrones were spawned correctly. And the first ardrone can take off, land and be controlled correctly. But when I tried to send a take-off command to the second ardrone, the first one just flew away. (The first ardrone's velocity along z axis just kept rising and the altitude of its navdata finally rise to 3000.)
Do you have any idea about how can I fix that problem? Thanks in advance!

I finally found out what's wrong. It was the problem with the base_links' body name. Each ArDrone seems to have the same base_link body name. But it strange that each Ardrone should belongs to different namespaces. But anyhow, just rewrite the urdf files and make sure every base_link name of each ArDrone is different, which should solve all the problem.

What version of ROS version were you using? I'm trying to create a similar setup for ROS Kinetic + Gazebo7
