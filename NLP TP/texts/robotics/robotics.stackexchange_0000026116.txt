Q:

Specify xacro properties in launch file

I am working on ros-fuerte-gazebo. I have a world in which I want to spawn doors to different rooms.
Is there a way to specify the values for <xacro:property> tags in launch file ? I want to use a single *.urdf.xacro file using different values for the same property. Is it possible ?
For eg.:
In door.urdf.xacro
<xacro:property name = room value = "workroom" />
<link name = "${room}_door">
....

I would like to specify the value "workroom" for the property room in the launch file so that I can use the same *.urdf.xacro file for all the rooms in my gazebo world (kitchen, bedroom etc..). I know I can use TinyXML but it will be easier and simpler if I can specify the properties in launch file. Or is there any other way out ?
Thanks!
PS: I know this is more a ros question than a gazebo question. I am posting here hoping some gazebo enthusiast would help me out.
