Q:

Mocking in ROS?

Hey,
I'm creating tests for my project and I was wondering, is there a mocking package in ROS? I was using gtest for the tests itself so I was expecting gmock, or googlemock, to be in ROS too but I couldn't find it.. Should I just use gmock as if it was a regular gtest, without ROS?
Thanks in advance.

That would be great to have in a ROS context.

there is a simple interface for mocking subscribers , service and aciton servers .

I need to mock something apart from subscribers, services and action servers.

Where can I find the sources of mock_objects?
