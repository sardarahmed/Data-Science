Q:

cob_bringup unrecognized as a package

I am running electric on ubuntu 10.4.  I installed ros-electric-care-o-bot according to the instructions.  Then, following the Caro-o-bot instructions for simulation, I attempt to "rosdep install cob_bringup".  I get the error below even though the cob_bringup stack is in my electric directory.
rosdep install cob_bringup
Warning: could not identify ['cob_bringup'] as a package
Usage: rosdep [options] <command> <args>

A:

I just downloaded and installed the Care-O-bot stack to test this problem. I was able to get the rosdep to work correctly with the following commands:
roscd cob_apps
rosdep install cob_bringup

Just a note, the rosdep for this stack only contains one dependency, and it appears that I already had it on my machine. If this turns out to be the case for you, don't panic if you see the "No packages to install" result.
I hope this helps.
