Q:

rviz on jetson tk1 board

Hello all! I am having a problem getting rviz to work in my jetson tk1. I am getting the following error when I roslaunch the .launch file that we use:
[rviz_desktop-2] process has died [pid 11126, exit code -7, cmd /opt/ros/indigo/lib/rqt_rviz/rqt_rviz -d /home/ubuntu/enterprise_ws/src/mst_control/vcg/Enterprise.rviz __name:=rviz_desktop __log:=/home/ubuntu/.ros/log/e81b465c-b94b-11e4-a101-00044b26fcd3/rviz_desktop-2.log].
log file: /home/ubuntu/.ros/log/e81b465c-b94b-11e4-a101-00044b26fcd3/rviz_desktop-2*.log
And of course, rviz doesn't work. I've already done the following and added to my ~.bash.src file:
unset GTK_IM_MODULE
I had to do that for rviz to work just by starting roscore and ros running rviz. I can rosrun rviz, but for our purposes, launching it from the launch file is troublesome. mst_control and Enterprise are our packages and names, fyi. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks so much!

A:

running rviz on the TK1 is not recommended. You should have a separate machine for running visualization.
This looks like rviz is segfaulting. There are few things you can try to isolate the problem:

Run your command by itself, instead of within a launch file. You'll get more descriptive error messages.
You're using rqt_rviz instead of rviz. Try running your config file with rviz
If both of those work, run rviz with the default config, and add the items from your config individually. If adding a particular display causes rviz to crash, then you know the problem is with that display.
