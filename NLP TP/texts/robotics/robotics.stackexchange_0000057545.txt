Q:

install() directly to /etc/udev/rules.d

Is there a policy on this? It's a problem if the same package in different rosdistros install the same file.
Options:

Install the file to a name like xyz-hydro.rules, so that there's no conflict.
Create a non-distro package which installs the rules, that the distro packages can depend on.
Don't install them; make it a manual step for the user to copy them from /opt/ros/hydro/share into the system location.
Install to share, but provide a postinst script to copy/link to udev/rules.d

What's the process to add a non-distro package to packages.ros.org? Thoughts?

I think the non-distro package is the cleanest, but I'm not sure how easy it will be to get it accepted into the ROS deb repository.

Not a policy afaik, but for "least system-wide infection" with "most ease of use", I like the way that kobuki_ftdi installs rules. Basically rosrun kobuki_ftdi create_udev_rules will use the correct copy command + sudo and do that.

@dornhege: That's what we've historically done (with Clearpath platforms). We're trying to get away from needing that manual rosrun install step, though.

In that case I'd also go for a non-distro package. Maybe ask at ros-release for something official?

Is there something official? Isn't creating another package for just one rule file a bit of an overkill?

A:

As of bloom 0.5.13, you can supply files in a "debian" folder in your package, and the various debhelpers, including dh_installudev will pick them up. You can see this in action in pointgrey_camera_driver:
https://github.com/ros-drivers/pointgrey_camera_driver/tree/master/pointgrey_camera_driver/debian
The appropriate rule gets installed by the debian package, using the proper udev machinery, but there's no pollution of the regular catkin install procedure.
