Q:

Error on testing Hokuo "UBG-04LX-F01" on hydro linux 12.04 by using this command "rosrun rviz rviz -d `rospack find hokuyo_node`/hokuyo_test.vcg"

when I print this command
rosrun rviz rviz -d `rospack find hokuyo_node`/hokuyo_test.vcg

in my terminal (Note: My distribution of ROS is hydro and my linux version is 12.04).
This error appear:
$ rosrun rviz rviz -d `rospack find hokuyo_node`/hokuyo_test.vcg
[ INFO] [1460147347.794917828]: rviz version 1.10.20
[ INFO] [1460147347.794991170]: compiled against OGRE version 1.7.4 (Cthugha)
ERROR: the config file '/opt/ros/hydro/share/hokuyo_node/hokuyo_test.vcg' is a .vcg file, which is the old rviz config format.
New config files have a .rviz extension and use YAML formatting.  The format changed
between Fuerte and Groovy.  There is not (yet) an automated conversion program.

I would be grateful if any one  help me to solve this problem as soon as possible
please send me the correct command
Best Regards

A:

As the error message says, the rviz config for doing that validation is out of date, and there doesn't appear to be an updated version available.
As an alternative, you can run and set up rviz manually:

run rviz with the rviz command
set the "Fixed Frame" to "/laser"
add a "LaserScan" Display
set the topic name to "/scan" in the LaserScan display.

In case, there is no the option "/laser" in Fixed Frame, open a terminal and type this : rosrun tf static_transform_publisher 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 map laser 100 before you will run rviz
