Q:

How should I let my "fluent" work well?

I made a "fluent" on the emacs.
  CPL> (make-fluent :name 'fl :value 1)
  #<FLUENT FL [1]>

It seems working well. But....
when I give the command like below
  CPL> (wait-for (< fl 20))

The error message appear as below.
  The variable FL is unbound.
  [Condition of type UNBOUND-VARIABLE]

How can I fix it? Thank you.

A:

While you created a fluent object you didn't bind it to a variable. Try:
(defvar fl (make-fluent :name 'fl :value 1))

Have a look at this tutorial for a more sophisticated example that uses fluents.
