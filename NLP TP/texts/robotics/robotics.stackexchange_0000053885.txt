Q:

apt cannot find ros package

Hi, I'm trying to setup ros on a Pandaboard, running Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.2.0-1412-omap4 armv7l).  After running apt-get update I cannot install anything about ros, because apt cannont find any package starting with ros:
vision@panda-vis-01:/etc/apt/sources.list.d$ sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-ros-comm
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-fuerte-ros-comm

Y've set the repository to universe and multiuniverse, but still the same problem. Please help me.

A:

Fuerte is not supported on Ubuntu Precise 12.04 http://wiki.ros.org/fuerte
You will need to use groovy or hydro.

In the link says: "ROS Fuerte Turtle is primarily targeted at the Ubuntu Lucid, Oneiric, and Precise releases [...]". Is that wrong?

Sorry I was too quick. You're right it is supported for precise. The issue you have is that you are running on armv7 there are only i386 and amd64 builds on the farm.
