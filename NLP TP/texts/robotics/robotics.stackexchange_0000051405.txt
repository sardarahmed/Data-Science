Q:

What is the difference between a topic and a message?

A very newbie question for sure, but I'm having a little trouble distinguishing between topics and messages. I understand that topics are the named "channels" published and subscribed by nodes and messages are the details of the data carried on the topics so they seem like pretty much the same thing. Can you ever have multiple message types sent across one topic? If not then why the distinction between the two?

A:

As you said, the topic is the channel where nodes are subscribed for to read messages or where the nodes publish those messages. The topic can be seen as a tag of certain type of data, and the message is the data itself, previously defined. Also, another reason for the difference between topic and message is that you can use two topics that share the same type of messages.
For Example:
Topics: Front_Laser_data, Rear_Laser_data
Message: int readings[]

Ah, it's the fact that different topics can share the same message type I was missing. Thanks.
