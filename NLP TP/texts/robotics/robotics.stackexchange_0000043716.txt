Q:

cv_bridge accuracy?

ROS passes around images in its own sensor_msgs/image message format.
But it is 8bit data.
So I wiil want to use images in conhunction with OpenCV.
CvBridge is a ROS library that provides an interface between ROS and OpenCV.
Maybe Using cv_bridge is 32bit data.
Dose from 8bit to 32bit make loss accuracy?

A:

ROS Image messages are not necessarily 8-bit data; the Image message supports a variety of encodings. (Note that the message uses an array of 8-bit values to store a binary blob; that doesn't mean it's 8-bit data.)
Unless you specifically tell it not to, cv_bridge will respect the type of the Image message it's operating on, and the resulting cv::Mat will match.
See the documentation on image_transport and cv_bridge for more.
