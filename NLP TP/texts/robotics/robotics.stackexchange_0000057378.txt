Q:

Is it possible to manually rotate point clouds in RViz?

I've been working with some Kinects in Rviz and recently found the ability to use static_transform_publisher to create the necessary transforms between pointclouds so that it will allow me to display multiple point clouds at once.  Since camera_pose_calibration doesn't work in Hydro, I'm going to try to align them manually as a first step.  However, I was wondering if there was a way to rotate/translate point clouds in Rviz itself that I may have missed.

Did you solve it?

A:

I don't think this functionality is there out of the box. It might be easily implemented with interactive markers as a small node providing a 6DoF marker that directly controls a tf transform. This seems like an obvious little tool, so maybe you are in luck and someone has hacked together such a utility already.
Edit: Another idea would be hijacking the joint_state_publisher [1] GUI by writing a small URDF file with a joint between your cameras (possible a floating joint, but I dont know how the joint_state_publisher GUI handles these. Use this in combination with robot_state_publisher to get the /tf transforms.
