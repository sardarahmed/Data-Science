Q:

Could not find Qt binding (looked for: 'pyqt', 'pyside') when rosrun

I install ros kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04, with python 2.7. rqt_graph shows properly, however, when I run rosrun rqt_gui rqt_gui and rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure. It shows the following message, my $PYTHONPATH is /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages:/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages.
ros-kinetic-python-qt-binding is already installed.

I am having a similar error, any solution???
Comment by siou12 on 2017-12-24:
I had almost the same problem, turns out that it was the miniconda installer path that I had to comment out in my .bashrc in order to solve the problem.
# added by Miniconda2 installer
#export PATH="/home/kostas/miniconda2/bin:$PATH"

hope it works for you too

A:

I had the same issue, when I ran rosrun rqt_graph rqt_graph , then it searches for QtCore in  the pyqt and pyside
modules. Actually I have already done: sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-rqt ,
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-rqt-common-plugins and
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-rqt-graph . So every dependency was already installed.
The problem was that anaconda was messing up with my path (as mentioned in the comments).
So I commented the export PATH="/home/usp/anaconda2/bin:$PATH" in my ~/.bashrc ,then close the terminal & reopen it. And everything was running smooth.
