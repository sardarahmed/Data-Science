Q:

Is there a book on gazebo?

Hi all,
I am working on a turtlebot with gazebo. However, I am looking for more documentation on gazebo with ros using turtlebots as the ground robots. So far, I have not gotten far to find good book on it. Please help.

A:

as far as I know, no such book exists. They will be mentions of gazebo in various ROS books, but no book solely on gazebo.

I see. What is the best way to learn Gazebo so one can incorporate it with ROS?

I think the best way to learn about Gazebo is following the tutorials, they're constantly updated.

In addition to tutorials there are two good books: 'ROS BY EXAMPLE' vol.2 (vol.1 is good for turtlebot, but without gazebo) and 'Mastering ROS for Robotics  Programming'
