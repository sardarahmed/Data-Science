Q:

spacenav_node tutorial help

Dear all
I tried to go through spacenav_node two basic tutorials. I was able to echo the 6DOF joystick on topic /spacenav/joy. The reading from the joystick is correct. However when I run the turtle sim, the turtle did not move at all. After double print out the rxgraph, I found turtle_teleop node is subscripting topic /joy[unknown type]. I guess it might be the bug.
So I tried to changed file .../spacenav_node/src/spacenav_node.cpp, make it published /joy topic instead.

ros::Publisher joy_pub = node_handle.advertisejoy::Joy("/joy", 2);

It does not help. node spacenav_node still publish /spacenav/joy. I am new to ROS. I guess there is some easy and right way to do this. Any hint or suggestion will be appreciated. thanks.

A:

Do not change the code. Use remapping instead.
e.g. start turtle_teleop with joy:=spacenav_joy.
You should read the documentation about topics and remapping to understand what's going on.
