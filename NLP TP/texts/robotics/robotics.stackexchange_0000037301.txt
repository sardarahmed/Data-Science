Q:

Graspit ROS - interface plugin

Hi,
I installed Graspit! for Diamondback from apt and it works fine. Now i would like to use the provided graspit_interface plugin. According to this post, there should be a graspit_interface node for starting the simulator with a containing ROS node but in my install the package only compiles a shared library libros_graspit_interface.so. Could somebody with some experience with this tool maybe elaborate a bit on how to start/use the plugin or maybe provide some lines of code illustrating how to interact with it from within a ROS node?
Thanks,
-Robert-

A:

In fact, above question was addressed in the comments of the answer to this post. When installing Graspit from debs, no launch file for the ROS interface is included opposed to an install from source which provides a file   graspit_simulator/trunk/graspit_interface/launch/ros_graspit_interface.launch. Alternatively the node can also be started via 'rosrun graspit graspit plugin:libros_graspit_interface' (assuming $GRASPIT_PLUGIN_DIR is set to the directory containing the library libros_graspit_interface.so).
