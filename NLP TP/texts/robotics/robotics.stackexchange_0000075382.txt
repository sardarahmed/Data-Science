Q:

Jackal robot PS4 remote cannot pair using bluetooth with the robot?

I just got a jackal robot with a PS4 remote. According to the instructions it should automatically pair with the jackal robot however the pairing doesnt happen.
However, when I connect the remote to the USB inside the robot it works. Almost seems like I need to reinitialize the remote. I tried following the commands:
sudo sixpair
sudo sixad --boot-yes
I get the following error: No controller found on USB busses. Please connect your joystick via USB.
Any advice?

Trying ds4drv-pair command. I get the following error:
Scanning for PS4 controller

I don't have a fix, I just wanted to say that I also just received a jackal and the same thing happened to me. I ended up using a different controller connected to my laptop.

Did you receive it with a PS3 or PS4 controller?

I received it with a PS4 controller

Ashwin, did you get a chance to try re-pairing it with ds4drv-pair?
Comment by tonybaltovski on 2016-07-24:
Airuno2L, did you also get a PS4 controller?
Comment by Airuno2L on 2016-07-25:
I got a PS4 controller but never got it working. Once I realized it wasn't working as described in the manual  I threw it in storage and grabbed a controller I'm more familiar with. The manual is incorrect else where also, like it said the robot's IP was 192.168.1.1 but it was actually 192.168.1.11

Airuno2L, you are correct there are many discrepancies in the clearpath manual, but clearpath also sent us a "From the desk of the Robotsmiths" document which helped clear alot of the confusion created by the default clearpath manual.  (Aside from the PS4 controller issue)

A:

Clearpath was able to assist me in solving this issue. Here are some of the things which could help solve your issue:
Firstly if you have sixad installed when you received your jackal then that needs to be removed using: sudo apt-get purge sixad
Unpair the controller: sudo bluez-test-device remove AC:FD:93:E2:C2:0A
Ensure that bluetooth is enabled: connmanctl enable bluetooth
Check to make sure bluetooth is enabled:    sudo service bluetooth status
If bluetooth is not enabled start the bluetooth: sudo service bluetooth start
Also make sure the bluetootd is executable: ls -la /usr/sbin/bluetoothd
If not make it executable: sudo chmod +x /usr/sbin/bluetoothd
Restart the bluetooth: sudo service bluetooth restart
Finally, press the PS and share button simultaneously so the controller bluetooth is enabled for pairing and type:
sudo ds4drv-pair
Hopefully that helps!!

Thanks for this. What do you mean by "search button" though?
Comment by Ashwin Mathur on 2016-07-29:
Apologies Airuno2L, i meant to say share button.
