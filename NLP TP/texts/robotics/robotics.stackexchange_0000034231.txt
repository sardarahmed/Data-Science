Q:

How to stop stageros from publishing its transforms?

How can I stop stageros from publishing its transforms and all of its published topics? Is there a simple remapping possible?

A:

stage's published topics (including tf) aren't in a namespace, so you can't remap them in them one go.  But you can remap them individually using the usual remapping arguments.
E.g., at the command-line (assuming one robot):
roscd stage     
./bin/stageros odom:=stage/odom base_scan:=stage/base_scan tf:=stage/tf world/willow-erratic.world

Out of curiosity, why do you want to remap stage's outputs?

I tried that, and found that /tf was still published in the global namespace.  That probably ought to be ticketed.

For a launchfile you can just set the namespace to stage once using the ns attribute.

Do I need to do something like :  and set tf_prefix ="old_transform" within the launch file? There's only 1 robot running.

My config files are meant to run on a physical robot and they publish all needed topics and transforms. To debug certain issues, I thought it a good idea to see how the same thing runs in simulation on stage. Hence I  need to quench out all topics published by stageros.
