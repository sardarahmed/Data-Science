Q:

Contents file missing in http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu?

I have had trouble finding ros packages since I use apt-file and I had not noticed that it did not use the ros repository. That is because the Content file is missing.
So can this be fixed? Where should I create an issue?
Or is there any other way to find in which ros deb a file is in?

A:

As described on the Ubuntu install page, released ROS packages are built to debs with the ROS distribution (ros-groovy-) and stack name for dry packages, or package name for wet packages.
For example, if you were interested in installing teleop_twist_keyboard for Groovy, you could visit the wiki, observe that it is a dry package inside of the brown_remotelab stack, and install the ros-groovy-brown-remotelab package.

Yes, for certain scenarios that works. But apt-file is a standard way to find stuff the should work. Why use a non-standard method when there exist a standard method?

We're using reprepro to generate the repository, and it doesn't generate the Contents file by default. Fixed.
