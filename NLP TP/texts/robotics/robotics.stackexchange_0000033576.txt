Q:

Moving Lego NXT's motor

I've been playing with ROS+Lego NXT and after successfully playing
with the sensors I got stuck trying to move one motor.
The only parameter I found on nxt_msgs related to that is
JointCommand, but JointCommand only has "effort".
So I tried:
rostopic pub /joint_command nxt_msgs/JointCommand '{name: 'motor', effort: 10}'
And confirmed that this value changed with:
rostopic echo joint_command
name: motor
effort: 10.0
But no movement. I also tried the nxt_teleop demo, but no matter the
arrow key I press, none of the motor move.
I also tried the steps described in this post, but had no success (http://answers.ros.org
/question/486/trouble-following-lego-nxt-tutorials)
Any ideas?
thanks

were you able to run the test on the installation page (http://www.ros.org/wiki/nxt/Installation)? or run the first tutorial (http://www.ros.org/wiki/nxt_ros/Tutorials/Getting%20started)

A:

Try using the command rxgraph when your system is running to see what is subscribing and publishing in order to better diagnose the problem.
nxt_teleop should publish to cmd_vel which publishes to base_controller which publishes to joint_command
There are 2 tutorials online for Teleoperation, I found the nxt_teleop (http://www.ros.org/wiki/nxt_teleop) works, and I have not had success with nxt_assisted_teleop.
So I run roscore, a robot.launch file (which reads robot.yaml for parameters), and then I launch teleop_keyboard.launch from the directory .../stacks/nxt_apps/nxt_teleop
and then use the arrow keys to drive the nxt.
