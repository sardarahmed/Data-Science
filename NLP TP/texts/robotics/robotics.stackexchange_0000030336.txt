Q:

is ros client c++ code thread safe?

Can I initialize and run the ros C++ client code in it's own thread?
I'm thinking of creating a thread, and in the thread initializing ROS, then having my main loop run there.
I can't see why not, but I thought I'd ask before venturing there.  If there is any general guidance on using threads and ros, that would be appreciated.

A:

roscpp is threadsafe.  There is a summary of the threading model in the roscpp overview on the Callbacks and Spinning page.
