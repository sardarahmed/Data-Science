Q:

Pointgrey Camera Driver Kinetic Ubuntu package unauthenticated

I'm running the ROS Kinetic docker container and using rosdep to install the Pointgrey Camera Driver package, but I'm getting this error:
WARNING: The following packages cannot be authenticated!
  ros-kinetic-pointgrey-camera-driver
E: There were unauthenticated packages and -y was used without --allow-unauthenticated
ERROR: the following rosdeps failed to install
  apt: command [apt-get install -y ros-kinetic-pointgrey-camera-driver] failed

I'm not a fan of --allow-unauthenticated.  Is this expected behavior?

I'm running the ROS Kinetic docker container [..]

how old is that image?
This could be #q325039 if the image is old enough.
A docker pull ros:kinetic would show whether there is a newer image.
Finally: it's not necessarily about that specific package. The error typically indicates there was some problem verifying files from that repository and you just happen to try and install that one.

I tried it on a fresh image.
dgooding@createbonfire:~$ docker pull ros:kinetic

When I do this from a super fresh official image, the driver package isn't even there.

Not sure why at this point, but it looks like that package is actually not available for Kinetic: status_page/ros_kinetic_default.html?q=pointgrey. Notice the red squares in the X64 and X32 columns.

A:

This doesn't appear to be a problem with keys or with unauthenticated packages, as the package just really isn't there.
The Pointgrey camera driver builds are broken:

ros-drivers/pointgrey_camera_driver#188
ros-drivers/pointgrey_camera_driver#113

Some users have been able to retrieve the .deb from the snapshot repository (ros-drivers/pointgrey_camera_driver#188#issuecomment-521527548). As it probably hasn't changed much over the years, that could be a short-term workaround.
It would perhaps be nice to help @mikepurvis fix the underlying problem.
