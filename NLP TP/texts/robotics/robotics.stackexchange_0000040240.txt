Hi,
P3AT can be used with the help of P2OS.
Kinect can be used with the help of openni_camera package.
I suggest you to try them individually and test the packages to have a feel of it.
Then you may have to setup the tf frames as indicated in this tutorial. So that you have a transformation between the robot and the kinect.
I hope this should be your starting point to get started with what you have in your question.
Hope it helps.
