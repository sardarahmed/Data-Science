Q:

Problem while launching Gazebo

whenever I "roslaunch gazebo_worlds empty_world.launch" the terminal freezes after displaying the following message
"Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
Insufficient GL support
[gazebo-2] process has died [pid 3093, exit code -11].
all processes on machine have died, roslaunch will exit
shutting down processing monitor...
... shutting down processing monitor complete
done
"
I think my laptop is working on onboard intel graphic card which is causing this problem. Although I have nvidia graphic card already installed I am not sure it is active. I don't know what the problem is.

A:

I recently figured out that my laptop has optimus Setup. In an attempt to solve this I tried installing bumblebee, which was the only online solution to this. but that also did not work.
Is there any other way?

Only a limited number of graphics cards are supported by the underlying rendering engine.  See http://answers.ros.org/question/210/gazebo-supported-graphics-card
