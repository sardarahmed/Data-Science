Q:

ROS Groovy and libavcodec-extra-53 compatibility

Hello everyone,
I want to install libavcodec-extra-53 instead of libavcodec53 (AFAIK the latter should include everything from the former plus some other codecs). However, when I try to do so it forces me to remove all my ROS installation. Is there any way to make ROS compatible with libavcodec-extra-53?
Thank you in advance

Thank you, at least now I know that it is possible :D

A:

There must be, because I have ROS groovy + libavcodec-extra-53 installed right now. Unfortunately, I don't know any surefire command that will resolve any conflicts. I usually hunt down the conflicts using aptitude and do a little uninstall-reinstall dance until everything's installed.
