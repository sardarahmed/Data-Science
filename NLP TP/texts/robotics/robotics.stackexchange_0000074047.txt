Q:

How do I append/add to a rosbag file without overwriting it in Python?

Basically I was testing recording data to a rosbag using a timestamp.
I noticed that every time I open and close the file it just rewrites the data, so I just leave the file open when the program starts and close it when it ends.  However if I want to write to that same file it just overwrites all of the data.
How can I just append/add onto the same bag file?

I use rosbag to open a new bag file in append mode and it throws an ROSBagException : empty file any inputs how to solve this ?

A:

I don't think the rosbag file format or the API supports appending to a file.
Instead, the rosbag API supports seamlessly opening and reading from multiple bag files, so if I have multiple logging sessions, I record one bag file during each and then open all of them together when I want to analyze the data.
