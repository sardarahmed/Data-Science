Q:

Subscribe to multiple topics simultaneously

Hi,
I implement a stair detection algorithmus for ROS. Therefore the node analyzes input data from an Asus Xtion camera via openni_launch. Can the node subscribe to both topics, /camera/depth/image and /camera/rgb/image, and receive both image frames to the same time?
Thanks in advance,
Max

Thanks, I used an ApproximateTimeSynchronizer (http://docs.ros.org/api/message_filters/html/python/#message_filters.ApproximateTimeSynchronizer)
