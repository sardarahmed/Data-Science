Q:

Fedora 15 / Electric / Build Issues / Gazebo

Hi all
I just installed an Electric desktop-full as per the instructions on an x86_64 Fedora 15 installation. ROS seems to have installed fine.
However, whenever I attempt a rosmake simulator_gazebo, or any other package that requires eigen as a dependency, I get the error
rosdep install ERROR:
failed to install eigen

I have eigen3-devel installed (eigen3-devel-3.0.0-2.fc15.noarch) and don't really have a clue how to go about this, as apparently eigen doesn't have any compiled libraries, only the headers.
Can anyone help? Thanks!
UPDATE: It seems that the warning is thrown only because it can't really find it by the name it's looking for. For example, after a little playing around, I could get vision_opencv working.
UPDATE 2 : Now after quite a few hours, I'm stuck at a cmake stage. Had to install yampl-cpp-devel, tinyxml-devel, vtk-devel, libyaml-devel, rosdep install for gazebo_tools, build assimp, copied the /usr/include/ffmpeg/* to /usr/include (to fix missing avformat.h), hdf5-devel, [added -ltinyxml flag to  /gazebo/build/CMakeCache.txt (and in gazebo_tools), added a VTK_DIR:FILEPATH=/usr/lib64/vtk-5.6 to pcl_ros/CMakeCache.txt ... Didnt work], used http://www.cmake.org/pipermail/cmake/2006-March/008633.html and changed VTK REQUIRED to VTK5 required in the cmake files. Also changed the path in the URL file to point to lib64/vtk-5.6
This fixed the missing VTK errors, but I'm repeatedly stuck with the tinyXML errors.
/usr/bin/ld: note: 'TiXmlElement::SetAttribute(std::basic_string<char,std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > const&, std::basic_string<char,    std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > const&)' is defined in DSO /usr/lib64/libtinyxml.so.0 so try adding it to the linker command line
/usr/lib64/libtinyxml.so.0: could not read symbols: Invalid operation

I also get a (possibly related because it involves pcl_ros_tf)
  [ 28%] Built target rosbuild_precompile
  Linking CXX shared library lib/libvision_reconfigure.so
  /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lpcl_ros_tf
  collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
  make[2]: *** [lib/libvision_reconfigure.so] Error 1
  make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/vision_reconfigure.dir/all] Error 2

Where do I add the -ltinyxml flag?
