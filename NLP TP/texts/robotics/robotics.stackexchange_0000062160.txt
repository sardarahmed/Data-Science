Q:

The detail of RGBDSLAMv2

Recently, I download a copy of RGBDSLAMv2 and successfully run on my computer, it is amazing. So I am have a lot interest in it and decide to analysis the code. It seeming not that easy even thought I download the paper "3D Mapping With an RGB-D Camera". So I ask for some help, some detail information or a tutorial, or how this code works and the architecture may help me a lot.
may thanks!
