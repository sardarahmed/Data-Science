Q:

can i make map in ROS using rqt?

I ask this question because rqt is implemented by QT framework and it is the combination of QT and ROS. QT supports to load map so i want to know if rqt supports such feature. if so i want to load map and track gps through rqt. is it possible? please help. . .

A:

There's rqt tool called rqt_marble, on which it's been a while since I've not been able to work. It only can currently publish GPS coordinates of the waypoints between 2 points calculated by KDE's Marble library. I have in mind to add subscribing and plotting GPS of multiple robots. Feature idea was discussed here.

Hi, i am also facing same problem  like here  http://answers.ros.org/question/57313/geo-referenced-mapping-interface-for-rosrviz/   may i know how you got solution at last? or any idea for me? please give your suggestions.   i want to load a map and track gps based on /GPSFix message from lidar. i need to get waypoints also . The main thing is everything should be done without internet connection.
up to my knowledge qt is able to load map online only. is it correct? if so what about rqt?
