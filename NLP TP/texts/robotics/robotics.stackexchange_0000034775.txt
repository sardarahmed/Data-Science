Q:

No /dev/ttyUSB0 with iRobot serial->usb cable

Hi,
Just trying to get started with the turtlebot bringup on an ASUS 1215N-PU27.  I am using an iRobot serial to usb converter cable to connect the Create, but I am not seeing any corresponding USB device (there is no /dev/ttyUSB0).
Running "roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch" eventually generates the following error(s),
[ERROR] [WallTime: 1318029892.652336] Failed to open port /dev/ttyUSB0.  Please make sure the Create cable is plugged into the computer. 

I don't recognize one of the entries in dmesg, or the lsusb listing as the usb cable/device, but I could certainly be wrong.
turtlebot@turtlebot-nb:~$ lsusb

turtlebot@turtlebot-nb:~$ 

My situation sounds like cant-access-turtlebot-through-ttyusb0 but I am not even getting that far.
Any help, or guidance would be much appreciated.
Thanks

Does /dev/ttyUSB0 even exist when the cable is plugged in?

Do you get an ouput to dmesg when you plug and unplug the cable?

A:

may be you should check cable?

It was the cable.  I ordered a "Pluggable USB to RS-232 DB9 Serial Adapter" and that works fine with an older Create DB9-Serial cable.

It may very well be the cable.  I just tried basic create command via realterm and that did not work either.
