Hello,
How can i install gscam for webcam images in ROS Hydro in ubuntu 12.04? I tried to install it using synaptic manager in ubuntu. But when i run "roscd gscam" in terminal, it says that no command found.

A:

No command founds suggests that you have not setup your ROS envionment and roscd cannot be found. Make sure that you have sourced the setup.bash which is appropriate.

Although roscd is unable to found gscam but gscam node starts working from the terminal. The problem i facing is that everytime, i have to set GSCAM_CONFIG="v4l2src device=/dev/video0 ! video/x-raw-rgb ! ffmpegcolorspace from terminal and then run rosrun gscam gscam. I have already kept that line in .bash but still its not working and i have to  write that first in terminal. How can i get rid of it...how can i start gscam from roslaunch?
