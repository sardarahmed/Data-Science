Q:

Why ros2 std_msgs/Header removes `seq`?

Hi,
I'm upgrading a ros1 package to ros2 and found that std_msgs/Header msg has changed.
in ros1: https://github.com/ros/std_msgs/blob/kinetic-devel/msg/Header.msg
# sequence ID: consecutively increasing ID 
uint32 seq

while in ros2: https://github.com/ros2/common_interfaces/blob/rolling/std_msgs/msg/Header.msg
seq is removed. Why?

A:

According to this document: "The field has been deprecated for a long time and was not set consistently in ROS 1."
In many cases the subscribers would ignore the sequence number, so it made sense to remove it to reduce overhead. Note that this header is shared across a large variety of messages, so removal does have an impact.
