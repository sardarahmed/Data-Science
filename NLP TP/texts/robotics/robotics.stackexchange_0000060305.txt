Q:

What is Warn and Error about Rotate recovery?

After planning, ROS outputs a warn and an error on a terminal.

[WARN] [1403639144.542396993]: Rotate recovery behavior started.
[ERROR] [1403639144.542945771]: Rotate recovery can't rotate in place because there is a potential collision. Cost: -1.00

What outputs these warning and error? I means which source file says error and warning? and What kind of problem happens on my plan?
Could anyone give me any clues? Thank you in advance?

A:

Yes, this in the rotate_recovery behavior inside the navigation stack. However, the actual cause of this is typically more complex. If your robot has an odd-shaped footprint, than that can be the cause. But if you are using a turtlebot, with a circular footprint and centered drive wheels, you should pretty much always be able to rotate in place -- unless localization drifts/jumps, thus putting you on top of an obstacle that was already in the cost map.

Thanks @fergs, I try to experiment a navigation with turtlebot2. As Turtlebot2 can rotate in place, you say that such a error doesn't arise without drift/jumps?

@fergs, I run into this situation quite often with my Kobuki when it is stopped in a hallway and needs to go to the next goal location.  I am using amcl and an existing map for localization and the DWA global planner.  Is there any way to force a rotation in place as a last resort recovery behavior?
