Q:

understanding source command and in tutorials

I have done all the beginner level tutorials of ROS successfully ,and I have some questions about the source command .
Please tell me if I am wrong in my sentences.

After each time I create the catkin workspace:  source  ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash  . But as I want to do this every time, then I did  echo "source  ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
After each time I create a catkin package following the tutorial: source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash. This is not necesary to do with >> ~/.bashrc
After each time I do catkin_make:  source ./devel/setup.bash

Am I wrong? Are there other cases for doing source? Is neccessary to do these every time?
Thanks in advance.

A:

sourcing a 'setup.bash' file, whether the base ROS one in /opt/ros/indigo, or the one in you workspace (devel/setup.bash), is only necessary once per terminal (instance of bash shell) that you open. This will load the ROS environment, giving you access to ros* and catkin* commands.
Therefore, if you add it to ~/.bashrc, you will only need to run source if you want to SWITCH workspaces.
