Q:

Husky simulator on Lunar: source code

Where can I find husky simulator package source code to compile it to Lunar distribution?
There are other questions about it, telling that we can compile from source, but they don't tell where the source code is and searching on Internet I haven't found it.

A:

Please see #q295677.
Summarising:

for released and indexed pkgs: go to wiki page (wiki/husky_simulator), click on Source link in the Package Summary section (typically top of the page)
alternatively: setup debian source repositories and use apt-get source
for everything else (ie: not released, no wiki page): search for the package name with Google and look for the source repository (typically hosted on Github)

Thanks but, what do I have to do to compile it?

Please see #q252478: it talks about Kinetic and 16.04, but the process is the same on Lunar. You obviously don't want to do the git clone .. step if you've already retrieved the sources using some other method.
