Q:

A global planner using a Roadmap graph

Is there a global planner in ROS1 that can deal with a predefined Roadmap graph to make the robot move on its edges.
I think this would be a very useful thing but can not find anything in that area.

Is a Roadmap graph a specific data structure?
Comment by ct2034 on 2019-02-26:
No. I mean just a generic geometric graph that is not a gridmap. For example from a 2D PRM etc.
It would be good to use something existing like a Boost Graphs, Networkx or GraphML.
And it would also be a good feature to get this graph via a topic (similar to the map topic, but a graph)

A:

To answer my own question. I made this here: https://github.com/ct2034/miriam/tree/master/roadmaps/odrm_global_planner
Currently, I am in the process of releasing/cleaning it up.
