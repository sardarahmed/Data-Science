Q:

Reset rqt_console config

After I accidentally dragged the top of the rqt_console, my rqt_console now only shows a blank window (just a window with a white background).  How can I reset the rqt_console configuration to restore normal behavior?

A:

You could see whether removing ~/.config/ros.org/rqt_gui.ini helps.
Be sure to make a backup of the file first. You may want to restore it.
