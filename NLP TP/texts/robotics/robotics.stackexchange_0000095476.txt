Q:

Camera view occluded by robot body, how to deal for SLAM?

On my mobile robot, I have a RGBD camera(zed) which even at the lowest resolution/fov setting, captures part of the robot body. When performing visual SLAM using RTabMap unfortunately the body is interpreted as part of the environment.
Be sides just cropping the camera stream, which adds latency I'd like to avoid, is there any other way to deal with this?

A:

One option is to pre-filter the camera data for robot parts based on your URDF model. Examples of packages that provide such functionality are

MoveIt's depth self filter, see  for instance here.
