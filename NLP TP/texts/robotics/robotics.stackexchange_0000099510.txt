Q:

How to convert a mesh or shape into an Octomap?

I want to convert 3D meshes into Octomaps, to obtain the swept volume of a robot trajectory.
The only conversion I found is binvox2bt, but this loads a mesh file directly into an octree, and does not allow transformation before conversion.
This issue seems to imply that there are no easy solutions. Does anyone have a good project or method to point to?

What is your mesh format ? , if its a format that Gazebo supports, you my spawn the mesh to a Gazebo world.
I have a gazebo plugin that can acquire octomap(optionally a pointcloud) of world. Though its only in ROS2; https://github.com/NMBURobotics/vox_nav/tree/foxy/vox_nav_utilities, if you are interested I can provide a more detailed answer.

A:

I looked through the code of gpu-voxels. It looks like they made some functions to convert URDF shapes to point clouds. The point clouds are then transformed and converted to octrees in their final positions.
The mesh format has to be .binvox, but the binvox2bt tool linked in the OP should be able to convert.
