Q:

vicon_bridge serviceClient FAIL!

Hi there,
I have written a simple serviceClient subscriber to Vicon_bridge services. Basically, I want to have a clent that retrieves the pose information from the vicon_bridge Service Server.
I have tried all I know but every time I run the code, the error condition returns as so:

[ INFO] [1448305105.714274705]: waitForService: Service [/vicon/Superchicko/headcore] has not been advertised, waiting...

even though the vicon_bridge node is clearly advertising since

rostopic echo /vicon_bridge/Superchicko/headCore

does show me the pose messages in another terminal.
I see on the roscpp documentation page that when subscribing to a ServiceServer within a class, the Service client should be constructed as follows:

ServiceClient ros::NodeHandle::serviceClient  (   const std::string &     service_name,
bool    persistent = false,
const M_string &    header_values = M_string()
)

The thing is when I try this, I get no calls either  from the vicon_bridge::viconGrabPose. Could anyone help me out?

A:

It's fixed. Code is available on my page.
The service server is advertised as "/vicon/grab_vicon_pose/" and not vicon/subject_name/segment_name.
My bad!
