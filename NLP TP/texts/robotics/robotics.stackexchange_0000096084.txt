Q:

Timestamp message ros2 - python

Hi. I`m trying to form the timestamp message in ROS2 (dashing) in python.
When I use
msg.header.stamp = node.get_clock().now()

I have the error:

The 'stamp' field must be a sub message of type 'Time'

Thanks in advance! :)

A:

Use to_msg() to convert from rclpy.time.Time to builtin_interfaces.msg.Time
  msg.header.stamp = node.get_clock().now().to_msg()

Link to Time.to_msg() in rclpy/time.py
