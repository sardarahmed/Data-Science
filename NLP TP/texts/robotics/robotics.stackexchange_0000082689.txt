Q:

connect to Arduino instead of Kobuki

This should be an easy question.
I want to run the kobuki software with a connection to Arduino instead of the Kobuki-base. To me it seems that it can be easily done by changing the Arduino serial port

/dev/ttyACM0

to the Kobuki serial port

/dev/kobuki

After trying everything I could think of, I still have no succes. I can create the /dev/kobuki port when the Arduino is connected - but it isn't connected so that reading and writing from that port gives the same results as reading and writing from the Arduino port. Am I overlooking a solution here?
Another easy option would be changing the software to connect to /dev/ttyACM0 instead of /dev/kobuki. However, I have no clue where in the code that part is happening, is there a specific file which handles this?

A:

I found out that changing the port in

kobuki/src/kobuki/kobuki_node/param/base.yaml

to /dev/ttyACM0 is sufficient in this case.
