Q:

ROS NetworkSetup

Hello, community.
I'm following ROS NetworkSetup tutorial and trying to connect Laptop to Desktop.
I succeed to connect Desktop from Laptop by ssh. but after that it asked me password.
I tried Laptop's password, Desktop's password and all other password I know but it doesn't work.
It said : Permission denied (publickey,password)
how do I solve this problem?

Did you setup your private and public ssh keys correctly? This looks like a networking problem that is not related to ROS but to your computers network setup generally...
