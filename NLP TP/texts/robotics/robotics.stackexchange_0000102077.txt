Q:

Difference between the gazebo plugins "ros_control" and "gazebo_ros_control"?

Any kind human is able to explain to me the difference between "ros_control" and "gazebo_ros_control" in simple words?
Many thanks.

A:

As far as I know, ros_control is for controlling the robots (simulated or real ones):

https://wiki.ros.org/ros_control,

gazebo_ros_control is one of the packages gazebo_ros_pkgs:

https://classic.gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_control

for adaptation of control to the simulated URDF robot using Gazebo plugins

Simulating a robot's controllers in
Gazebo can be accomplished using
ros_control and a simple Gazebo plugin
adapter. An overview of the
relationship between simulation,
hardware, controllers and
transmissions is shown below:
