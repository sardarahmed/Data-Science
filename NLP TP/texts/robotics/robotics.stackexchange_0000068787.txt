I'm also interested.

A:

For Rolling Spider, there are quite a few wrappers of the Parrot SDK available on Github : https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=rolling+spider&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults . There might be some compatible with ROS.

For th Jumping Sumo, I've been working on a prototype. The source code is available there : https://github.com/arnaud-ramey/rossumo . It is a work in progress and to be documented, but supports the video stream, the control (motion), and the animations.

Cheers !

Hi Arnaud ! I was wondering whether you had tested the use of rossumo on a jumping race drone, and if not, if you think that it would be compatible. Indeed, I was thinking of using it to test a few algorithms dedicated to obstacle perception. Cheers !

Hi Edoca,
Excellent question.
I don't own a Jumping Race so cannot really tell.
But two things make me confident about that:

the Jumping Race is the same as the Sumo, except for an increased speed and the ability to access that speed from the SDK ;

2) the Parrot SDK is supposed to be common for all minidrones.
So I encourage you to test it and share your conclusions :)
I am available for debugging / help - fill issues on the Github page.
Cheers!

Hi Arnaud ! I was wondering if your ROS package could be used along with microsoft Kinect? Was thinking of using it for gesture control of jumping sumo using ROS and kinect.

Hello, there shouldn't be any trouble using this package alongside with a kinect one, for instance openNi. As long as you comply with the topics names and types, it should work out of the box. Keep me updated in case of trouble.
