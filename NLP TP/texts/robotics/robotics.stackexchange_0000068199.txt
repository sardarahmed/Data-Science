Q:

Unable to kill rosnode running in background

I killed my_node using

rosnode kill my_node

When printing a list of nodes

rosnode list

my_node is not showing up the nodes, but it is running in the background and I confirmed it using the following command:

ps aux | grep my_node | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}'

This shows a list of my_node, because I started the my_node many times.

kill $(ps aux | grep my_node | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}')

Is not killing any of the nodes
I have tried, pkill as well without any luck. Only way to get out of this issue is to restart roscore
I would like to know if there is any other way to kill the node?

A:

It's quite likely that your node is stuck in an infinite loop somewhere or is never initializing ROS.
Usually, kill sends SIGINT, which can be caught by the process so that it can terminate gracefully. It sounds like your process is stuck somehow, and this signal is caught and ignored.
You can also tell kill to send the SIGKILL signal, which cannot be caught and causes your program to terminate immediately. You can tell kill to send the SIGKILL by name: kill -KILL or by number kill -9
Once you've cleared out any runaway processes, you should go through your code and try to understand why it's getting stuck; otherwise they'll just keep running away from you.
