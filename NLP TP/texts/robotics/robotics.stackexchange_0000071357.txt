Q:

Error when crawling with permissions problems

Hi all,
I have a ros package that I want to access via roscd using autocompletion. But, for some weird configuration of our lab, I don't have permissions to see the files of a directory, thought I can access to one folder.
Example,
I have my packages in:
/home/robot/rych/catking_ws/src

And I have no problem accessing or crawling there, but I don't have permissions in the folder:
/home/robot

So I get the error (warning actually):
Warning: error while crawling /home/robot: boost::filesystem::directory_iterator::construct: Permission denied: "/home/robot"

And this is really annoying, there is a way to disable this Warning?
Or even better, there is a way to tell ros to not crawl into this specific folder? (allowing to crawl inside the package folder only)
Edit: I add the content of CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH and ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH = /home/robot/rych/catkin_ws/devel:/home/robot/rych/PhaROS-ws/devel:/opt/ros/indigo

ROS_PACKAGE_PATH = /home/robot/rych/catkin_ws/src:/home/robot/rych/PhaROS-ws/src:/opt/ros/indigo/share:/opt/ros/indigo/stacks

What do you have your CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH and your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environment variables set to? You might be able to adjust those to control the package search crawing behavior.

I edited the question to show the content of both variables, can you see how to solve this with that information?

A:

The tab-completion for roscd eventually calls rospack; and that startup for rospack tries to query if the current directory is within a ROS package or not, by walking up from the current directory to /, looking for a package.xml.
It looks like this is a bug in rospack, and I don't see a good way to suppress it without modifying rospack. You should file an issue on the rospack issue tracker.
