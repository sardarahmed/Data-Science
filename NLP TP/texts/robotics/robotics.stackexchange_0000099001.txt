Have you been able to track down why you are getting this warning message?

Any solution?

A:

The warning message is due to a change in transform-handling behavior. In short, it used to be the case that a redundant transform (one with the same timestamp and frame_ids as a previously received transform) would be added to the transform cache alongside the original one. This was apparently not intended behavior, and as of noetic redundant transforms are ignored and a warning is printed (see this issue for more details).
You are definitely not the only one to encounter this, as evidenced by this discussion.
It's up to you whether to try to hunt down the source of the redundant transforms in your setup and fix it or to just ignore the warnings.
