Q:

how to get 32FC1 from realsense d435 depth topic

hi, I want to get sensor_msgs/Imagic from /camera/depth/image_rect_raw with 32FC1, I have changed the rs_rgbd.launch, set align_depth = false. There are some new topics of sw_registered, but on them the image_encodings is still 16UC1.So where is my fault?

A:

You can use the script given the ROS package available below. It converts the depth encoding 16UC1 to 32FC1.
