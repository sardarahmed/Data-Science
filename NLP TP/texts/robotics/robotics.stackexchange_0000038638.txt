Q:

how to visualize quadrangle in rviz

I am looking for a proper way to visualize quadrangles in rviz. The quadrangles are from a dynamically updated map representing a terrain environment.
The closest display type I can find in rviz is the 2d map, but it is limited to 2d flat ground while in my case the elevation of cells has to be considered; another close approach is to visualize the vertexes of quadrangle, but no color filling of the quadrangles can be achieved.
thanks for any advices

A:

The best way is probably to manually generate triangles for a visualization_msgs/Marker.
