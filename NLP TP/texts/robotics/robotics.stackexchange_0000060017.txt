Q:

Copying ROS packages from Virtual Nao to Actual Nao

Hello there,
I am following the tutorial (I can't publish links! The title is: "Installing ROS Indigo onto NAO with help of virtual-nao") from the ROS Wiki, which involves compiling ROS to a virtual Nao, before copying files to the real robot. I had some excellent help with a problem from yesterday, so was hoping someone might be able to help once again.
I am now at the stage of copying packages from the virtual Nao to the actual Nao. Packages such as rosversion, rospkg, lz4 etc. appear to have been copied across successfully. However, the package "Netifaces" is giving me problems now. I have attempted to copy multiple folders/packages called "netifaces" or "netifaces-0.10.4-py2.7-linux-i686.egg" into the following locations - all of which give me the same (or very similar) errors:
/home/nao/nao_ros_ws/install_isolated/lib/python2.7/site-packages
/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/
/home/nao/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages

It is worth mentioning these locations are where I have copied all of the other packages, unless suggested otherwise in the Wiki.
However, when attempting the following commands:
$ ssh nao@<Nao_IP>
$ source install_isolated/setup.bash
$ roslaunch nao_bringup nao.launch force_python:=true

the following error is displayed (there is no cut&paste from the VM - I have to type so please forgive spelling errors):
... logging to /home/nao/.ros/log/3c8e50e2-9959-11db-b7b2-0001c005b836/roslaunch

Once again, I am using VirtualBox Graphical User Interface Version 4.2.10_Ubuntu r84101.
The OpenNao image is "opennao-vm-2.0.1.54.ova"
Any help, please feel free to suggest something.
Thanks

A:

Hi,
Can you check your usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/easy-install.pth file and see if the line
./netifaces-0.10.4-py2.7-linux-i686.egg is present ?
Otherwise the location on your real nao should be /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ but you can also copy them into /home/nao/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages if your root is full. Just don't forget to modify the easy-install.pth file accordingly.
