Q:

pi-robot pkg for kinect - process has died error

Hi,
After installing openni_camera and pi-robot package (skeleton_markers and pi_tracker), I've been trying to run the skeleton tracking launch files, but always fails with the message like this:
[tracker_joint_controller-3] process has died [pid 23481, exit code 1, cmd /home/daikii/fuerte_workspace/pi-robot/pi_tracker/bin/tracker_joint_controller.py __name:=tracker_joint_controller __log:=/home/daikii/.ros/log/0bc93050-1ad4-11e2-80a6-001b63050e97/tracker_joint_controller-3.log].
log file: /home/daikii/.ros/log/0bc93050-1ad4-11e2-80a6-001b63050e97/tracker_joint_controller-3*.log
Can anyone specify what this message is trying to tell me? I tried modifying the launch files, checking directories, and etc, but I can't pinpoint the problem.
I am running ROS fuerte on Ubuntu 12.04.
Thank you so much for your help!

Hello,
I maintain the pi_tracker and skeleton_markers packages but they were written for ROS Electric.  However, I just now added some Fuerte-specific launch and RViz files.  To try it out, first do the following:
$ roscd skeleton_markers
$ svn update
$ rosmake --pre-clean skeleton_markers

$ roscd pi_tracker
$ svn update
$ rosmake --pre-clean pi_tracker

Then you should be able to launch the openni tracker and pi_tracker using the following:
$ roslaunch pi_tracker skeleton_fuerte.launch
$ roslaunch pi_tracker tracker.launch
$ rosrun rviz rviz -d `rospack find pi_tracker`/tracker_rviz_fuerte.vcg
