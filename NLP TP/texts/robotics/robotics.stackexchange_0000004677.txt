Q:

How to estimate yaw angle from tri-axis accelerometer and gyroscope

I would like to estimate the yaw angle from accelerometer and gyroscope data. For roll and pitch estimate I've used the following trigonometric equations:
roll  = atan2(Ax,Az)  * RAD_TO_DEG
pitch = atan2(Ay,Az)  * RAD_TO_DEG

and a simpified version of the Kalman Filter to consider also angular rates. The roll and pitch estimates are accurate (accelerometer values need to be filtered in presence of chassis vibrations).

In order to get the Yaw angle I'm using the following equation:
yaw = atan2(Ax,Ay)  * RAD_TO_DEG;

but the it doesn't work. Do you have any advice?

A:

Assuming your vehicle is roughly horizontal to the ground, you won't be able get a good estimate of yaw from the accelerometer. Consider the nominal case: when your accelerometer is pointing straight down (Ax=0, Ay=0, Az=g) the reading will never change as you change yaw angle. 
Normally, to get yaw angle vehicles use a magnometer (measure earth's magnetic field) or cameras and track the scene.

A:

Gyroscopes will only give you the rate of change of the yaw angle, not the absolute yaw angle.  
Unless you plan to set the yaw angle initially and have it drift further and further into garbage values (as you integrate the rate of change), you'll need another sensor to provide periodic updates on your actual yaw.  This could be a magnetometer (compass), or a GPS, or a pair of GPSes, or some other method of finding your heading, which would provide input to a correction algorithm (e.g. Sebastian Madgwick's filter).

A:

yaw can be measured by rate gyro and magnetometer not with accelerometer because accelerometer values depends on gravity component but on rotation in z axis only there is no change in gravity componets
