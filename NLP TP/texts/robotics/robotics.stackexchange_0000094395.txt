Q:

Having problems reading .STL file in 10-myfirst.urdf

I am very new to the urdf tutorials. I am trying to load an STL file using 01-myfirst.urdf.
De urdf file looks as follows:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<robot name="myfirst">
  <link name="base_link">
    <visual>
      <geometry>
        <mesh filename="package://urdf/Part1.stl"/>
      </geometry>
    </visual>
  </link>
</robot>

The file Part1.str is in the urdf folder within the package.
The command I am using in the root of the package:
~/moveit_ws/src/urdf_tutorial$ roslaunch urdf_tutorial display.launch model:=urdf/01-myfirst.urdf 

This is the message I am getting is:
[ERROR] [1579020199.142407500]: Could not load resource [package://urdf/Part1.stl]: Unable to open file "package://urdf/Part1.stl".

Part1.stl is an ascii file. On the suggestion on someone else's post I underst I needed to remove the SOLID statement in the file. But to me the system cannot find the Part1.stl file at all.
What am I doing wrong? All help will be appreciated
Regards
Nico

A:

You need to specify the package as well. The filename format is package://PACKAGENAME/PATHTOFILE, so in this case, I'm guessing it would be package://urdf_tutorial/urdf/Part1.stl
