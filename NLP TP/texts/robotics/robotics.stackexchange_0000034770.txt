Q:

How append a new plugin to Gazebo from a different package?

Hello All:
My name is Ivan,
I'm working on a project with ROS and Gazebo. but I have the following problem:
I have a package (wam_description) where is the file urdf the robot,
and in another package I created the plugin for gazebo (wam_gazebo), where I have a library and a small urdf where where ls declare variables for use in the plugin (and all, obviously, within the label )
My question is how I can tell the plugin Gazebo to use?, Before I had no problems and it was all in one package, but now we defragmented the packet and do not know how to solve the problem
Thanks for your time

A:

@DimitriProsser is right, but you need to use xacro for this to work. Your urdf file should look like this (let's say it's called wam_description/wam.urdf.xacro):
<robot
  xmlns:xacro="http://ros.org/wiki/xacro"
  name="wam">

  <include filename="$(find wam_gazebo)/urdf/your_file.urdf" />
</robot>

Now you can load the URDF file into the robot_description parameter using this launch file:
<launch>
    <param name="robot_description" command="$(find xacro)/xacro.py '$(find wam_description)/wam.urdf.xacro'" />
</launch>

That's right, I forgot that xacro is needed. Thanks for catching that error.
