Q:

deb http://packages.ros.rog/ros/ubuntu xenial main? typo?

I think that a typo exists in ros-latest.list on kinetic version.
http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu
$ sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.rog/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'  
$ cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list  
deb http://packages.ros.rog/ros/ubuntu xenial main

rog -> org, isn't it?
Actually I'm a starter, so I don't know where to notice that.
I Hope that it will fix.

A:

Yes, it should be org, but I'm wondering which page you are seeing this on. I just checked, and the page that has that text on it wiki/kinetic/Installation/Sources. As far as I can tell, it correctly has .org, not .rog:

Can you give a direct link or post a screenshot?

Oh, I'm so sorry for MY MIS-TYPING. This is caused by misunderstanding about the echo command. Thanks for your reply!
