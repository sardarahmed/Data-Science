A:

The extrinsic parameters for tf related to kinect position on the turtlebot are present in turtlebot_calibration.xacro file. I use ROS fuerte, in my system this file is present at /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/turtlebot/turtlebot_description/urdf/. Locate this file correspondingly for your system.
Using this file- x,y,z, yaw, pitch and roll of the kinect can be set.
