Q:

infrared sensor

Anyone can tell me the meanings of the fields of IrMsg.msg
(http://svn.code.sf.net/p/roscorobot/code/trunk/Electric/Corobot/corobot_msgs/msg/IrMsg.msg)?
float32 voltage1
float32 voltage2
float32 range1
float32 range2

Why there are two ranges and two voltages?

A:

I haven't written the message, so without any further information my guess is that there are two sensors.
voltage is probably provided as the mapping from voltage to range is usually not unique for IRs.
