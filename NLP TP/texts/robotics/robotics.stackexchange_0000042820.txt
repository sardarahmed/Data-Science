I checked out the package from svn and then compiled with the following error:
 cd build && cmake -Wdev -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=`rospack find rosbuild`/rostoolchain.cmake  ..

Could you please reformat your console output listing? If you prefix each line with '    ' (4 spaces) it wil preserve formatting, making it much easier to read. See also markdown/syntax/.

A:

I suspect you have not installed all the new Python scripts needed for compiling packages with Fuerte.
In particular, it looks like you are missing the new rosdep script.
