Q:

what IMUs work with ROS?

I'm investigating adding an IMU to my 3DOF robot platform to improve odometry through robot_pose_ekf
What IMUs are available that output sensor_msgs/Imu messages?
Here's what I found so far:

imu_drivers
microstrain_3dmgx2_imu
wiimote
imu_9drazor

What solution would work best for the least amount of money (taking into account I only have 3DOF on my robot)?
(for example, has anyone used Wiimote IMU data for robot_pose_ekf?)

A:

You can have a look here:
Sensors wiki and contribute those you found extra. We at KUL have the Xsens Mti package that we maintain.
