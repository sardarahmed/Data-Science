Q:

roscore fails in groovy

I've got Ubuntu 12.04 and ROS Fuerte installed and working correctly. I recently installed Groovy and I couldn't run it.
First of all, I source /opt/ros/groovy/setup.sh from a fresh terminal. Then I run roscore and this is the output:
$ roscore
WARNING: unable to configure logging. No log files will be generated
Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.
Press Ctrl-C to interrupt
Done checking log file disk usage. Usage is <1GB.

Traceback (most recent call last):

    p.start()

    f_roscore = get_roscore_filename()

    return os.path.join(r.get_path('roslaunch'), 'resources', 'roscore.xml')

    raise ResourceNotFound(name, ros_paths=self._ros_paths)
ResourceNotFound: roslaunch
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/groovy/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/opt/ros/groovy/share
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/groovy/stacks

If I look for roslaunch: $ rosversion roslaunch
Cannot locate [roslaunch]

and my installed version is ros-groovy-desktop-full, version 1.9.39-0precise-20121230.
Has anyone the same issue? Do you know how to solve it?

A:

Same question here:
http://answers.ros.org/question/47762/setting-up-ros-groovy-cant-launch-roscore/
Delete /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rospkg* it is outdated.
