Q:

Has anyone interfaced ROS with an Allen Bradley Compact Logix or Control Logix plc?

I am looking to interface ROS with an Allen Bradley PLC and I was curious if anyone has ever set up communications like this before?

A:

We have used the Epics library for communicating with AB PLCs.  It's not a ROS interface exactly, but it can easily allow a ROS node (or any C++ program) to communicate with the PLC.  The libraries typically communicate at a tag level with the PLC (similar to most other methods).
