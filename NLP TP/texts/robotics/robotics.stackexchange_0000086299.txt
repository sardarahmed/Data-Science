Q:

Customizing Turtlebot3 - OpenCR tweaks needed

We are trying to customize our TB3 by putting it on a different base, but with all the other parts unmodified. Different base means different spacing between the wheels. What is the easiest (?) way to tell OpenCR about this? We've tried rebuilding the OpenCR code with what looks like the appropriate include file modified.
More detail
We found what seemed to be the right include file, https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/OpenCR/blob/master/arduino/opencr_arduino/opencr/libraries/turtlebot3/examples/turtlebot3_burger/turtlebot3_core/turtlebot3_core_config.h#L59, and made the modification.
Result
We rebuilt the software but when loading it into the OpenCR things aren't working. In other words. When we load the new software onto the board, it doesn't appear to even come up. We are kind of feeling our way blindfolded.
Ask
Does anyone have a link to instructions or a case study where this was successfully done? Thanks!

Hi :)
You can set distance between wheel on source code (turtlebot3_core_config.h)
