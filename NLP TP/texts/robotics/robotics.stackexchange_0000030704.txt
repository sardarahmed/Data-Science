Q:

tod_training features.config.yaml options

The wiki page doesn't list the options for this yaml file. Where are these listed and read in? I'm having very mixed results.

A:

TOD is currently unsupported and is seeing a big overhaul. Once the API is stable we will release it again (we plan around July/August 2011).
I updated the wiki for the parameters we use internally so please trust that. Other features/descriptors are possible. For example, for SIFT you would use:
detector_type: SIFT
extractor_type: sequential
descriptor_type: SIFT
detector_params:
max_features: 2000.
min_features: 1000.
extractor_params:
octaves: 3.
