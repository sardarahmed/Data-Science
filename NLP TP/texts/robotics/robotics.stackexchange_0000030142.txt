Q:

How do I know when the PR2 switches from wireless to wired networking

When I plug in a network cable into the back of the PR2, who do I know it is actually using the wired network and not the wireless network?

A:

Network-switching is controlled by the utility "multi_interface_roam."  This utility produces useful information in the log file: "/var/log/roam/console-output.log"
To monitor it, run:
tail -f /var/log/roam/console-output.log
You will see a description of the 3 possible networking interfaces.  lan1 (the service port), wan0, or the ddwrt.  The active interface will show up in the far right column.
For example, if you are on wireless, you will see:

2011-03-07 16:38:33,918 - INFO -    bs@lan1   inf  Wired    0.000 100
2011-03-07 16:38:33,918 - INFO -       wan0  15.0  NoLink  -2.000  -2
2011-03-07 16:38:33,919 - INFO -      ddwrt   inf  Wired   56.976 100 active

Note: "ddwrt" shows up as a wired interface because it is wired from the computer to the ddwrt router
If you are on wired, you should see:

2011-03-07 17:01:35,952 - INFO -    bs@lan1   inf  Wired   0.000 100
2011-03-07 17:01:35,952 - INFO -       wan0   inf  Wired 100.000 100 active
2011-03-07 17:01:35,953 - INFO -      ddwrt   inf  Wired  99.990 100 #2

Perhaps this is something to add on the PR2 dashboard, as the connection influences the performance of the PR2.
