Q:

rosjava_core installation fails

Around one month ago, I installed rosjava_core following the steps presented at the rosjava installation guide (http://docs.rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/rosjava_core/html/installing.html) without signifcant problems in my desktop computer.
Today, I'm trying to do the same in a different computer (Ubuntu 12.04) but new errors appear. The promblem shows up when merging with remote repository:
rosws merge http://rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/.rosinstall

It seems that rosjava_core has been moved (you can check it at http://rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/README) to GitHub (https://github.com/rosjava/rosjava_core). After surfing this repository, I found a more updated documentation where it is written how to merge with the new remote url:
rosws merge https://raw.github.com/rosjava/rosjava_core/master/.rosinstall

However, I still get the same error when executing it:
ERROR in config: Unable to download URL [https://raw.github.com/rosjava/rosjava_core/master/.rosinstall]: HTTP Error 404: Not Found

and I can not install it.
What am I doing wrong? how can I solve the problem?

Did you solve your issue? I am stuck on the same step of the installation.

I've been able to install rosjava_core in a new machine in a "dirty" way: I copied the files downloaded in a different computer for a previous installation. Then I just followed the steps detailed in the installation guide. I had to install the gradle package in order to avoid a missing dependency.
