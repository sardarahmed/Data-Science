Q:

How to kill Roscore programatically

I am using Pharo to launch roscore, and thus I cannot simply CTRL+C in the terminal, because that shuts down pharo as well. Pharo allows me to send commands to the console.
How do I end the roscore process, then, with a command? $ ps aux | grep ros gives me a list, but I need to automate the Roscore killing (for test purposes, I have to invoce roscore, run several tests, and then shut it down automatically).
Thanks!

How do you actually start roscore? That is, I'd never heard of Pharo until your mention of it...if you can start a process, surely there's a way to halt it, right?

A:

I have never heard of Pharo, but if you can send commands to a console, you can just use a command to stop the roscore process. For example in Ubuntu, just send the command "killall roscore" and the master should shutdown. Just a quick and dirty solution.
