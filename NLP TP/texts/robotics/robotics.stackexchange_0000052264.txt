A:

According to REP-003 the supported target platforms for Groovy do not include Ubuntu 13.04 (Raring). Have you installed all the core ROS packages yourself from source? Then this might work if you install & compile octomap yourself, and all other dependencies of RGBD-Slam.
Otherwise you will have to try out ROS hydro (alpha version), or use an older version of Ubuntu.
