Q:

first lecture of AutowareAuto without point cloud and laser

In the first lecture of AutowareAuto, I tried to run 7 debugging commands in the ade environment according to the lecture notes.
But after I run the first 5 sentences, then  run: ros2 run point_cloud_filter_transform_nodes point_cloud_filter_transform_node_exe...
After that, point clouds still cannot appear on Rviz.
I see no error output, only after running the second sentence
rviz2 -d /home/${USER}/autowareclass2020/code/src/01_DevelopmentEnvironment/aw_class2020.rviz, some warnings are displayed as follows:
*QStandardPaths: XDG_RUNTIME_DIR not set, defaulting to '/tmp/runtime-gavinfang'
rviz2: Stereo is NOT SUPPORTED
rviz2: OpenGl version: 3.1 (GLSL 1.4)

Could you add autoware tag to the question please for others to easily find this question?

Thanks and already done

A:

A recent version of rviz2 on foxy had issues visualizing point clouds, you could try sudo apt update ; sudo apt dist-upgrade and rerun the command that opens up rviz2 ?
