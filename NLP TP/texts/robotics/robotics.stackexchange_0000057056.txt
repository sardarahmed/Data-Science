Q:

How to create a local map from global one

After runing a slam algorithm I receaved a big map and I dlike to make it smaller- I'd like to use only data that are in 3-5 m around. Is there possibility of deleting a node from octomap graph representing a too far point?

A:

There is a clear option. Not sure if you can easy clear with it as you can only specify two corner points.
~clear_bbx (octomap_msgs/BoundingBoxQuery)

Clears a region in the 3D occupancy map, setting all voxels in the region to "free"

Maby a stupid question but how can I use it in terminal?

Try it with tab completion, it will give the required format.

I think the  usage is like this:  rosrun octomap_server octomap_eraser_cli.py -x -y -z x y z
but still I can't use it- propably I have other problems with octomap (or rgbdslam). Anyway thanks for help. This is the function I was looking for.
