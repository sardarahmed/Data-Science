Q:

What is package textured_object_detection used for?

I wonder about the package textured_object_detection. It's description says it has a similar purpose to tod_detecting, though there has been much more activity on tod_detecting recently.

A:

this is an older version of tod_detecting. Yes, we are aware it is a mess. We are doing a lot of cleaning behind the scene and plan on releasing that in July/August.
For now, tod_training/detecting should be used.

Was this the package where the detection was textured, as opposed to the objects detected?

It is my recommendation that you should wait for the July/August release of object recognition.
