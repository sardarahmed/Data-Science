Q:

Is it possible to control the GUI camera with python to follow a model?

Using the current Gazebo GUI it is possible to focus the camera on any model using the "Move To" option. However, the camera doesn't "attach" to the model, i.e. the camera doesn't follow the model once it moves. Is there a way of calling "Move To" from python or calling some service that moves the camera so it will track the model automatically?

A:

This is on my todo list. There is a function within gazebo/rendering/UserCamera.hh to follow a model (look for TrackVisual function). I need to properly expose this function to the GUI.

Is there a way to set this from GUI by now?

You can right-click a model and choose "Follow"
