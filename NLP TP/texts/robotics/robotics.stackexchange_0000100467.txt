Q:

DDS for ROS 2 on Windows Setup

Hi~
I did not succeed in  building ROS2 on Win 10
But I followed the direction on ROS 2 on Windows Setup and got foxy "installed".
https://ms-iot.github.io/ROSOnWindows/GettingStarted/SetupRos2.htm
After the installation, I could run the turtlesim.
However, I find that I know little about the DDS: where it locates, what type (OpenDDS? RTI?), and how to use it within ROS.
Has anyone tried DDS on windows?
Thanks for your advice

About the link, I cannot see the proper Installation steps in this link. I would highly recommend having a look at the official Foxy steps.

Just have a look at the official link of DDS installation,
