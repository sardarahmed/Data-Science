Q:

Where is ROSJava code?

Could someone please point me to the location where I can download the ROSJava packages to use for Java development in Eclipse?
Could you also explain exactly what I need to download/build to be able to use it?
Unbelievable how difficult and time consuming it is to obtain and use this software. Instructions on getting this set up is pitiful!

A:

Get a local copy of the rosjava repository with this command:
hg clone https://code.google.com/p/rosjava/
