Q:

Android app not found on Market

I haven't been able to find ROS' android app in MARKET on my phone (Samsung Sidekick, Firmware: 2.2.1) by doing what's described in the wiki page above (As of now, Nov 15, '11) after searching by "Willow Garage" the result only shows so-called "Science Pro" app. Any tips?

A:

Scan the QR code at the page from your link: QR
Or go to the Android Market and send the applications to your phone. You will have to sign in but you will then be prompted on which device to send the application to.
Hope that helps.

@seth_g thanks. This navigates me to ROS app (However as @ben pointed out, my phone doesn't fulfill the requirement so I can't install the app for now...)
