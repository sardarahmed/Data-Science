Q:

ros1 zsh completion

Having no tab-completion for ros* commands (i.e. roslaunch, rosrun) after sourcing a setup.zsh file. The ros* commands are available to call; there's simply no aid in auto-completing pkg's name, launch file, arguments, etc.
Completion works within the bash shell after sourcing a setup.bash file.

A:

Do not have this in the .zshrc:

zstyle ':completion:*' use-compctl false

Make it true or do not specify at all (true is the default value).
After trying out a clean Oh-My-Zsh installation, I was surprised that the completion worked there. The problem lied within my own, custom .zshrc configuration. Apparently, having use-compctl set to false broke auto-completion just for the ros* commands and seemingly nothing else.
