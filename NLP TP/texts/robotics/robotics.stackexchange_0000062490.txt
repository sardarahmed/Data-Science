Q:

How to silence catkin_make output regarding EusLisp

Whenever I catkin_make I get all this unnecessary output like:
"set ARCHDIR to Linux64
use the location of executables to set EUSDIR
set EUSDIR to /opt/ros/hydro/share/euslisp/jskeus/eus"
after every single object is compiled.
How do I silence this?
Thanks
Arjun

A:

Not a complete answer but I suppose one or more packages in your %CATKIN_WS%/src refer to euslisp. So just to silence it you can temporarily move that package out of the src directory. You may determine this by grep etc.:
$ grep -r 'euslisp' %CATKIN_WS%/src
$ ack-grep -ai 'euslisp' %CATKIN_WS%/src

For a permanent solution, you might want to open a ticket at the issue trackers of the packages you evacuated in the process above.
