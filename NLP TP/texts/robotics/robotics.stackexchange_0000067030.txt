Q:

Append parameters to parameter server using YAML files

Hi,
Is there a way to avoid overwriting parameters when being loaded from a launchfile using a YAML file?
For example, I have two YAML files like the following:
config1.yaml
topics:
  - topic: topic1
    type: geometry_msgs/Twist
  - topic: topic2
    type: std_msgs/Empty

config2.yaml
topics:
  - topic: topic3
    type: geometry_msgs/Twist
  - topic: topic4
    type: std_msgs/Empty

and want to have the 4 topics loaded under the topics parameter.
I know that namespacing is the way it's normally done to separate parameters with the same name, but I'm looking for some other way.
Thanks!

Not as of yet. But there's a ticket for it!
