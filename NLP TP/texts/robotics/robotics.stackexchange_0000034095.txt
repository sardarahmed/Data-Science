Q:

Unable to launch turtlebot_dashboard

I am able to ssh into my turtlebot and run the start/stop services, but I can not bring up the turtlebot dashboard.
Input:
rosrun turtlebot_dashboard turtlebot_dashboard&
Output:
[rospack] couldn't find package [turtlebot_dashboard]
What is the problem? I feel like I may have inporperly installed the turtlebot ISO because I also had a software problem with the ssh section. I just installed the ssh server to get that to work. Is there something I need to install for the dashboard?

A:

The ISO doesn't include the dashboard (as it is a visual tool). Try:
sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-turtlebot-viz

(note, the ISO probably uses diamondback, if using something else, you can change "diamondback" to whichever distro you are using).

@ParkerGibbons typically we don't install visualization software on the robots that's why it's not in the ros-diamondback-turtlebot-robot  variant which is included in the ISO. Typically we use "workstation" computer to do visualization which is part of the ros-diamondback-turtlebot-desktop variant
