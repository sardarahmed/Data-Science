Q:

ROS 2 Docker humble release

Is there any date for the official release of the ROS 2 Humble docker images? I see the roadmap and the freeze dates but I cannot find when is going to be released the docker image.

A:

The Distributions Documentation lists the 23rd May 2022 as the release date for Humble.
Not sure if this includes the docker images, but the Release Checklist found on GitHub includes the (still unchecked) point Create new Docker images for Humble under Late development cycle.
I see that the checklist was updated 7 days ago, but I don't know if this really is an active document.
