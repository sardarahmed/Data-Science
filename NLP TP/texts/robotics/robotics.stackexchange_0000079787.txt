Q:

Is the Tag in Package.xml redundant?

Am learning :::ROS from here:
http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingPublisherSubscriber%28c%2B%2B%29
but is not 100% clear to me what is this in the package.xml file

find_package(catkin REQUIRED
COMPONENTS roscpp rospy std_msgs
genmsg)

I need to do REQUIRED and COMPONENTS, but hold on, is not a roscpp  required too?  what belowns to REQUIRED and what to COMPONENTS ???
Thanks!

Are you sure that roscpp is required? What if I wrote my entire ROS package in Python? Would roscpp still be required?

A:

The REQUIRED refers to the ROS build system catkin mentioned before the REQUIRED. I.e. build shall fail if catkin (For whatever reason is) Not found.
The COMPONENTS refers to the COMPONENTS  (catkin packages, hence ROS packages) that are needed to build your package because your package depends in Them. These package are listed after COMPONENTS.
