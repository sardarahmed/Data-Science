Q:

Setting calibration for openni Kinect - running into max value

I'm trying to calibrate my Kinect so that the RGB and depth data overlap.  I am running openni_launch and using dynamic_reconfigure_gui to tweak the values.
I have a good value for depth_ir_offset_x (-1.8) but the maximum value for depth_ir_offset_y (10) is insufficient.  It looks like depth_ir_offset_y=20 would be ideal, although I am limited to 10.
Any ideas on how to break this limit?
Also, should I submit this as a bug?
