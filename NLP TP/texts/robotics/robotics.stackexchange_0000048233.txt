Q:

stage doesn't display world maps

hello everyone
I'm trying to run some world maps in stage simulator.
Everything works when writing
rosrun roscd stageros willow-erratic.world

while, when using any other world file (already present in default folder or added to it from internet), I get errors like the following one:

    OpenGL Warning: No pincher, please call crStateSetCurrentPointers() in your SPU
 [Loading willow-four-erratics.world][Image "willow-full.pgm"]
err: Model type laser not found in model typetable (/tmp/buildd/ros-fuerte-stage-1.6.6/debian/ros-fuerte-stage/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/stage/build/stage/libstage/world.cc CreateModel)
err: Unknown model type laser in world file. (/tmp/buildd/ros-fuerte-stage-1.6.6/debian/ros-fuerte-stage/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/stage/build/stage/libstage/world.cc CreateModel)

Another error I encountered is

ubisum@ubisum:/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/stage/world$ rosrun stage stageros autolab.world
OpenGL Warning: No pincher, please call crStateSetCurrentPointers() in your SPU
 [Loading autolab.world][Include chatterbox.inc][Include irobot.inc][Include hokuyo.inc][Include map.inc][Image "bitmaps/autolab.png"]

    line=208

Rilevato trace/breakpoint (core dump creato)

Do you know which are the causes of these two errors and how to solve them?
thanks for support

A:

Seems like you're using old world files. As of Fuerte (Stage 4.1.1) lasers have been replaced by rangers in the new world file formats as described here. There are also other questions like this here on answers.ros.
