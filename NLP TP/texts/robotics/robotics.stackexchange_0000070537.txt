Q:

ImportError: No module named rospkg Reinstalled still not work

I installed the simulation environment of Nao Players in RobCup.
Everything is okay but cannot find Rospkg. I reinstalled with many methods but still not work. In fact, the pkg is there exactly and if I import rospkg in python client, the error occurs. I wonder if there is some problem about Python. Hope someone can help me. Thank you very much

How you are installing rospkg? sudo apt-get install python-rospkg or with sudo pip install -U rospkg?

A:

I found out the reason. Because i installed 'conda', the bad guy change the env path of python. The sys cannot access the package. I delete it and make the pkg work. Thank you very much. In fact, I meet a even sever problem now. I will post it tomorrow since it is too late now. Here is mid-night,hah

How can we fix it without removing conda?
I'm working on a project that needs it.
