Q:

Gazebo simulation time speed up

Hi everyone.
I have been trying to simulate two Turtlebot II on Gazebo.
I wonder if it is possible to perform simulations with time increased several times (pun). I'm not really concerned in visually observe the movements, but I want to run several times  the same simulation and store different measurements / data for statistical analysis of the project I'm working on.
Is this kind of high-speed simulation possible in Gazebo?

A:

Given that gazebo always performs real-time dynamics simulation, there are limits to the speed that can be achieved on commodity hardware. There are some options though:

Get a faster computer

Reduce dynamics simulation fidelity
(time step, solver iterations). Might
make simulation unstable though

Reduce scenario/robot complexity  (simple geometries, switch off/don't
use sensors you don't need)

If you only require a relatively abstract robot model, using Stage or the recently introduced STDR simulator instead might be another option.
