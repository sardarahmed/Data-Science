Q:

Bottom camera problem

Hi,
I use gazebo 2.2 with ROS package tum_simulator. This is a package with simulator of quadrotor AR Parrot Drone.
I had thought that bottom camera is not working and only front camera is OK, but I noticed that image from bottom camera don't display ground but sky. (strange)
Please check this screen: http://snag.gy/L5Riw.jpg
This is a world from Gazebo and two windows from rviz. Left image is a view from bottom camera :( and right image is a view from front camera. Black shape near window of the house is quadrotors' model.
Have you ever heard abut this problem? Any ideas?
I notice that when I run this node I got some errors, I hope that this is a reason of problems with camera.

A:

It was an issue with the orientation of the bottom camera on a urdf file (@green96 found the issue). You can look here for more information.
