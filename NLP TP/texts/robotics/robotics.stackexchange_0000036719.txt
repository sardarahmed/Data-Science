Q:

fingerdetection in MIT's mit-ros-pkg didn't run well

When I ran the finger_detection demo in MIT's mit-ros-pkg. It had no compiling error and ran OK and the prime sense viewer successfully tracked person's skeleton.
But the finger data didn't show in Rviz. The messages from /finger_norms topic didn't show the yellowing WARNING and are said to be received but the line segment which should have represent the finger direction didn't show on screen.
I rostopic echo the /finger_norms and get the following result.
What does it mean?

I am using ROS electric and UBUNTU 10.10.
Thanks.

A:

I found a probably useful and correct answer for my own question here.(Finger detection doesn't work well.)
In my case I edited the tol parameter, and it runs better now.
