Q:

Display a path using markers

I am trying to display the path followed by my differential drive base using rviz.
I tried doing the same by using a sphere type marker.
However, it changed the position with time.
Is there any way I can display the entire path using the coordinates from a tf frame with markers?

A:

You just need to give a different ns for each marker. I guess you use the following code to specify a marker:
visualization_msgs::Marker marker;
marker.type = visualization_msgs::Marker::SPHERE;
marker.header.stamp = ros::Time::now();
...
marker.ns = "markerName"

You need to change the "markerName", e.g. "marker0","marker1","marker2"...

It's probably better to change the id instead of the namespace. There are also specific path displays in rviz.
