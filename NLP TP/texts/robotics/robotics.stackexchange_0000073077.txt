Q:

Rosbag and timestamp received vs timestamp published

I can't find it anymore but I seem to recall reading somewhere that when you record a rosbag, the timestamp encoded to the message is the time at which the message was received by the rosbag record process instead of the time at which it was published.
If this is true, is there a way to force a rosbag to instead encode messages with the timestamp which were published with them?

If I may suggest: please re-open the question, post your edit as an answer and accept your own answer. That makes it a bit clearer that the question was actually answered - instead of just closed.

Answer accepted and question closed!

A:

It seems the premise of this question is partly incorrect.
Although rosbag does store the time at which a message is a received, the time stamps aren't stripped and replaced with a new one but rather the entire stamped image is recorded (along with the publishing time stamp) as a sensor_msgs/Image which still contains the original Header.

Hi, I still don't understand your answer. Did you mean that the timestamp of the message is the timestamp when the entire message is recorded? Is the timestamp recorded in the bag different from the original message timestamp?
