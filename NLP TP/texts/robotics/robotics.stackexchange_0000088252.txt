Q:

Hi, I am editing a ros wiki page for my package. I wish to add mathematical equations in that but unable to do so

I tried using the markdown language tool as discusses http://csrgxtu.github.io/2015/03/20/Writing-Mathematic-Fomulars-in-Markdown/, but failed :(

A:

The ROS wiki uses MoinMoin, not Markdown, so the page you link to isn't relevant.
You can check wiki/HelpOnEditing and wiki/HelpOnMoinWikiSyntax to see what is supported.
Beyond that, I'm afraid you're going to have to resort to 'tricks' (ie: including images with your equations rendered (by something else) or embedding an html snippet that uses some service to render the equations).
