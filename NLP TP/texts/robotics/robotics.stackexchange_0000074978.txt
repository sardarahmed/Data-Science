A:

Your IMU publishes it's data with the frame_id set to fcu. There appears to be no connection to that frame in your current tf tree, however. You'll probably want to add the fcu frame to your robot URDF or run a static_transform_publisher to publish the transform (see for instance here: http://answers.ros.org/question/82931/failed-to-rosrun-static-tf-publisher/).
