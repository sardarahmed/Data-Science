Cameras Services documentation missing?

HI,
Are photo/SetConfig , photo/GetConfig and photo/Capture
at http://wiki.ros.org/Sensors/Cameras#Services still valid with kinetic and on?
Or are the links just broken?
Any pointers appreaciated.
Thanks, -Ville

A:

In a way, yes. The documentation for those services can actually be found here.
However, following the various links leads me to wiki.ros.org/photo, part of (what was then still called) the bosch_drivers stack.
I'm not sure how generic those services are, and if they were ever used by nodes other than photo_node. The wiki doesn't show any users of the package (no Used By), and photo itself does not seem to have been maintained/released since Groovy.
If you're interested because of photo/Capture: polled topics were never really implemented (REP 106), but there is the polled_camera package.
As for the GetConfig and SetConfig services: I guess most drivers migrated to dynamic_reconfigure or implemented their own custom service API.
