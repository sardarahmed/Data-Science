Q:

base_link to laser frame

Hi,
I'm trying to use gmapping, RVIZ, etc. I wrote a urdf file to describe my robot.
I have a problem with transform. I have to provide a base_link to laser_frame transform.
Should I write this transform or does it already exist in hokuyo node ?
If I have to write if, do I need to transform every points of the laser scan ?
Thanks

A:

The transform should be in your URDF file. You should have a link base_link that is your base and a hokuyo link that is the laser_frame.
You use a robot state publisher that will send out these transforms automatically from the URDF.

I wrote a tf_broadcaster to send transform between base_link and laser and also tried tf's static_transform_publisher. Is this okay?
Because when I launch rviz, I cannot visualize the laser scan with base_footprint or base_link as the fixed frame although tf view_frames shows everything correctly.
