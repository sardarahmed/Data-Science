Do you want gmapping to use pitch/roll or do you want to get pitch/roll estimates out of gmapping. In either case: gmapping is set up  to be a 2D algorithm.

I use gmapping to create 2D map.But the ground is not flat.So I think maybe I need to publish roll and pitch and I want gmapping to use the data.I am confused about whether I should use a node to publish roll/pitch in some format like message or I only need to add pitch/roll to TF frames.

In other word, how can I let the gmapping know that there is roll/pitch data to use?Thank dornhege for your attention.Would you give me some advices?

A:

gmapping itself can't make use of roll/pitch for pose estimation. What you can do however as a minimum is encode this information implicitly in the tf that you provide for odom->laser. Gmapping will transform laser messages to the odom frame.
