Q:

Best 3D object recognition package

Hi,
I came across few object detection/recognition packages in ros

tabletop_objects
steder11icra
roboearth
find_object

I find some of them are built on cturtle and when i try to checkout these packages they accompany with lot of other packages of cturtle along with them. I have ros-electric and would like to recognize some objects like laptop, bottle and books etc using 3D pointclouds from Kinect. So can someone suggest the best package that is stable and working.
Thanks,
Karthik

hey we are also working on object detection/identification using 3D pointclouds from kinect. so can you suggest the best package/database for this purpose..?  thank!

As of now i am using PCL and writing a simple package myself to recognize object. You may check the documentation of PCL and its tutorials for the same.

hi, it's that any suggestion or recommendation for me to lean how to detect the a object? and I'm more comfortable with python......so any suggestion for me? thank you so much.

A:

The current tabletop detector works well for well-separated, rotationally-symmetric objects on a flat surface such as a table.  It won't work for laptops and books unless they're in exactly the same orientation as in the database (tabletop detection is only doing 2D ICP).
TOD works well for highly textured objects (from views in which the texture is actually visible and not just a tiny patch of fuzzy pixels that humans can't even make out), but I wouldn't say that it's quite stable yet.  Should be available and stable for Fuerte Turtle.
Can't say about the others, I haven't tried them.

TOD seems to be there only in diamondback. Am i missing something here.
Comment by hsiao on 2012-01-09:
tabletop detector works with either Kinect or narrow stereo; TOD requires Kinect.

Does it work with Kinect as the sensor?
