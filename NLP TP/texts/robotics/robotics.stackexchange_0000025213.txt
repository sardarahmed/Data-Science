Q:

How to build a python node as a component?

I have a python node that I would like to add to a composable node container.
I could not find any documentation on the python equivalent to the rclcpp_components_register_node cmake command. I would assume that I would need to adjust the python code of the node as well as the setup.py file.
Naively, I have just tried to add the executable in the ComposableNode():
ComposableNode(
    package="foo",
    plugin="foo_node",
    name="foo",
),

but got the following error when launching:
[ERROR] [bar.container]: Could not find requested resource in ament index
[ERROR] [launch_ros.actions.load_composable_nodes]: Failed to load node 'foo_node' of type 'foo_node' in container '/bar/container': Could not find requested resource in ament index

It would be great if you could help me figure this out.
Thanks.

As of ROS 2 Iron Irwinin the features status mentions that the composition of node components at compile, link, load, or run time is currently only in C++.
