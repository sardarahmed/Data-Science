Q:

pocketsphinx excessively verbose

Now that I have pocketsphinx running well, I am launching it with a number of other nodes.  The basic pocketsphinx program prints many "INFO:" statements as it processes the voice input.  This makes any messages printed by my other nodes unusable since they scroll off the screen rapidly.
Not using "output="screen" when recognizer.py is launched only stops the messages from recognizer.py, not from pocketsphinx.
Can anyone tell me how to stop these messages?
Thanks,
Alex

A:

Try playing with the logfn parameter:
E.g. from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17825820/how-do-i-turn-off-e-info-in-pocketsphinx:
pocketsphinx_continuous -logfn /dev/null

Or write to file:
pocketsphinx_continuous -logfn [file]

In python (what ros pocketsphinx is using), from https://mattze96.safe-ws.de/blog/?p=640:
self.asr.set_property('logfn', '/dev/null')

This worked.. For windows Users, use pocketsphinx_continuous -logfn NUL
