Q:

compatibility between NAOqi and ROS

Hi there,
I am very new to the topic NAO and ROS. This is for my thesis at university. I wanna develop a few short programs in ROS but I am not sure if it is compatible with NAOqi. So my only question is: Can i install ROS on my NAO without any problems to also use NAOqi? I wanna use ROS because there exist a connection module (iot_bridge) to interact with NAO and a smarthome framework.
thanks for help
Ralf

A:

The simplest way is to keep NAOqi on your robot and install ros on your laptop/desktop computer. There is a ROS package to control NAO and it provides everything you would need.
