Q:

openni doesn't find kinect

Hi,
I am running Ubuntu 12.10 and ROS Groovy.
lsusb shows the kinect:
Bus 002 Device 019: ID 045e:02ad Microsoft Corp. Xbox NUI Audio
Bus 002 Device 018: ID 045e:02b0 Microsoft Corp. Xbox NUI Motor
Bus 002 Device 020: ID 045e:02ae Microsoft Corp. Xbox NUI Camera

But when I run roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch, it doesn't find the kinect.
[ INFO] [1357079636.178559036]: No devices connected.... waiting for devices to be connected
[ INFO] [1357079639.179093142]: No devices connected.... waiting for devices to be connected

A week ago, after installing the updated openni package, everything worked and now I get the same "no devices connected" message even though I tried connecting it in different usb ports etc. Is this a bug or is my camera somehow broken?
Regards,
Oier

Well, after trying everything from manually putting the devices id on the launcher file, to remove gspca_kinect (which wasn't loaded), I had the brilliant idea of reinstalling all the openni ros packages via synaptic, now it works :-)

I'm having similar issues and tried re-installing all the openni packages via synaptic, but when I went to re-install them it appears there are only 32bit version available at the moment. Did you have this problem? I'll try again tomorrow but it appears there is a debian issue.

What version of Ubuntu are you using? I have 12.10 and the openni packages installed are 64 bits architecture.

I'm on 12.04. The packages are available again - not sure if it was my computer or the servers.

I updated on electric (ros-electric-openni-kinect (0.3.4-s1336532617~lucid => 0.3.6-s1356576176~lucid)) and it broke everything. I got the "No Device Connected" error, I reinstalled and it fixed it.
