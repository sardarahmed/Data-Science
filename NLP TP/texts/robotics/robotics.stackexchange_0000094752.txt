Q:

Does anyone know where i can find source code of turtlesim package?

I want to understand how this simple simulator works. I can't find any good explanation. For example, in ros_tuturials they say:

run roscore
rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node
rosrun turtlesim turtle_teleop_key

But how it's connected? how it works? (I know there topics,master, etc.).
and what about measure of speed? speed unit = ? (metres per second) . Is there a motor(simulation of it) or it's just moving on the screen from one point to another point?
A lot of questions...
Any ideas, guys?

A:

As with just about every released package, the wiki would be a good first stop to try to find information. In this case: wiki/turtlesim.
Under the Package Summary heading, we find the link to the Source repository: ros/ros_tutorials.
In there, we navigate to the turtlesim directory, which contains all sources for the package.

And see #q320046 for a related Q&A which goes into a bit more detail (but discusses the general case).
