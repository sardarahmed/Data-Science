Q:

Shutdown request received

hi,I am using laser assembler package for 2D pointCloud to 3D point-cloud conversion. First I am start launch file (laser.launch), then followed by I'll run cpp file, when I run .cpp file  suddenly the roslaunch(master) file will be shutdown, the error is
[ WARN] [1375768306.726458068]: Shutdown request received.
[ WARN] [1375768306.726502466]: Reason given for shutdown: [new node registered with same name]

launch file is
<launch>
    <node pkg="laser_assembler" type="laser_scan_assembler" output="screen"  name="laser_scan_assembler">
    <remap from="/scan" to="tilt_scan"/>
    <param name="tf_cache_time_secs" type="double" value="11.0" />
    <param name="max_scans" type="int" value="400" />
    <param name="ignore_laser_skew" type="bool" value="true" />
    <param name="fixed_frame" type="string" value="/sr_lidar1_scan" />
  </node>
</launch>

thank you

How could a .cpp file be run?

A:

Is it possible that you run a .cpp file from the "laser_scan_assembler" ? I think you start the same node again, which ends in an shutdown because you have the same name twice.
If you wanna run it both together then change the name in the .launch file, e.g to "laser_scan_assembler_1"

thanks Mr.coon, if i change the .launch file node name ,, is .cpp file run time error occurred for [ERROR] [1375875020.161393352]: Need to set parameter fixed_frame

Have you read the laser_assembler doc? It states the laser_scan_assembler requires a parameter fixed_frame.

I was running the same node in two launch files, one in my gazebo world launch file and one in the controller launch file. The gazebo launch file would init the node and the controller launch would kill it. Thank you!
