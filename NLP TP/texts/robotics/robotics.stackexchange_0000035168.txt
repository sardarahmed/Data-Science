Q:

trajectory_filter and pluginlib syntax 1.2

This tutorial still uses pre-cturtle syntax for its plugins. Thus, when I run my trajectory_filter chain, I get

[ WARN] [1319409949.585461199]: Deprecation Warning: No '/' detected in FilterType, Please update to 1.2 plugin syntax. 
[ WARN] [1319409949.585612870]: Replaced NumericalDifferentiationSplineSmootherFilterJointTrajectory with NumericalDifferentiationSplineSmootherFilterJointTrajectory

What is the proper syntax? I'm running electric.

A:

Correct syntax is defined on the pluginlib wiki page also the filters wiki page has examples.

The filters page still has the old syntax I believe. In filter_chain.h, the above error will be printed whenever there is no / in the type. The correct syntax is hinted at on the pluginlib page, in that I think you're supposed to declare your plugin with a slash in the name (i.e. with a package)...

...and then use that in the scan_filter_chain parameter.
