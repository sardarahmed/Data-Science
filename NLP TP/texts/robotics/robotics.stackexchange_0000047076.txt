What do you want to do? Reformulate that question, so it is understandable. For now my guess answer is: No.

A:

If you want to create two different nodes, one publishing a topic and the other subscribing to its messages, they will need different .cpp files for their sources.
If you want a single node that subscribes to one topic and publishes to another, than can be done in a single .cpp file.
