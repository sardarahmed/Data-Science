Is the path to the camera parameters file correct?
Comment by adreno on 2014-05-09:
Check if you have camera_parameters.txt file in your gscam package directory...

A:

gscam need the camera_parameters.txt calibration file in the gscam package directory

For it to work well with what you want to do for image processing you should calibrate the camera that you are using

camera_calibration package will create the right calibration file for you, which you can place in the gscam package directory

Enjoy!
