Q:

Best localization method?

I am making a robot that is supposed to roam inside my house and pick up trash using openCV. I plan to send information from my arduino mega to my arduino nano connected to window pc using radio transceivers. I also plan to send video feed from raspberry pi camera over WiFi to the windows PC. The windows PC then uses openCV and processes other information from the sensors and sends command back to arduino mega.
I have right now:

Arduino mega
raspberry pi + usb camera + wifi dongle
Xbox 360 kinect 
wheel encoders
sonar distance sensor
arduino nano
windows PC

I want to know how to keep track of the robot like the room it is. I think what I am trying to do is SLAM, but I just need to make the map once because the rooms don't change much. I am open to ideas.  Cost is a factor.

A:

Looking at your hardware, only the wheel encoders are suitable for environment-independent localization, which is not enough in most cases. The localization method using the wheel encoders called "odometry". The other sensors you have are suited more for known environments and map-based navigation. The camera could be used for markers detection and mapping, the distance sensor can be used for matching the location to a map (Particle Filter is the thing). In any case, I would add some inertial sensors(gyro, accelerometer or integrated IMU) to your system, to improve the localization performance.
