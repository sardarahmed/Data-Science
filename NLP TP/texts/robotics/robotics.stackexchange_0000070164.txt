Can I read in command argument and set robot_description in c++ program?

A:

Sure. It's just 'another parameter'.
Note: you will have to make sure that any other nodes that require that parameter will be started after your 'c++ program', or they'll most likely fail (most nodes (such as the robot_state_publisher) try to access parameters only once, at init). This can be tricky, as there is no guaranteed order in which nodes are launched.
Letting roslaunch set robot_description as a parameter takes care of this automatically, as "parameters will be stored on the Parameter Server before any nodes are launched" (from here).

I agree with you. But the problem is that roslaunch is not friendly to IDE.
My plan is that I can setup a standalone c++ program for debug in IDE such as qtcreator/eclipse.
For the end user, I have other executable integrated into roslaunch.
