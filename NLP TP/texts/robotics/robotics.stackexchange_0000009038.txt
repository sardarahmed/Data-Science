Q:

How to load a PUMA robot in the existing environment in OpenRAVE 0.9

I have a PR2 robot in an environment, which can be seen on the GUI of OpenRAVE. 
Now, how can I load a PUMA robot arm in the same environment?

A:

Multiple robots and environments can be loaded.  Simply load them and position the robots.  Here is a Python example:
#! /usr/bin/env python

from openravepy import *

env = Environment()
env.SetViewer('qtcoin')

env.Load("pr2-beta-sim.robot.xml")
env.Load("puma.robot.xml")

pr2 = env.GetRobot('pr2')
puma = env.GetRobot('PumaGripper')

puma.SetTransform([1,0,0,0,0,1,0])

Run this with something like: ipython -i my2robots.py
For an example in C++, see this example.
