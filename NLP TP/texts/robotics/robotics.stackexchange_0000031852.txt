Q:

Topological_navigation dependency

Hi to all,
I'm trying to test the Topological_navigation but i encountered some dependencies problem.
Apparently, one of the stacks known as graph_mapping_utils is not available in the graph_mapping package but is required by the topological_navigation package. How should i solve it?
Can i also classify whether usage of the camera is the only source to obtain information from the surrounding by the topological_navigation?
Thank for your time
With regards,
Zhiping

A:

Hi Zhiping, you may not be using the right versions.  In particular, if you follow the rosinstall directions given on http://www.ros.org/wiki/topological_navigation you shouldn't have any dependency problems.  Also, the camera is not needed for this stack â€” it just assumes a horizontal laser range finder.

Dear Sir
Do you know how to install topological_navigation node into Fuerte version? I run the instruction in the topological_navigation node website, but there is nothing in the desired-topo-nav-location
