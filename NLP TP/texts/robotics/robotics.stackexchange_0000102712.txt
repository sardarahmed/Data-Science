Q:

How to use if else in python launch file?

Hi. Sorry for all mistakes, English is not my native language. I'm migrating my project to ROS2 Foxy. In my old launch file I have following lines of code:
  <arg name="config" default="$(eval 'cartographer_jetson.lua' if (target == 'jetson') else 'cartographer_host.lua')"/>
  <arg name="odom" default="$(eval '/rs_t265/odom/sample' if (target == 'jetson') else '/minicar/controller/odom')"/>

How those lines should look like in python launch file? I actually couldn't find documentation with examples that cover that situation, so if there are some documentation with detailed explanation of python launch file creation process I'll be would be very grateful for a link.
Appreciate any help
