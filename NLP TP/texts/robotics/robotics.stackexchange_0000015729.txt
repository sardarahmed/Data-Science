Q:

What is the difference between active and passive sensors?

Apparently, there are active and passive sensors. An infrared proximity sensors should be an active sensor, whereas a gyroscope should be a passive sensor. Why is that the case? In general, what is the difference between an active and a passive sensor? Multiple examples (with appropriate explanations) may be helpful to clarify the distinction.

A:

Let's recall that sensors are used to measure a physical quantity.
The distinction between passive and active sensor characterize the sensor ability to retrieve a measurement without or with inputing energy (mechanic or electromagnetic or else) in the environment.
For example, an infrared proximity sensor is active because the sensor needs to actively emit infrared waves in order to retrieve the measurement of the distance. So, any sensor which requires to input energy to the environment in order to retrieve the measurement is active (laser range finder, ultrasound range finder, sonar, lidar, time of flight camera, etc.).
On the other hand, sensors like gyroscope or accelerometers are named passive because they are able to retrieve a measurement without actively interacting with the environment. Other examples are: encoder, switch, camera, magnetometer, barometer, etc.
More complex sensor like microsoft kinect or intel euclide are composed of several sensors both passive (visible camera, IMU) and active (IR camera and lighting), thus making the full sensor an active sensor.
EDIT: added sensors based on comment
