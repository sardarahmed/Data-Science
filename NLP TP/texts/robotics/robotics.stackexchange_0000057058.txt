Q:

Installing rosserial on Raspbian with ROS Hydro

EDIT: Solved, working rosserial connection between the pi and arduino following the instructions on http://wiki.jigsawrenaissance.org/ROS_on_RaspberryPi
With both a Raspberry Pi Model A & B, I successfully installed ros hydro following the ros wiki ROSberryPi/Setting up Hydro on RaspberryPi but I haven't successfully installed rosserial yet.
I've tried following the 1.1 Broken Packages section with the following commands:
$ cd ~/ros_catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https:// github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial
$ cd ..
$ rosdep install  --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro hydro -y --os=debian:wheezy

But rosdep fails here saying:
pi@rpiA ~/ros_catkin_ws $ rosdep install  --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro hydro -y --os=debian:wheezy

executing command [sudo apt-get install -y ros-hydro-nav-msgs]
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-hydro-nav-msgs
ERROR: the following rosdeps failed to install
  apt: command [sudo apt-get install -y ros-hydro-nav-msgs] failed

I'm trying to get an idea of what steps I could take to fix this, not sure where to start.
EDIT - 2/5/2014 00:11
Following suggestion to add missing packages (well I feel silly)
$ git clone https:// github.com/ros/common_msgs.git
$ cd ..
$ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro hydro -y --os=debian:wheezy
...
executing command [sudo apt-get install -y ros-hydro-tf]
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-hydro-tf
ERROR: the following rosdeps failed to install
  apt: command [sudo apt-get install -y ros-hydro-tf] failed

One down, tf next
$ git clone https:// github.com/ros/geometry
... fail tf2

Then tf2...
$ git clone https:// github.com/ros/geometry-experimental
$ cd ..
$ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro hydro -y --os=debian:wheezy
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
tf2_bullet: No definition of [bullet] for OS version [wheezy]

Okay, this is a new one for me, in progress...

A:

Your install is calling for more dependencies than rosserial really needs, but I can't say why. FWIW you can install rosserial in a fresh "working" WS (e.g. ~/catkin_ws/ instead of your ~/ros_catkin_ws/) and just "catkin_make" it.
Here are instructions that worked for me, and a prebuilt Raspberry Pi image, too:

I followed the instructions (http://wiki.jigsawrenaissance.org/ROS_on_RaspberryPi) verbatim (used the official rosserial package) and it worked out perfectly, thanks cha!

Hey, the website is no longer available, do you have another link that works?
