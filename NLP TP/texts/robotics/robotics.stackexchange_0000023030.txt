Q:

Simulate Wind in Gazebo - physics_msgs

I am trying to simulate a drone inside an environment with constant wind. I have found a good plugin (link below) and I have done the following to integrate this plugin in my system:

include the gazebo_wind_plugin.cpp file in my src folder
include the header file (gazebo_wind_plugin.h) in the include folder
edit the CmakeLists.txt to include this plugin

https://github.com/PX4/PX4-SITL_gazebo/blob/master/src/gazebo_wind_plugin.cpp
However, I get errors during catkin_make showing the following:

How should I install/integrate physics_msgs? Kindly advice if any other issue is present.

A:

You don't have to compile these files with your plugin. You should include the already existing wind plugin in to your world file. Check this example file and how you should use the wind plugin. The Gazebo physics will be on charge of applying the wind to your drone.
