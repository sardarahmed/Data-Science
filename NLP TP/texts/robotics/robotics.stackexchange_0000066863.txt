Q:

roslaunch openni2_launch failed on raspberry pi

I installed openni2_launch from kalectro OpenNI2
It run well and simpletest worked fine.
I compiled openni2_launch and openni2_camera in raspberry pi. When run the command following, it failed at  [camera/driver-2] process. Who can help to figure out how to fix it?
  roslaunch openni2_launch openni2.launch

Hi there, this seems to work for me using rosrun as stated in the link you posted. But openni2_launch still has the same error as  in the question ?
