Q:

CCNY RGB-D tools Installation Problem

Hi,
I downloaded the tools from github and followed the instructions to install them. However the installation fails with the message
Linking CXX executable bin/global_cloud_align
  lib/librgbdtools.so: undefined reference to `boost::filesystem::detail::status(boost::filesystem::path const&, boost::system::error_code*)'
  lib/librgbdtools.so: undefined reference to `boost::filesystem::detail::create_directories(boost::filesystem::path const&, boost::system::error_code*)'
  lib/librgbdtools.so: undefined reference to `boost::filesystem::detail::create_directory(boost::filesystem::path const&, boost::system::error_code*)'

Other packages can link to boost normally, so in CMakeLists.txt I added the compile flags for filesystem and system but no luck. I have not messed with the package files in any other way. The rest of the stack's packages also seem to isntall fine.
EDIT:
Forgot to mention, I am using ROS Hydro, Boost 1.52 on Ubuntu 12.04
Any suggestions ?

A:

Sorry for the late answer,
Your Cmake file isn't able to link Boost to librgbdtools.
Try looking through this link - http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake:How_To_Find_Libraries
to understand exactly how CMake links these libraries (this helped be a lot).
If you know FIND_PACKAGE isn't working, then try setting BOOST_INCLUDE_DIR / LIBRARIES manually, and then linking them. Also, try removing the default PATHS in the FIND_PACKAGE(Boost .....) command.
A hacky solution (not recommended) is to directly specify the libraries themselves in what you link to the rgbdtools.h file.
I'd suggest this as a last resort.
