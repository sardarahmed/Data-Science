Q:

Can't run catkin make for Arlo packages

I am receiving 'could not find a package configuration file provided by "PACKAGE_NAME" with any of the the following names' errors.
I am using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on VMWare Workstation 12 Pro and ROS Indigo.
I have tried manually installing the packages but eventually i get to a package called "ceres" and can't progress any further.
I have also tried removing and reinstalling ROS Indigo and have not seen any results.
Edit:
Sorry, my bad.
The arlo platform is a base for a robot. I am using the parallax propeller board micro controller
https://www.parallax.com/product/arlo-robotic-platform-system
I'm trying to compile some packages from the indigo branch of this repository.
https://github.com/chrisl8/ArloBot
Essentially the packages are turtlebot code rejigged for the propeller board

We don't know what the "Arlo packages" are.
If you refer to something, please always include (a) link(s) to what you are referring to.

My bad, I have updated the description

Seeing as chrisl8/ArloBot has an issue tracker I would suggest you post your problem there. ROS Answers is a Q&A platform for (general) ROS questions about commonly used pkgs. Posting your question here is ok, but I expect that you'll get a more helpful answer from the pkg author than here.

And for any future questions you may post on ROS Answers: just stating "I'm receiving an error" and "I can't progress" is not really helpful. We can't see what you see (on your console), so just copy-paste error text verbatim into ..

.. your question please. Use the Preformatted Text button (the one with 101010 on it) to format such text properly.

chrisl8/ArloBot#16.

A:

Hi there, I am the owner of the Arlo package. I am ChrisL8.
The solution is to add two more packages before running the install or cmake:
sudo apt install ros-kinetic-geodesy 
sudo apt install libceres-dev

I will go ahead and add those two packages to the install now.
Sorry for the slow response, I actually found this message while looking for the solution to the issue.
