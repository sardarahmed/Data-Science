Q:

Orocos-bfl not found while installing navigation stack ROS indigo + Ubuntu 14.04

Hey guys,
I have just installed Ubuntu 14.04 and ROS indigo and is trying to install navigation stack (http://wiki.ros.org/navigation). While doing catkin_make, I get the following error in the robot_pose_ekf package:
-- Boost version: 1.54.0 
-- +++ processing catkin package: 'robot_pose_ekf' 
-- ==> add_subdirectory(navigation/robot_pose_ekf) 
checking for module 'orocos-bfl' 
--   package 'orocos-bfl' not found 
CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindPkgConfig.cmake:283 (message):
A required package was not found
Call Stack (most recent call first):
/usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindPkgConfig.cmake:337 (_pkg_check_modules_internal)
navigation/robot_pose_ekf/CMakeLists.txt:6 (pkg_check_modules)
Then, I tried to install bfl from http://www.orocos.org/bfl which did not work as it is not up-to-date I guess. Can anyone help me out here and give some suggestions on how to solve this issue?
Thanks in advance.

A:

Try installing the binary version of the navigation stack:
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-navigation

Thanks..this worked but I want to install the navigation stack in my workspace so that I can work on it and modify it whereas this installs in opt/ros/indigo.. any suggestions regarding this?

Once you've installed the binary of navigation, you'll have bfl (since ros-indigo-ocoros-bfl will have been installed as a dependency of navigation), so you should now find that your workspace builds.

sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-navigation does not work. Any suggestions? Cannot also do rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro indigo -y
