Q:

Ubntu desktop VS core

Hi,
I am beginner in this ROS and studying to integrate melodic with our target device, might be arm64.
Have one silly question, as far as I know, we can integrate ROS on Ubuntu or as well othres.
However, I am confused that does it mean we can use both Ubuntu desktop and Core version also ?
Since I thought we have to use Ubuntu core for embedded device.
Sincerely,
