Q:

Turtlebot dying when launching kinect

Everytime I try to launch the kinect it gets stuck after setting the depth frame id and then the power system dies shortly after.
turtlebot@turtlebot:~$ roslaunch turtlebot_bringup kinect.launch

A:

Well the stuck issue was simply me not realizing that the program was just running. The power down issue is that I swapped to a new laptop_battery.py and it seems to not show the correct charge for the iCreate battery now. Will have to just keep tabs on charging it until I have time to look into it.
