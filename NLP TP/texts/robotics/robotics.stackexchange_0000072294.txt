Q:

A silly question about packages organization!

Inside a package there is initially the two files CMakeList.txt and package.xml and the folder src. From the tutorials, I understood that the scripts belonging to a package should be placed in its scr folder. However, while studying ROS I found many packages that had thier scripts placed in a user created folder called scripts. Taking into account the said, my question is: Why someones creates a new folder called script instead to use the already existing one called scr. Is this a ROS good practices or just a user preference? If it is a good practice, for what I should use the folder script and for what should I use the folder src.
Thanks in advance!

Do you have an example of such a package?

For example: https://github.com/qboticslabs/mastering_ros/tree/master/chapter_3_codes/seven_dof_arm_gazebo

A:

catkin_make looks inside your src directory. However, my understanding is that those scripts are in Python and don't need to go through the gcc compiler. Thus, it doesn't need to compile them into executables. Generally you'd put them in src if they were C++ files. I'm not exactly sure what "good practices" are in this scenario but that's why it's ok to put them in scripts instead of src.
