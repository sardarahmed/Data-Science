Q:

Using wiifi_ddwrt Package

Hi,
I'm trying to work with the wifi_ddwrt Package on indigo. But, Im having trouble.
First I installed the Package by giving the Source in the terminal:
git clone https://github.com/ros-drivers/wifi_ddwrt.git
After that I tried to execute the nodes (analysis, ddwrt, etc ) :
~/catkin_ws$ rosrun wifi_ddwrt analysis
and an error occured:

        ImportError: cannot import name  pr2_msgs

and after I installed std_msgs

        ImportError: cannot import name AccessPoint

Is there anything that Im doing wrong?  Would you guide me through the installation and execution of the Package/nodes?
Thank you in advance for your help.

A:

You need to install the pr2_msgs package: http://wiki.ros.org/pr2_msgs
Either sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-pr2-msgs or clone https://github.com/pr2/pr2_common.git
