Q:

Documentation of Gazebo topics

Are the default Gazebo topics documented anywhere? Searches on Google and Gazebo answers turned up nothing. The documentation on gazebosim.org only covers the code API and protobuf messages.

A:

Unfortunately, I don't think there is any documentation on Gazebo topics, that would definitely be good to have.
