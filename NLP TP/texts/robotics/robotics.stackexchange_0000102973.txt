Q:

rqt_plot in ROS 2?

I want to check the data in topic with realtime plotting, and I know there was rqt_plot in ROS 1.
However, I could not found rqt_plot in ROS 2 humble.
Moreover, I could not use correctly rqt -> Plugins -> Visualization -> Plot.
How to use rqt_plot or similar app in ROS 2?

A:

You'll want to use PlotJuggler instead.
I'd almost go as far as to write "forget about rqt_plot".
