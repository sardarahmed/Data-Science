Q:

Activating OpenNi depth registration by default

Hello!
My problem is the following: I use the openni_kinect package to get rgb/depth feeds from my kinect. I start the ROS nodes for this by using
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch

My program needs depth registration to function properly (disabled by default), so far I have enabled this by running
rosrun dynamic_reconfigure reconfigure_gui

and setting the parameter manually, but it is quickly getting old. Is there a way to turn the depth registration on by default in my roslaunch?

A:

A simple solution is to edit the openni_kinect/openni_launch/launch/includes/device.launch file and add the following param setting to the driver nodelet
<param name="depth_registration" value="true" />

An alternative solution which works for me is to use the dynparam command-line tool from inside your own launch script, e.g.
<node pkg="dynamic_reconfigure" type="dynparam" name="dynparam" args="set /camera/driver depth_registration true" />

which avoids the need to edit the launch files in the openni_kinect package.

Thanks! I picked the second alternative since I prefer not to change the ROS files (then my system can work on a clean ROS install)
