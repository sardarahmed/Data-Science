Q:

Is there an implementation of JointStateInterface, EffortJointInterface, PositionJointInterface and VelocityJointInterface in ros2?

Hi. Sorry for all mistakes, English is not my native language. So, I have folloing lines of code in my ros1 project

hardware_interface::JointStateInterface js_interface_;
hardware_interface::EffortJointInterface ej_interface_;
hardware_interface::PositionJointInterface pj_interface_;
hardware_interface::VelocityJointInterface vj_interface_;

I have a problem with understanding, how this lines should look in ros2 Foxy. I'll appreciate any help. As far as I know EffortJointInterface  can be used in Galactic and all newer version, but I could be wrong.

You may start with  https://control.ros.org/master/doc/getting_started/getting_started.html

Thank you for reply. I read those two yesterday, and maybe I miss something, but there are no answer for this particular question in there. All that I get is assumption, that JointTrajectoryController is doing something similar to JointStateInterface, but still, maybe I am wrong here

As here written github
ros_control's JointStateInterface, EffortJointInterface, 
PositionJointInterface, VelocityJointInterface, *InterfaceProvider 
functionalities have been replaced by RobotHardware.

Oh, I see. Thank you for your help. You already answered my question, but still do you happen to know where to look this RobotHardware? I't is a little strange for me, but there are no RobotHardware in hardware_interface or joint_limits_interface.

You may find something here: demo hardware

I couldn't find any RobotHardware uses there. Still, thank you for your help.
