Q:

what configurations should i consider in ekf_localization_node when using IMU and an ultrasonic sensor?

Good day everyone, now I'm working on a quadcopter project and I'm using IMU(gy-801)  and also an ultrasonic sensor for getting the z-axis ,I have used the accelerometer and the gyroscope data to make the imu_msg and i've visualized this msg using rviz and it works very well then i have put the ultrasonic data and the heading angle in an odometry_msg,then i used this two messages in ekf_localization_node to get the pose and twist but the /odometry_filterd message that is published from that node doesn't give real data and the pose always increases fast although the quadcopter doesn't move. so am i working wrong or is there any configurations that i should consider?? thank you in advance

so what sensor do you suggest for a quadcopter odometry?

I've seen a lot of people who use visual odometry. If you search google for "ros visual odometry" you'll find lots of examples.

thank you very much

A:

If you're feeding noisy acceleration measurements into an EKF without a source of position odometry your position estimate is going to explode. You can do some searching for people who have tried using r_l with just an IMU, but from what I've seen the consensus is that the results won't be great.
