Q:

SLAM system for LIDAR and Stereo camera for cone detection for Autonomous driving

The purpose of the SLAM system is very specific, for detecting cones in an image and triangulate their position to create a map.
The data input would be the camera data, odometry and the LIDAR data.
I have been going through SLAM algorithms on openSLAM.org and through other implementations of SLAM systems.
I would like to know if there are a set of SLAM algorithms specific for the problem I have and what are the most efficient and least time consuming SLAM algorithms available. Any leads would be helpful. 

A:

You should probably also add information regarding your sensors, for instance what LIDAR are you to use 2D or 3D etc. The nature of SLAM algorithm shall also depend upon what kind of system do you need to use it on specifically what are the rates that you need, do you need the SLAM to be online or offline etc. Further the machine you run your algorithms may also be the reason which decides which algorithm you finally use.
Regardless I think these are some SLAM algorithms that may help you :

Orb SLAM : http://webdiis.unizar.es/~raulmur/orbslam/ uses only camera information but performs very well at least the RGB-D version.
Google Cartographer : https://github.com/googlecartographer/cartographer needs no introduction.
You should also checkout gmapping - slam-gmapping
Definitely checkout the LOAM algorithm, it uses only LIDAR data but produces very good quality maps, you can use EKF on the odometry that it provides with the one you have, that should give you a good positional estimate.
