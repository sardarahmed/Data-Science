Q:

remote roslaunch failed to launch

Hi all,
I am trying to launch nodes on a remote master machine through a launch file. My ssh keys are setup for passwordless connection. The husky.machine file to configure the launch ssh connections to the remote computer is:
<launch>
<arg name="robot_0_ip" default="$(env ROS_MASTER_IP)" />

<machine name="robot_0"
         address="$(arg robot_0_ip)"
         user="ros"
         env-loader="/home/ros/catkin_ws/husky_launcher.sh"
         ssh-port="22"
         timeout="20" />
</launch>

I stripped down my main launch file, system.launch to this:
<launch>
    #### 1: ARBITER - ROBOT COMPUTER CONFIGURATIONS ###########
    <include file="$(find husky_pursuit)/launch/game/husky.machine" />

    #### 2: ARBITER - ARENA SETUP ###########
    <include file="$(find husky_pursuit)/launch/game/arbiter.launch" /> # local

    #### 3/4: ROBOT - ROBOT LAUNCHES ###########
    <node machine="robot_0" pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="base_link_to_laser" args="0.25 0 0.25 0 0 0 /robot_0/base_link /robot_0/laser 40" />
</launch>

It just launches one node remotely on robot_0 (the master), a static_transform_publisher. Before running this launch file, I ssh into robot_0 and run roscore. The error from running system.launch is:
... logging to /home/ajay/.ros/log/81f340de-1106-11e4-a670-801f02abdf53/roslaunch-i72ubuntu-12392.log

Based on the log file, SSH authentication was successful, but ProcessMonitor shuts down. The log file is at pastebin.com/Q2t3hEpp
Why does the remote roslaunch fail to launch?
Thanks!
EDIT: /home/ros/catkin_ws/husky_launcher.sh env-loader file:
#!/bin/bash
export ROS_WS=/home/ros/catkin_ws
source $ROS_WS/devel/setup.bash
export PATH=$ROS_ROOT/bin:$PATH
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:$ROS_WS
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http:// 192.168.1.125:11311
export ROS_HOSTNAME=192.168.1.125

(I added a space between http:// and 192.168.125:11311 because I can't publish links yet. It's not really there on the robot computer).

I've usually seen issues like this when there was an error in the environment loader script. Can you edit your question to include your environment loader?
Comment by Ajay Jain on 2014-07-21:
I added the script. It sources the workspace devel/setup.bash file - does it also need to source /opt/ros/hydro/env.sh?

A:

Your environment loader looks reasonable, except that the last line should be exec "$@"

Thanks - this worked! Now I just need to resolve my TF extrapolation into the past errors...
