Q:

Publishing parameter updates to camera using pointgrey_camera_driver

With Indigo and Ubuntu 14.04 I would like to control the parameters of a BlackFly GiGE camera using pointgrey_image_driver.  I can see the image using image_view while running the driver.
It looks like the parameters should be accessible using dynamic reconfigure but when I publish messages from the command line, there is no effect on the image.  Examples of messages I have tried:
rostopic pub -1 /camera/camera_nodelet/parameter_updates dynamic_reconfigure/BoolParameter '{name: auto_white_balance, value: False}'

rostopic pub -1 /camera/camera_nodelet/parameter_updates dynamic_reconfigure/BoolParameter '{name: white_balance_red, value: 3}'

Actually, I'd just like to set all the parameters once so if there's a way to do that other than by using dynamic_reconfigure, that would be great to know.
When I look at the parameter_updates topic, I see that there are no subscribers to that topic.  That seems like a problem.

It's the unique camera that you have tried?
I have no problems using Flea3 1394b...

A:

Instead of poking at the topics directly, dynamic_reconfigure has a command-line client and a python API that probably provide what you're looking for. Both are documented on the dynamic_reconfigure wiki page.
As a side note, I think that topic is used for the node to send updates when its parameters change; not for outside clients to change parameters.
