Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: rqt_shell tmux

Thank you for the contribution of rqt_shell. I am implementing a GUI in ROS indigo, Ubuntu 14.4. However, the integrated rqt_shell cannot use 'tmux' functionality by right clicking and adding a tag, like Guake. Could you please tell me how to implement the terminal multiplexer functionality in rqt_shell plug in? Thank you.
I look forward to your reply.
