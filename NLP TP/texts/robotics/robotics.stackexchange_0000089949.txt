Q:

apt update: "Malformed entry 1 in list file"

I am using command sudo apt-get update and this error is coming. How to solve this issue?
Malformed entry 1 in list file /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list (Component)
E: The list of sources could not be read.

I am using ubuntu 18.04 and ros melodic.

What is your question? I don't see any question, just an error or warning without any context. Please see the support page for how to ask a question.

A:

Malformed entry 1 in list file /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list (Component)

E: The list of sources could not be read.

Something probably went wrong during initial setup of the ROS package repository sources. Most likely this section of the tutorial.
Can you show us the contents of ros-latest.list? Use the following command:
cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list

and copy-paste the text from the terminal into your original question text. Use the edit button/link for that.

Edit:

ros-latest.list content:-

deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu  main

I have the impression that this is missing the Ubuntu code name for the release, which in your case probably should be bionic (provided you are actually running Ubuntu Bionic (ie: 18.04).
To make sure: what is the output of:
lsb_release -sc

If that returns an error, or tells you the command lsb_release can't be found, then that is most likely what went wrong. If the command can't be found, install it using sudo apt install lsb-release.

Edit 2:

it is showing output :- bionic

Then something must have gone wrong while executing this line from this section of the tutorial:
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'

Can you run this again and check carefully whether any warnings and/or errors are printed?
