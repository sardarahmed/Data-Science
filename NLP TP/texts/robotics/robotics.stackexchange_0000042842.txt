Q:

Can someone explain how the Quaternion works for MoveBaseActions?

I really want to be able to send  a goal to move base that is it's current position, but a different orientation/ rotation. I know I can send a twist command to rotate the robot, but I was wondering how someone would do it via MoveBase?

A:

Have a look here to understand quaternions.
To rotate the robot, you can, for instance, send a PoseStamped with frame id base_link and the relative orientation of your goal relative to your robot to move_base.
