A:

It looks like the erratic_robot package is still a rosbuild package, and isn't released into Hydro.
You can install it from source in a rosbuild workspace, but it can't be released until it's converted to catkin.

Thank you.
I downloaded the erratic_robot-master.zip  and make it, and then use catkin_make command, but package player(erratic robot) still can not be found. how can i converted it to catkin?
I already installed it in fuerte, now i have two version in my computer

since erratic_robot is a rosbuild package, you cannot build it with catkin_make, and you cannot build against it from a catkin package. You should set up a separate rosbuild workspace for Hydro, overlaid on your Hydro catkin workspace, and built it there.

See http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/using_rosbuild_with_catkin#rosbuild_workspace_on_top_of_catkin_workspace for instructions on how to set up a rosbuild workspace that is overlaid on your catkin workspace.
