Q:

do i need to install gazebo_ros_pkgs

Q1: do i need to install gazebo_ros_pkgs in indigo? because the gazebo(gazebo2 ) should be integrated in ROS.
Q2: I hear ROS Hydro supported Gazebo simulation environment better than Indigo, is that true?
Thanks,all.

A:

Yes....ros Indigo full install will install Gazebo and I have no issues with Gazebo under Indigo. But I do not push it very hard.
