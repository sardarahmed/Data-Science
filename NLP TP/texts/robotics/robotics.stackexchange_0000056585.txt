Q:

[Solved]Problem with rosmake and rosrun usb_cam usb_cam_node

Good afternoon partners
Following the tutorial for installing usb_cam on groovy

http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Setting%20up%20ROS%20on%20RaspberryPi#ROS_Peripherals

I can roscd usb_cam and I have all the dependencies installed but when I do the rosmake I'm given the next :
 Configuring incomplete, errors occurred! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------} 
[ rosmake ] Output from build of package usb_cam written to: 
[ rosmake ] /home/pi/.ros/rosmake/rosmake_output-20140116-192405/usb_cam/build_output.log
[rosmake-0] Finished <<< usb_cam [FAIL] [ 16.84 seconds ] 
[ rosmake ] Halting due to failure in package usb_cam.
[ rosmake ] Waiting for other threads to complete. 
[ rosmake ] Results: 
[ rosmake ] Built 36 packages with 1 failures. 
[ rosmake ] Summary output to directory 
[ rosmake ] /home/pi/.ros/rosmake/rosmake_output-20140116-192405

And if I try rosrun usb_cam usb_cam_node I'm given :
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named usb_cam_node below /home/pi/catkin_ws/src/bosch_drivers/usb_cam
[rosrun] Found the following, but they're either not files
[rosrun] or not executable: 
[rosrun] /home/pi/catkin_ws/src/bosch_drivers/usb_cam/src/usb_cam_node

Could anyone help me please?
Thanks
EDIT
This is the output_build log:
mkdir -p bin
cd build && cmake -Wdev -

Thanks a lot

It sounds like the usb_cam package is failing to build. Can you post the rest of the rosmake output?

A:

According to the build log, you're missing the self_test package which is a dependency:
Failed to invoke /opt/ros/groovy/bin/rospack deps-manifests usb_cam [rospack] Error: package/stack 'usb_cam' depends on non-existent package 'self_test' and rosdep claims that it is not a system dependency. Check the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH or try calling 'rosdep update'

According to the ROS wiki, the self_test package is part of the diagnostics stack. I suggest you add the entire diagnostics stack to your catkin workspace, and rebuild your catkin workspace.

Ok. It's in progress. I'm telling you when it finished. Thanks.

Ok. I've just added the entire diagnostics stack in my catkin_ws and rebuilded it. Now when I invoke rosmake usb_cam everything finish OK.
I've just run "rosrun usb_cam usb_cam_node" and it worked for me. Know I have to fin my webcam .
Thanks you so much.
