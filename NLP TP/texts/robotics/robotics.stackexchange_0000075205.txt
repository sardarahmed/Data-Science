Q:

My custom made mobile manipulator using Husky doesnt move

I have been stuck on this issue for the past one week.I mounted a custom made arm on top of a husky.Independently the arm and husky works fine without including each other.I am able to move the arm using moveit! and move the husky using the husky control package.
When i attach the arm on top of the husky my problem starts.I noticed the following.
  <gazebo>
<plugin name="gazebo_ros_control" filename="libgazebo_ros_control.so">
  <robotNamespace>/autoarm</robotNamespace>
</plugin>

when i include this to my URDF i can move my arm.But if i change this code into -
  <gazebo>
<plugin name="gazebo_ros_control" filename="libgazebo_ros_control.so">
  <robotNamespace>/</robotNamespace>
</plugin>

I can use the husky_control package to move my husky.So my problem is that  i cant move both my husky and my arm at the same time.This might be a silly question but i am totally lost.

This sounds like a gazebo question; you'll probably get a better answer if you ask on the gazebo forums: http://answers.gazebosim.org/questions/
