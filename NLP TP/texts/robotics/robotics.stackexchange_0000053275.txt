Q:

ROS beginner_tutorials (17th tutorial) Error

Hello,
I am trying to learn ROS. So far I had many errors. Thanks to ROS Answers, I found solutions to them so far.
I could not solve this one, so here is my question.
I get this error when I am trying the 17th tutorial - Writing a Simple Publisher and Subscriber (C++)-
irem@willis:~$ cd ~/fuerte_workspace/sandbox/beginner_tutorials
irem@willis:~/fuerte_workspace/sandbox/beginner_tutorials$ make
mkdir -p bin
cd build && cmake -Wdev -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=`rospack find rosbuild`/rostoolchain.cmake  ..

  Aborting.  Please fix the broken dependency!
