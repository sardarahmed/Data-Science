Q:

Converting a rosbag.db3 file to .pcd

I've been trying to convert a rosbag which i've generated after running the kiss-icp algorithm (so output is sensor_msg/msg/PointCloud2) into a 3D map of the environment, by converting it into a .pcd format using the humble-pcl-ros library. For some reason it recognises other .cpp files as executables in the pcl_ros library (filter_cropbox_node, pcd_to_pointlcloud etc.) but not bag_to_pcd, leading to:
ros2 run pcl_ros bag_to_pcd.cpp /data/myrosbag.db3 /kiss/local_map /data/map1

No executable found

Is there any way to fix this or is there perhaps an easier method or package to use to convert my rosbag.db3 file into a 3D map? Thanks.

A:

It is expecting the name of the executable, not the source file cpp:
Try:
ros2 run pcl_ros bag_to_pcd /data/myrosbag.db3 /kiss/local_map /data/map1

You need to include your node bag_to_pcd node in the build and installation process, in other words, add the node to the CMakeLists.txt file of the package to ensure it gets compiled and linked properly.
