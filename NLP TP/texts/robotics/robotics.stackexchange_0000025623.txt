Q:

Gazebo's Fuerte Dependencies Causing Groovy Issues

I am using ROS Groovy but have Gazebo 1.3 and its Fuerte dependencies installed as well. I believe the urdfdom package is having issues because of having both the Fuerte and Groovy versions installed. It is throwing errors such as:

ERROR ros.rosconsole_bridge.console_bridge: Material [Brown] color has no rgba
ERROR ros.rosconsole_bridge.console_bridge: Material [Brown] not defined in file

But when I remove Gazebo and Fuerte dependencies, this error goes away.
When can we expect a stand alone version of Gazebo that depends on Groovy instead? Thanks!

A:

This has been solved thanks to your hard work Dave. Gazebo can be used with ROS groovy using gazebo_ros_pkgs, which has documentation provided by Dave.
