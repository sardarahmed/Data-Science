Q:

How to transform acceleration data to velocity data

My IMU( Xsens MTi-28A53G35) only puts out orientation, angular velocity and linear acceleration. I want to use this data to help improve the accuracy of odom of the robot.
The Robot_localization doesn't support acceleration data from IMU so I have to transform acceleration into velocity first. I am wondering whether there are any nodes that can do this or I have write a node for it?

A:

Why don't you just ignore linear acceleration? Check this tutorial. In the config param of your imu in the launch file, you can set the variables related to orientation and angular velocity as true and the rest as false. So your config param for imu should look like this:
<rosparam param="imu0_config">[false, false, false, 
                                     true,  true,  true, 
                                     false, false, false, 
                                     true,  true,  true]</rosparam>
