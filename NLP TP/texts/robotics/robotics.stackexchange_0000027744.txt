Q:

Is the Cloud Simulation service still running

I saw that a Cloud Simulation feature is listed on the Gazebo home page but the link http://cloudsim.io/ hasn't worked for me across the couple of days I've tried it. Is it sill available?

It is on our roadmap for Gazebo 8.0, and is under development. Stay tuned.
