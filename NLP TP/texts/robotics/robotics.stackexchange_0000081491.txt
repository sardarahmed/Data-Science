Q:

Gazebo simulator launch file problems - ROS Kinetic

I was trying to install Gazebo and its proper dependencies in order to simulate a Parrot AR Drone 1. To do this, I used a tutorial from a Github account. I tried to execute the roslaunch cvg_sim_gazebo ardrone_testworld.launch command, but was had the following error:
robotics@robotics-2:~/catkin_ws/devel/tum_simulator$ roslaunch cvg_sim_gazebo ardrone_testworld.launch
[ardrone_testworld.launch] is neither a launch file in package [cvg_sim_gazebo] nor is [cvg_sim_gazebo] a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

It might have been due to me executing improper commands for my drone when installing the dependencies. I am not sure. I did perform the source command by using source devel/setup.bash in the catkin_ws. The command I specifically used for install was
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-ardrone-autonomy-*

I am able to find the launch files but ROS can't recognize tum_simulator or cvg_sim_gazebo as a package. I know this by using the rospack find <package name> command. This is probably why I am receiving errors with the launch file. Any help is appreciated, along with recommendations for other simulators known to work in ROS Kinetic for my specific drone.

A:

It turns out that the ros-kinetic-ardrone_autonomy is supposed to be ros-kinetic-ardrone-autonomy (with a hyphen instead of an underscore at the end). Also, I had performed git clone  https://github.com/angelsantamaria/tum_simulator.git in ~/catkin_ws/devel. When I removed it from ../devel and into ~/catkin_ws/src the issue with using roslaunch was solved!
