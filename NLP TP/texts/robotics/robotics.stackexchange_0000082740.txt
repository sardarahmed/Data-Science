Q:

Python version to use with ROS kinetic

Which python interpreter version is most advisable to use with ROS kinetic and gazebo 7 simulator?
As I read to set up ros to work with python 3 requires a extra effort.

A:

ROS kinetic targets Python2.7 (It does recommends compatibility with python 3 but doesn't require it).
Gazebo doesn't have a Python interface AFAIK.
You can find more details about what version of languages and dependencies a specific ROS distribution targets on REP3.
Hope this helps
Edit: "As I read to set up ros to work with python 3 requires a extra effort." indeed python3 not being officially supported, none of the packages are tested with python3, thus there is no list of known compatibility problems and the potential of breakage is pretty high. So I'd recommend python2.7 and if you write python code to write it in a way that it can run with both versions
