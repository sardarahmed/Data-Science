Q:

Is there any python support for creating a custom costmap_2d layer?

Hello,
I am trying to make my custom costmap_2d layer from pointcloud2 data, which would be marked as free space.
I looked at the tutorial, which is in C++. I was wondering if there is any other support in python for the same. It would make it a lot easier in python, I think.
Thank You.

A:

No.
Not in the standard packages.
The navstack uses C++ plugins to host layer plugins. This is not supported by / with Python.

I don't believe anything has changed.
Using boost::python or possible pybind11 (docs) would appear to be the way to do this, if you're still interested.
