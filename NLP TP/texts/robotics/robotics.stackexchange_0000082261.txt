Q:

Waypoint specific yaw_goal_tolerance for move base

Is there any way to specify a yaw_goal_tolerance for each waypoint you send to move_base? Sometimes I care which direction it ends up in and other times I don't care. And using dynamic reconfigure sounds overly complicated and would result in much less readable code and would be harder to debug.

Are asking about setting the yaw_goal_tolerance parameter for the base_local_planner dynamically?

Yes, that is correct. Id also like to note that I've noticed that when using dynamic reconfigure, if you mess something up it fails silently. Which is terrible for debug. It would also make code less readable so before going through all the work to set that up I'm wondering if there is an easier way

I currently monitor the distance and angle in a separate node and cancel the goal if I'm close enough.

Also other planners like teb_local_planner might give you the option.

A:

AFAIK there is no such option, unfortunately.
