Q:

face_recognition package usage is unclear

What steps exactly do I have to run in what order for face_recognition package?
I assumed the following, which doesn't seem to be working for me.

Publish /camera/image_raw I'm using shows clearly my face
rosrun face_recognition Fserver
rosrun face_recognition Fclient
rostopic pub -1 /fr_order face_recognition/FRClientGoal -- 2 "your_name" or other rostopic command that are mentioned in README.md.

Also, if successful, what result can I expect? In general, well-accepted ROS package description has "published topics" or similar section (e.g. http://wiki.ros.org/libuvc_camera#Published_Topics).

A:

The steps are correct. The above steps can be used to add your face to the database. Then, you can continue the tutorial to recognize faces. The package is based on actionlib , so you need to learn about actionlib to understand and use the face recognition package.

I have the same question, I did input the commands correctly, but I can't find any picture new in the date package.
