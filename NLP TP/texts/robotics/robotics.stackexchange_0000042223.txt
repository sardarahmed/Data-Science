Q:

Rosjava message description

I am currently trying to get the msg definition from a running ros system. My current solution consists of recursively examining the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH and reading all the .msg files. Not pretty.
Is there any special reason one cannot get at the (private) TopicDescription in the TopicDeclarations accessible through the MasterStateClient? Or is this just not a feature yet?
Is there a better way to do it?

A:

That's simply not a feature yet. Please file a feature request:
