Q:

rosdep installing the dependencies fails on OSX 10.10

Hi,
I am trying to setup ros on OSX 10.10. I'm following the installation instructions given here: http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/OSX/Homebrew/Source. While resolving the dependencies using this command:
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro indigo -y
I get an ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64 error while installing collada-dom and opencv. This I guess is associated with the default stdlib for clang being libc++ instead of libstdc++.
So I tried to install the dependencies of collada-dom with libstdc++. I was able to install Boost successfully but am unable to figure out how to install pcre with libstdc++.
Also for opencv I installed it using libstdc++ using the formula provided here, but this is just a keg-only formula. Even though I symlinked myself, rosdep isn't detecting this version.
Any help is much appreciated. Has anyone been able to get it working on OSX 10.10?

I haven't had time to upgrade to 10.10 myself, so unfortunately I can't reproduce any of these issues yet.

Hmm. Are you on Mavericks? Can I compile against 10.8 SDK on Yosemite/Mavericks?

A:

I don't think it is as easy as changing os x sdk versions. I think the pcre problem is an issue with the provided stdlib and compiler. But without more details I doubt anyone can help without reproducing it. As for rosdep you can just skip the opencv key if you know it is installed.
