A:

This depends on how you've installed the roboearth package. If it's been installed as a binary (via, say, apt-get install ...), then editing it won't do anything.
To build it from source, you'll need to download the source using rosinstall (see the docs for rosinstall, and the "source" line in the list at the very top of the roboearth wiki page). Then, build it using rosmake. Because you're building it from source, any changes you make will take effect as soon as you recompile.
