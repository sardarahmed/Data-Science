unable to install micro-ros-agent on raspberrypi

error: snap "micro-ros-agent" is not available on stable for this architecture (arm64) but exists
on other architectures (amd64).

A:

Hi, you can build the micro-ROS agent in a Raspberry Pi using the micro_ros_setup package. You can find more information here: https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_setup#building-micro-ros-agent
If you have further problems please open an issue in our Github repos to allow us to track and solve the problems.
Thanks a lot for using micro-ROS!
