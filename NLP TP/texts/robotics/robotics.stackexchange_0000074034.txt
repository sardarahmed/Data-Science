Q:

looking for an IDE for my project developments

Hi, everyone.
I am a beginner in ROS. I am trying to control Baxter Robot using ROS in C++ or Python language. I am following the ROS and Baxter Tutorials to learn it. Till now, I am using gedit editor for code writing.But I found that using the gedit  had a problem that I need to switch to terminal for compiling using Catkin_Make and switch back to Gedit in case of any error. Apart from that auto-suggestion and debugging are two big challenges, which are not available in the gedit.
I am looking for an IDE, which has at least following support:

Suitable for ROS C++ and python code development
Auto suggestion while writing the code (like Visual Studio in windows )
Line by line debugging support (Functionality to insert breakpoint)
Go to definition/Find all references (to see the definitions, header files etc)

in addition,I am using ROS Indigo in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64 Bit OS.
Thank you.

oh, I'm sorry. Yes, it is IDE not IED.

A:

I assume you mean IDE, not IED. And I recommend you google first; there have been many threads already about IDEs.
