Q:

launching nodes in a new terminal with roslaunch

Hello everyone.I've to print on screen some results obtained with stageros and it doesn't do that in the same window,so it's possible to write a launch file so that it opens one node in a new terminal?Or it can write in the same terminal but I'm missing something?
thanks

A:

If you really want to launch it in a new terminal, you can use the following:
<node name="foo" pkg="bar" type="bar_node" output="screen" launch-prefix="xterm -e" />

If you are using Ubuntu and gnome-terminal you could replace "xterm -e" with "gnome-terminal --command" to open in Ubuntu's default terminal.

To follow up on this ancient thread: is there a way to keep the terminal open after the node dies? It would nice to be able to read any error messages before it disappears.

when i use "xterm -e" or "gnome-terminal --command" it fires error saying "check if executable present and have right permission to execute".
without this options the launch file runs my two node without problem but in same window, and I want to run this nodes in  separate window.

"gnome-terminal --command" didn't work for me when my node needs the args.
The node can't find them on gnome-terminal. But xterm does, Thank you.
