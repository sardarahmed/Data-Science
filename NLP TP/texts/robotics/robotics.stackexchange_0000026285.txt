Q:

What is the tbb/task.h header for, and where can I get it?

Trying to compile a plugin that sets joint positions, I get this error:
$ make
[100%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/set_joints.dir/set_joints.cc.o
In file included from /usr/include/gazebo-1.7/gazebo/transport/transport.hh:3:0,

make[2]: *** [CMakeFiles/set_joints.dir/set_joints.cc.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/set_joints.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2

What is the tbb library and how should I install it?  I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit with Gazebo 1.7.1.

Thanks! Fixed the problem. Should this be added as a dependency for Gazebo?
Comment by Daniel Vaz on 2013-04-26:
Yes, in page (I think that is the newest installation instruction) http://gazebosim.org/wiki/1.6/install the tbb library is a prerequisite. Best regards.
Comment by Ben B on 2013-04-26:
It's only listed as a prerequisite for installation from source.

Great. Thanks.

I thought you had compiled gazebo from the source. ;)

No worries. That was my old setup, but I just reformatted my machine and decided to go the binary route.
