Q:

A subscriber (python script) problem? Please correct..... the error

I am trying to write the python script to subscribe topic "cmd_vel_mux/input/teleop" as keyboard Teleop node publishes message on this topic
#!/usr/bin/env python

import roslib
roslib.load_manifest('test')
import rospy
from geometry_msgs.msg import Twist
from std_msgs.msg import String
  
def callback(data):
     print rospy.get_name(),  "%f %f %f %f %f %f" %data.linx %data.liny %data.linz %data.angx %data.angy %data.angz

def listener():
      rospy.init_node('subs1', anonymous=True)
      rospy.Subscriber("cmd_vel_mux/input/teleop", Twist, callback)
      rospy.spin()
 
if __name__ == '__main__' :
      listener()

Error on terminal ............

A:

The error means that rospkg cannot find the package "test". Have you create it as a package, and is it location in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH ? Does rospack find test finds the path ?

I have to check by rospack find test again. However I have checked it earlier and it was working well. More over there 3-4 more scrips in the this test package and all are working well.
If there is some other possibility then please let me know.

Don't forget to source the setup.bash file for your catkin workspace in every terminal you are using.
