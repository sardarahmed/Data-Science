Q:

motion_planners stack: broken link

The motion_planners stack's page contains a broken download link. Namely the "source" link refers to a non-existent svn: https:// code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/stacks/motion_planners/trunk.
For the records, also the author's personal webpage (www. cs.cmu.edu/~maxim/software.html) refers to a non-existent webpage and svn.
Thank you in advance for your help. Francesco

A:

I'm sorry about the broken links and the crappy documentation. We are making a push this summer to get the SBPL out of the DBack/Electric age and into the more recent past and maybe even the future :).
updated repository:
git clone https://github.com/sbpl/sbpl.git
I fixed the link at www.sbpl.net.

Hi Ben, thank you for your answer. I am on another project right now, but in the future I might be working again with ROS and in that case I will definitely be very interested in your porting of SBPL to a more recent distribution!! Thank you for writing the git repository link, for future reference!
