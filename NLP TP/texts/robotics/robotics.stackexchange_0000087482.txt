Q:

Fanuc Robot: Get ROS to read I/O pins

More of a general question, but has anyone figured out how to get a readout of any of the digital pins I/O within ros, as some form of a publisher?

A:

See #q272675 for what is essentially a duplicate.
Summary: use a fieldbus for any serious work (modbus, ethernet/ip, profinet, etc).
For debugging / simple stuff (non-production), see whether fanuc_ros_cgio and fanuc_ros_cgio_py can help.
