Q:

Is there any package for omnidirectional drive robot for gazebo?

Hi,
I am looking for a ROS package for omni directional robot in gazebo,(just like erratic robot package). Is there any package, from where I can start working easily.
My aim is to run a navigation algorithm on omni directional robot in gazebo simulator.
Thanks

A:

For instance, the PR2 and Care-O-Bot are omnidirectional drive robots available for simulation in gazebo. Both use a system of four steered and driven casters (for a total of 8 motors) to achieve omnidirectional mobility.
If you're interested in simulation of a meccanum-wheel drive robot, I'm not sure there is one available for gazebo. Last time I looked, the youbot for gazebo used no true meccanum wheels, but a similar system to the two robots I mentioned above.

Has there been a release for kinetic or melodic?
