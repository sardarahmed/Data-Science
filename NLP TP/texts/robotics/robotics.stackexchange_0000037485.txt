Q:

it is planned going to Stage 4.x?

Is somebody or organization working on this?
Stage 4.x has interesting features which are not properly working in Stage 3.2.2, for instance I'm interested on set the update interval of models like sensors or actuators.

A:

ROS fuerte (expected release in March 2012) will have Stage 4.X.X, in case you are looking to relate Stage 3 and Stage 4 then have a look here, http://blog.aus10.org/?p=125.
UPDATE : ROS fuerte will have Stage 4.1.1
