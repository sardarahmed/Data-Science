Q:

setting each bit in std_msg::Int8 rather the whole byte?

I at the moment trying to come up with a solution such that I can set my std_msgs::Int8 bitwise instead of setting the whole byte.
The reason why i want to do that is because, i am currently using the message type as a register, in which the 4 last bits is read by a node, that performs certain actions based on that value.
is it possible to do something like std_msg::Int8 msg.data[0] = True  and thereby only set  one bit?

A:

Your exact syntax is incorrect, but you can definitely set individual bits and decode the number in a subscriber. For example, something like msg.data = 8 would set the data field to have 0b00001000 in binary. You can set values using hex/binary/decimal (see integer literals), and you can also use C++ bitwise operators to set and access individual bits.
