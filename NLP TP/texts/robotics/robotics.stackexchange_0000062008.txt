Q:

Creating the URDF in the PR2 MoveIt! Example

Hi All,
I am attempting to follow the tutorial on MoveIt! using the PR2 example in ROS Hydro.
However, it talks about using the URDF file generated "above":
Click on the browse button and navigate to the pr2.urdf file you just created above. Choose that file and then click Load Files. The Setup Assistant will load the files (this might take a few seconds) and present you with this screen:
The 'above' link goes to a section on pre-requisites. This page contains no information on creating the URDF. The URDF file contains the xacro macros but I can find no clear instructions on actually creating it.

Bjem,
If you look at the newer version of the tutorial posted here,
http://docs.ros.org/hydro/api/moveit_setup_assistant/html/doc/tutorial.html
It says:
This file gets installed in /opt/ros/hydro/share/pr2_description/robots/pr2.urdf.xacro on Ubuntu with ROS Hydro.
This would be the file that you use as the URDF.

Thank you, I successfully completed the tutorial at the site you specified. It's a shame the 'mainline' documentation doesn't say this.
