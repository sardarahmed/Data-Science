Q:

Is there an easy way to get the end effector name just from tf?

I have a node that queries move_group to get the end effector name, but uses move_group for nothing else. Ideally I would like to run this node without having to bring up move_group at all, and I don't want to hard code the name of the end effector. Is there a trivial way to solve this? I looked at the C++ code for getEndEffector in move_group_interface.cpp, but it needs some other libraries.
Is there a simple way to get this information by using only TransformListener, for instance?

A:

I can think of one way, but it may not be too nice: every MoveIt configuration package contains a name_of_robot.srdf (see wiki/SRDF). This file contains additional information not found in the robot_description among which is the name of the configured end effector. As an example, see the config of the pr2:
<!--END EFFECTOR: Purpose: Represent information about an end effector.-->
<end_effector name="right_eef" parent_link="r_wrist_roll_link" group="right_gripper" />
<end_effector name="left_eef" parent_link="l_wrist_roll_link" group="left_gripper" />

As this file is valid SRDF, you could probably parse it with the SRDF library (or just any XML parser really), and retrieve the names of the defined EEFs.
PS: obviously, this does not use TF, but it does give you the information you are after without having to use any (large) additional dependencies.

I'll keep this in mind, but for now I am going to try the solution with the parameter server. Thanks for the help.
