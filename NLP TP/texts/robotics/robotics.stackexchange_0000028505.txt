A:

According to the migration guide:

***Replacement:*** virtual double Position(const unsigned int _index = 0) const final

Thanks. Are you aware of any implementation example of Position( ) function?

I was able to do it successfully in case any one has the same question. You have to call like:

x = steering_joints[0]->Position(0);
