Q:

Network settings not saving permanently

Hi,
I set up my ubuntu laptops to network with each other following the ROS/NetworkSetup tutorials http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot/Tutorials/hydro/Network%20Configuration .
Now, I was trying to set the localhost computer to be the ROS_MASTER_URI and ROS_HOSTNAME.
I've tried both of this things:
$ > echo export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311 >> ~/.bashrc
$ > echo export ROS_HOSTNAME=localhost >> ~/.bashrc

Also I have tried,
$ export ROS_HOSTNAME=localhost
$ export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311

Both of them allow me to set the configuration for the first time I bringup anything. But after the first run, my settings go back to other ubuntu laptop that I have, which is 10.1.xx.xxx .
Any help is appreciated

I think this needs some clarification. After your first run, when you are sure that the problem is present, can you run cat ~/.bashrc and post the results ?

A:

You should check what is in your .bashrc file, and make sure that you are only setting one master and one host. Also the ROS NetworkSetup tutorial  will give you further information.

Do you know what directory this .bashrc file is in?
I tryed looking for it but no luck

Its in your home directory, try to enable the view of hidden files (ctrl-h should do this for you) . Other option is to open it from the terminal with a text editor, for example with the command $ vim .bashrc

It is still not saving permantly, I have tried all the different ways possible. I am also unsure if I have a source instalation or a deb installation. How can I know?

Sorry i dont know what you are talking about. As i understand it, when you open a new terminal ubuntu run the bashrc script. So if you set in the script the network configuration, it shoud be set every time you open a terminal. Maybe you should modify the etc/network files in ubuntu, you should search some imformation about this before you change something.
