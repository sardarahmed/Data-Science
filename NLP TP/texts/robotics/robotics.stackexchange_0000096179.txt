Q:

Where is the x86 release of ros2 foxy?

On the install page
it says: "We support Ubuntu Linux Focal Fossa (20.04) 64-bit x86 and 64-bit ARM."
But in the downloads page I can only see releases for amd and arm.
Has it not been released yet? Do I need to build from source? Or should I just download the amd version?
I have a hp laptop with a 64bit Intel I5 pro, running Ubuntu 20.04

A:

AMD64 is a reference to the architecture used by Intel and AMD, you're good to go. :)

Article on Wikipedia about this: wikipedia/X86-64.
@CraigH92: AMD was "the first" with a publicly available and popular 64bit extension to plain x86, and MS chose to follow their naming convention. So that's why we all call it amd64. It's the name of the instruction set, it does not refer to AMD as in: only AMD processors.
Intel's processors also support the amd64 (or x86-64) instruction set.
