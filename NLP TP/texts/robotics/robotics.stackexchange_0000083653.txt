Q:

libboost_system.so.1.55 vs. 1.54 on armhf (rpi3)

Hi, I'm compiling ROS Kinetic from source for the Raspberry Pi 3. Recently I started getting a lot of these warnings:
Scanning dependencies of target rosout
[ 50%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/rosout.dir/rosout.cpp.o
[100%] Linking CXX executable /home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/devel_isolated/rosout/lib/rosout/rosout
/usr/bin/ld: warning: libboost_system.so.1.54.0, needed by /usr/lib/gcc/arm-linux-gnueabihf/4.9/../../../arm-linux-gnueabihf/libconsole_bridge.so, may conflict with libboost_system.so.1.55.0
/usr/bin/ld: warning: libboost_thread.so.1.54.0, needed by /usr/lib/gcc/arm-linux-gnueabihf/4.9/../../../arm-linux-gnueabihf/libconsole_bridge.so, may conflict with libboost_thread.so.1.55.0
[100%] Built target rosout

These don't seem to affect anything, but I'd like to understand more about why these started appearing.
Edit: I have headers for 1.55.0 installed via apt, and libraries for 1.54.0 and 1.55.0:
pi@raspberry:~$ find / -name libboost_system.so* | less
/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libboost_system.so.1.54.0
/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libboost_system.so
/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libboost_system.so.1.55.0
pi@raspberry:~$ ls -l /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libboost_system.so
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 25 Sep 24  2014 /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libboost_system.so -> libboost_system.so.1.55.0

Do you have multiple versions of Boost installed?

1.55.0 and 1.54.0, see edits

Hmmm, looking at /var/log/apt/history.log, it appears that both versions were installed by rosdep. First "apt-get install -y libboost-all-dev", which pulled in all of 1.55, then "apt-get install -y libconsole-bridge-dev" which pulled in 2 libraries from 1.54.

A:

Multiple boost versions on the same machine can work, but typically only if you keep them strictly separate. See #q274016 for another question about that and some thoughts.
Did you build the 'other Boost' from sources? It can't have just "turned up" on its own.
