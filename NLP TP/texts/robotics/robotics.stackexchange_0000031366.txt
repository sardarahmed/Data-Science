Q:

cross compile ROS on Nao

Hi all,
I'm trying to cross-compile ROS on my Nao robot.
The wiki on http://www.ros.org/wiki/nao/Tutorials/Cross-Compiling says that I need Aldebaran's Cross-Compile-Toolkit (CTC) for the job.
Does anyone know where I can download CTC?
It seems http://users.aldebaran-robotics.com/ doesn't provide CTC.
Thanks.

A:

On http://users.aldebaran-robotics.com/ you need to navigate to Software --> Download --> All Downloads --> your desired version (older ones are in Archives) --> Linux --> find the CTC in the list of files.
For example this is a link to the directory containing CTC v1.10.25: http://users.aldebaran-robotics.com/index.php?option=com_docman&task=cat_view&gid=26&Itemid=
