Q:

How to localize an acoustic source underwater with a hydrophone array

I am working on an Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), and I do not know how to localize an acoustic source underwater 
I know that I will use an array of hydrophones but how can actually get the position of the acoustic source
-are there any available commercial chips for acoustic signal processing?
-are there any available books discussing that topic technically?
-is there any known strategy for underwater acoustic source localization?

A:

The simplest answer would be to use the phase difference to calculate the direction -- rotate your array until all sensors get the same phase, and you've found the direction to the source (or do some calculations based on the phase difference -- this does not require any mechanical movement).
For the distance -- use two separate arrays and triangulate the position from the two angles. If you don't have two arrays -- use the left and right half of the same array to calculate angles and go from there, the precision might suffer a bit, though.
