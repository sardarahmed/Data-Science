Q:

navigation2 cpp Action with feedback examples

Hi I have reviewed all of the documentation and source code and I am still confuse don how to set up a cpp nav action client and if necessary a server. I have used the top level pub/sub process.  But, I would like more intermediate feedback equivalent to what is provided in the Python3 BasicNavigator class and examples.  Is there an equivalent class for cpp and similar examples.  if there is documentation specific to this that I have missed, please point me to it.

A:

Track the Nav To Pose client in the Waypoint Follower as the practical demo of how to work with it https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/blob/main/nav2_waypoint_follower/src/waypoint_follower.cpp#L67. The rviz2 plugin also uses the client as another example. Overall, its the typical Action API but I understand it can be a little daunting for new users, its one of the main reasons I implemented the Waypoint Follower the way I did to be a clear demo.
