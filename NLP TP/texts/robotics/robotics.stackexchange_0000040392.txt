Q:

p3dx gazebo problem with Fuerte

Hello,
I am quite new in ROS. I simulated pioneer3dx with gazebo by doing some modifications and downloading the set of packages by
sudo apt-get install ros-electric-erratic-robot
to use erratic robot's teleop.
Now, there is another laptop with Fuerte version and I want to do the same thing on it, but it seems impossible in this way, and downloading erratic_robot package alone gives some errors because of some missing files. Can you tell me how I can move the robot? or is there another teleop packages for moving p3dx?

A:

It's possible that the p3dx package has not been upgraded to Fuerte yet. In Fuerte, Gazebo was upgraded to version 1.0, so there have been a number of changes. If the p3dx package has not been modified, it very well might not work with Fuerte.
