Q:

Failed to connect to server (When ROS is connected to the robot)

Hi All,
I'm having difficulty connecting to my fanuc robot with ROS Melodic. I followed this tutorial to configure "http://wiki.ros.org/fanuc/Tutorials". When I send this commandï¼š
robot_interface_streaming.launch robot_ip:=192.168.20.22 J23_factor:=0 use_bswap:=true

I got this error:
Failed to connect to server, rc: -1. Error: 'Connection refused' (errno: 111)
Failed to receive message lenth
Failed to receive  incoming message

when I ping 192.168.20.22, I received responses from the robot. So I don't know what went wrong, or did I configure something wrong? Does the operation of the Fanuc controller require any operation, which I do not know at this time.

A:

First, and pedantic, but: Melodic is EOL. There is no support for it any more.
As to your connection issue: I'd suggest to make sure you installed everything on the robot controller as well, and have started the TP programs on the Fanuc teach pendant. Without those programs, the ROS nodes will not be able to connect.

Thank you, I noticed that Fanuc's TP program was not activated.
