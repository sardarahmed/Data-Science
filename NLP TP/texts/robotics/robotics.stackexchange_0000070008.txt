Q:

Can't subscribe to tf with roslibjs

Hello Community,
I have a problem with the roslibjs Library. Right now I try to do this tutorial:  roslibjs TfClient Tutorial
But I can't get it to work. The rosbridge returns this error:
[ERROR] [WallTime: 1445335466.389260] [Client 10] [id: subscribe:/tf2_web_republisher/feedback:4] subscribe: Unable to load the manifest for package tf2_web_republisher. Caused by: tf2_web_republisher
[ERROR] [WallTime: 1445335466.393854] [Client 10] [id: subscribe:/tf2_web_republisher/result:5] subscribe: Unable to load the manifest for package tf2_web_republisher. Caused by: tf2_web_republisher
[ERROR] [WallTime: 1445335466.523221] [Client 10] [id: publish:/tf2_web_republisher/goal:6] publish: Cannot infer topic type for topic /tf2_web_republisher/goal as it is not yet advertised

I am not quite sure what this means. Any help is appreciated.

Is there a good procedure for installing tf2_web_republisher?
