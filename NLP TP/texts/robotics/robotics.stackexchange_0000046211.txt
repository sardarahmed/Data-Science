Q:

object_recognition_core failed to run corre

hello,
Im fairly new here and I've been trying ROS for fun for a few days and finally got stuck at object_recognition_core.
I finished the installation of fuerte on Ubuntu 12.04 and then object_recognition from the ROS repositories:

sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-object-recognition-core
Then I followed the quick guide of this page:
(ecto.willowgarage.com/recognition/ros_quickguide.html)
unfortunately,I failed to run this in the third Terminal:

rosrun object_recognition_core orb_template.py -o my_textured_plane
 it says:

[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named orb_template.py below /opt/ros/fuerte/share/object_recognition_core
 
 Anyone knows how to solve this?

A:

orb_template.py is now found in the object_recognition_capture package.
