Q:

vrpn_client_ros Unable to Locate Package

Hi all,
I'm pretty new to ROS and linux, so my questions may seem pretty basic, sorry. I'm using Ubuntu 18.04 and ROS Melodic.
I am currently following this tutorial to install vrpn_client_ros.
I entered the below command in the terminal, and the response I get is below that.
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-vrpn-client-ros -y

Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-kinetic-vrpn-client-ros

Now I have two questions:

Are programs built for older distributions of ROS able to be installed/run on newer distributions of ROS? If not, that would explain why it's unable to locate the package.
According to the GitHub here, it seems like a newer version of the package has been updated for Melodic. However, I'm not sure if it's available for people to install yet. Would anyone possibly be able to give some insight?

Thank you very much in advance! Being new to ROS, linux, and GitHub, there's been a lot to take in.

A:

You can't install install Kinetic packages using apt while using Ubuntu 18.04 as they require 16.04. You can try cloning it into your workspace and compiling it yourself.
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone -b kinetic-devel https://github.com/ros-drivers/vrpn_client_ros.git
cd ..
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash

I used the kinetic-devel branch as it appears to be the latest one.
