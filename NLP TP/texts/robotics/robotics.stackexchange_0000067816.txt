Hi i'm having the same problem, did you manage to solve it?

A:

What path are you using to save the file to? I had the same problem when I tried to reference a path with the ~ to the home directory. Possibly the program used to create the map is not able to write to this directory - someone with a better knowledge of hector_geotiff can elaborate on this. I solved this by giving the full path to the directory.
Doesn't work: <arg name = "map_file_path" value="~/maps"
Works: <arg name="/home/username/maps"

Thanks for your advice! I had solved this problem last years but I forget the detail approach.
I remember that I also give the full path to the directory. I think you are right. Thanks again.
