Q:

Build Failed when running ./gradlew install for rosjava

Ubuntu version 10.10 maverick
ROS version electric
java 1.6.0
I get the following error:  Any HELP?
(I can post stacktrace if that helps)
(I should mention I already tried the suggestions at:
http://answers.ros.org/question/42748/rosjava_core-build-error-apache_xmlrpc_commoncompile/)

Building > :apache_xmlrpc_common:compileJava > Resolving dependencies ':apache_xmlrpc_common:apache_xmlrpc_common:compileJava

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':apache_xmlrpc_common:compileJava'.

java.lang.NullPointerException (no error message)

Try:
Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace. Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.

BUILD FAILED
Total time: 6.569 secs

Yes, please provide the stack trace, the command you run, and the gradle version (by running the command with --version)

A:

You probably don't have the JDK installed.
sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk
