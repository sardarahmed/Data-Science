Q:

RGBDSLAM v2 waiting for

Hello guys,
i'm currently testing some RGBD algorithms, but when i use RGBDSLAM v2 i cant get any input data (Waiting for visual image on topic /xtion/rgb/image_rect_color and waiting for depth image on topic /xtion/depth_registered/hw_registered/image_rect_raw)
On this two topics is data. Rtabmap working without any problem.
Here is my launch file:

<launch>
  <node pkg="rgbdslam" type="rgbdslam" name="rgbdslam" cwd="node" required="true" output="screen"> 
    <!-- Input data settings-->
    <param name="config/topic_image_mono"              value="/xtion/rgb/image_rect_color"/> 
    <param name="config/topic_image_depth"             value="/xtion/depth_registered/hw_registered/image_rect_raw"/>
    <param name="config/topic_points"                  value=""/> <!--if empty, poincloud will be reconstructed from image and depth -->

    <!-- These are the default values of some important parameters -->
    <param name="config/feature_extractor_type"        value="ORB"/><!-- also available: SIFT, SIFTGPU, SURF, SURF128 (extended SURF), ORB. -->
    <param name="config/feature_detector_type"         value="ORB"/><!-- also available: SIFT, SURF, GFTT (good features to track), ORB. -->
    <param name="config/detector_grid_resolution"      value="3"/><!-- detect on a 3x3 grid (to spread ORB keypoints and parallelize SIFT and SURF) -->
    <param name="config/max_keypoints"                 value="600"/><!-- Extract no more than this many keypoints -->
    <param name="config/max_matches"                   value="300"/><!-- Keep the best n matches (important for ORB to set lower than max_keypoints) -->

    <param name="config/min_sampled_candidates"        value="4"/><!-- Frame-to-frame comparisons to random frames (big loop closures) -->
    <param name="config/predecessor_candidates"        value="4"/><!-- Frame-to-frame comparisons to sequential frames-->
    <param name="config/neighbor_candidates"           value="4"/><!-- Frame-to-frame comparisons to graph neighbor frames-->
    <param name="config/ransac_iterations"             value="100"/>
    <param name="config/cloud_creation_skip_step"      value="2"/><!-- subsample the images' pixels (in both, width and height), when creating the cloud (and therefore reduce memory consumption) -->

    
    <param name="config/cloud_display_type"            value="POINTS"/><!-- Show pointclouds as points (as opposed to TRIANGLE_STRIP) -->
    <param name="config/pose_relative_to"              value="largest_loop"/><!-- optimize only a subset of the graph: "largest_loop" = Everything from the earliest matched frame to the current one.

    <param name="config/backend_solver"                value="pcg"/><!-- pcg is faster and good for continuous online optimization, cholmod and csparse are better for offline optimization (without good initial guess)-->
    <param name="config/optimizer_skip_step"           value="1"/><!-- optimize only every n-th frame -->
  </node>
</launch>

Im using Ros Indigo (Ubuntu 14.04) with an asus xtion camera. What i'm doing wrong ? :/

A:

Looks about right. When comparing to the default launch file, I see that you are using the hw_registered topic (make sure that there is data on this topic), and you are not starting openni from the same launch file (so I guess you start it externally?).

Hey,
yes I'm starting it externally and on the hw_registered topic is data. Futhermore I have solved the problem. I created a relay from /xtion/rgb/camera_info to /camera/rgb/camera_info.

Ah, the camera_info is the culprit. No need to relay, just set the "camera_info_topic" parameter to the correct topic then.
