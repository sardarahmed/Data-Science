Q:

Hydro install hangs on "ldconfig deferred processing now taking place"

Hello,
I am an existing ROS Groovy user on my Ubuntu 12.04 machine. I have been trying to install ROS Hydro using
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-desktop-full

but no matter what I do, the installation suddenly stops at the following:
Setting up ros-hydro-rqt-tf-tree (0.3.3-0precise-20140130-2331-+0000) ...
Setting up ros-hydro-rqt-robot-plugins (0.3.3-0precise-20140208-0437-+0000) ...
Setting up ros-hydro-stage (4.1.1-5precise-20140130-1745-+0000) ...
Setting up ros-hydro-stage-ros (1.7.2-0precise-20140201-1433-+0000) ...
Setting up ros-hydro-simulators (1.0.2-0precise-20140208-0545-+0000) ...
Setting up ros-hydro-desktop-full (1.0.2-0precise-20140208-0614-+0000) ...
Processing triggers for libc-bin ...
ldconfig deferred processing now taking place
turtlebot@TurtleBook:~$ 

If I try to run the install again, I get:
ros-hydro-desktop-full is already the newest version.
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 114 not upgraded.

..but I can clearly see it has not installed as opt/ros/hydro has no "stacks" folder.
I can repeat the process by calling apt-get remove and then apt-get autoremove, but it never completes properly. I've tried using a different internet connection and that doesn't help anything.
Does anyone know why this happens? If I need to provide more information on my setup, please do let me know.
Thanks in advance.

A:

It looks like the installation has completed successfully. Are there other folders in /opt/ros/hydro ? Does /opt/ros/hydro/setup.sh exist?
I think the migration to catkin has done away with the stacks folder. I wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't exist any more.

You are right! I feel very silly right now.
I suppose I was expecting some sort of message that indicated the installation was finished, as well as the fact that I was so sure I'd seen reference to a stacks folder in Hydro before. Thanks!
