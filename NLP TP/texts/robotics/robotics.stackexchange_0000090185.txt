Q:

fail to connect denso hs45452 robot

Hello everyone, I'm working on a tutorial http://wiki.ros.org/denso_robot_ros/Tutorials/How%20to%20control%20an%20RC8%20with%20MoveIt%21
version indigo, about How to control an RC8 with MoveIt! .
After I finished the tutorial, I launched bringup file, but get this error,
[ERROR] [1548245807.887070308]: Failed to change to slave mode. (83500126) 

And I checked the teach pendant, it says error code (83500126) needing registering(invoke source, PC). But I have followed the tutorial and registered b-cap slave. Because of this error, I got the following error
[ERROR] [1548245821.516886560]: MoveItSimpleControllerManager: Action client not connected: hs45452/arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory

Would you like to help me on this problem?
