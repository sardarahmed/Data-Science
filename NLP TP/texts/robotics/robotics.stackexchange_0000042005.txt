Q:

Using Threading Building Blocks with ROS

Hi,
I couldn't find any information about how to use ROS with Threading Building Blocks (TBB). If I add
<rosdep name="tbb" />

to my manifest.xml and do "rosdep install" I get the error "Failed to find rosdep tbb for package ... on OS:ubuntu version:natty". Do I have to create my own rosdep.yaml file? I'm working with ROS Electric on Ubuntu Natty.
Thanks for your help!

A:

This is confusing, because rosdep changed significantly between Electric and Fuerte.

On Fuerte it resolves to libtbb-dev.

On Electric, it needs to be defined in some stack's rosdep.yaml.

What does this show?
$ rosdep where_defined tbb

UPDATE: your result shows that tbb is not defined by any stack in your $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.
If you are developing a stack of your own, add a rosdep.yaml containing something like this stanza:
tbb:
  arch: intel-tbb
  ubuntu: libtbb-dev
  fedora: tbb-devel

the output is:
$ rosdep where_defined tbb
tbb defined in set([])

thanks, this works :)
Finally, I had to add a command to link against tbb to my CMakeLists.txt:
target_link_libraries(mynode tbb)
