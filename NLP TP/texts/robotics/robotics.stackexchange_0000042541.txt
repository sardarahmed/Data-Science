Q:

ROS in multi-robot applications?

Greetings,
In my knowledge, most development in ROS is for single robot operations.
Is ROS being used in any multi-robot applications?
Any open-source initiatives which focuses on multi-robot systems?
Edit 1:
Are there any released / beta packages involving Multi-robots e.g. exploration, tracking etc?

A:

Searching on answers.ros.org gives a few results:

tag multi-robots

tag multi_robots

So I guess people are definitely working on multi-robot applications.
