Q:

Wifi connection issues with ROS 2 and Humble

I've been having wifi connection issues since upgrade to ROS 2 Humble.
The connection will mostly work, but then drop for some period of time.
I'm posting this "question" and answer here in case others have issues.
It might NOT be related to ROS 2, DDS, or Humble at all.

I'd suggest posting your edit as an answer.

I will post answer once we are finished testing.   In the mean time, this fix seems to have improved wifi:
I disabled Wi-Fi power management directly by editing:
sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/default-wifi-powersave-on.conf
Then changed the value from 3 to 2, saved changes and rebooted.
Still need to do more stress testing with ROS 2 specific  code before I say its the "answer".

A:

Disabling power save seemed to fix issues.  I have not reverted with latest kernel updates to see if fixed in standard kernel, but disabling power save fixed issues I was having.
