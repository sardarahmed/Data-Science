Q:

rosjava installation on macosx results in an error

Following these instructions http://wiki.ros.org/rosjava/Tutorials/hydro/Installation, at the step when rosdep install --from-paths src -i -y is executed
I get
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
rosjava_build_tools: No definition of [python-rosinstall-generator] for OS [osx]

This error looks similar to this error.
I checked rosjava_build_tools folder and .rosinstall is missing.
I added rosjava_build_tools to ROS_PACKAGE_PATH following the advice given here.
Any help is appreciated.
EDIT: moving to the next step and calling catkin_make does not produce errors.

A:

It looks like the rosdep rule for the python rosinstall_generator is missing on OSX. You should open a ticket or a pull request against rosdistro to fix this.
See the doc on contributing rosdep rules for more information.
