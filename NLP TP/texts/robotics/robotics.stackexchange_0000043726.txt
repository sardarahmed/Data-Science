Q:

Hector_Slam Imu How to set up the tf tree

Hi all
I'm currently working with hector_slam for creating maps.
I have written a package for my imu which offers me a rotation matrix, so that i can calculate roll, pitch and yaw.
My question is: How should i connect them to the hector_slam tf tree?
Roll, pitch to base_stabilized->base_link
and
Yaw for orientation to base_footprint->base_stabilized?
or can i put them all together to base_stabilized->base_link? Makes it any difference?
Thx for your response

A:

The yaw for base_link and base_stabilized should be the same, it's only the roll and pitch angles that differ between both, as also described in the setup tutorial.
You can use the hector_imu_attitude_to_tf node to conveniently publish the base_stabilized->base_link transform using a IMU message. I just added this to the tutorial, too.

I have mpu6050 and raspberry pi. I have written a code to publish the yaw, pitch and roll from imu. Now, how can I make hector_imu_attitude_to_tf node get this data? I mean, should I change any lines of code or will it directly subscribe to these values?
