Q:

What is the relationship between stack names on the ROS wiki and its repository's name?

Our lab hosts code with Google Code and was planing on releasing each stack as a separate repository.  Unfortunately, this scheme also generates very ugly repostority URLs as repository names aren't allowed to have underscores (which I've replaced with dashes) but this isn't a preferred ROS naming convention as I understand it.  Also, the repository name is also prepended with Google Code project name: https://code.google.com/p/gt-ros-pkg.my-stack-name/
My question is what happens when a repository with this name gets indexed and linked to a page on the wiki? Is there a way to turn "gt-ros-pkg.my-stack-name" to something more friendly like "my_stack_name"?

A:

When you start moving to individual stack repositories, the best solution is to submit a web-accessible rosinstall for indexing (simply e-mail the link to ros-users).  rosinstall's "local-name" attribute will ensure that the stack has the correct name when it is indexed.
