Q:

cancellAllGoals() to stop a robot?

I'm quite new to ActionLibs and while going trough the several tutorials regarding action servers and clients, I started to think about the client functions

cancellAllGoals()
cancellGoal()

I'm currently using move_base to send goals to a robot, with action libs.
Supposing I gave to a robot a goal position in a map, can I stop it using one of the two aforementioned functions?
Thank you all,
T
EDIT after dornhege reply:
This is the reply I hoped to receive. Assuming that cancellAllGoals() actually stops the robot's motion, I have the following problem..
typedef actionlib::SimpleActionClient<move_base_msgs::MoveBaseAction> MoveBaseClient;
MoveBaseClient ac("move_base", true);
â€¦
ac.cancelAllGoals();
Previous code doesn't stop the robot. Am i doing something wrong?
(consider that the way I send goals works fine)

A:

Yes, that's what they're intended for.
For example, I usually put this in a SIGINT handler for our executive to stop all actions, when the user interrupts with Ctrl-C.
