Q:

pr2_gazebo_plugins, ROS and Gazebo 1.9

Hi folks.
I'm currently working on a robot and found an URDF file including Gazebo plugins. This file is based on pr2_gazebo_plugins. I'm working on Gazebo 1.9. I managed to spawn my robot in Gazebo but the topics are not feed.
I have read in the document about PR2/Gazebo:
Note: This tutorial refers to a previous version of Gazebo that is no longer fully supported. In the future this tutorial needs to be updated to use the new gazebo_ros_pkgs interface.
Does it mean that the description file should be adapted to gazebo_ros_pkgs? I just want to be sure before breaking everything.
Thx in advance for your answer!

A:

I answer YES to my own question. I have adapted my previous URDF file which was based on pr2_controller to ros_controller. That works very nicely.

Great, I'm glad this worked - ros_controllers is mostly a port of pr2_controllers with the name just being removed
