Q:

How can I save the RVIZ visualization to an image file

Hello,
I am publishing data trough different publisher, mainly with visualization_msgs::Marker and  nav_msgs::GridCells objects.
I get a visualization in my RVIZ window and what I want to do is to save this visualization into an image of the size I want.
Do you know if there is a plug-in who can do that ? Or if there is some other way to do that ?
I don't want to do a screen shot because i would like the size of my image to be bigger than the actual definition of my screen.

A:

Take a look at #q142351 and #q258251 - rviz_camera_stream should do what you want.
