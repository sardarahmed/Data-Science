Q:

ros2 run python executable not found

I am working with ROS2 ardent, using Colcon to build.
The build is suceessful and I can also see my executable in <ws/build/package-name/build/lib/> but still when I run the package using ros2 run, no executables are found.

Did you source the setup.bash file in the install folder ??
source <ros2_ws>/install/setup.bash
You can add the command to ~/.bashrc so that you don't have to source every time you open a terminal.

Yes, I have sourced the setup.bash file, still no executable found

A:

I found the problem.
In the setup.py file, I had a missing , for the last node in the entry pointsi.e.

entry_points={
    'console_scripts': [
        'listener = demo_nodes_py.topics.listener:main',
        'talker = demo_nodes_py.topics.talker:main'
        'listener_qos = demo_nodes_py.topics.listener_qos:main'
       
    ],
},

NOTE :  The missing `,` before the `listener_qos` node.

The strange thing here is, compiler compiles all the 3 nodes and I can see in the <ws/build/package-name/build/lib/> folder. Shouldnt the compiler just ignore the 3rd node listener_qos in this case ?
