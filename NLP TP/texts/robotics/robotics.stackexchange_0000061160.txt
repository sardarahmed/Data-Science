Q:

How to use state_publisher launch file

I have managed to solve most of my problems, but the missing thing with me is with the CMakeLists.txt of the hand_pub. (BTW should I edit it for the hand_urdf ??)
I have added the following in my CMakeLists.txt, is there any thing I should add?

find_package(catkin REQUIRED
COMPONENTS roscpp rospy std_msgs)
catkin_package()
include_directories(include
${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS})
> add_executable(state_publisher
> state_publisher.cpp)
> target_link_libraries(state_publisher
> ${catkin_LIBRARIES})

Because I am getting an error when trying catkin_make. I am not sure if my cpp file is wrong or it is not able to compile at all.
my old post:
I have finished my URDF file and saved it in catkin_ws/src/hand/hand_urdf/urdf (its name is hand.urdf)
I was able to open it in rviz using :

roslaunch urdf_tutorial display.launch model:=Hand.urdf gui:=True

(the current directory being the one stated above) and everything works and I can move the hand and everything using the state_publisher gui.
Then I worked on the state_publisher, I did the state_publisher.cpp and saved it in catkin_ws/src/hand/hand_pub and wrote a launch file called display.launch and saved it in catkin_ws/src/hand/hand_pub/launch
I think I have something wrong with my launch file which is:

My question is do I have something wrong with the directories? Do I have something wrong with my launch file? Most importantly how do I run everything together from terminal (I think that I have to run the launch file but what is the exact command for that) i.e. for the urdf I called roslaunch urdf_tutorial display.launch model:=Hand.urdf gui:=True.

If you are getting an error, please post the error.

A:

You also need to upload the urdf to the parameter server. Do this by adding the following line to your launch file.
<param name="robot_description" textfile="$(find hand_urdf)/urdf/hand.urdf" />
(assuming that I'm reading your directories correctly)
