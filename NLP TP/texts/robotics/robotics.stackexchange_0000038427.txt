Q:

Octomap with turtlebot

Hi,
Has anyone used Octomap with turtlebot. I see there are no tutorials on the octomap. So i just wanted to know if someone successfully used it for their work and could give me some heads up on the same.
I would like to create a 3D occupancy grid map of the surroundings using the kinect on the turtlebot and navigate on the same.
Any suggestions and pointers are much appreciated!!!
Thanks,
Karthik

A:

Check out octomap_server and its documentation. That's what you need to build up 3D occupancy maps from any point cloud source. There is an example launch file in the package which you only need to modify. It should be straightforward if you have good odometry or a localization in a 2D map running along.
