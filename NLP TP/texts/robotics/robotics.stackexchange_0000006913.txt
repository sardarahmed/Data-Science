Q:

What is the reduced form of this block diagram?

What is the reduced form of this block diagram? I can't see any solution way :(

A:

Starting with your system and some guidelines for block diagram reduction (PDF):

Move the pickoff point between G2 and G3 to before G2
Combine G2 and G3 into one block (G2G3)
Combine G4 with the G2G3 block (G4 + G2G3)
Combine G2 and H1 (G2H1)
Redraw the rats nest after G1
Duplicate the H2 line to give a feedback loop around (G4 + G2G3) and
a feedback line towards (G2H1)
Collapse the (G4 + G2G3) and H2 loop
Make room for more work!
Move the summing junction located just before G1 to just after G1
Move the pickoff point just before the big transfer function to
 just after it (what was the G4 + G2G3 stuff)
At this point everything should be easy
Collapse summing junctions into summed blocks
Collapse feedback loops
Collapse feedback loops
Collapse feedback loops

Done! (see the pic below for details) Please check my work; I did everything in paint, but this is the route you should take. Moving summing junctions and pickoff points is key to solving this, as it is in nearly every instance.
