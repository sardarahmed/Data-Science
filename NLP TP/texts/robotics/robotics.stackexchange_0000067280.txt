Q:

static transformation publisher

I want to do a static transformation
the actual frame is in x forward y right z up
the new frame if x forward y left and z up
I want to do transformation from the new to the actual frame using the static publish
<launch>

 <node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="laser" args="0 0 0 x y z w  /uav/base_link_ENU /laser  100"/>

</launch>

What should I replace the x y z and w
And do I need to have a listener ??

A:

x y z w is only used if you want to specify orientation using a quaternion. If you want to use Euler angles, you can use the other parameter order. From the static_transform_publisher:
Usage: static_transform_publisher x y z yaw pitch roll frame_id child_frame_id  period (milliseconds)

Note the order ypr instead of the often used rpy.

Thank you  :)

Make sure to use radians for the yaw, pitch and roll.

@gvdhoorn Can I know what are the advantages and disadvantages of using Euler over Quaternions?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-09-16:
This would be a rather broad discussion @AM97.
One of the biggest advantages of quaternions would be they don't suffer from gimbal lock and have a single unique representation and interpretation. Euler angles both suffer from gimbal lock and have at least 12 different orders of rotation (note @malharjajoo's comment about the order of rotations).
For more, I'd refer you to sites like wikipedia (for a quick overview) or the relevant (math) literature.

@gvdhoorn I understand why we are using Quaternions. But I would also like to know what are the benefits if I use Eulers?.
P.S I know to avoid Gimbal lock is one of the main reason to use Quaternions even though they are little complex. I am just curious to know what will be advantages if we use euler in robotics?
I think we can keep track of when you approach a singularity (gimbal lock). In the singularity, angles may flip instantaneously from 90 to -90 degrees but although it would be difficult in the real world.

The advance of Euler is: It is easier to imagine rotation around the three axes z y x, than to imagine Quaternions.
