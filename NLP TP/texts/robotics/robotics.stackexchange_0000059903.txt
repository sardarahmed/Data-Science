Q:

How to check the existence of a node in .launch

I'm starting with launch files and I couldn't find any tutorial about it.
If you can share any paper, guide or explanatory website I would really appreciate it.
In addition, I want to put an "if" inside the launch file in order to create a node only IF it doesn't exits yet. ¿How can I do it?

Have you tried the roslaunch wiki page? The Tutorials section should help you get started.

Roslaunch cannot check for the (non)existence of a specific node. There is partial support for conditionals (if and unless), but it is used for conditional inclusion / evaluation.
