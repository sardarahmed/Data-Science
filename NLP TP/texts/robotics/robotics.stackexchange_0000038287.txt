Q:

Can I pass a nav_msgs/Path message directly to local planner?

Hi. Within the move_base, the nav_msgs/Path is passed internally from the global planner to the local planner.
If I generate a path message with an external node, how can I pass it to the local planner within move_base? Should I always write a plugin that adheres to global planner interface? Is there a way to pass it as a "standard" ros message?
Thanks!

A:

If you want to use all of the functionality of move_base, you're going to have to write your own global planner plugin. base_local_planner does not subscribe to a path, so you cannot publish it over a topic. In fact, base_local_planner has no external access at all. It can only be accessed by using move_base and interface methods, and move_base provides no methods for externally setting the plan.
