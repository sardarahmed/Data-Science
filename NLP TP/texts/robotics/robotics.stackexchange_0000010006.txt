Q:

Build a simple robot to learn ROS

I am a beginner to ROS and I wanted to know if I could build a simple robot to learn ROS. 
I currently have the following components available:

Arduino Uno
Simple two wheeled robot chassis
Some motors
L293D motor driver
Some ultrasonic sensors
Some infrared sensors

A:

If you are interested in learning ROS but do not have sophisticated hardware available, you can use the Gazebo simulator to simulate a robot and use ROS with that.
Keep in mind that ROS is not the only way to write software for robots, and also not necessarily the best way.
