Q:

Suspend a publisher

Hi! In my system there are 2 nodes that publish on a topic concurrently.
This situation leads an unstable state for my system, so I would suspend publication (only for that topic) from one of the two nodes.
I wouldn't work on the code of two nodes.
There is a way to pause the subscribtion of a publisher to a topic?
Thanks

A:

With a topic_tools mux you can feed both inputs into a node and select which gets published out with a service call:
http://wiki.ros.org/topic_tools/mux
So instead of
node1 -> topicA 
node2 -> topicA
topicA -> node3

it would be
node1 -> topicB -> mux
node2 -> topicC -> mux
mux -> topicA  (which is a copy of either B or C depending on mux selection)
topicA -> node3

thank you for the answer, but following your suggestion I should work on the code of node1 and node2 to divert respectively node1 to topic B and node2 to topicC. Right?
In this case your solution isn't good for me.

You don't have to alter the code to change where publications go, remapping can change that at runtime: http://wiki.ros.org/Remapping%20Arguments or http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML/remap
