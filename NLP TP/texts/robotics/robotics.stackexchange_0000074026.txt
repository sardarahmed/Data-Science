A:

You need a package to subscribe to a topic published by the sensor's package then publish it as another topic containing the values you need. After that you can subscribe again to do your traitement..
To do that you need:
Writing a Simple Publisher and Subscriber (C++):

Or more advance tutorial where you can create your own message type:
