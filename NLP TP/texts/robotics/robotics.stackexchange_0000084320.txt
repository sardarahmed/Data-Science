Q:

Traverse a 3D building

I have a drone which I would like to find the better way to traverse an 3D buildings from start point to an end point, regarding some conditons:
1- the drone must pass throught all the possible aisles of the buildings at lest once and as few times as possible, i.e. the drone must cover all the environment;
2- the 3D building is already known (not a mapping case), so the drone doesnÂ´t use any kind of sensor to perform this task.
Anyone knows the best algorithm to do this task?
I kown there are some grid-based (A*, D*) and some other sample-based like RRT.
And how can I feed the algorithm?

A:

This sounds similar to the seven bridges of konigsberg problem.
So you'll have to convert your 3D map of the building into a graph before solving this, this step is probably the hardest part of this challenge and will depend on what type of representation your map is in. If it is a mesh then finding the genus of it is probably a good start.

Thanks for replying. Actually my map is a Collada file that built in an 3D model toll and exported to gazebo simulator. So  I have it in  sdf as well.
