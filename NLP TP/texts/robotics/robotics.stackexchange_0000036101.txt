A:

Generating odometry information from a camera or depth-sensor like a Kinect is an incredibly difficult problem. Vslam is an attempt to generate visual odometry data from a stereo-camera setup. The Kinect can provide you with the same information as a stereo camera system, in that it publishes an image and a depth map. I believe there have been attempts to use vslam with the Kinect before, but I'm not sure what kind of reliability people have been getting.
Building a 3D obstacle map using SLAM and gmapping can easily be done with the Kinect, however.  You can find an example here.

Building a 3D obstacle map using SLAM and gmapping can be easily done with Kinect instead of a laser scanner, but not without an odometry source. The question was to obtain odometry from laser. I've tried that with Kinect, kinect_to_laser, and laser_scan_matcher. But the results were rather bad
