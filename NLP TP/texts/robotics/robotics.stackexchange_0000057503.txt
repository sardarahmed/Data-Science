Q:

Simulated robots in Gazebo/Hydro

Hello,
in Hydro, are there some working robot simulations? I mean Gazebo models etc. I know only about Turtlebot but I would rather do some experiments with an omnidirectional platform. Unfortunately, PR2 simulator stack is not available (doesn't compile) as well as Care-O-Bot (not released but there is hydro branch on github - need to try it)...

Thanks for tip. But I need simulated sensors like camera, 3D laser etc.

A:

I do not know any for Gazebo, but Stage Simulations are working in Hydro, if that is an option for you.
