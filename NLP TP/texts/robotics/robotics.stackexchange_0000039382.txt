Q:

android_camera_tutorial consuming high memory (raw_image) slow image refresh

Hello, The android_camera tutorial memory consumption is too high. I just upgraded to new version of rosjava_android. I am using one mobile device as RosCameraPreview node which runs roscore and transmits images to another android device (motorola xoom) which subscribes to the message. Both seem to consume high memory and I can see GC constantly running. The frame changes approximately 30 seconds on the ImageTransport side
I rarely see the message onFlyCompress. I think this version publishes /camera/raw_image/compressed, that may be the issue, how can I subscribe to /camera/image/compressed ?
The previous version I had was working very well. I recently upgraded to new version. Any ideas to improve the performance ?
Regards
GOPI
