Invoking "make -j2 -l2" failed

Here is the file tree:
pluginlib_tutorial_
- CMakeLists.txt
- package.xml
- polygon_plugins.xml
+ src
 - polygon_loader.cpp
 - polygon_plugins.cpp
+ include
 + polygon_tutorials_
  - polygon_base.h
  - polygon_plugins.h

I'm lost as to why polygon_base.h is not being found.
~/catkin_ws/src/pluginlib_tutorials$ find . -name polygon_base.h
.include/pluginlib_tutorials_/polygon_base.h

I was concerned that maybe the include path was not looking in the "include" folder so I tried the absolute path as well
/home/users/jackson/catkin_ws/src/pluginlib_tutorials_/include/pluginlib_tutorials/polygon_base.h

Which still did not work. What am I missing?

A:

In your CMakeLists.txt, you need to tell the compiler to look for include files in your include directory.
You can do this by adding the following line to your CMakeLists.txt:
include_directories(include)
