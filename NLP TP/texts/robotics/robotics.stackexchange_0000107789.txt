Q:

Robot won't move and laserScan won't show in RVIZ

I have a 4 wheeled robot with a LIDAR on the robot. I am able to move the robot in Gazebo and the lidar "scans"(if that's the right term for the blue lines coming out of it) are showing up in Gazebo. But when I open RVIZ and try to show the laserScan points(?) on in RVIZ nothing will show and the robot doesn't move either. So I am not really sure what I am doing wrong at the moment. I don't know much about robot_state_publisher and joint_state_publisher but I know they are running when I run the launch file. Although I have a working robot I am still very new to ROS so apologies if I've made a rookie mistake.
here is a link to my github and the launch file that will run the robot. Use teleop keyboard node to control the robot.
Some guidance on what the issue could be is very much appreciated. thanks.

So after a lot of research I managed to fix the issue with the laserscan points not showing in RViz. I used the LiDAR implementation from turtlebot3's description for the 'melodic-devel' version which is the version I am using and then I modified it to be fixed to the chassis etc so that it is correctly positioned in my urdf structure if that's the right way to put it. Now it shows the laser points but the robot won't move in RViz lol so now I have to fix that. I have updated the files on my GitHub so you can have a look at the lidar.xacro file to see the lidar implementation if you are having the same problem.
