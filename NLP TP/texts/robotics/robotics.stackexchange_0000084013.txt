Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Loggers in ROS

I'm trying to understand loggers in ROS. The roscpp overview page mentions different loggers. And when you use the NAMED macros, they make "child" loggers. It also mentions there is more information in a configuration file that is not linked.
What is a logger? And what is a child logger and the need/use case for it?
Thank you.

A:

Logger allows programmer to control the verbosity of the print statements, with change of verbosity level in configuration file, obviously without recompiling the code. As you have read in the Overview page, ROS logger support different versions. By changing the verbosity level in the configuration file, one can control what will get printed on the system console. Please read section 2 of rosconsole page for further details. Also rqt_console, allow much better control over print statements and display of them.
