Q:

Get all messages from topic

Hi all,
it is a simple question but I see that there is no topic on it. I have a topic on which a publisher is publishing data (string) with a queue of 10 messages.
On the other side, I want to subscribe it through a subscriber (with queue 5).
Is there a way to get all messages (or at least the first 5) published on this topic?
I tried with a callback function of the subscriber taking a vector with no results.
Thanks a lot for any answering,
Neostek

A:

The point is that I publish on this topic different type of data and I want to store in memory the last X ones since I want to read them only with a certain frequency. I think the best solution is to modify my callback function in such a way it stores data with a simple array. Thanks a lot for your reply!
