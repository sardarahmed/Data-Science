Update
It is possible to install and use ROS Lunar on Windows 10 thanks to WSL:

This is the best way to use ROS on Windows right now, though it is not perfect.

The Windows installation page links to useful information regarding ROS on Windows. Please be aware that ROS on Windows is still very experimental. If you want the full "ROS experience", you should consider installing Linux.

I believe it's important to recognise that ROSonWSL is not the same as having a native Win32/64 ROS. WSL does not have the same level of access to Windows resources, so 'driver' components wanting to access hw (usb, gpus for gpgpu fi) will not work (easily).
