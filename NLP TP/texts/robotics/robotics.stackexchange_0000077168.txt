Q:

Rosbagging MoveIt! Best practise

Hi Everybody
Every once in a while I see some strange movements executed by our robots (mitsubishi, fanuc, ... - industrial 6-axis). Since execution has continued already it's of course difficult to debug this. I would like to be able to record both what I told the robot to do and what it then did.
I think rosbagging /joint_path_command and /joint states should do the trick. How do I play back those? I would like to see them visualized in rviz
Does anybody do this? Got some code to share?
Thanks a lot
Simon

Hi Simon,
I have done something similar before and I used a publisher with type moveit_msgs::DisplayRobotState (easily visualized using the rviz RobotState plugin). It should be pretty easy to load the bag file and step through the relevant states, visualizing both the /joint_states and /joint_path_command states. Unfortunately I can't share any code on that at the moment.
Another, perhaps easier option would be to use moveit_visual_tools.
Good luck
