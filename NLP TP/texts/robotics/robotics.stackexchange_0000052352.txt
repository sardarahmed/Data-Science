Q:

Is the repositories list being maintained?

There seems to be a little bit of duplication between the repositories list that is manually created, and the packages list which I believe is automatically generated from the rosdoc/hydro/doc.yaml (etc) file. Am I right and do we still need this repositories list?

A:

The list is not being maintained and should probably be removed to avoid out of date information.
