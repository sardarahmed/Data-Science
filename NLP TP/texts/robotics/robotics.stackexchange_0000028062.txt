Q:

Setting max speed of collisions

There are sharp edges in the imported collada mesh I am running my robot in and when the robot collides with the edges it gets launched in the air and flies far away.
Is there a parameter I can set to reduce the max speed or force imparted on the robot from collisions?
Thanks
