Q:

where are the 42 header bytes?

I went through the code carefully, I can't figure out where are the 42 header bytes.
According to the doc for the 32E, the data packet should start with a 42 bytes header, followed by 1200 bytes of data (block + encoder + points), terminated by 6 status bytes.
In the pcap reading code, those are discarded (input.cc line 269). I cannot find any trace of it in the InputSocket code. Can anyone explain?

A:

The IP and UDP headers are not returned by a recvfrom() on a UDP socket.
