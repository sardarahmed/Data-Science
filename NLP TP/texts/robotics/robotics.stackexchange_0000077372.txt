Q:

Can you convert a color topic from a bag file to monochrome?

Hi
I am using the ethzasl_ptam package. It requires monochrome images. I want to use RGB-D bag files. The images come in on the /camera/rgb/image_color topic.
Is there a way convert a color topic from a bag file to monochrome ?
Or do I have to convert the bag file to images and then convert the color images to monochrome ?
And if so, how do I then use the images with ethzasl_ptam ?
Thank you!

A:

You can use an image_proc node http://wiki.ros.org/image_proc, have it subscribe to your image_color and then you will get an image_mono output.

Thanks for the reply. Had a look at image_proc. Looks like it subscribes to the image_raw topic. Is there a way I can make it subscribe to  "/camera/rgb/image_color" instead ? I don't have the image_raw topic in the bag file. Thanks

rosrun image_proc image_proc image_raw:=/camera/rgb/image_color __ns:=/camera/rgb/converted -> remap the image_raw topic to your topic, and put the namespace where image_proc won't conflict with other topics http://wiki.ros.org/Remapping%20Arguments
