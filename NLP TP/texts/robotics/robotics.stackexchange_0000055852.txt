Q:

Groovy catkin_create_pkg

I'm having the following message every time I try to use catkin_create_pkg. Any idea how to solve this???
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/bin/catkin_create_pkg", line 71, in <module>

  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.3/dist-packages/catkin_pkg/package_templates.py", line 211, in create_package_files
    newfiles[cmake_path] = create_cmakelists(package_template, rosdistro)

A:

it was a similar problem as the one described by tfoote, but instead of using pip, I was using the git repository. I deleted the catkin_ executable files and it works like charm right now (or it seems so)
