Q:

Problem with ROSARIA rostopic info

I recently installed ROS Fuerte on a new machine, and I am having trouble installing the ROSARIA package for Pioneer series robots. Specifically, I think that a URL on the ROS side is set wrong, or is not providing useful content. I get the following error when I enter rostopic info ROSARIA:
$ roslocate info ROSARIA
error contacting http__://ros.org/doc/api/ROSARIA/stack.yaml:
HTTP Error 404: Not Found
error contacting http__://ros.org/doc/api/ROSARIA/manifest.yaml:
HTTP Error 404: Not Found
cannot locate information about ROSARIA

A:

I installed ROSARIA manually by checking out the repository from Google code :
cd ~/ros
rosws set amor-ros-pkg https___://code.google.com/p/amor-ros-pkg/ --hg

Make sure to update to revision 30 only, as the later revisions are broken and do not compile when calling :
rosmake ROSARIA
