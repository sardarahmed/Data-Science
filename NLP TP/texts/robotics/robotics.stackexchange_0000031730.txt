Q:

adding extra tags in xml launch files

we would like to add extra tags no supported by roslaunch to the launch xml files. these tags contain metadata that are very particular to the launch file, but do not fit into any of the current tag settings.
currently we get a warning  when we do this:
WARNING: unrecognized tag
however it is not clear what internal error flags roslaunch sets for this launch file, and wanted to make sure that such a feature is supported.
thank you,

A:

This feature isn't supported. I would use formatted comment markup, which is more the javadoc/doxygen/epydoc approach.
We could potentially support a generic metadata tag (filed as a feature request ticket); I wouldn't want to have arbitrary tag support as roslaunch is about have a clear model of the system launch.
