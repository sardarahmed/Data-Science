Hi,
Here is an example of a world file actor.world which includes the actor.model file (careful that the sdf model is 1.2 for actor.model, but I think you can change it to 1.3). But I don't really see any difference between these files and your world.
Do you have the walk.dae file in the ~/.gazebo folder?
Cheers
