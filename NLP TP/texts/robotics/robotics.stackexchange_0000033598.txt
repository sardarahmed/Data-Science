Q:

Dynamixel AX-12 help

Hi there.
I'm trying to work with ROS and AX-12 servos on an eeePC. I have the USB2Dynamixel dongle and i can read the states of the 3 servos I have connected by using the ax12_driver_core package, but cant find and way of actually controlling the servos to move. The robotis package has launch files but for the RS series of servos. Any help would be wonderful.
Thank you in advanced.
Chris Paton

Hi Chris--you might want to check out the new dynamixel_motor stack (http://www.ros.org/wiki/dynamixel_motor) which I believe will be replacing ax12_driver_core going forward.  (Though Anton can correct me if I am wrong.)

A:

Both ax12_controller_core and ax12_driver_core packages are deprecated, you should use dynamixel_motor stack instead. Try working through the tutorials and see if they help. If you run into any problems, just update the question and we'll try try to resolve them.
