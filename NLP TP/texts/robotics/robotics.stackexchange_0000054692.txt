A:

The error message is pretty explanatory -- the controller is unable to connect to the action specified. Does your driver actually expose a FollowJointTrajectoryAction interface named arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory?

You need to post more information for anyone to be able to help -- you have posted nothing about what robot/drivers you are using, or any details of your launch files or controllers.yaml.
