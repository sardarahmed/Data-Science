Q:

motion_planning_msgs

I am trying to use kinematics_msgs package, which depends on motion_planning_msgs.
So I have downloaded motion_planning_msgs package and tried to compile, but when i do rosmake motion_planning_msgs, this never ends compiling.
I've seen this package has been deprecated, but if I want to use kinematics_msgs, what should I do?
Thank you in advance

Have a look at the "Used By" on the right hand side here and take your pick http://ros.org/wiki/kinematics_msgs
