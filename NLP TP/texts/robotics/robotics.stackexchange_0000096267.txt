Q:

universal_robot on Noetic: packages not found

Hi there!
I'm trying to connect ROS to a Universal Robots UR5, following this tutorial here:
http://wiki.ros.org/universal_robot/Tutorials/Getting%20Started%20with%20a%20Universal%20Robot%20and%20ROS-Industrial
To achieve this, I need the universal_robots package installed, which is part of the ROS_industrial stack.
To install ROS_industrial, I am following these installation instructions: http://wiki.ros.org/Industrial/Install
It states I should be able to install ROS_industrial using the command: sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-industrial-core, however this results in the message
E: Unable to locate package ros-noetic-industrial-core

I'm brand new to ROS, so any help is appreciated!
I am using Ubuntu 20.04 (64 bit) with ROS Noetic.

Please don't follow that tutorial.
We're in the process of marking those all deprecated, as they document the process for setting up the old drivers.
For any use of Universal Robots with CB3 and newer controllers (including the e-Series), use this driver instead: UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS_Driver.
This is the only supported driver for Universal Robots robots, CB3 and e-Series. And the official driver.

To achieve this, I need the universal_robots package installed, which is part of the ROS_industrial stack.
To install ROS_industrial, I am following these installation instructions:
http://wiki.ros.org/Industrial/Install
It states I should be able to install ROS_industrial using the command:
"sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-industrial-core", however this results in the message "E: Unable to locate package ros-noetic-industrial-core".

I am using Ubuntu 20.04 (64 bit) with ROS Noetic.

That package hasn't been released yet for Noetic, so that command cannot be used yet.
I'll update the instructions.
As I wrote above: please find the new, supported and official driver at UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS_Driver.

"That package hasn't been released yet for Noetic, so that command cannot be used yet."
What ROS distribution do you recommend to work with the CB3 UR5 robot?

I believe you've misunderstood my comment: the packages in industrial_core have not been released into Noetic. But those are not needed for UR packages.
