Q:

ROS on Ubuntu Xenial (16.04)

Hi,
Is ROS (Indigo or Jade) compatible with Ubuntu 16.04?
If yes, is there some additional steps to install it?
If no, when will it be?
Best,
Jimmy

A:

Supported platforms are documented here: http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0003.html
Updates for Kinetic are in a PR here: https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rep/pull/106 and Kinetic will support Xenial
