Q:

rospack find foobar

Hi,
I am trying to do the tutorial :
http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/Creating%20a%20Package%20by%20Hand
I did already:
 source /home/fschiano/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

And I am in the catkin_ws folder.
But when I give the command
rospack find foobar

I get the error:
[rospack] Error: package 'foobar' not found

How can I solve this?
thanks.

A:

Try a rospack profile (after you've sourced setup.bash).
If that doesn't work, make sure foobar actually is a ROS package (has a manifest: package.xml).
Also make sure there is no CATKIN_IGNORE file in the package directory.

Edit: your last comment does not correspond to what you wrote in your OP. Anyway, these steps should work (in a fresh terminal):
cd /home/fschiano/catkin_ws
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
# (this step is optional, only if the next step doesn't immediately work)
rospack profile
rospack find foobar

If rospack cannot find foobar then, something is wrong.

When I type rospack profile I get :
Full tree crawl took 0.014759 seconds.
Directories marked with (*) contain no manifest.  You may
want to delete these directories.
To get just of list of directories without manifests,
re-run the profile with --zombie-only

great. Now again try rospack find foobar (in the same terminal).
Comment by fabbro on 2014-10-10:
I always get : [rospack] Error: package 'foobar' not found
I am in this folder
/home/fschiano/catkin_ws

and I do first :
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash

then
rospack profile

and then
rospack find foobar

catkin_ws folder has to stay in the ros folder?
