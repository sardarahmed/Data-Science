Q:

Building robots with high reliability, durability, and battery life

I'm involved in research on psychologically plausible models of reinforcement learning, and as such I thought it'd be nice to try and see how well some to the models out there perform in the real world (i.e. sensory-motor learning on a mobile robot). This is already been done in some robotics labs, such Sutton's implementation of the Horde Architecture on the "Critterbot". However, these implementations involve robots custom-build by robotics experts in order to deal with the trials and tribulations of learning on a long time-scale: 

"The robot has been
  designed to withstand the rigors of reinforcement learning
  experiments; it can drive into walls for hours without damage or burning out its motors, it can dock autonomously
  with its charging station, and it can run continuously for
  twelve hours without recharging."

Unfortunately I'm no expert when it comes to designing robots, and don't have access to a high quality machine shop even if I did; I'm stuck with whatever I can buy off-the-self or assemble by hand. Are these constraints common enough for amateur robotics suppliers to cater to, or should I expect to have to start from scratch?

A:

In short, yes, there are a number of robotics companies catering to just your needs. Specifically which apply to you depends on what type of robot you desire. Naturally cost varies with the complexity and durability. For example if you would be satisfied with a differential drive robot for indoor use then the iRobot Create may suit your needs. If you need something for outside use then you could look at Clearpath Robotics products. For a full humanoid robot the Aldeberan Nao is a good choice. For quadrotors check out the AR.Drone Parrot. And I understand Liquid Robotics offers a good selection of water based robots.
