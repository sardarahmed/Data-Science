Q:

Differences and benefits on using Karto or GMapping SLAM

Both methods look quite similar looking at the ros.org documentation.
Gmapping seems to have a better ROS support and documentation but beyond of this, does anyone have experienced or know the benefits of using each one of them in terms of performance, result quality, etc?

A:

I've been testing it for some days, and in the moment it sounds to me to be a faster algorithm. The presition sound similar to me by the moment.
I think that there are not much people using karto because the current package is broken. Here I provided a solution about how to build it:
