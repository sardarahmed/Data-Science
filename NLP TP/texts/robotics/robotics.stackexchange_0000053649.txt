Q:

Change laser range while stage is running

I know how to set the laser range in the world file. But once the world file is executed on stage, I can't find any way to manipulate the value of any properties in that world file. So, my question is, after I execute the world file on stage, then I want to change the laser range while I am running the stage. How can I do so?

A:

Not sure this is easily doable in Stage, but a workaround could be to write a small node that subscribes to the scan, truncates the ranges contained as you require, and republishes the scan to another topic. Should be a few lines of Python or C++ code and you don't have to mess with Stage.
Another thing you could do is look at the laser_filters package and see if it satisfies your requirements.
