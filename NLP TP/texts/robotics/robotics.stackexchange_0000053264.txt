Q:

roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch no devices connected

I'm just starting out trying to use ROS with my Primesense device (Asus Xtion Pro Live) on Ubuntu 12.10 and ROS groovy. I'm trying to perform
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch 

but I'm faced with
[ INFO] [1375408552.874803204]: No devices connected.... waiting for devices to be connected

This is the output of lsusb:
Bus 001 Device 008: ID 1d27:0601  
Bus 005 Device 002: ID 413c:2003 Dell Computer Corp. Keyboard
Bus 005 Device 003: ID 0461:4d22 Primax Electronics, Ltd 
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
Bus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
Bus 005 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
Bus 006 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
Bus 007 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
Bus 008 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub

It seems like my Primesense device isn't recognised (first row above). The question is, where can I download the appropriate drivers? I'm a bit confused because I can run ./SimpleViewer in the OpenNI samples (doesn't this mean the drivers are installed?). I've read a few other posts regarding this, including
http://answers.ros.org/question/60766/kinect-not-recognized-with-opennilaunch/
and this
http://answers.ros.org/question/60562/ubuntu-12042-and-openni_launch-not-detecting-kinect-after-update/
but nothing works. I've also tried looking up the Asus drivers download page here
http://support.asus.com/Download.aspx?SLanguage=en&m=Xtion+PRO+LIVE&p=19&s=11
and noticed that it's quite outdated (OpenNI v1.5 and NiTE v.1.5, when v2.2 is out). I already have OpenNI v2.2 installed. Should I be installing NiTE 2.2? I ask because it's categorized as a Middleware Library.
Thanks!

I see a problem like you, have you solved it successfully?
Comment by Andrew.A on 2013-11-26:
Yes, the problem was that I installed the primesense drivers for v1.5, but my OpenNI version was v2.2. I downloaded OpenNI v1.5 instead and it worked.

So how about 's the version of sensor driver?

Do you use the Live USB installation or Debs ? I use USB Installation, I tested successfully ASUS XTION with NIViewer it can receive data from Xtion , but when I tested with openni.launch, I see it notice :
[camera/depth/points-10] process has died [pid 12126, exit code 255, cmd /opt/ros/groovy/lib/nodelet/nodelet load depth_image_proc/point_cloud_xyz /camera_nodelet_manager --no-bond image_rect:=image_rect_raw __name:=points __log:=/home/turtlebot/.ros/log/134c8d7c-5714-11e3-8e6d-70f1a10ec189/camera-depth-points-10.log].
log file: /home/turtlebot/.ros/log/134c8d7c-5714-11e3-8e6d-70f1a10ec189/camera-depth-points-10*.log
So what problem with me?

I updated my answer below, please check it. To fix your error, get the older version of openni_camera from source.

I run the sample code follower successfull bu using openni2_launch and openni2_camera

A:

The problem was that I installed the Primesense drivers for v1.5, but my OpenNI version was v2.2. I downloaded OpenNI v1.5 from here instead and it worked.
EDIT: Also, there is an issue with the openni_camera package. You can leave the deb package installed, as long as your compiled sources have priority. Use echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH and see if your source directory is first. This is what I have:
$ echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
/home/andrew/catkin_ws/src:/opt/ros/groovy/share:/opt/ros/groovy/stacks

Go to your sources directory, get the source code using git and use the rollback_usb branch.
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/ros-drivers/openni_camera.git
git checkout rollback_usb

Compile using catkin_make in the root of your catkin directory
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make

Finally, test it out with roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch.
You can read more about this issue here.
Primesense drivers can be downloaded from the OpenNI website. I'm using v5.1.2.1 from here (32-bit). 64-bit version is here. I think there are more recent versions over here if you like, but I haven't tried them.
Alternatively, if you choose to use v2.2, then you should install the packages openni2_camera and openni2_launch instead (see here).
