A:

They basically mean there are nodes which have active subscriptions, but no one is publishing to those topics.
That could be OK -- as it could just mean you haven't started the node(s) which publish(es) to those topics -- but it could also mean you've not remapped things correctly (for instance) -- in which case those unconnected subscriptions would indicate a problem with your application's configuration.
There's no way to know for roswtf so it just gives you a WARNING, to at least draw your attention to it.

I thought so, but wasn't sure as I had not noted those particular topics before. Thanks!
