Q:

Android Teleop App - "App Start Failed"

Hello everyone,
I've today started to toy around with the Android apps. Of the three I have tried, Chirp and Follower work fine, however basic Teleop isn't working at all. Teleoperation isn't an issue with controlling the Turtlebot from a workstation. Would anyone have any suggestions out there to why I would be getting the below error?
Thank you.

I have the same problem. I think this is being fixed in the next release of ROS. Please check out  https://kforge.ros.org/turtlebot/turtlebot_apps/rev/5407c701e391
