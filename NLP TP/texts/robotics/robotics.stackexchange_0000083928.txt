Q:

How to calibrate Stereo Camera?

Hi,
I am using Snapdragon_Dev_Board(eagle8074/Snapdragon801) with Stereo Camera.
Snapdragon_Dev_Board has Linux Linaro 14.04(pre-loaded). I have installed ROS-Indigo on top of it.
I am running two nodes
snap_cam_ros
https://github.com/ATLFlight/snap_cam_ros
and dfs_ros_example
https://github.com/ATLFlight/dfs-ros-example
to get the disparity image, depth image and point cloud.
While I am launching the snap_cam_ros on [Snapdragon_Dev_Board + Linux Linaro 14.04(pre-loaded) + ROS-Indigo] environment , using:
roslaunch snap_cam_ros stereo.launch
it is showing the following error:
[ INFO] [7122.158294089]: using default calibration URL
[ INFO] [7122.159528307]: camera calibration URL: file:///camera_info/left.yaml
[ INFO] [7122.160654714]: Unable to open camera calibration file [/camera_info/left.yaml]

[ WARN] [7122.164905130]: Camera calibration file /camera_info/right.yaml not found.
How to resolve this error: Can anyone help me out?
Regards,

A:

Size of the checkerboard can be anything that you print out. As long as it is suitable enough to cover the entire stereo overlap region to get a good estimate of size but also provides enough samples along the x and y directions as well as skew samples. Print out whatever checkerboard works for you and then measure the square length and input that to your calibrator.
You can use the camera_calibration package which has a good tutorial

Thanks;
I did:
'roslaunch snap_cam_ros stereo.launch`
I am finding the following error:
using default calibration URL
camera calibration URL: file:///camera_info/left.yaml
Unable to open camera calibration file [/camera_info/left.yaml]
Camera calibration file /camera_info/left.yaml not found.
