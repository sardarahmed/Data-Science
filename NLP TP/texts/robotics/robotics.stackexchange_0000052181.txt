Q:

How to find out if Rosmaster is running yet?

I am trying to debug a node that is supposed to publish a "shutdown message" to a topic.  Since I am running rostests on my nodes, this message is supposed to get published fairly early after I launch my nodes.
Unfortunately, sometimes the message-sending happens and sometimes it doesn't.  I am even using the "latch" option on my publisher (so that a subscriber can still receive a message that was sent before the subscriber started).
My current suspicion is that the Rosmaster sometimes doesn't have time to initialize.  I've been hunting around for a way to check on the Master's status, but I can't seem to find it.  Is there a way to make sure the Rosmaster is running?
(as an addendum: I'm not looking for a terminal command.  I'm looking for some kind of code that would let my node know that rosmaster is reachable.)

A:

In python there's a way. See this thread.

If the master did not start running, would the other nodes actually start? (I get a socket error when I try)..

@trinighost I think a node tries to connect Master upon booting, and fails if Master not running with specified URI. That's probably the error you're seeing.

@trinighost and be sure not to ask new questions in comment area ;)

I was trying to clarify that this was a solution to the same problem.. because I wasn't clear on how the OP was able to avoid the error that I saw. I promise that I wasn't trying to ask a new question :)
