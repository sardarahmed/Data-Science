Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: bag to csv

I am doing this to grab a topic from my bag
rostopic echo -p -b bagfile.bag /topic1 > topic1.txt
an example text file is this:
%time,field.axes0
1319232665843818430,0.0
1319232665893904494,0.0
is %time unix time? because I can't seem to convert it.
What I would like is to convert this to tell me the number of seconds from its start, so the bag starts with 0 time, this is to match the timestamp on an audiofile logged at the same time as this.
Thanks

Seems like its the unix time at nanosecond level. You could trim of the last 9 digits if you dont care for sub-second accuracy.

A:

It's probably the easiest to use the Python API of rosbag. See this example for how to access the timestamp and here is a description for handling times with rospy.

I did the reindex. Still getting the same error. Please help
Comment by Felix Endres on 2011-11-23:
rosbag (the command line tool) has a reindex function, see "rosbag help"

I am trying the cookbook python example and I am getting this... rosbag.bag.ROSBagUnindexedException: Unindexed bag
