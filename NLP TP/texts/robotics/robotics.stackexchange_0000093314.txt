Q:

How to improve the robot frame rate when using motion planning in rViz?

Hello there,
I am currently trying to get a better frame rate for the motion planning plugin in rViz. Right now, I have a frame rate of 1 or 2 Hz. Another user had the same problem, which looked like this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2yPOtkc84M&feature=youtu.be. His solution was to increase the joint_state_publisher rate (https://answers.ros.org/question/307723/how-to-make-robot-movement-in-rviz-with-moveit-smoother/), but in my code, I only use my own moveIt "robot"_planning_execution launch file, which loads multiple launch files (like robot_interface_simulator.launch, planning_context.launch and move_group.launch) and a robot_state_publisher node. Also, if I load a robot model in rViz, the frame rate is way faster than the motion planning plugin.
So my question is, how do I increase the frame rate for the motion planning plugin in rViz if I don't use a joint_state_publisher?
I am using kinetic with rviz version 1.12.17.
Thanks,
Julien Audet

A:

You can set it programmatically with :
rviz::Display moveit_display = rviz_manager_->createDisplay("moveit_rviz_plugin/MotionPlanning", "motion_planning", true);    
moveit_display->subProp("Scene Geometry")->subProp("Scene Display Time")->setValue("0.0001");

where rviz_manager_ is of type rviz::VisualizationManager.
