Q:

Best tutorial for learning nav_stack

I am learning about and experimenting with the Navigation stack. We have a Robotis Turtlebot3 and soon will have a ClearPath Turtlebot2. But the class has 9 students.
I've been scouring google for a nav stack tutorial with actual code that allows me to see the various mov_base capabilities in simulation. I am running Kinetic.
Can someone refer me to a good tutorial that will work on Kinetic and that allows me to understand path planning and work with it. Believe me I searched and have tried to follow many of them (not just from ROS.org) and each one fails in a different way.
