Q:

About ros_web_video and mjpeg_server

Hello, I know that mjpeg_server is deprecated but for curiosity i was trying to use it whit a turtlebot, I ran the commands as it follows here   Wiki for mjpeg and the webpage was loading and not showing the information of the kinect.
I ran:
$ roscore 
$ turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch
$ rosrun mjpeg_server mjpeg_server
$ rosrun rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket

And then the page doesn't show something.
So I want to prove with the newest library form Robot Web Tools ros_web_video, and after installing it i don't know how to run it.
Any lights about this?
Thanks beforehand!

A:

mjpeg_server is replaced by web_video_server not ros_web_video (also deprecated). Is there some documentation error somewhere that pointed you to ros_web_video?
You can find documentation on web_video_server at https://github.com/RobotWebTools/web_video_server and it can be installed with sudo apt-get install ros-<DISTRO>-web-video-server (replacing <DISTRO> with your ROS distro that you are using. You can then run the package with rosrun web_video_server web_video_server and point your browser to http://localhost:8080/ to see the available topics.

Thanks for explainning this, now when I am subscribed to the web_video_server I see no image of the kinect and the browser (Firefox) shows the icon of a page with a 3 geometry figures. The browser say always Connecting and Transfering data from localhost... why could this happening?

About web_video_server: It is possible to use rosbridge while you're using it?
Comment by rtoris288 on 2015-02-18:
What is the URL you are trying to load the image from? Any yes, rosbridge and web_video_server run on different ports and are independent of each other.

I am using this URL http://localhost:8080/stream_viewer?topic=web_video_sever
Comment by rtoris288 on 2015-02-18:
Topic should point to the actual ROS image topic, not the name of the node. Going to http://localhost:8080 should provide you with a list of available image topics which can be streamed.

My mistake was that I forgot to create the camera topic,
$ rolaunch openni_launch openni.launch

and using /camera/rgb/image_rect_color
Thanks!
