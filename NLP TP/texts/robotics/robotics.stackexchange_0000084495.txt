Q:

rospack find throws exception error

rospack find is giving runtime errors on my beaglebone board. Other rospack commands are running fine like rospack depends.
and here is the error message :
debian@beaglebone:~/catkin_ws$ rospack find
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'rospack::Exception'
what(): error parsing manifest of package class_loader at /home/debian/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/share/class_loader/package.xml
Aborted

also after writing $rosrun and pressing tab it is throwing exception error written below :
debian@beaglebone:~/catkin_ws$ rosrun terminate called after throwing an instance of 'rospack::Exception'
what(): error parsing manifest of package class_loader at /home/debian/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/share/class_loader/package.xml

although $ rosrun <pkg_name> <node_name> is running completely fine when typing the whole command without using tab
with using tab the console is like this ;
debian@beaglebone:~/catkin_ws$ rosrun ros_o3d_wall_f find: '': No such file or directory
o3d-find: '': No such file or directory
find: '': No such file or directory

o3d-pub o3d-sub

here i pressed tab after $rosrun ros_o3d_wall_f . And then there was this line added find: no such file or directory then again i pressed tab and line added was o3d-find: no such file or directory and when i pressed tab for the third time it should me the two nodes o3d -pub and o3d-sub.
can someone explain me this anomalous behavior.
i have installed ros on my board from source files as apt-get repository was unable to find it.
I used the http://wiki.ros.org/lunar/Installation/Source tutorial to install ros-desktop-full from source files. for my beaglebone board. Although its running fine on my desktop but on the board its throwing  error.
Should i build the package again to avoid this error and if so what other packages and dependencies i need to update . Also i don't know how to remove the installed package as i used $catkin_make_install_isolated  command and not the $catkin build command to build the work space so $catkin clean won't work.
Here are the contents of the package.xml  file mentioned above in the error.
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<?xml-model href="http://download.ros.org/schema/package_format2.xsd" schematypens="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"?>
<package format="2">
  <name>class_loader</name>
  <version>0.3.8</version>
  <description>
    The class_loader package is a ROS-independent package for loading plugins during runtime and the foundation of the higher level ROS "pluginlib" library. class_loader utilizes the host operating system's runtime loader to open runtime libraries (e.g. .so/.dll files), introspect the library for exported plugin classes, and allows users to instantiate objects of said exported classes without the explicit declaration (i.e. header file) for those classes.

I've re-formatted to make your output more readable ;). Then, it may worth running rospack profile command after building (ref).
Comment by Dirk Thomas on 2018-01-04:
Please do not double post your question. You have already asked the same question here: https://github.com/ros/rospack/issues/86 In that ticket you have also been asked to provide specific information. Please do so otherwise others can't help you with your question.
Comment by kamalpandey1993 on 2018-01-05:
rospack profile is also giving the same error as mentioned above @130s

if somebody could explain me that when these exception error occurs maybe then i'll get my way @Dirk Thomas
Comment by ahendrix on 2018-01-05:
The error you're getting usually means that the package.xml file has an error. Now that you've added it to you question, I don't see anything obviously wrong with it. I suppose this could be an issue with the permissions on that file, or it could be an issue with the XML format headers.
Comment by ahendrix on 2018-01-05:
It's a bit of a shot in the dark, but you might want to try removing the first two lines from this package.xml to see if that helps. (If it does, that indicates a bug in rospack or the package.xml).

Comment by kamalpandey1993 on 2018-01-05:
i tried commenting the top two lines and interestingly now the parse error exception is not on that file. It came from file at smclib package and after resolving that on bondpy, pluginlib, actionlib one by one. Now i cannot uncomment from all package.xml files. Could it be version error. @ahendrix
Comment by kamalpandey1993 on 2018-01-05:
@jayess sorry for grammar. I was saying that generally when does these types of errors occur? maybe that could help me.
Comment by ahendrix on 2018-01-05:
This looks like a regression of https://github.com/ros/rospack/issues/77

A:

The problem seems to be related to the TinyXML2 version you are using. TinyXML2 version 4.0.1 (which is e.g. in Ubuntu Zesty) has a bug making it unable to parse xml-model correctly. All other versions (3.0.0 and lower as well as 5.0.0 and higher) don't have the problem and work as expected (see https://github.com/ros/rospack/issues/77). To address the problem you should update to a newer version of TinyXML2.

@Dirk Thomas thanks but how to update the tinyxml2. I tried updating the libtinyxml2 package and also removed the older version . But now rospack gives error for not finding libtinyxml2-4.so library. How can i change the settings in Ros to use the newer version of that library. OS is DEBIAN Stretch.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-01-08:
This is not a setting. You'll have to recompile - everything (or: everything that depends on tinyxml).
Comment by Dirk Thomas on 2018-01-08:
Until the bug is fixed in the Debian Stretch package of TinyXML2 the approach @gvdhoorn mentioned is the only way.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-01-08:
Seeing as the OP has a from-source install of Lunar on Debian Stretch, wouldn't he always need to recompile? Unless ABI bw-compatibility is maintained of course.
Comment by kamalpandey1993 on 2018-01-08:
well package.xml file is in every package , and i guess if i compile whole packages again for debian stretch, how its going to determine to use version of xml parser above 4.0.1 or lower @gvdhoorn
Comment by kamalpandey1993 on 2018-01-08:
@Dirk Thomas should i recompile the packages by removing version 4 and installing other version. Will the ROS packages be able to find this new library, because I think their dependency is in version 4 only. Correct me if i am wrong
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-01-08:
I don't understand your question @kamalpandey1993: how is package.xml involved in any of this? TinyXML (the library) contains a regression in version 4.0.1 - get a newer version, recompile and things should start working.
You need to recompile basic ROS pkgs that use TinyXML.

while recompiling i got this error
==> Processing catkin package: 'rospack'
make[2]: *** No rule to make target '/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libtinyxml2.so', needed by '/home/debian/ros_catkin_ws/devel_isolated/rospack/lib/librospack.so'.Stop

i already installed libtinyxml2.6.2 , @gvdhoorn
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-01-09:
Did you rm -rf your devel and build folders before you rebuilt your workspace? It could be that CMake is still using the old files.
