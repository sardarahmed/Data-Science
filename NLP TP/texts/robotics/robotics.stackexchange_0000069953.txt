Q:

Rosbag on srvs?

Hi,
Is it possible to record the requests and responses over a srv with rosbag? When I use rosbag record on the srv name, the bag files are empty. I can't find any documentation about using rosbag with srvs so I thought I should ask here to confirm.

A:

rosbag cannot be used to record service calls. See this ticket for the reasoning.
