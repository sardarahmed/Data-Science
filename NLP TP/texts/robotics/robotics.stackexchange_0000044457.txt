Q:

new openni.launch file --> topic gone

Hi
Since the last update the topic
/camera/depth_registered/image
is gone. I used this, because the depth values were in meter.
When I disable registration i have the topic
/camera/depth/image
But this doesn't help me, because i need the registered image. It seems like the update somehow removed the /camera/depth_registered/image topic. Only /camera/depth_registered/image_raw is published.

A:

Yes, the last update accidentally removed that topic.  I've reverted that change. You can use the fixed version from source (should only need to download openni_launch from source). The update should propagate into the debian files in the next day or so.

Nice to hear, experienced the same. -- Does this include this issue 44893/initialize-but-topics-are-empty, too?

I don't think so - other topics should still be getting published. This bug should have primarily affected the depth image
