Q:

ROS 2 Params YAML File Package-Relative Path

Is there currently any analog to the rosparam flag subst_value for ROS 2 YAML parameter files? I would like to use a package-relative path (like $(find package_name)/path/to/file.txt from ROS 1) in a ROS 2 parameters file but I can't find an example of this.
