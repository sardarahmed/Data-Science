Q:

turtlebot sensors

How can I turn off the cliff sensor? or deactivate it for a certain amount of time. I'm driving the robot into an elevator but it can't quite make it in because of the small gap down the shaft... my cmd_vel commands keep getting ignored because the cliff sensors activate.

A:

You will have to change the turtlebot_node.py code here. Right now it sends (0,0) velocity when there is a wheel drop.
