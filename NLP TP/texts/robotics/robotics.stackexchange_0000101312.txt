Q:

rviz2 not loading "Entry Point Not Found"(Windows)

I'm not sure if this is a simple error... getting back into ROS after being away for 7 years or so.  Maybe I need to setup a PC with Ubuntu again.. but thought I'd try with Windows 10 first.
I've followed the install steps for everything listed in the ros installation guide page, I've installed chocolaty and ROS Foxy using the Windows(alternate install method)
Everything seems to install fine, I can run the Talker and Listener, Turtle Sim Example, but RViz2 isn't working.
I get two "Entry Point Not Found" errors, both .dll's are located in the directories shown in the erros.
Error1:
"
The procedure entry point
?hasEdgeList@MovableObject@Ogre@@UEAA_NXZ could not
be located in the dynamic link library
C:\opt\ros\foxy\x64\bin\rviz_common.dll.
"
Error 2:
"
The procedure entry point
?coulour@ManualObject@Ogre@@UEAAXAEBVColourValue@2@@Z could not
be located in the dynamic link library
C:\opt\ros\foxy\x64\bin\rviz_rendering.dll.
"
I've tried setting my paths as I've seen in another ROSAnswers forum post
Using that post I tried running my workspace setup with an admin CMD window thinking maybe it could fix a path issue.
Below is what I used as my workspace setup, but it didn't change any issues since I think they were pointing to the correct location already.

call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\Common7\Tools\VsDevCmd.bat" -arch=amd64 -host_arch=amd64
SET Qt5_DIR=C:\Qt\5.15.0\msvc2019_64
SET QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH=C:\Qt\5.15.0\msvc2019_64\plugins\platforms
SET "ChocolateyInstall=C:\ProgramData\chocolatey"
SET "PATH=C:\python38; C:\python38\scripts; C:\opt\ros\foxy\x64\bin; C:\opt\ros\foxy\x64\lib;%PATH%"
SET "PYTHONHOME=c:\Python38"
SET "PYTHONPATH=c:\Python38\lib\site-packages;c:\opt\ros\foxy\x64\lib\site-packages"

@ncr7 did you resolve this? I'm having similar startup issues with rviz2.

Did anyone solve this?

A:

Hi, was having the same problem, the command "ros2 run rviz2 rviz2" works for me. Try checking it out.
