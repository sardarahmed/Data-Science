Q:

The joints rotate faster than their limits in Gazebo

Hi there. I write a model, consisting of several links and joints. The joints are revolute and I set the limit of one joint as:
<limit effort="1000.0" lower="-1.57" upper="1.57" velocity="0.5"/>

The "lower" and "upper" work well in Gazebo, however, the angular velocity sometimes is larger than 0.5 rad/s. To explain this, I set the rate as 20 Hz, than in each step the change of angle should be less than or equal to 0.5/20=0.025 rad/s. But sometimes it is larger than 0.5/20 in one step.
I appreciate your help. Thanks.

A:

Gazebo does not support velocity limits set from a model specification. Your code snippet is from a URDF file, which is not the default/preferred model format for Gazebo. URDF lets you define a velocity attribute, but Gazebo does not use that value.
You will need to use a controller or plugin to manage joint velocity.

Thanks for your help.
Actually this is a .xacro file. Anyway it is quite similar with .urdf file. I use gazebo_ros_control. I think I need to tune pid paramters to control the velocity.
Thanks!
