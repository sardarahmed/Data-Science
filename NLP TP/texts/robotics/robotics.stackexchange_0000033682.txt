Q:

TurtleBot unable to contact my own server

A question from Marc Howard:
I am having a problem getting the turtlebot minimal.launch program to run.  It gives me the following error:
Unable to contact my own server at [http://IP_OF_LAPTOP:42375/].
This usually means that the network is not configured properly.

A common cause is that the machine cannot ping itself.  Please check
for errors by running:
ping ip_of_laptop

For more tips, please see
http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/NetworkSetup
I have checked both .bashrc files and they have the following lines in them:
Laptop .bashrc file:
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://IP_OF_LAPTOP:11311
export ROS_HOSTNAME=IP_OF_LAPTOP

Workstation .bashrc file:
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://IP_OF_LAPTOP:11311
export ROS_HOSTNAME=IP_OF_WORKSTATION

I have tried replacing those with the actual IP addresses and that did not work either, and documentation I found on the net advised that the way I have it above was correct.  I also don't understand on a fundamental level where it assigns "IP_OF_LAPTOP" or"IP_OF_WORKSTATION"  to the actual number.
I went through the NetworkSetup tutorial and the EnvirmonmentVariables turtorial with no luck.  My computers also do not have names on the network (aka they cannot be accessed with a URL other than their ip address.  Do you have any suggestions?  Thank you very much!

A:

In a tutorial when we write something in all caps like IP_OF_LAPTOP, we mean that you should replace IP_OF_LAPTOP with your actual IP. You can find out the IP of a computer in Ubuntu by typing ifconfig in a terminal.
you should see something like:
lo        Link encap:Local Loopback  
          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0
          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host
          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:16436  Metric:1
          RX packets:88474362 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:88474362 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 
          RX bytes:9302480192 (9.3 GB)  TX bytes:9302480192 (9.3 GB)

wlan0     Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 48:5d:60:7d:22:e6  
          inet addr:192.168.1.4  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          inet6 addr: fe80::4a5d:60ff:fe7d:22e6/64 Scope:Link
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:1093031 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:1422901 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 
          RX bytes:430045105 (430.0 MB)  TX bytes:1327311556 (1.3 GB)

In this example the IP_OF_LAPTOP is 192.168.1.4
