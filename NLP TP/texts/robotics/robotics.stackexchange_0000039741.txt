Q:

Run ROS on an Android Smartphone?

Hi,
is it possible to run the whole ROS infrastructure on a (modern) android smartphone? Searching the web just yielded tons of pages about android talking to a ROS host..
I've got some LEGO Mindstorms at hand and want to use these with rosjava (and lejos) to develop mobile robotics applications, USB and Bluetooth restrict their range to uselessness.
Thank you in advance!
Best regards,
Andreas

A:

rosjava runs on Android. Have a look at the android_core repository of the rosjava project.
Please note: rosjava is still unstable and the interfaces are likely to change.

Also see the android_core documentation: http://docs.rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/android_core/html/index.html

How do you want to use leJOS with Android? How does that overcome problems with USB and Bluetooth? I have recently added new Android projects to leJOS that improve Android connectivity to leJOS,I have not yet tried rosjava on Android with leJOS.
