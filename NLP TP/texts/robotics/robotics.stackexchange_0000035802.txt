Q:

Using CUDA in ROS with eee PC 1215N

Hi,
I know that with bumblebee/ironhide, I can use the Ion 2 graphics card on linux, but after installing bumblebee or ironhead, can I use CUDA and turtlebot? Has someone tried it?

What about turtlebot? Have you tried to use virtualGL with turtlebot?

The 1215n is the turtlebot laptop.

A:

I got glx working for the nvidia gpu through virtualGL:  http://answers.ros.org/question/2258/how-to-make-use-of-the-nvidia-gpu-on-asus-1215n  though I have not tried to compile cuda on it yet.
