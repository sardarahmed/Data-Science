Q:

[Stage] topic coordinates are different of those declared in .world file

Hi,
In my world file I have this model:
laser_base
(
    name "base_0"       # NE base points W
    pose [1.6 1.6 0 180]    
)

where pose is [x y z th], so this model is located at the top-right of the origin.
Now, when I subscribe to the topic /base_pose_ground truth, I have this:
[...]
pose: 
  pose: 
    position: 
      x: 1.6
      y: -1.6
      z: 0.0
    orientation: 
      x: 0.0
      y: 0.0
      z: -0.707106781187
      w: 0.707106781187
[...]

Why these coordinates are different? Should not they be the same?
EDIT 1:
I've found this in stageros.cpp:
// Note that we correct for Stage's screwed-up coord system.
    tf::Quaternion q_gpose;
    q_gpose.setRPY(0.0, 0.0, gpose.a-M_PI/2.0);
    tf::Transform gt(q_gpose, tf::Point(gpose.y, -gpose.x, 0.0));
    tf::Quaternion q_gvel;

Why is this considered screwed-up coord system?

A:

The coordinate system was fixed in stage_ros version 1.7.2:
CHANGELOG.rst:
1.7.2 (2013-09-19)

Changed default GUI window size to 600x400
Added velocity to ground truth odometry
Fixed tf (yaw component) for the base_link->camera transform.
**Fixed ground truth pose coordinate system**
