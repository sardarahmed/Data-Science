Q:

What exactly is $\omega_k$ in the stage cost of moving horizon estimation?

In (nonlinear) moving horizon estimation the aim is to estimate an unknown state sequence $\{x_k\}_{k=0}^T$ over a moving horizon N using measurements $y_k$ up to time $T$ and a system model as constraint. All the papers I've seen so far 1,2,3 the following cost function is used: 
$$
\phi = \min_{z,\{\omega_k\}_{k = T-N}^{T-1}} \sum_{k = T-N}^{T-1} \underbrace{\omega_k^TQ^{-1}\omega_k + \nu_k^TR^{-1}\nu_k}_{\text{stage cost } L_k(\omega,\nu)} + \underbrace{\mathcal{\hat{Z}}_{T-N}(z)}_{\text{approximated arrival cost}}
$$
The noise sequence $\{\omega_k\}_{k = T-N}^{T-1}$ should be optimized/minimized in order to solve for the unknown state sequence using the prediction model:
$$
x_{k+1} = f(x_k,\omega_k)
$$
whereas the measurement model is defined as 
$$
y_k = h(x_k) + \nu_k
$$
with additive noise $\nu$.
The question is what exactly is $\omega_k$ in the stage cost?
In the papers $\nu$ is defined to be 
$$
\nu_k = y_k - h(x_k)
$$
However, $\omega_k$ remains undefined.
If I can assume additive noise $\omega$ in the prediction model, I think $\omega_k$ is something like the follwoing:
$$
\omega_k = x_{k+1} - f(x_k)
$$
If this should be correct, then my next Problem is that I don't know the states $x_k$, $x_{k+1}$ (they should be estimated).
EDIT
Is it possible that my guess for $\omega_k = x_{k+1} - f(x_k)$ is "wrong" and it is enough to just consider:

the measurement $\nu_k = y_k - h(x_k)$ in the cost function $\phi$
the prediction model as constraint?

And let the optimization do the "rest" in finding a possible solution of a noise sequence $\{\omega_k\}_{k = T-N}^{T-1}$? In this case which Matlab solver would you suggest? I thought of using lsqnonlin since my problem is a sum of squares. Is it possible to use lsqnonlin with the prediction model as constraint?

A:

What helped to solve my question was to use fmincon with the process noise $\omega_k$ as decision variable and to use the measurement noise which includes the state in the equation $\nu_k = y_k - h(x_k)$. To come up with a solution for the state $x_k$ I just solve the prediction model using an initial state at the beginning of the moving window $x_{k-N}$ and also the noise sequence. Where the noise sequence is the decision variable. Using this method, the prediction model constraint is "included" in the cost function. Of course at the very first start of the optimizaiton, a random noise sequence is chosen (with magnitude according to the state variables). After each run of the optimization the shifted noise sequence from the previous run can be taken as initial guess.
