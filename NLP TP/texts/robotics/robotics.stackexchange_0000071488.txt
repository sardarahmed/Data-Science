This forum is primarily for questions about ROS (Robot Operating System), and your question does not appear to be about ROS. You will probably get a better answer by asking on a general programming site like Stack Overflow.

A:

If the int32 come from a std::msgs you can access the value with .data
int var = yourMsg.data
here is the documentation : http://docs.ros.org/api/std_msgs/html/msg/Int32.html
