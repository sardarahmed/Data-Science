Q:

rgbdslam_v2 evaluation problem

Hi,
I am using rgbdslam_v2 with the datasets from http://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset.  After executing ./run_tests.sh, the processing is done. But there are some problems with evaluation. The print is here:
18:30:27 Finished processing rgbd_dataset_freiburg1_xyz
rgbd_dataset_freiburg1_xyz ... Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/home/hjzhang/rgbdslam_catkin_ws/src/rgbdslam_v2-indigo//rgbd_benchmark/evaluate_ate.py", line 2, in

I really have to resolve this problem. Does any one have the same problem or some ideas to solve this problem? Thanks very much!!!

A:

You have to install cython (apt-get install cython). It's not in the dependencies list, because the evaluation scripts are optional, but I should have mentioned it in the README.
