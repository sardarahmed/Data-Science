Q:

ROS_WARN messages go to stdout instead of stderr?

I am running the velodyne package in Ubuntu 16.04 with ROS Kinetic. I am trying to log all the errors to a file. However, the ROS_WARN messages seem to go to the normal stdout instead of the stderr in ROS. This is not what is expected according to the ROS logging documentation. Does anyone know why this might be happening? And if I am missing something?
Any help would be appreciated.

A:

Possibly an oversight. A fix's been merged into melodic-devel.
