ok so where do I have to look? In the robot's urdf where is specified the laserscan? Or somewhere else?

its from your laser driver. or you can check your laser message frequency by using rostopic hz /lasertopicname

where do I have to modify in order to increase frequency? In the urdf file I have :
<sick_laser_v0 name="laser" parent="base" ros_topic="scan"
update_rate="30" min_angle="-0.97" max_angle="0.97" l_x="0.5" l_y="0.0" l_z="0.25" l_r="0.0" l_p="0.0" l_yaw="0.0"/>

I guess you are using simulator, i have no idead about gazebo. try changing update_rate.  are you getting 30hz for rostopic hz /lasertopicname

Yes I'm using Gazebo. Still 20 hz after modifying update_rate to 30

may be you are not modifying right file. try modifying update rate in gazebo_ros_laser_controller plugin
