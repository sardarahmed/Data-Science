Q:

Error when installing pr2-simulator

Hi guys,I was following this tutorial Starting PR2 in Simulation and I understood that I needed to install pr2 simulator first. So I have executed:
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-pr2-simulator

And this is what I got:
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-kinetic-pr2-simulator

I have just started using ROS, and I don't know much about this world
Thank you in advance
