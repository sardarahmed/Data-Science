Q:

GPS Amplifier - Is this reliable?

I'm multimedia developer who is searching for a way to get GPS signal inside buildings/structures. Is amplification a reliable way to fix this GPS signal issue?
Will a "GPS Amplifier" work as perfectly as using GPS outside?

A:

The short answer is no.
By amplifying a GPS signal, you are creating a multipath situation. Instead of the proper signal path from the satellite directly to the receiver, you would be creating a triangle inequality (unless your amplifiers just happened to be exactly in line between each satellite and the receiver).

You might decide that having an imperfect signal inside the building is better than no signal at all.  However, the bigger issue is that you'd be magnifying the multipath effects for any GPS receivers outside the building.
You should look at an alternate GPS-like technology, such as radio-frequency TDOA (time-difference of arrival).
