A:

Quoting from here, Jade only supports "Trusty (14.04), Utopic (14.10) and Vivid (15.04) for debian packages." Reading the ROS Release Policy we see that

ROS releases will also not add support
for new Ubuntu releases after its
release date.

This means that Jade will not ever support Wily (15.10) with debian packages. Next May when ROS K is released, it will likely support 15.10, but only through the end of July (when 15.10 reaches EOL). ROS K will be an LTS release paired with Xenial (16.04) as its LTS distribution.
You can always try building ROS from source if you are stuck on 15.10.
