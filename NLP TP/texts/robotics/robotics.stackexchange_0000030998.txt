Q:

How do I make rosinstall just install the one package I want

I've gotten used to doing:
roslocate info $package > /tmp/$package.rosinstall; yes s | rosinstall ~/ros /tmp/$package.rosinstall

but this results in rosinstall going through every custom package I've installed and updating it. I have some conflicts in packages that I don't really want to update, so the 'yes s' is necessary so I don't have to babysit the process. This is particularly annoying since my list of installed packages is only going to get bigger as time goes on.
Am I missing something? Is there an easier way to install third-party stacks? rosinstall is so close to being perfect

A:

There's no option to update just a single checkout as rosinstall's purpose is to achieve the state of the system asked of it by the .rosinstall file.
I would suggest that you can update the .rosinstall file to point to the checkout which you are working against such that it does not conflict anymore.  Rosinstall doesn't check for local changes if it has the same URL/branch combo.
