Q:

Using Git with ROS Groovy/rosws?

Is there something new/different about using git within rosws in ROS Groovy? It looks like I'm getting the stacks checked out but when I use rosmake it reports 0 of 0 stacks created.
Does the catkin workspace effect this?

Please update your question showing exactly what you did. What does rosws info show?

Also update what exactly you did with which packages. In principle there is nothing different, but the packages you were using might have been catkinized for groovy.

A:

Packages were catkinized for groovy. Need to use catkin commands (wstool set) instead of older apt-get process.
