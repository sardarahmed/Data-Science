Q:

unable to launch pr2 keyboard teleop on hydro

I was trying to launch pr2 keyboard teleop on hydro but I shown the following error

ERROR: cannot launch node of type [pr2_teleop/teleop_pr2_keyboard]: can't locate node [teleop_pr2_keyboard] in package [pr2_teleop]

Did anyone faced the same issue before?
Thanks

A:

This sort of question has been asked and answered many times. There are a few basic possibilities:

You've installed pr2_teleop from source, and it hasn't been built
You've installed pr2_teleop from debs, and there's a bug in the install command.

In this case, it looks like the second option is the case. I've reported this as a bug: https://github.com/PR2/pr2_apps/issues/14
