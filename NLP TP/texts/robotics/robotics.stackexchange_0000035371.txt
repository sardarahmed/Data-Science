Q:

Turtlebot on Gazebo not operatable

Please forgive this poorly formatted question, but Turtlebot on Gazebo is not operational. It used to be (in my experience at least October 10) working using turtlebot_teleop (which still publishes topic turtlebot_node/cmd_vel with certain values now). So I'm wondering there might have been update on turtlebot / gazebo side that could be causing this. I'm trying to use the packages that I haven't modified. Any ideas would be appreciated. Thanks.
Environment: Ubuntu 11.04/10.10, ROS electric
How to reproduce:
roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_empty_world.launch
roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch
