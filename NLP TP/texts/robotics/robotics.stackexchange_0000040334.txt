Q:

Roboearth installation in fuerte in ubuntu 12.04

I m trying to install Roboearth from the wiki page but when i try to install ros-fuerte-perception-pcl-addons.
it returns with the error no such package found.
Is there some other way to install these depedencies?
Thanks in advance :)

Same for me on 11.10, that package does not seem to exist on fuerte or unstable. Found it in trunk and tried to compile, but its dependencies and the requirements of their dependencies again are too old and tangled.

A:

Please try it again. It should compile under ROS Fuerte now.
