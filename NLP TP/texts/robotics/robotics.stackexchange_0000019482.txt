Q:

What is the cheapest 20mm-diameter roll-angle-sensor (+/-10deg, 60Hz update) you have come across?

What is the cheapest roll-angle-sensor (10degree accuracy, 60Hz update) you have come across for airborne
mobile robots that have a 20mm diameter, shaped like a rocket?  (The robot
is shaped like a rocket and one may need to fit a roll sensor inside of it.)
   I realize that for purely vertical travel, some type of compass would work, but the robot here needs to be able to travel horizontally as well as vertically.  This one below at inertiallabs.com is 554dollars.  I am hoping to find cheaper:

A:

Asking for the cheapest sensor does not make much sense without specifying a maximal error. Otherwise I propose to add a small rock, guess a zero-roll angle and you have a 'sensor' for free with a maximal error of 180deg. 
A real solution would rather be any IMU with a magnetometer (like the MPU9255). It's around 10$ and would give you the information you need.
