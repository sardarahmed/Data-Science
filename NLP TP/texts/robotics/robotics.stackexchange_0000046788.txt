Q:

Rosjava use Kinect

Hello,
I am playing with rosjava on android and now I want to display data from kinect on robot to android. First, I try RosCameraPreviewView, but it works with camera on android. Can RosCameraPreviewView display data from kinect or can I use RosImageView ?
Or I can't use any features from rosjava ?
Thanks for any help
