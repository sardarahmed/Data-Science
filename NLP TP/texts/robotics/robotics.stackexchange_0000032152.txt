Q:

rosdoc and wiki updates

What needs to happen for rosdoc to automatically find and generate stuff for a PackageHeader on the wiki? Specifically, I'm making the wiki page for pr2_marker_control, which is in trunk of pr2_object_manipulation, and it still says "Newly proposed, mistyped, or obsolete package. Could not find package "pr2_marker_control" in rosdoc."
I suspect this is because the released version of pr2_object_manipulation is a branch; does rosdoc only look through specific branches of stacks?

A:

The rosdoc indexer is controlled by this rosinstall file:
https://code.ros.org/svn/ros/stacks/rosorg/trunk/rosdoc_rosorg/repos.rosinstall
The rosinstall file can be updated by people with commit access (usually me).
