Q:

What uses the Grasp Message?

I'd like to use the PR2_grasp_adjust package and associated service call GraspAdjust. However, I can't figure out what to do with the Grasp message once the service returns. Is there a particular service that takes Grasp messages?

A:

A Grasp can be passed on to the PickupAction, serviced by the object_manipulator. You can see an example of calling that action here:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/pr2_tabletop_manipulation_apps/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20Simple%20Pick%20and%20Place%20Application
Note that, unlike the example, you will be populating the desired_grasps field of the PickupGoal with your computed grasp.
Another example can be found in the pr2_interactive_manipulation package, in the file that Adam mentioned above.
