Q:

gazebo ros pid plugin

Hello
I am looking for a gazebo ros plugin to simulate pid position control.
I found a GazeboRosForce but nothing to rotate or move a joint to a certain position.
Any ideas?
Greetings
Max

A:

This is how I've always seen it done. You could write a Gazebo plugin, but you could also run a node like this instead, without having to write any new code at all. Running this controller outside of Gazebo will basically subscribe to the joint's positions and then issue corrective commands to force the joint to follow the PID. Whether it's running in a separate node or as a plugin to Gazebo, it's really all the same in terms of functionality.

Good idea thanks, I will try the control_toolbox, If I have the time I will write a gazebo plugin, because a note runs as a separate process while a gazebo plugin will run within the gazebo loop. Therefore you can not assure real-time "as far as you can speak of real-time with a simulator"
