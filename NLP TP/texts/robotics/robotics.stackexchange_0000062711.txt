Q:

Can I use Stage 3.x.x with ROS Hydro?

Most of the tutorials I found is for stage version 3.x.x.. But Since Fuerte stage version is 4.x.x.
I use Ubuntu 12.04 and on this version ROS Electric can not be installed.

A:

Unfortunately the Stage package is poorly documented. But I've used Stage 4.x.x with Hydro before. I recall there were some minor changes I had to make to my .world files (adding a new dimension to some variables) to make them work with the new version. But other than that everything seemed to work fine.

You're correct. Modifying the config files should be fairly straight forward as I recall. There's always help on ROS Answers if you run into issues!
