Q:

ros2 merging maps for multi-robot exploration

Hello, i'm trying to merge  maps generated from multiple robots in a simulation however i noticed that the map_merger package doesnt exist in ros2. Does anyone know a way to merge maps in ros2 ?
thanks.

Hi Nick. I just finished porting multirobot_map_merge package to ROS2. You can check it out at https://github.com/robo-friends/m-explore-ros2#multirobot-map-merge
Hope it helps future people or you and any feedback or report is welcome!

Hi Charlie, We tried the package in foxy for multi robobts with slam-gmapping - rviz and gazebo all started fine but could not navigate in rviz as the goal is always rejected by the server for both robots. Rviz for map merge is empty.
We tried it in Galactic - launches fine, could navigate both robots in rviz, could run map merge it subscribes to /robot1/map and /robot2/map and map_updates but rviz for map merge is empty
