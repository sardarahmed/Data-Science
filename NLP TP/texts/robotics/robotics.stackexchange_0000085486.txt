Q:

tf between pointcloud and world frame

Dear all,
Instead of using freenect_launch package, I published all depth_image_proc required images and infos by myself and successfully generated pointcloud since I can echo specified topic and it did have response. The problem right now is when I want to use pointcloud to generate actomap in moveit, I assume since I lose the tf between pointcloud and world, the message will always drop. But because I don't know what frame name of pointcloud, I don't know what I should write down when I launch tf publisher. Any idea for how to get the frame name of my pointcloud? Thanks in advance for any help.

A:

If you're publishing the images yourself should be setting the frame_ids in your code. Or else it's a parameter on the intermediate pipeline. You can always find out the frame_id on a message by looking at the output of rostopic echo .

Got it. So the frame_id is specified in the header of message. Right now after launch tf between world and pointcloud in move_group.launch, when I run rviz, it always crashed because of failure to call service /get_planning_scene. But I did launch move_group.launch. Any idea? Thanks for reply.
