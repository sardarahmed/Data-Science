Q:

wg-ros-pkg port to diamondback

I tried building some of the pr2 packages yesterday and found a few are still using eigen, as opposed to eigen3. Looking at the SVN comments at https://code.ros.org/gf/project/wg-ros-pkg/scmsvn/, the packages appear to be in transition. So, this is not so much a question as much as I'm looking for affirmation that you WG-folk are still working on this... should I hold my breath, or make some of the necessary fixes in my local code base?
Thanks,
Sean

A:

The wg-ros-pkg repos is mostly ported to diamondback, including all released stacks.
In Diamondback the package eigen contains eigen3.  The eigen3 package was only a backport into cturtle.
