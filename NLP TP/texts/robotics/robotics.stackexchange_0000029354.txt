Q:

ros-ign-bridge not publishing CameraInfo

Hi I'm using Gazebo Fortress compiled from sources on Ubuntu 20.04 with ROS Noetic
When running roslaunch ros_ign_gazebo_demos rgbd_camera_bridge.launch
If I add a Camera view in RViz I get the warning CameraInfo not published.
Is this considered a normal behavior?
If not, how can I fix this?
EDIT:
I've figured out the following: In the Gazebo GUI, add the Image Display plugin, then select the depth image. The message will then be published on the associated Gazebo topic.
My question now is: How do I get the data to be published without using the GUI?

A:

For whom ever might read this.
There was a bug in gz-sensors.
I opened an issue and contributed a PR that hopefully will have been merged by the time you read this.
