Q:

rqt_graph displays node that doesn't exist

Hi,
I've encountered some problem with using rqt_graph. The problem is displayed on simple example in the image below. The color node doesn't exist (I checked it with rosnode list command), but it's displayed there anyway. I tried reinstalling the whole rqt but it didn't work.

Does anyone know what the problem might be?
