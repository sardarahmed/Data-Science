Q:

Best ROS Kinetic webcam driver?

Hi all,
What is the best webcam driver for ROS Kinetic? I've looked around and it appears libuvc_ros might be OK, but will this work with integrated laptop camera too?
Thanks in advance!
Regards,
Martin

A:

That driver will work with any UVC compatible camera, so if your laptop camera is a USB camera that is UVC compatible (and almost all of them are these days), then I'd expect it to work.
Under Ubuntu (and probably other distributions as well), you can use guvcview to check: if that works with your camera, then libuvc_cam should as well.

Thank you for the reply, gvdhoorn.
I tried installing guvcview and got an error saying no device found. I have a latitude E6540, would you happen to know what driver I could use to get it up and running with ROS?

guvcview has nothing to do with ROS, it's a Linux tool for interfacing with UVC compatible cameras. The only reason I mentioned it is because you can use it to make sure your camera is UVC compatible. The fact that guvcview can't find your camera suggests it is not. But ..

.. do you still have Windows on this machine? If so, does the webcam work there? It's rare for webcams to not be USB devices these days, but it is still possible. Try to find out what kind of webcam it is (look at the hardware properties fi), then you could try to set it up under Linux.

Also: a "driver" for ROS is nothing more than a small program that on one side knows how to 'speak ROS', and on the other side can talk to the real, OS-level, driver of your hardware. So the first thing to do is make sure your OS can work with your device. Then worry about ROS.

According to this pdf it should be a Creative Labs Integrated Webcam. The driver seems to suggest it's a USB cam. Don't know about UVC.

Finally: what is the output of ls -al /dev | grep -i video?

Thank you for all the informaio gvdhoorn, the output of the line mentioned above is:
crw-rw----   1 root video    29,   0 Nov 21 14:44 fb0

And it does work in Windows using a program like Picasa. I will try Bluehash's response below!

It very much looks like you don't have any video device, which would explain why you can't get any of the nodes to work (the fb0 device is an output device, not a camera). The usb_cam package suggested by @bluehash essentially does the same things as libuvc_cam, so also won't work.

I would suggest using the Ubuntu support forums to get your camera to work under Ubuntu. After that, we will be more than happy to help you sort out the ROS side of things.

The pointgrey one appears as fb0, not video1. I can use both cameras in ros but opencv uses pointgrey automatically when I plugged it. (by cv::VideoCapture(0))
crw-rw----   1 root video      29,   0 Nis 21 10:55 fb0
crw-rw----+  1 root video      81,   0 Nis 21 10:55 video0

How can I correct this? Need to install ros driver for it?
