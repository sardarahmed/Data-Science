Q:

Native spherical (WGS84) coordinates?

(this is a cross post from answers.gazebosim.com)
I'm looking to build a simulation where I can accurately bookkeep my robots position in geodetic coordinates (WGS84 datum).
Unfortunately the ROS+Gazebo+Hector GPS plugin route isn't likely to work, exactly because I'm trying to simulate vehicles at high latitude (near the poles), and traveling large distances O(10 km), so the equirectangular projection used by the Hector GPS plugin can't be expected to yield accurate results.
Is it possible to run ROS+Gazebo to run a simulation natively in spherical coordinates? I haven't been able to find any resources to date on this.
If not, have any others found themselves in a similar situation? Outside of writing a dynamical model in MATLAB or similar, have others found an acceptable solution?

A:

The Spherical Coordinate and GPS plugin classes in Gazebo implement WGS84<-->local XYZ coordinates via the intermediate Earth Centered Earth Fixed frame (here's one of many refs on this conversion). This is compared to the equirectangular projection implemented by the Hector GPS plugin.
The local XYZ origin is located at the lat/long specified in the Gazebo world file and has an ENU (East-North-Up) orientation.
