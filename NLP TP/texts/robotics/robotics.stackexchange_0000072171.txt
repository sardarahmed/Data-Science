Q:

Node doesn't receive message, but rostopic list/info sees it

I've modified the turtlesim tutorial to control some servos from a ps3 controller, and everything works fine when everything is running from my laptop. Now I want to move the part/file that actually do the moving of the servos over to a RPi.
I've added

export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://Yoda.local:11311

to the .bashrc on both nodes.
rostopic list/info/type displays the same info on both laptop and RPi, but when I try to get any actual data out, the RPi doesn't receive anything on rostopic echo/hz
I've tried running

rostopic pub -r 10 /robonova3/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist  '{linear:  {x: 0.1, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0,y: 0.0,z: 0.0}}'

on both machines, but its only picked up locally, not by the other machine...
Any suggestions?

Have you also set the ROS_IP on both computers?

A:

This can happen when ROS_IP or ROS_HOSTNAME (only one of the two needed) are not set correctly on both machines. See also lEnvironmentVariables or this Q/A, Searching for "ROS_IP" or "ROS_HOSTNAME" here or on google should also provide sufficient info to fix this issue.

Voila! Thanks
Should've been better explained that this is needed. In the tutorial it's only mentioned as something to add if one cannot ssh to the machine - which I could...

you are welcome to edit the wiki to better explain that ;)
