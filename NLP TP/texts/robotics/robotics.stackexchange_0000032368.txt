Q:

cameracalibrator.py doesn't work with --no-service-check?

I am trying to calibrate a stereo camera (Logitech Webcam Pro 9000) setup under Ubuntu/Diamondback. I am using usb_cam drivers, which are publishing:
/image
/rosout
/rosout_agg
/usb_cam_left/camera_info
/usb_cam_left/image_raw
/usb_cam_left/image_raw/compressed
/usb_cam_left/image_raw/compressed/parameter_descriptions
/usb_cam_left/image_raw/compressed/parameter_updates
/usb_cam_left/image_raw/theora
/usb_cam_left/image_raw/theora/parameter_descriptions
/usb_cam_left/image_raw/theora/parameter_updates
/usb_cam_right/camera_info
/usb_cam_right/image_raw
/usb_cam_right/image_raw/compressed
/usb_cam_right/image_raw/compressed/parameter_descriptions
/usb_cam_right/image_raw/compressed/parameter_updates
/usb_cam_right/image_raw/theora
/usb_cam_right/image_raw/theora/parameter_descriptions
/usb_cam_right/image_raw/theora/parameter_updates

Since the usb_cam drivers do not support the set_camera_info service, I am invoking the cameracalibrator.py with the --no-service-check flag:
rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --size 8x6 --square 0.108 --no-service-check right:=/usb_cam_right/image_raw left:=/usb_cam_left/image_raw right_camera:=/usb_cam_right left_camera:=/usb_cam_left
And absolutely nothing happens - no errors, no messages, no gui. The calibrator node is running and is subscribed to the image_raw feeds. Any ideas?

A:

Are your images synchronized? If you are just using two usb_cam nodes, the timestamps won't ever match on the left/right images, and so you'll never get a matched pair passed to the callback.
