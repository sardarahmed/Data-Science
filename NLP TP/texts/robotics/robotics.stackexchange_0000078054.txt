Q:

[Morse simulation]Module not found: No module named 'morse.middleware.ros_request_manager'

HI there,
I'm trying to use the Morse simulation but find some problems while run the tutorial"examples/tutorials/tutorial-1-ros.py".
The error is as follow:
[helpers.loading] Module not found: No module named 'morse.middleware.ros_request_manager'
[helpers.loading] Could not load the class RosRequestManager in morse.middleware.ros_request_manager
[helpers.loading] Could not create an instance of morse.middleware.ros_request_manager.RosRequestManager
[core.services] Request Manager morse.middleware.ros_request_manager.RosRequestManager not found. Check for typos in the configuration file!

I've already installed the python3.4 and other elements which tutorials indicates.

And also refered the answer:

But still cannot solve the problem.
Any ideas of this problem?

This would really seem to be a problem with Morse and one of its plugins, would you agree? I would suggest you ask this question on a Morse support forum, as you stand a much better chance of getting (good) answers.

A:

Hello!
Can you tell us:

What version of Ubuntu & ROS are you using?
How you have installed MORSE?

...since quite a while, MORSE supports ROS 'out of the box', and does not require any particular ROS configuration steps.

Ubuntu 14.04
Ros 1.11.19
I've already installed MORSE, and launched a simple simulation by using command:
$ morse create mysim
$ morse run mysim

I want to develop a vehicle dynamic model by MORSE on ROS, so I need to use ROS modules.
Does MORSE support my Ubuntu & ROS version?
