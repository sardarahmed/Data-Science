Q:

Can I extract 3d models from RobotStudio?

Hello,
I need to make a ROS package for an ABB IRB 6640-235/2.55
Does anyone know if I can extract the dae and stl files for the 3d models from RobotStudio? Or does anyone have a suggestion where i could get these files from?
thanks,
Dominik

Hi, I am working to create an ABB IRB 2600 12kg/1.85m urdf. I have found the CAD from abb online and when importing into meshlab the robot will self assemble. I had to downscale the robot for RViz as the scales were different. When I open the urdf in RViz my robot does not self assemble as in meshlab. I have tried two things: leaving origins for joints 0,0,0 and then also closely matching to the urdf for the 2600 1.65m variant. (the only difference is length of upright arm). Any recommendations for fixing?
Thanks, Ryan!

I don't know about RobotStudio, but ABB distributes CAD models for "all" of their robots via their site.
I believe IRB 6640 CAD Models should have the files for the specific variant you're after.

And if you model that variant, a PR to add it to ros-industrial/abb/abb_irb6640_support would be a great contribution.

Thanks for the help. Will definitely do a PR once I've finished and tested it.

The new #q383955 seems to suggest you succeeded in creating the support files for your robot variant?
