I followed the guide link text,and input the followed commands

Publish /usb_cam/image_raw I'm using shows clearly my face
rosrun face_recognition Fserver
rosrun face_recognition Fclient
rostopic pub -1 /fr_order face_recognition/FRClientGoal -- 2 "your_name"

I got something in the terminal
Fsever

A:

I fixed it with the help of my friends.
in /home/michael/catkin_ws/src/procrob_functional/src --face_recognition.cpp

change image_sub_ = it_.subscribe("/camera/image_raw", 1, &FaceRecognition::imageCB, this); to image_sub_ = it_.subscribe("/usb_cam/image_raw", 1, &FaceRecognition::imageCB, this);
that is because I use "usb_cam" node not "camera" node
