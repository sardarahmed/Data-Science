Q:

How to teleop PR2 arm in simulation?

I followed Teleop PR2 arm in simulation.
When I run:
  sam@sam:~/code/ros/manipulation/teleop_arms$ ./bin/teleop_pr2_arms_keyboard 
  Reading from keyboard
  ---------------------------
  Use 'WS' to forward/back
  Use 'AD' to left/right
  Use 'QE' to up/down
  sam@sam:~/code/ros/manipulation/teleop_arms$ ./bin/teleop_pr2_arms_keyboard 
  Reading from keyboard
  ---------------------------
  Use 'WS' to forward/back
  Use 'AD' to left/right
  Use 'QE' to up/down

But I can't control PR2 by press W,S,A,D,Q,E on this terminal.
How to fix it?
Thank you~
