Q:

Where can I find the test_ros package?

Hey!
I tried to run the test cases of rosmsg but they depend on a 'test_ros' package that is not listed in the package xml and also not listed in the repositories. Can someone tell me where I can get this package?

A:

There is a test_ros package in ros_comm from the Fuerte release. It contains only message and service definitions.
http://rosindex.github.io/p/test_ros/#fuerte-overview
https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/tree/fuerte-devel/test/test_ros
It looks like test_ros was renamed to test_rosmaster. test_rosmaster has all the same service and message definitions as the old test_ros package
https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/tree/indigo-devel/test/test_rosmaster
test_rosmaster is listed on the packages packages page in the wiki.
http://www.ros.org/browse/details.php?distro=indigo&name=test_rosmaster
The wiki page says the website for test_rosmaster is just rosmaster

The messages are duplicated at several positions. But the tests need a "test_ros" package:
https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/blob/indigo-devel/tools/rosmsg/test/test_rosmsg_command_line.py
I just wanted to add test cases for a Pull Request, but that's quite hard if the test cases don;t run...
