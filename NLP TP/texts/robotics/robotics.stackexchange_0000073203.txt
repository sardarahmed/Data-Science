Q:

What are differences of ROS Desktop vs Base?

I'm installing ROS Indigo on Jetson TK1 and it's fast enough for RVIZ so I was wanting to install the desktop version but only base is available.
How can I get a list of the packages in Desktop so that I can install them manually? This is all on Ubuntu 14.04 "Trusty" on ARM Jetson TK1

A:

You probably can't install the desktop metapackage on ARM because not all of the packages in it build for ARM.
The full list of which packages are currently available on ARM and which aren't is on the ARM build status page

All of the packages installed by base are also installed by desktop. Desktop also includes GUI (graphical user interface) packages that are only useful if you have a monitor attached to your TX1.

I would start with base, and if you find that you need the additional GUI packages, you can install individual packages or the desktop variant later.
