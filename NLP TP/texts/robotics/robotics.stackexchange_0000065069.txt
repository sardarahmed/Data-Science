Q:

Problems with using gmapping - cannot launch node

I request your help in getting started with gmapping on robotino. I have just checked out the robotino-ros-pkg using svn and run 'rosmake robotino' without any errors. Now when I want to launch gmapping using: roslaunch robotino_navigation gmapping.launch, I get the following error:
sam3891@sam3891-ThinkPad-SL400:~$ roslaunch robotino_navigation gmapping.launch

PARAMETERS
* /rosdistro: indigo
* /rosversion: 1.11.10
* /slam_gmapping/xmax: 20
* /slam_gmapping/xmin: -20
* /slam_gmapping/ymax: 20
* /slam_gmapping/ymin: -20

ROS path [2]=/home/sam3891/robotino-ros-pkg
ROS path [3]=/opt/ros/indigo/share
ROS path [4]=/opt/ros/indigo/stacks

Is there any step that I am missing between download the robotino-ros-pkg and implementing gmapping? Do I need to download any extra packages? If so, how do I link it to ROS?
Can someone help please?
Here is the gmapping.launch file:
<launch>
  <node name="slam_gmapping" pkg="gmapping" type="slam_gmapping">
    <param name="xmin" value="-20" />
    <param name="xmax" value="20" />
    <param name="ymin" value="-20" />
    <param name="ymax" value="20" />
  </node>
<!-- Run rviz -->
<include file="$(find robotino_navigation)/launch/rviz.launch" />
</launch>

From the error it seems your ros package paths are not defined properly. Also share the contents of you launch file to know which nodes you are trying to run. Did you sourced your bashrc file with correct ros package path before launching the gmapping node?

Hi, the problem is I am not able to find the gmapping node. There are no source files in the 'robotino_navigation' folder. So my question is, do I need to download something else (some other package) to get Gmapping running?

A:

I solved my problem by downloading the openslam_gmapping dependency ("http://wiki.ros.org/openslam_gmapping?distro=indigo") and then building it in the catkin workspace using "catkin_make". This generated an executable in the devel folder, which I copied and placed into the "bin" folder of "robotino_navigation".
