Q:

How to Integrate a Custom Global Planner with Move_base for Dynamic Path Generation?

I've developed a custom global planner for a ROS project, which dynamically generates new paths based on certain conditions. This means that the global planner continuously produces new paths during its operation. I'm seeking advice on how to efficiently pass these dynamically generated paths to move_base.

Is there a way to integrate this behavior with move_base without modifying its core code?

If modifications to move_base are necessary, what would be the approach to ensure integration?

A:

There is no event-based mechanism in ROS 1 Navigation - use Nav2 which has this ability.
If you want to hack around it, you could potentially set the replanning rate really high (e.g. 100hz) and evaluate yourself each cycle if you should actually replan or just resend the last one.
