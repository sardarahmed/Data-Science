Q:

Problem installing orrosplanning package

Hi,
I try to install package orrosplanning in ROS but I get this error message:
/usr/local/lib/libopencv_gpu.so.2.3: undefined reference to `cv::gpu::GpuMat::release()'
  collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
  make[3]: *** [../feature0d_view] Error 1

I think is by opencv lib, obviously, but last week this didn't happen.
If someone knows something about this I appreciated answers.
Cheers,
Ra√∫l

A:

I ask myself. I had opencv installed by repository and ROS version of opencv and there was a conflict choosing the path.
I uninstalled opencv from svn repository and now compile fine.
Thanks.
