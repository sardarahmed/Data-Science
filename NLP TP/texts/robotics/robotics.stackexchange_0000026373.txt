Q:

please help!, how to open .urdf.xacro file in Gazebo?

Hello all.
I have to load a .urdf.xacro file using the latest version of gazebo. The file of my interested is :https://github.com/utexas-bwi/segbot/tree/master/segbot_description.
Using Gazebo 1.7, I have no idea how to open up  a   .urdf.xacro   file.
Do I have to convert it first to sdf or do I open it directly?
How do I do that?
Thank you!

A:

You'll need to run xacro to convert the file to urdf, which Gazebo can handle. This is easy to do if you have ROS installed:
rosrun xacro xacro.py <xacro file here>

If you don't have ROS installed, I can't think of an easy way. Let me know and I'll post the converted file. That file will undergo some changes in the upcoming week that you won't get if I do so (I maintain the segbot stack).
