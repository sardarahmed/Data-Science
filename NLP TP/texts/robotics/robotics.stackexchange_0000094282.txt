Q:

Sourcing setup.sh fails with: unexpected EOF while looking for matching `"'

I'm trying to install ROS Kinetic, and it keeps failing at various points in the catkin_make process, most notably and most frequently like so:
I ran:
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash

(sometimes I get the following)
-bash: /tmp/setup.sh.SIm4vZkcV4: line 38: unexpected EOF while looking for matching `"'
-bash: /tmp/setup.sh.SIm4vZkcV4: line 39: syntax error: unexpected end of file
-bash: [: 0: unary operator expected

and then
catkin_make

And here's the output:

No matter what, I seem to be having an error in the auto-generated setup.sh file. Not sure how to proceed from here.

Are you building Kinetic from source?
Comment by greentreefrog8 on 2020-01-05:
I was not, but now I am. Same syntax error.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2020-01-05:\

I was not, but now I am

Why?
Comment by greentreefrog8 on 2020-01-05:
I thought there would be a different outcome. There was not.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2020-01-06:
If you don't have a good reason to build from source (and this goes for all packages, not just the "base ROS install"), then don't do it. Always try (hard) to use binary (ie: released) packages.
Please remove the Catkin workspace in which you were trying to build before, and make sure you've installed Kinetic using apt.
As to your problem: please tell us what you did exactly (ie: how you installed ROS). Also include the output of lsb_release -a, uname -rvmp, printf %q "$IFS" and ps -p $$ (note the double dollar sign).
Comment by greentreefrog8 on 2020-01-06:
I've added to the information above.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2020-01-06:
Just for completeness, could you show the contents of /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash and /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.sh?
And based on the armv7l in the uname output you appear to be running this on an arm platform (RPi by any chance?).
That is not necessarily a problem, but would have been good to mention.
I would recommend to remove the source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash line from your .bashrc for now. It's not needed (you can do it manually) and it would unbreak your setup for now.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2020-01-06:
As a test, please run this sed command (copy-paste it, it's a single command line):
sudo sed -i 's|rm -f "$_SETUP_TMP"|#rm -f "$_SETUP_TMP"|g' /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.sh

This will make setup.sh not delete the temporary setup.sh file it creates in the /tmp directory so we can take a look at it.
Then open a new terminal, type source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash. It will probably still fail.
But now there should be a file called /tmp/setup.sh.SOME_RANDOM_CHARACTERS. Open it with less /tmp/setup.sh.SOME_RANDOM_CHARACTERS (obviously replace SOME_RANDOM_CHARACTERS with whatever is there on your machine).
Copy the contents of this file and append it to your question text.

There might be a special character in your username, or home directory or something else that breaks parsing of the setup file.
Comment by greentreefrog8 on 2020-01-06:
Yeah, it's an arm processor. Not an RPi. Sorry, I didn't realize it was important.
the sed command does nothing?
removing the line from the .bashrc would unbreak my setup, but the issue with the setup.sh still persists.
I'm noticing that the syntax error shows on line 38/39, or line 31. Lines 38/39 don't exist.
Comment by Dirk Thomas on 2020-01-07:
Can you share the output of env without sourcing the setup file? Maybe that provides some insight.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2020-01-07:
I don't see anything out of the ordinary in the files shown. There may be something unexpected in the environment, so running env before sourceing anything would be a good check.
Comment by greentreefrog8 on 2020-01-07:
env is up there too now. The only thing I can think of is to remove all the ROS stuff from my environment variables, uninstall ROS, and let it set up everything again.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2020-01-07:\

The only thing I can think of is to remove all the ROS stuff from my environment variables, uninstall ROS, and let it set up everything again.

this would not change anything.
Your environment is incorrectly setup. There should not be any quotes, commas or such characters in there.

A:

Several of your environment variable contain a single double quote: LC_ALL, PATH, LC_CTYPE. Please fix those to not contain quotes. I would expect it to work after that.

Comment by dinesh on 2020-03-28:
i'm also getting this error. but i'm not able to fix it. isn't it setup.sh file which should be modifed and quotes to be checed?
Comment by greentreefrog8 on 2020-03-29:
No, you should just modify your environment variables
