Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Odometer Code

hello,

I'm implementing Odometer in the navigation stack using this:

http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup/Odom

What I understood is that in order to make this code really work on my robot then i'll have to change some stuff.
for example:

16   double vx = 0.1;

17   double vy = -0.1;

18   double vth = 0.1;

I changed those values manually because i dont have a driver. I got help from this:

http://www.geology.smu.edu/~dpa-www/robots/doc/odometry.txt

However, my question is what else should i change?
thank you,

A:

This is just dummy code showing how to fill such messages. What you have to change for your robot depends on your robot's data. There is no general answer for that.

can you explain further or provide a source explaining the code.. i dont understand what's in the website. it is not enough.

Odometry only makes sense, when it comes to a robot. So, at least the velocity values or pose estimates needs to be robot data. Unless you have that it doesn't make sense to publish odometry. If you want more detailed information, you'll have to provide what data you can get out of your robot.

i can get anything out of my robot.. i already provided the velocities,, how can i get the pose estimates?
Comment by dornhege on 2015-04-08:
In this case the code should already work. You only need to continuously update these. It integrates velocities to get pose estimates in ll 31-34. If you have direct pose estimates, e.g., from encoders your code also use these.
