Q:

Setting use_sim_time globally across all ROS2 nodes

Is there a way to set the use_sim_time ROS2 parameter across all nodes?
I want all my nodes to use_sim_time globally by default since most of my work is in simulation.

A:

I think you can use SetParameter in this case.

Thanks! I ended up using SetParameter since I only needed to change one parameter across all nodes. I did not look into RewrittenYaml.
