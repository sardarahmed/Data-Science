Q:

Wheeled Robot Motion Primitives: Is throttling forward and crab motion considered as one?

I am simulating a wheeled robot of six-wheels and can be independently steered, like MER-Opportunity.
The wheeled robot can perform throttling forward, 
||---|| <--wheel orientation
||   ||
||---||

crab-motion, 
//---// <--wheel orientation when heading is 45
//   //
//---//

and turning on the spot.
//---\\ <--wheel orientation
||   ||
\\---//

My question is: Is it correct to say that I have 2 motion primitives? Throttling forward is basically crab-motion with heading zero.

A:

While I am not really sure what you exactly mean by "motion primitive", having the ability to do the "crab-motion" enables you to translate regardless of your orientation and without changing it (assuming 180 degrees of steering) which would not be the case if you had only one pair of steerable wheels (like in cars, remember the parallel parking problem).
Note however that this is still non-holomonic motion system unless the wheels are omniwheels (you cannot rotate and translate independently).
