Q:

Limiting minimum range of virtual kinect laser scan

I am trying to simulate a virtual turtlebot creating a map with gmapping in gazebo.
As an answer to a question I asked earlier, I have been advised to limit the minimum distance from the laser a scan must be to be accepted as valid, so that the laser does not pick up the robot itself.
I am having trouble figuring out how to get that done. Does anyone know what the best way to go about that would be? Or where I could read up on making changes like that?
Thanks,
-Ethan

Which driver is producing the original scan data? Some of them provide a minimum range parameter.

I don't know how to check which driver that is.

I have not worked with gazebo,
but for the actual turtlebot you can check out the parameters of the package "pointcloud_to_laserscan". In this package, a parameter named "~range_min" defines such value for kinect data. (http://wiki.ros.org/pointcloud_to_laserscan)

A:

Hi, sudhanshu_mittal's solution is fine. I add another option: in
turtlebot_description/urdf/turtlebot_gazebo.urdf.xacro

you have the description of the simulated kinect. Parameters
<clip>
    <near>0.05</near>
    <far>8.0</far>
</clip>

allows you to set pointcloud depth limits. In fact, I don't know why near limit it's 0.05... should be 0.4!
