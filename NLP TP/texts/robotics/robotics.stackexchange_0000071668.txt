Q:

Communication with onboard computer and Drone [Solved]

I saw a method to build up a communication with an onboard computer and a Parrot AR Drone. http://wiki.ros.org/ardrone_autonomy
Can I use this instructions for another Drone too? I do have a drone using Pixhawk(APM) and have a onboard computer running Ubuntu and ROS.

A:
