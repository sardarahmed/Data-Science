Sorry my crystal ball is broken, we need more information. Please write HOW you tried to modify the message.

A:

All the code to support messages is auto-generated, so for your changes on the .msg file to be effective the easiest way is to re-build your package.
If you are using a catking workspace try to rebuild it:
$ cd your_catking_ws
$ catkin_make

This will re-generate your messages using the new message specification.
