Q:

Is Venetian mirror possible in Autodesk Inventor?

I see there are things like glass and mirror in Autodesk Inventor Professional 2016 but is there a possibility to have Venetian mirror? So that from one side it would look like a mirror and from the other side it would look like a transparent glass?

A:

Surface properties like that are really only for cosmetic purposes so it is unlikely any CAD program has that option. However, you may be able to get the appropriate effect by assigning particular faces either glass or mirror texture.
Based on your added comments, I think the best option is simply to capture images or animation frames with whatever proper surface setting is needed for the required view angle. Then you can stitch the separate animation frames together to make it seem as though the component has the look you want.
