Q:

Sensing the level of a liquid in a tube

I'm looking to build a sensor which will detect the level of liquid in a tube.
It does not have to be precisely accurate, just detect whether the level is approximately above a certain height.

The liquid level can be seen in the red oval

I thought about monitoring this with a webcam and using opencv to detect the liquid level. but this seemed a bit overkill. Especially if I have to have a dedicated PC to process the images.
Surely there's a simpler solution.
Perhaps a component I can attach to a raspberry PI or arduino board ... 
I'm not very familiar with laser sensors so I don't know what is suitable. 
As long as it's reliable ...
EDIT
I should add that the tube contains toluene which is flammable, and it is vacuum sealed. So we can't just drill into it. Some kind of optical/laser sensor might be  OK, as long as it can recognise a clear liquid. 

A:

If you look in the industry, they usually use capacitive proximity sensors.
This sensors can be adjusted easily to sense behind the glass. In addition I can tell you, that this measurement is highly reliable. Usually they start around 70$, but you find also some cheaper DIY-solutions.
Another possibility is the use floating styrofoam with a magnet on top of the liquid. Just place a reed-relay at the side of your tube and you got the position.
The disadvantages of the listed solutions are that they provide only digital measurements. You get only information like this: The liquid is higher or lower than X cm.
For analog measurements refer to LPs' solution or work with the weight of your device and calculate then the height of your liquid.
EDIT:
concerning the edit of the questions, You should really consider the capacitive proximity sensors, which are usually used for such applications, because you do not need to modify the tube at all.
