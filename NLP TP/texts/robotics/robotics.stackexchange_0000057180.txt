Q:

How to make use of actionfiles between two packages?

Hi,
I am trying to make use of actionlib between two packages in the same workspace, but when I "catkin_make" the workspace I get the following error:
workspace/src/skills/src/master.cpp:63:33: fatal error: ur5_proxy/ur5Action.h: No such file or directory
The ur5Action.h plus additional action files are created in another package called ur5_proxy, and is placed in a directory called workspace/devel/include/ur5_proxy
So my question is how do I make use of actionfiles created in the ur5_proxy package in the skills package? I think the problem concerns the CMakelist or the package.xml.

A:

Your target containing master.cpp needs to declare an explicit dependency on the messages:
add_dependencies(your_program ${catkin_EXPORTED_TARGETS})

See the catkin howto for details.
