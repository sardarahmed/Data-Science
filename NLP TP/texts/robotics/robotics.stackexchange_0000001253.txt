Q:

What is the difference between Task-Level and Joint-Level Control Systems?

While doing a literature review of mobile robots in general and mobile hexapods in particular I came across a control system defined as "Task level open loop" and "Joint level closed loop" system.

The present prototype robot has no external sensors by
  which its body state may be estimated. Thus, in our simulations and experiments, we have used joint space closed
  loop (“proprioceptive”) but task space open loop control
  strategies.

The relevant paper is A simple and highly mobile hexapod
What is the meaning of the terms "joint-level" and "task-level" in the context of the Rhex hexapod?

A:

These are just terms to describe the "layers" of control on the robot.  The "joint level" means the position of each actuator (leg), and the "task level" means the current goal of the robot (like go forward, go east, go to location X, etc).  
This paragraph is about sensing.  There are (apparently) position sensors in all of the leg joints, so the robot is capable of closed loop control at that level -- no user intervention needed.  ("Proprioceptive" is a $5 word for "I know where my legs are because I can sense them".)
However, having no external sensors means that the robot can't tell where it is in relation to the world and as a result it can't determine what action it should take to accomplish its goals.  So, it must run as open loop.  Presumably this means that they are either giving it a pre-scripted set of actions, or directing it via remote control.  
So, the task-level control handles the "go forward" concept, but the joint-level control handles the uneven terrain underfoot.
