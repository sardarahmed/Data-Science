Q:

i can't find the left/right wheel topic on turtlebot Kobuki?

Hi, the "/cmd_vel_mux/input/teleop" topic controls linear velocity and angular velocity of the turtlebot kobuki, what i have been trying to find is the topic that controls the rotational speed of the left/right  wheel of the turtlebot kobuki in order to implement an LQ regulator to control the speed loop of the turtlebot.

A:

Without knowing more about your system (packages, real vs. simulated, topics, etc.) it's hard to give a precise answer. I'm guessing that the /cmd_vel_mux/input/teleop topic takes Twist messages which means that there isn't a separate topic for left and right motors (if that's what you're looking for). Here is the definition of a Twist message
$ rosmsg show geometry_msgs/Twist
geometry_msgs/Vector3 linear
  float64 x
  float64 y
  float64 z
geometry_msgs/Vector3 angular
  float64 x
  float64 y
  float64 z

As you can see, there's linear and angular components to the message. The ones that are probably used are the linear.x (forward/backward) and the angular.z (rotate clockwise/counterclockwise). There is no component for individual wheel speeds (if that's what you're looking for). You can get around this by doing some math to determine the correct linear/angular component values and publish those values along the correct topic.

there is an internal regulator to assure that the Turtlebot goes the exact speed set by the *"cmd_vel_mux/input/teleop" topic.( they use PID regulator for that)
for more accurate measurement i want to use LQ regulator, and for that a separate topic for left and right motors is necessary.

What I'm saying is that that's probably not exposed. I can only guess with the information given.

it is kind of important for my work, i guess i will just keep looking, thank you :)

i ran the rqt_graph during the simulation and i think you are right, the left/right motor topic is not accessible. i will simply try to improve the PID parameters instead of using a different regulator. Thank you for your help
