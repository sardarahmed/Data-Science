Q:

rotate the robot using cmd_vel

hi,
I tried to rotate the pioneer robot using cmd_vel / geometry/Twist with angular.z value.
the robot turns but not nice, sometimes slow, then fast :(
I searched the internet to solve that task, but it hasn't helped.
can anyone help me to rotate the robot lets say 30degree. a c++ code snippet would be awesome, but I'm thankful for any help...

A:

Normally publishing on cmd_vel with an angular.z value should be fine. If it it doesn't behave, I would actually blame the node that provides cmd_vel. Did you try with higher rotational values? Does it get more stable then? Maybe there is a minimal velocity on your motors and the driver runs a controller to reach lower rotational values as good as possible.
If you want to move the robot to a specific coordinate in odometry, e.g. 30 degrees rotated from the current position, check out this tutorial.
For path planning and collision avoidance, check out move_base.
