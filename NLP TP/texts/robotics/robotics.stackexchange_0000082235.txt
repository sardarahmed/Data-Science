Q:

Thread Scheduling in ROS

Dear All,
Anybody had an idea about thread scheduling in ROS?
Suppose I have a node which spawns multiple threads. How ROS handle scheduling of these user defined threads?
Can anybody spread some light on these topics.
Thanks in advance

A:

ROS generally does not mess with threads you spawn (i.e. change priorities or so). This is up to the operating system and you can use standard operating system facilities to do so (for instance setting priority to SCHED_FIFO or so).
