Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: EV3 not NTX

Hello,
I am very new to robotics and purchased an EV3 a few months back, since I am coming from a PHP background, I would really like to experiment using an os like ROS. I have found information about NTX, but I can't seem to find any instructions for installing ROS on EV3.
A bit of guidance will be very helpful.
Thanks,

Hi - this is a great question - and one that I am trying to work the answer out for.. I found this: https://github.com/mindboards/ev3dev its a linux distro for the EV3 that should work if you have a microSD and follow the instructions - take a look at this error first though: https://github.com/mindboards/ev3dev/issues/63 - which helped - but I havenâ€™t gotten past the boot screen yet, you may have more luck.. The next step for me would be then to get a wifi dongle working and see how I can send commands to the EV3 real time.. I was thinking of trying to install a light version of ROS on the SD card - but I am now sure if that is a good idea either.. Will definitely follow up as soon as I have anything more to offer.
