Q:

Queries to implement Navigation stack in simulation

I am trying to implement navigation stack in simulation, but first I want to build the map and save to map server as it is requirement. To build the map, I have followed steps from this link :http://wiki.ros.org/stdr_simulator/Tutorials/Create%20a%20map%20with%20gmapping
I am able to see the simulated map in rviz, how can I use this to load to the map server?

A:

You want to use the map_saver node from the map_server package. You can use this to store the map built with gmapping to disk (as a pgm image and a yaml file containing map metadata), and then later load that map using the map_server. Then you can do things like localize within the map using amcl.

I've built map and got two files one is .pgm and other in .yaml, Now how can load that map using map_server?
I am using this command, rosrun map_server map_server mymap.yaml and getting response :
[ INFO] [1493855683.820361988]: Read a 775 X 746 map @ 0.020 m/cell
how can I use this for amcl?

amcl calls the static_map service offered by the map_server to get a copy of the map.
