Q:

Where to download files referenced in "Object Disappearance for Object Discovery"?

Hi, I wanted to download the dataset used in the paper "Object Disappearance for Object Discovery" .
However, the link http://pr.willowgarage.com/data/mobileobjects/small.bag from the ROS wiki page seems to be outdated now, is there still any way of downloading this rosbag dataset?

A:

IIRC, all files that were hosted at pr.willowgarage.com have been moved to download.ros.org.
You should find the particular file you're after here: download.ros.org/data/mobileobjects.

Edit: I've also fixed the wiki page (diff).
