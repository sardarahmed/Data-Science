Q:

Do subscribers work on a FIFO queue?

Do the queues used in ros::Subscriber behave like FIFO queues?
In particular, if I use a message_filters::Synchronizer that, in approximately equal time increments, invokes a callback function for a subscribed topic with queue size 1000. Will the queue items (passed to the callback) be processed in FIFO order?

Empirical evidence says: yes

A:

Yes they are FIFO on order of receipt.  The closed documentation I'm aware of is in the roscpp overview
