Q:

How to fix an Unstable Build

For those of us that don't speak build-farm, how do I make this build not unstable?

A:

Looking at the console output (http://jenkins.ros.org/job/doc-hydro-navigation/26/console), the only error I see is that it barfs when trying to send emails -- I'm guessing hersh@willowgarage.com (the maintainer email) is no longer valid?

Thanks. I think this is what I'm looking for, although I have yet to check to see if this removes the unstable flag.

Looks like it's not complaining about hersh, it's complaining about "a catkin package".
Comment by Dirk Thomas on 2013-09-29:
The line "Notification recipients: hersh@wDocumenting a catkin package" will extend the list of recipients and that might break the email notification plugin. The problem here seems to be that the output is mixed up (like stdout and stderr). I am pretty sure I filled a ticket about that some time ago but can't find it.
