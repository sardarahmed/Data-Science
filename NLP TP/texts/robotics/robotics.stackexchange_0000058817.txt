Q:

What does qnh attribute stands for in hector_uav_msgs/Altimeter?

Hello,
I am trying to use hector_uav_msgs/Altimeter for barometer sensor data publishing, but I cant figure out what does qnh attribute stand for? Is it possible it's pressure difference?
I understand this is a RTFM-like question, but I can't find any documentation regarding this stack. Any links to documentation would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks in advance
