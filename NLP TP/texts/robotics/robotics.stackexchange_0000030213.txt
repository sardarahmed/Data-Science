Q:

vslam tutorial CameraInfo error

Hi all,
I am running the vslam tutorial, I achieved to compile it but like other I got an error in the vslam-tutorial.bag
$ rosbag play --clock /path/to/your/bag/vslam_tutorial.bag
Client [/wide_stereo/stereo_vslam_node] wants topic /wide_stereo/right/camera_info to have datatype/md5sum [sensor_msgs/CameraInfo/c9a58c1b0b154e0e6da7578cb991d214], but our version has [sensor_msgs/CameraInfo/1b5cf7f984c229b6141ceb3a955aa18f]. Dropping connection.
Client [/wide_stereo/stereo_vslam_node] wants topic /wide_stereo/left/camera_info to have datatype/md5sum [sensor_msgs/CameraInfo/c9a58c1b0b154e0e6da7578cb991d214], but our version has [sensor_msgs/CameraInfo/1b5cf7f984c229b6141ceb3a955aa18f]. Dropping connection.
if I still want to use the vslam-tutorial.bag, how can I change the CameraInfo or what can I do to solve this problem?
Thanks

Which distribution are you running this on?

A:

Have you tried running a rosbag check and rosbag fix on the bag file?
