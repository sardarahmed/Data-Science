Q:

libboost error during linking

Linking CXX executable ../bin/msg_synch
/usr/bin/ld: CMakeFiles/msg_synch.dir/src/msg_synch.o: undefined reference to symbol 'boost::signals::connection::~connection()'
/usr/bin/ld: note: 'boost::signals::connection::~connection()' is defined in DSO /usr/lib/libboost_signals.so.1.46.1 so try adding it to the linker command line
/usr/lib/libboost_signals.so.1.46.1: could not read symbols: Invalid operation
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

The above error occurs when I try to compile test code for approximate time synchronization. The boost library exists and is found, however, I can not interpret the error...other than the obvious, which does not work, adding the lib to the linker. Any suggestions?
As in a previous question, I am synching 3 separate messages with time stamped headers.

How are you linking your executable?

A:

# Put this line before the executable or library in your CMakeLists.txt
   rosbuild_add_boost_directories()
   # assuming that my_target is your executable
   rosbuild_add_executable(my_target my_srcs/my_target.cpp)
   # Put this line after the executable or library:
   rosbuild_link_boost(my_target signals)
