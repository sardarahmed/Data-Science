Q:

catkin_make operation not permitted

I recently experienced a problem with catkin_make.  I am unsure what changed before I experienced the error as I had been using my computer for a couple of weeks without needing to use catkin_make, but I had been using the files in my catkin_ws in that two week period.  Therefore, I am uncertain what was the initial cause of the error (the error is included in the code segment below).

Other than the very first time I ran catkin_make, I received the following error message, which looks very similar:

I tried running catkin_make clean but I received the same error message as shown above.
I also went through my catkin_ws and made every package individually with catkin_make_isolated.  I moved the packages that did not successfully make into another folder on my computer.  However, the same error messages occurred when I ran catkin_make again.
I also made sure I ran:
source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash
source devel/setup.bash
sudo apt-get update
rosdep update
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-control-msgs 
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-catkin 

When no resolution was found, I ran
 rm -rf build
 rm -rf build build_isolated/
 rm -rf build/ build/
 rm -rf build/ devel devel_isolated/

and the last command fixed my problem.  However, I don't actually know what I did wrong.  I want to try to avoid doing it again.  I wanted to post this to help anyone experiencing the same problem and to ask for ideas of the cause of the problem. I would appreciate any hints you could offer as to the possible cause of this issue.

A:

Did you copy your workspace e. g. as backup from an to a zip or from and to an NTFS file system? The unix "is executable" flags (chmod +x) does not survive all of these copies so afterwards when you restore your backup your sh and python script are not executable anymore, which might cause such errors....

I didn't copy my workspace, but its possible that a package may have moved at some point. The files within those packages moved around, but I made sure the individual python files retained their chmod +x state.  Thanks for the lead - it sounds more reasonable than any hypothesis I've come up with.
