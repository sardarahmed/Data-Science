Q:

navigation-stack-actionlib

Hi every body
I am using actionlib to move the bsae of the robot to certain coordinates.
I give the coordinates as follows:
move_base_msgs::MoveBaseGoal goal;
goal.target_pose.pose.position.x = 2;
goal.target_pose.pose.position.y = 6;
double th=D2R*(atan2( msg.pose.pose.orientation.y, msg.pose.pose.orientation.y));
geometry_msgs::Quaternion gth = tf::createQuaternionMsgFromYaw(th);
goal.target_pose.pose.orientation =gth;
Then the robot moves to the desired coordinates, however the robot has a  rotation behaviour when it reaches the goal.
How can avoid that rotation? I just want the robot to arrive to the desired position and stay there without any rotation.
In advance thank you :)

A:

Increase the tolerance on the goal.  If it's too tight the robot will hunt as it gets close.
