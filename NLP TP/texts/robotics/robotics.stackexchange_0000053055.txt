Q:

rqt_plot not publishing showing anything

rqt_plot not publishing anything even thought there is data being published on the topic "mytopic". When I do rostopic echo /mytopic I get continious output with parameters changing given as follows(just posted a script out of the big output I am getting) :
  id: 3
    vs: 4

  - 
    id: 10
    vs: 1

  - 
    id: 13
    vs: 6

  - 
    id: 18
    vs: 1
 
  - 
    id: 19
    vs: 1
  
  - 
    id: 21
    vs: 8

  - 
    id: 27
    vs: 1

  - 
    id: 31
    vs: 1

However when I do rosrun rqt_plot rqt_plot /mytopic nothing is ouputted. Can somebody help me with this.

What data types are the members of your topic? Are they numeric?

A:

Try:
$ rqt_plot /%TOPIC_NAME%/%FIELD_NAME%

In your case:
$ rqt_plot /mytopic/id /mytopic/vs

Hope this works.

unfortunately this does not work. I do not understand why it does not work. For rosrun rqt_graph rqt_graph I get a graph in which I have one note which is publishing and subscribing to my /mytopic. rqt_plot should output the data being published on a topic but it does not show anything althought "rostopic echo /mytopic" shows that data is being published on mytopic.

I'm not sure either. Try rosdep install rqt_plot (this installs missing dependency if any) and tell us the result.
