Q:

Using opencv with Gazebo?

I am planning to use the the camera sensor on Gazebo and use the image from the sensor to perfrom simple image processing like tracking a ball etc. I am planning to use OpenCV libraries. I am very new with opencv, so will I be able to use Opencv libraries ? If so what are the things that I should take care off. I just installed opencv from the following link.
http://docs.opencv.org/trunk/doc/tutorials/introduction/linux_install/linux_install.html#linux-installation
-Thanks

A:

You can use any library, including opencv, inside a gazebo plugin. There is nothing special you have to do.
I do suggest you use ROS.
