Q:

Scope Resolution problem in the ROS2 migration guide

While trying to migrate from ROS1 to ROS2 using the migration guide there is a problem of scope declaration.
while compilation many of the classes of the rclcpp are said as not declared.
e.g. auto node = rclcpp::node::Node::make_shared("talker");, here rclcpp::node has not been declared.
Similarly in rclcpp::rate::Rate loop_rate(10);, here rclcpp::rate has not been declared.
I already have the #include "rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp" What else am i missing ?

It's possible that line in the guide is out of date. Does rclcpp::Node::make_shared("talker") work?

Yes, I also thought the same and changed it to rclcpp::Node::make_shared("talker"). This works. As i also saw in the rclcpp::Node class and there is no mention of node. I am just creating a node by using auto node. Also does that mean I should change rclcpp::rate::Rate to rclcpp::Rate ?

A:

The extra namespaces rclcpp::node and rclcpp::rate were removed in this pull request https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/pull/416/files
Thanks for reporting it. I've updated the migration guide.
