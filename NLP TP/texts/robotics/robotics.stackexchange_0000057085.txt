Q:

pi_face_tracker installation problem

Hi, I followed the instructions to install the uvc_cam and pi_face_tracker but I have a problem installing pi_vision package. What should I do? The problem, I think, is that rosmake doesn't build all the packages required:
 tim@ubuntu:~/fuerte_workspace/sandbox$ rosmake pi_vision

It sounds like you're missing the opencv package. Try:
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-opencv
