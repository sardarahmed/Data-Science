A:

Assuming you have a mobile robot: There is no localization running which procides the transform from map to odom (or what it is called in your robot).
Run rosrun tf view_frames to get a PDF with the tf tree as well as the publishers.

Answer was: You need to start more than just rviz. rviz is just for visualization, but you need other nodes that publish what you want to visualize....

alright, let's take a step back...
Please edit your question with all commands that you actually start, as well as the launch files.
If you only start roscore and rviz, then you have nothing that publishes any data, not tf, not map, not Laserscans...

I thought this was due to environment problem.
