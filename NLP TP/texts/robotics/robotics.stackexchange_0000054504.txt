Q:

Unable to connect USARSim enviroment from ROS

Hi,
I have USARSim running on windows7 on a desktop and P3AT is loaded using Iridium.
In my laptop I have ROS installed and through a LAN wire I try to connect to both machines. I type follow commands in my laptop which are given below:
1.roscore
2.roslaunch usarsim_inf usarsim.launch
Then following error comes------>
root@ubuntu:~/fuerte_workspace/sandbox/usarsim_inf# roslaunch usarsim_inf usarsim.launch
... logging to /root/.ros/log/e8177c52-2a5e-11e3-8c4e-3c970e099562/roslaunch-ubuntu-16625.log

two additional comments:

the P3AT loaded with Iridium will be controlled by Iridium and will be unaffected by USARSimRos. In other words: there is no need to use Iridium if you are going to use USARSim
you can run the command as a normal user, there is no need to run it as root

Comment by RB on 2013-10-02:
I am following this paper "USARSIM/ROS: A COMBINED FRAMEWORK FOR ROBOTIC CONTROL AND
SIMULATION" by Stephen. Here he mentioned the steps; so even if we use ROS then somehow the robot must be placed in the environment of USARSim by something which is Iridium. So after loading teleop package from ROS can control the robot.
Have you tried differently?
Comment by kr1zz on 2013-10-02:
Also I follow the same paper. The robot is spawned where specified in the .launch file, there is no need to use Iridium. You can then control the robot sending cmd_vel messages. I think we are going off topic, send me an email at cristiano.nattero AT unige DOT it, ok?
