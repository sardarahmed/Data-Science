Q:

Is there a laser assembler that produces PointCloud2?

Hello,
I am using the laser_assembler package to assemble laser scans.
This implementation outputs pointCloud messages, and in parallel, point_cloud_converter has been deprecated for diamondback.
Is there any implementation of laser assembler that would already output pointCloud2 format?
Or is there anything planned to implement such a node?
Else, I can modify laser_assembler myself.
Thanks in advance
Raph

I don't think anyone has worked on this yet.  If you wanted to make a node which does that it would be greatly appreciated.  To get it integrated, please just attach it as an enhancement ticket for the laser_assembler package.

BTW, is there any clear tutorial on how to access/write the data of pointCloud2? I find it quite hard has data is an integer array and you need to deal with endianess and the size of whatever is carried inside. I found myself stuck on it quite often an prefer using the pcl pointClouds as they have helper functions to access/write inside them.

I hacked the node by changing the service to ouput PointCloud2 format, and by converting the original pointCloud to pointCloud2 using  sensor_msgs::convertPointCloudToPointCloud2. If this is fine with you, I can post it somewhere, else some more effort should be invested into dealing with pointCloud2 everywhere in the code.
