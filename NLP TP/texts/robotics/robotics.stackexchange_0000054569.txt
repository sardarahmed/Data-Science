Q:

Building Angstrom following wiki: where is the image

Hi,
Following this tutorial http://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Installation/Angstrom, I first tried option 1. I have Angstrom with kernel 2.6.32, but I followed the instructions which left me with a ruined BeagleBoard-xM system. Several other "users" had been created, I could no longer log in as user, only as root and ROS was not installed. After flashing the kernel again and running git, I checked using "opkg list" for ROS packages and none were available. So I guess the recommendation should be "only with latest kernel". Then I build an image, but after building it I can't find the image. What is it called, where is it? Then I used bitbake for cross-compiling ROS. When that finished, I checked for ROS packages and found none. Where should I find them ?
Edit: I tried to create the image again and this time it even goes wrong before the image is finalized giving this error:
NOTE: Error during finalise of /home//devel/setup-scripts/sources/openembedded-core/meta/recipes-extended/images/core-image-lsb-sdk.bb

I guess I'm doing something wrong, but no clue what....

Hi,
The problem is the combination of Angstrom and ROS. When I install Ubuntu I can install ROS groovy (and hydro) without a problem. The problem is that I want DSP as well, which is actively supported by Angstrom only.
Maybe I wasn't clear enough about this, but my latest attempts were building the image following http://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Installation/Angstrom, options 1 and 2, so I did follow http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/building-angstrom. The first time it seemed to go fine, just couldn't find where the image was. The second time, the building ends in the reported errors.
Will be followed up...
