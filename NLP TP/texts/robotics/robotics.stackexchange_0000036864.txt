Q:

Immediate seg fault when running ros node

I am new to ROS and I followed the directions for creating/making/running ros packages, but I get an immediate seg fault.
Here is what i did:

cd ~/ros_workspace
roscreate-pkg begtut std_msgs rospy roscpp
rosmake begtut
created talker.cpp from the tutorials and saved to src
added rosbuild_add_executable(talker src/talker.cpp) to CMakelists.txt
make
run roscore
rosrun begtut talker

I get "Segmentation fault" written to the screen
What am I missing?

Did you verify that the code was copied completely correctly?

A:

So I figured it out.  Thanks for those who looked at my question.
I looked at the core dump file and saw that it was crashing in the boost threads.
I apparentlty have 2 boost libraries installed.
I think the ros install put another one in my system.
I went ahead and removed this version, and rebuilt my program.
Now it runs fine.
Thanks.
