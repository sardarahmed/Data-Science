Q:

Speech Recognition

I need to recognize simple words like apple, orange , yes, no, stop etc  and publish them using a rostopic. I tried using pocketsphinx package with a dictionary, but the results were not very encouraging since the software confused different words. Is there a better solution using ros?

A:

Like this project for example?
Regarding Pocketsphinx: Have you tried another language model/training your language?
Also make sure your microphone quality is fine.
