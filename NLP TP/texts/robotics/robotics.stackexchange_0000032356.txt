Q:

Setting the goal in TrajectoryPlannerROS

I've been going through the API's in TrajectoryPlannerROS from  here  and in the ROS wiki. But I haven't been able to figure  out how to  set the goal pose?  I can't make this out anywhere in the documentation, despite there being lots of functions related to the goal, such as isGoalReached.

A:

The navigation stack uses actionlib to set the 2D nav goal pose. This tutorial explains how to do that programatically. For debugging, it is often useful to set navigation goals using RViz.
