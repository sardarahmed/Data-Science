Q:

Build of Win_Ros with Visual Studio 2013 for Kinect2 usage

Hello,
I am going to use a Kinect 2 sensor with ROS. As for now Kinect 2 SDK is available on Windows 8, I thought on using ROS for windows to send some data to an Ubuntu computer which will use it. But right now, the win_ros package is built with visual studio 2010 and the Windows7 sdk. Looking around I have seen more people interested in the use of the Kinect 2 sensor, also thinking on the "Windows sending the Kinect data to Linux" solution, but I suppose that if it was done directly with ROS, this would simplify a lot of things.
I would like to ask if there is anyone who has the knowledge and may be interested in making a built to be used with the new versions of VS.
Thanks!

This one looks interesting, even though it looks quite similar to the rosserial-windows as suggested in the comment of tonybaltovski

A:

Clearpath used rosserial_windows  with the Kinect 2.0.  Link
