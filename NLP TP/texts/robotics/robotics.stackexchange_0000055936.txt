Q:

Teleop control not working in Turtlebot simulator

I following this tutorial,
http://
wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_simulator/Tutorials/hydro/Explore%20the%20Gazebo%20world
but teleop not working.
I'm using Gazebo 2.1.0 and ROS Hydro.
I used $roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch AND $roslaunch kobuki_keyop keyop.launch and there isn't error message. I have no idea why it doesn't work.
I'm not sure if they've started on different servers and are unable to communicate.

Please say what you are doing and what you expect to happen and what is happening so that we can reproduce the problem. Otherwise we cannot help you.

The problem is that following step by step tutorial I should drive the turtlebot by Keyboard. When I run Roslaunch nothing happens, I can't move turtlebot in Gazebo. It seems that Gazebo and turtlebot_teleop doesn't speak.
I installed everything as the tutorial says.

Are you keeping focus in the teleop window?
Comment by Stefano Primatesta on 2013-12-07:
Yes, but nothing happens. Teleop indicates change of speed but Turtlebot is stopped.

I'm getting the same problem, just following the teleop tutorial that Prima89 mentioned. I can see velocity commands are being published to the /cmd_vel_mux/input/teleop topic, but the Turtlebot doesn't respond. Perhaps it's a problem with cmd_vel_mux then? Or mobile_base_nodelet_manager?

The official ros release gazebo version is 1.9.2.
Using gazebo 2.1.0 would be the problem. Can you try with gazebo version 1.9.2?

Works in Gazebo 1.9.1. Thanks very much jihoonl and tfoote!
@Prima89: refer to this post for how to downgrade from Gazebo 2.1.0 to 1.9.1: http://answers.ros.org/question/101976/ros-hydro-desktop-full-installs-gazebo-current-instead-of-gazebo/

Works!!! Thanks very much!

A:

Opps, looks like I accidentally upgraded Gazebo from 1.9.2 to 2.1.0 in the latest package update. I will try again with 1.9.2.
