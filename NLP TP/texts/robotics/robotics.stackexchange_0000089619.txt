Q:

roscore on python2.7 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe6 in position 16

Hey,
When I set python3.5 as default, I got a error. So, I corrected it to python2.7, However, roscore gave me a Error like this
~$ roscore

Thanks.And I will update with the full errror message.

A:

Sorry for later. A long time ago, I had saved this problem .
It just need to open terminal and input this
$ sudo update-alternatives --config python
有 2 个候选项可用于替换 python (提供 /usr/bin/python)。

  选择       路径            优先级  状态
------------------------------------------------------------
  0            /usr/bin/python3   150       自动模式
* 1            /usr/bin/python2   100       手动模式
  2            /usr/bin/python3   150       手动模式
要维持当前值[*]请按<回车键>，或者键入选择的编号：

Next you need to chose python2, just it looks like, push the number 2 & Enter. Everything is OK.
