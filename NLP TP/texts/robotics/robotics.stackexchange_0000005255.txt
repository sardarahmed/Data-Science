Q:

Where is the function _MAV_RETURN_ defined?

I'm trying to understand the source code of ArduPlane. The MAVLink message is decoded using a set of _MAV_RETURN_???? functions, e.g. _MAV_RETURN_float
When I grep recursively for _MAV_RETURN_float, I could not find where it is defined. I wonder if I'm missing anything.  

UPDATE
Here is the source code of Ardupilot, including ArduPlane.

A:

Macros(_MAV_RETURN_??) for uin8_t, int8_t and char are defined at https://github.com/diydrones/ardupilot/blob/master/libraries/GCS_MAVLink/include/mavlink/v1.0/protocol.h#L236 onwoards. 
However for datatype with more that 8 bits, they have written inline function _MAV_RETURN_## using 'Token Pasting Operator' which handles rest 16bit, 32bit and 64bit datatypes handled by mavlink including float. This function is written at https://github.com/diydrones/ardupilot/blob/master/libraries/GCS_MAVLink/include/mavlink/v1.0/protocol.h#L242 onwards
