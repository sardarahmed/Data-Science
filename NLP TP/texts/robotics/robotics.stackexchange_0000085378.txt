Q:

ERROR: cannot launch node of type [create_node/turtlebot_node.py]: can't locate node [turtlebot_node.py] in package [create_node]

Hi,
I am have installed turtlebot binaries. While executing :
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch

I am getting error as :
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [create_node/turtlebot_node.py]: can't locate node [turtlebot_node.py] in package [create_node]
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [create_node/kinect_breaker_enabler.py]: can't locate node [kinect_breaker_enabler.py] in package [create_node]
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [create_node/load_calib.py]: can't locate node [load_calib.py] in package [create_node]

I have reinstalled turtlebot package more than thrice. I am still facing this issue.
I have create_node package installed. All the three files (turtlebot_node.py,kinect_breaker_enabler.py,load_calib.py) are present in /opt/ros/kinetic/lib/create_node folder. When I move these files from lib folder to share/create_node I get below error:
[turtlebot_node-4] process has died [pid 5091, exit code 1, cmd /opt/ros/kinetic/share/create_node/turtlebot_node.py --respawnable cmd_vel:=mobile_base/commands/velocity turtlebot_node/sensor_state:=mobile_base/sensors/core imu/data:=mobile_base/sensors/imu_data imu/raw:=mobile_base/sensors/imu_data_raw __name:=turtlebot_node __log:=/home/nvidia/.ros/log/ca2facc4-1432-11e8-91f4-00044b8c7fdc/turtlebot_node-4.log].
log file: /home/nvidia/.ros/log/ca2facc4-1432-11e8-91f4-00044b8c7fdc/turtlebot_node-4*.log

Any help with this issue is really appreciated.
Thanks in advance

A:

You should not modify the setup.bash file. You need to source both of the setup.bash files of your distribution and your workspace. Please see the tutorial on the creating a catkin workspace.
