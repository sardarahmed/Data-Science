Q:

how to calculate covariance

Hey!
I am looking for the error covariance of two sensors (gyro & accelerometer). Since I do have the data sheets I was wondering if you could tell me how to obtain the value. I do know that the covariance might change but is there a way to estimate it from noise specifications or something similar?
In both cases I have the power spectral density of the noise. Is this the value I need? The information I am referring to is on page 12 and page 13 in this document.
Thanks for any suggestions :)

A:

Your link does not work. In general, if you have the data, you could just use the sample covariance as an estimate (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_mean_and_sample_covariance#Sample_covariance).
