Q:

How to get topic list from ROSBridge?

I've beem unsing ROSBridge 2.0 to communicate with ros, and i'm trying to get the topic list using the following JSON message:
{
"op": "call_service",
"service": "/rosapi/topics"
}
but i get an error on ros with the following text : "call_service InvalidServiceException: Service /rosapi/topics does not exist".
I can call services from rosservice but not from rossrv...
What am i doing wrong?

How did you start the rosbridge? did you rosrun or roslaunch?

A:

I already fixed it.
The problem was that i did not knew that the rosapi node had to be started. After i started the node (rosrun rosapi rosapi) it worked like a charm...
Thanks anyways.
