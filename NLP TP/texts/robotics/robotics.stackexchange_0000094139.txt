Q:

unable to visulize PointCloud using octomap_mapping

I am using Turtlebot3 Burger in gazebo simulation. Since it does not have pointcloud2 data, I use laser_geometry package to convert the scan data into pointcloud2. I want to use the octomap_mapping in octomap_server to visualize the pointcloud data. Based on some instructions, I modified the octomap_mapping.launch:

where "pc" is the pointcloud2 converted by laser_geometry.
But when I open rviz and use MarkerArray to visualize the occupied cell, it does show anything. I tried to look at the message in the /occupied_cells_vis_array, and It says no message warning.
Could anyone help me figure out what is going wrong? I am really new to ROS, thanks for patience.

A:

My guess is that you have a timestamp issue in your publishing of pointcloud2 message from the laser data. octomap_server  integrates pointclouds to the OctoMap only if there's a valid transformation between the frame of the point cloud and the fixed frame specified for octmap_server. So I would double check the timestamps of the generated pointclouds to see if they match with the current ROS time.
