Q:

How to use slam toolbox?

I've seen the introduction of slam toolbox, but have no idea what exactly tools it has(launch files or nodes), how to use them, what input do I need to give, and what their output is.
I think this has a great relationship with my lack of understanding of SLAM
But I still want to ask if there is a more detailed document so that I can use the slam toolbox with the only understanding of the input and output
Thanks in advance

I kind of agree. The documentation is pretty less and there is very little information about the launch files, how to run them etc (example: what is to be used when we have a rosbag and want to create a map later, when does one use the online sync launch, the online async launch, etc). I am using the melodic branch of the slam_toolbox. The ROSCON talk and the readme give some amount of information but it is not very clear.

A:

My recommendation would be to look at the Nav2_Bringup SLAM example which demonstrates the basic use of the slam_toolbox on a turtlebot3 robot, and includes typical configuration values.
The github link you included also contains quite a bit of the information you are looking for, if you scroll down to the API section. Consider the inputs to be the Subscribed Topics and the Configuration Parameters.

Thanks a lot. But I have no physical turtlebot3 robot. Can this run with a simulated robot?

Yes, if you look at the nav2_bringup package on github you'll get a bit more information on running navigation2 in simulation.
if memory serves, it will be something to the effect of:
ros2 launch nav2_bringup tb3_simulation_launch.py slam:=True
