Q:

detect qrcode with zbar_ros

I could use zbar_ros with a webcamera to detect QRcode successfully.
But when I change the camera ,and add <remap from="device" to="/dev/video1"/>.
I can't start zbar_ros successfully.

Hi, wsAndy. I wonder how can I use these codes. Do I need another QR code reader to help detect QR code? I am almost a green hand here. Any suggestion will be appreciated. Thanks in advance.
Best regards, Peter

Well, you don't need another QR reader. zbar_ros is a good package. I think the reason why I couldn't use another camera to detect QR is that I use a wrong driver. As zbar_ros package just need to subscribe an image .

A:

The <remap> tag is for ROS graph objects (topics, services, etc) rather than for ROS parameters. If you want to change the input device, you should use the <param> tag.
