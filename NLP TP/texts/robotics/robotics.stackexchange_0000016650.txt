Q:

Why is the contact force of the rigid-body robot model ks*xr?

In the paper "On Dynamic Models of Robot Force Control", which is written by Steven D. Eppinger and Warren P. Seering, there is a model 'rigid-body robot model'. The model is like below. 

In the paper, the model is described as:

We model the robot as a mass with a damper to
  ground. The mass $m$,. represents the effective moving mass
  of the arm. The viscous damper $b_r$ is chosen to give the
  appropriate rigid body mode to the unattached robot. The
  sensor has stiffness $k_s$ and damping $b_s$. The workpiece is
  shown as a "ground state". The robot actuator is
  represented by the input force $F$ and the state variable $x_r$,
  measures the position of the robot mass.

In the paper, the contact force, which is the force across the sensor, is $F_c=k_s x_r$. But because the damping source from $b_s$ is also the part of the sensor, I think the contact force is $F_c =k_s x_r + b_s \dot{x}_r$. However because this paper and model are cited by many studies, I think I'm wrong. So, why $F_c=k_s x_r$?
PS : I wrote $f_s = k_s x_r$ previously. I modified that to $F_c = k_s x_r$.

Edited:
You should have put the subscript $c$ on variable $F$, because they define $F_c$ as the contact force the system is trying to maintain.   Since achieving and servoing around that desired contact force is the goal, the velocity at the target state will be zero.  Therefore $F_c = k_sx_r$.   Youâ€™ll find the damping terms in the dynamic model - they are in the denominator of the transfer function. 
Note:  I see you added the subscript now.  Thanks.
