Do you know the manufacturer and model of your robot?

A:

I think there is only support for articulated robots currently. But you should check the list here:

The URDF format should be flexible enough to model a SCARA robot without problems. The bigger question is finding drivers that can control and read the hardware from ROS.

well we have the drivers the we can use and we are thinking using a raspberry pi. i saw in the gazebo simulator package in groovy the they have a scara in the example kit you think i can use that scara or i have to build my own scara package.

You can probably adapt the existing SCARA model to your robot. If you're going to be doing any kind of motion planning, you'll need to make sure that the dimensions in your URDF match your robot.
