Q:

ros indigo and opencv 3.0

Hi,
I just wanted to ask how to use ros indigo with opencv 3.0.
I installed ros-indigo-opencv3 and compiled the latest opencv from source.
When I create regular executables opencv 3.0 is used and it works fine,
but when I use catkin_make, some packages use opencv 2.4.x and some 3.0
and then they do not work together.
How do I hide opencv 2.4.x from being used?
Thanks

Similar to http://answers.ros.org/question/214043/use-ros-indigo-opencv3-alongside-248/

A:

nevermind. Some dependencies were using pre-built packages which used OpenCv 2.4.x. After recompiling these, everything worked fine.
