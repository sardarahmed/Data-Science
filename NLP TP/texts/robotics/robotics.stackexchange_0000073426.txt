Q:

catkin tools command not found

Hello,
I installed catkin tools (http://catkin-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html) in one of the users for a PR2 (locally installed with --user) by following the instructions in http://catkin-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html#installing-from-source.
The problem is when I try to run the catkin command as I get the following message:
-bash: catkin: command not found
If I try to use it like this:
~/.local/bin/catkin
I get
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "../.local/bin/catkin", line 5, in <module>

from pkg_resources import load_entry_point
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources.py", line 2707, in <module>

working_set.require(__requires__)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources.py", line 686, in require

needed = self.resolve(parse_requirements(requirements))
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources.py", line 584, in resolve

raise DistributionNotFound(req)
pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: osrf-pycommon>0.1.1

I'm not sure where to look at with this error....
Any suggestion would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks in advance

try doing source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash

A:

The first issue is most likely caused by the fact that ~/.local/bin is not in the user's PATH environment variable. When you do a non-user-specific pip install the executables will get put into /usr/local/bin which is likely on your path by default (the same is true with an apt-get install although it will likely be  in /usr/bin).
The second issue (where you provide full path to the executable) is because Python can't find modules that catkin_tools depends on. This is most likely because ~/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages (and possibly ~/.local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages) are not on the user's PYTHONPATH environment variable. In global pip installs and apt-get installs, this would also not be an issue.
Try fixing those two environment variables for the user, and the issues should go away.

Yeah, the ~/.local/bin was not in the PATH and the other issue was that there were some dependencies not installed. The installation process I followed then was different from the one they have now in their site (they included pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade)
