Please also provide the distribution and Ubuntu version you are using.

A:

It's working know
executing :
apt-get install ros-electric-client-rosjava-jni
and
apt-get install libjson-glib-dev
then specifying the https_proxy=xxx in front of the rosmake roboearth command
For info and answer i use Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.
