Q:

rostopic no longer work

I am working with ubuntu 14.04 indigo. I was downloading a python program and installed a few dependences like python3-pandas, python3-yaml, python3-rospkg. Now, it seems like my rostopic doesn't work anymore, when I run it, it shows
~$ rostopic 
rostopic: command not found

, I tried source the setup files below but rostopic still woudn't work.
echo "source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

Following is my env values:
ROS_ROOT=/opt/ros/indigo/share/ros
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.1.11:11311

I tried to export the following env values, and ran it again but rostopic still didn't work.
ROS_ROOT=/opt/ros/indigo/share/ros
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/administrator/catkin_ws/src:/opt/ros/indigo/share:/opt/ros/indigo/stacks
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
ROSLISP_PACKAGE_DIRECTORIES=/home/administrator/catkin_ws/devel/share/common-lisp
ROS_DISTRO=indigo
ROS_ETC_DIR=/opt/ros/indigo/etc/ros

Also, when I hit double tab on ros, it doesn't show rostopic as an option:
~$ ros
rosawesome                    rosdistro_migrate_to_rep_143
rosboost-cfg                  rosdistro_reformat
roscat                        rosed
roscd                         rosinstall
rosco                         roslocate
roscp                         rosls
rosd                          rospd
rosdep                        rospython
rosdep-source                 rosrun
rosdistro_build_cache         rosversion
rosdistro_freeze_source       rosws
rosdistro_migrate_to_rep_141 

From the above list, it seems like my roslaunch is missing as well.
Did downloading those 3 packages break my ros environment? What can I do to fix it?

A:

Try to install the rostopic package.
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-rostopic ros-indigo-roslaunch
You can find the installed commands in ls /opt/ros/indigo/bin
Source your environment source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
