Q:

Call code before launching?

I'm interested in auto-generating some files before the start of my ROS run.   The files will depend on real-time data available at the start of the run.    Is there a nice way to include this in my lanch file ?   Like some tag which funs an executable or python script before loading up the ROS modules?

A:

As noted in the roslaunch documentation, there are no guarantees on the order that nodes/scripts in launch files are started in. The easiest way to do what you want might be to write a short shell script that first runs the scripts for generating your data and then calls the required ROS launch file afterwards.
/edit To raise awareness for the "hacky way" @dornhege suggests below in comments. An example (creating a folder) is available here.

This sounds like a good solution. There is one slightly hacky way to do this: The param tag allows you to use the output of a command as a parameter. You can create a dummy parameter that just calls your program. Parameters are guaranteed to be set before the launch is started.

That hacky way is nice, thanks !
