Q:

C++ script in Python

I'm relatively new to the ros system.. I'm trying to install the sick_tim3xx-groovy package on my ros system but the package is written in C++ whereas my system is in Python.
Is there anyway to install the package without re-writting it or am I fresh outta luck?

A:

Hi @SuperRedRobin92,
mixing nodes written in Python and nodes written in C++ is no problem in ROS, since each node is a separate process that communicates with other nodes over network messages. Simply follow the instructions on the sick_tim3xx wiki page; the driver should publish sensor_msgs/LaserScan messages on the /scan topic. Simply subscribe to the /scan topic from your Python node and do whatever you want to do with the messages you get.
If you have any further questions, please comment on this answer or open a new question.
