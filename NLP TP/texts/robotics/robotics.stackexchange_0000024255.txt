Q:

Importing 3D models into webots 2023a and splitting parts into shapes for a robot

I am quite new with Webots. I am wondering if there is a possibility to import 3D models into Webots 2023a as it was possible within Webots 2021b. I have managed to import it within 2021b, but when I specify the bounding object and I apply physics, the robot falls through the arena and bounces around underneath. The same thing occurs when I just create a solid with a box shape and apply bounding object and physics to it.
I know that you can import it using a CADshape within the 2023a version, would I have to import all parts of my model assembly separately and then assemble it within Webots under a robot node?

A:

I would recommend you to merge together in your 3D modeling software all the parts of your robots that don't move with respect to each other and save them into a single Collada/DAE or a wavefront/OBJ CAD file. At the end you will have several CAD files corresponding to each moving part of your robot that you will assemble together in Webots within a Robot node using the CADShape node. For example in case of a simple differential wheels robots, you will have typically 3 CAD files: one for the base of the robot and one for each of the two wheels. For a legged robot, you will end up with many more CAD files.
As for the bounding objects, I would recommend against using CAD files for them as it will impact the performance and quality of collision detection. Instead, you should use primitives, such as Sphere, Capsule, Box, Cylinder and/or combination of them as explained in this tutorial.
