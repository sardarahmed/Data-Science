Q:

Restart a package with a clean state

Could someone remind me a way to flush/reset our package. There are some files needed to be deleted inside a package, like "something to do with cache, the file name", and so on. I did this long time ago, but, now I forgot already.
Thanks in advance.

A:

If I understand you correctly, a "make clean" when in the package directory should do it. To also rebuild dependencies you can also do a "rosmake [your_package_name] --pre-clean".
