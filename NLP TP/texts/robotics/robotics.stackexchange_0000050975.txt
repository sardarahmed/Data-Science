Q:

Matrix multiplication in ROS CPP

Hi,
I would like to write a node that reads data from a file, a vector and a matrix, and as part of the task this node is supposed to preform I need to multiply the vector by the matrix. Is there already a data structure in ROS library that one can use to create vectors and matrices. If so, How does the matrix multiplication is carried out?
