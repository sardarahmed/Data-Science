Q:

Is there a floating joint in Gazebo?

URDF description of the robot allows to specify a 'floating' joint -- a joint with 6 degrees of freedom. But when the robot description gets translated into SDF, the floating joint is converted into fixed joint. Is there a way how to achieve a floating joint in Gazebo? I want to completely control the child link's movement with my plugin.

Hi, did you figure out a way to do 6DOF pose control of a robot model in Gazebo?

A:

A floating joint in Gazebo (SDF) is just no joint 
Unlike URDF, links in SDF can just exist as children of the robot model without being connected to each other in a tree structure.
