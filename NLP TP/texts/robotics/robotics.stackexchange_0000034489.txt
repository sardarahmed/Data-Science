Q:

Trying to run rviz: Getting error "Could not contact ROS master..."

I'm trying to run rviz on electric/Ubuntu 10.4.  I am getting the popup message:
rviz:  Waiting for master
Could not contact ROS master at [http://localhost:11311, retrying...
I've run rviz before and never seen this.  Any assistance is appreciated.
Paul.

Thanks Hsu.  This worked.

Paul, you can edit your original question, rather than posting an answer.   Is your roscore running and your ROS_MASTER_URI pointing to it?

A:

Try:
In one terminal run "roscore"
Then, in a new terminal do "rosrun rviz rviz"
