Q:

Running sample ROS node on Android through SL4A

Hi,
Following the instructions in section 6 on running the sample ROS node on android page http://www.ros.org/wiki/android, when I went to SL4A, then went into ros.py, it asks for the ROS_PACKAGE_URI. I filled in the field with http://ubuntu:11311/. Then it says "uname: permission denied". How can I go about this?
Thanks
Soe

A:

Have you considered using rosjava instead? You'll see much better integration with Android that way. See http://rosjava.googlecode.com/

They are part of the Android library and not part of rosjava.jar. If you're having trouble, this may be better off as a separate question.

There is currently a problem with importing RosTextView and MessageCallable into the java because they seem not to be included in the rosjava.jar library.

There are fully functional Android projects under trunk/android/tutorials.

Hi Damon, Yes, I have already tried it, but cannot seem to understand how to start it off. Can you provide some simple example source files for linking android with ROS, which are fully functional? That would be very helpful indeed. I am using the eclipse with android sdk and adt tools. Thanks! :D
