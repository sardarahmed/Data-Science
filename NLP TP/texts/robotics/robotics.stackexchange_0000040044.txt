Q:

Fuerte: segfault for rviz and gazebo

Hi, I'm using ROS Fuerte on Ubuntu Oneiric. I found that segmentation fault occurs when I start gazebo and rviz.
Error messages for gazebo are:
Dbg pluginPaths and GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH doesn't exist.Set GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH to Ogre's installation path. ...or are you loading via SystemPlugins?

Error messages for rviz are:
[ INFO] [1335784163.509573136]: rviz revision number 1.8.11

Segmentation fault

What would be the possible reason for these errors?
Thanks!

A:

please read the page http://www.ros.org/wiki/rviz/Troubleshooting#Segfault_during_startup
and try each mode of these: copy PBuffer FBO, maybe one of them will work!
