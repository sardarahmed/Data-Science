Q:

Werid Multiple Machines Problem -

Hi,
I'm not sure of this is simply a compatibility issue or something else. On one machine I have fuerte an the other electric. Both the simple talker and listener tut's work fine with run on each machine.
I've set export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.1.40:11311 to the machine with has roscore running on.
Running roscore and talker on machine A then the listener on machine B - nothing happens. However "rosnode list" on machine A recognises lists the listener (and the listing updates when I kill the listener).
Similarly if I set up two listeners the older one gets killed off if that was running on machine B - but not the other way around.
So there seems to be some kind of comms going one. But not the whole thing.
Looking at http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/MultipleMachines hasn't reveiled anything. Pinging etc all seems okay.
Any ideas anyone?
Thanks in advance
Mark

Could you update your question to include the ROS_MASTER_URI you are setting on each machine and the ROS_IP/ROS_HOSTNAME you are setting on each?

A:

Okay found the issue. Came down to DNS problem (Machine B is a VM and the VM network bridge was assigning it an unusual address). Updated the /etc/hosts file with the machine name where roscore is running and working as expected.
Thanks for your input all
