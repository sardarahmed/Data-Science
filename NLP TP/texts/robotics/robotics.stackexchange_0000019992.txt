Q:

Why are the angular velocities of concentrated masses in Lagrangian independent?

There is an ordinary linear three-mass system.

If we write its Lagrangian, we get the following equation.

where $W_k$ and $W_n$ - kinetic and potential energy.
To find the moment of rotation of the first mass, we must differentiate lagrangian first by the angle of rotation of the first mass $\phi_1$, then find the rate of change in time of the Lagrangian derivative with respect to speed $\omega_1$.
Lagrange equation
Suppose we want to find the moment of the first mass $J_1$ (we assume that on the shaft of the drive motor).
$\frac{\partial L}{\partial q} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi_1} = -c_{12} (\phi_1 - \phi_2)$
$\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} = \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \omega_1} = J_1 \frac{\partial \omega_1}{\partial t}$
Which ultimately gives us a dynamic equation:
$M - c_{12} (\phi_1 - \phi_2) = J_1 \frac{\partial \omega_1}{\partial t}$
My questions are as follows:

Where did the masses of $J_2$ and $J_3$ go? Because we are looking for a derivative and speeds of this masses $\omega_2$ and $\omega_3$ do not explicitly depend on $\omega_1$, no matter how massive they are, they do not include into the equation of motion and do not affect the torque M.
Do I understand correctly that taking into account the influence of the moments of inertia of the remaining masses $J_2$ and $J_3$ is possible only by bringing the moments of inertia to the motor shaft $J_1$ (by correcting the coefficients of the square of the gear ration).
Is it possible to do without this operation and include the gear ratio in the model?

A:

Welcome to Robotics, Andrew Sol. I think I'm a little confused with your question as it appears to be about independent rotational masses connected by rotational springs, but then later you're asking about gear ratios.
This is a succinct as I can think to put it, and again I may have misunderstood the question so please feel free to comment on this answer or edit your question to clarify:
The equations of motion govern the dynamics of the system. If you have several bodies that are rigidly coupled, as in a gearbox, then you would (I would, at least) modify the moments of inertia to account for the gearbox ratio and then treat the entire gear train as one system.
Consider this: If $\omega_2$ could be calculated by $\omega_1$ and a gear ratio, then what dynamics do you need to solve?
