Q:

Path planning in simulator without sensor data

Is it possible to do path planning in ROS (only during simulation) without using any sensor data (eg. kinect, laser or stereo)?
Since the environment data is stored in collada format through which we have a perfect knowledge of the environment (even location which are not visible to PR2) and this data can be used for checking collision. I think this is how OpenRave also checks for collision while planning and it bypasses the sensor.
