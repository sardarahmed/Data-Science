Q:

sourcing setup.bash does not work in galactic

Hello,
So I installed ros2 galactic using the installation instructions, but when I use source /opt/ros/galactic/setup.bash it does not work, e.g. ros2 command is not found. That being said, when I use . ~/ros2_galactic/ros2-linux/setup.bash (mentioned in the installation instructions), it does do what it's supposed to do. Please help me!
Thank you

Which installation instructions did you follow?

A:

As the instructions you followed say, when installing from a pre-built binary tarball you have to use source ~/ros2_galactic/ros2-linux/setup.bash to activate ROS. It has been installed to ~/ros2_galactic. If you want it installed in /opt/ros then you need to follow these instructions to install using Debian packages. This works on Ubuntu, despite the name of the package format.
