Q:

Dynamic model of a tank like robot

I am planning a tank like robot for hobby purpose. I have control engineering background, however I never applied on robotics. 
I would like to test different control theory, namely MPC. I saw a lot of publications regarding the kinematics and inverse kinematics of such a robot, however I am wondering if somebody can point out regarding the dynamics modelling of such a system,taking into account the forces, mass etc?

A:

For building a dynamic model from scratch of any differential drive mobile robot (i.e., a tank), the best resource I've found so far is a paper by Dhaouadi and Hatab (PDF link) titled "Dynamic Modelling of Differential-Drive Mobile Robots using Lagrange and Newton-Euler Methodologies: A Unified Framework". It even includes some discussion of how to do the dynamic modeling of the actuators.
