I have been learning segmatch lately,and I refer to a website :

https://github.com/ethz-asl/segmatch/wiki/Demonstrations

when I run:

roslaunch laser_mapper kitti_loop_closure.launch

it can work but will show an error:

A:

The error ERROR: cannot launch node of type [laser_mapper/laser_mapper_node]: can't locate node [laser_mapper_node] in package [laser_mapper]seems to be regarding build/finding the node laser_mapper_node. Make sure the package laser_mapper is built and sourced, and check if you can run rosrun laser_mapper laser_mapper_node
