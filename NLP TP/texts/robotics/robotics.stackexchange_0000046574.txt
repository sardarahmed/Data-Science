Q:

How to call methods defined in python in a node written in C++

Hi,
I want to call quat_to_angle() and normalize_angle() methods defined in calibrate.py in the turtlebot_calibration package in my node written in C++. There is no header file generated of calibrate.py, so is there any way that i can use these methods in my C++ code without rewriting these methods in C++? If not then can u please tell some alternate implementations of these methods already done by someone else?
Thanks
Regards
Usama

A:

Not without some major overhead compared to the functions.
For C++: normalize_angle can be found in the angles package (angles/angles.h) and quat_to_angle can be done using tf functions. For the yaw use tf::getYaw. You can provide a tf::Quaternion or a geometry_msgs::Quaternion.
