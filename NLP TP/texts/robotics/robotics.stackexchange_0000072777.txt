Q:

Velodyne point cloud node doesn't work

I have a 32 HDl and VLP 16. I built the velodyne package by compiling it from source as I wanted to use VLP-16 driver.
When I try to run the velodyne pointcloud node for the HDL 32, I get the following error
$ rosrun velodyne_pointcloud cloud_node _calibration:=32db.yaml
[ INFO] [1458049427.031892132]: correction angles: 32db.yaml
YAML Exception: yaml-cpp: error at line 0, column 0: bad conversion
[ERROR] [1458049427.036928149]: Unable to open calibration file: 32db.yaml
[ INFO] [1458049427.043593822]: Reconfigure Request

A:

This is apparently a bug caused by a recent source update affecting the YAML reader.
See issue #84.
