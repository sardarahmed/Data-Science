Q:

Generating double s-curve velocity profiles with given time

I wonder how to generate double s-curve velocity profile for multiple DOF trajectory. Since there are constraints on initial and final velocities which can be non-zero it is necessary to synchronize each DOF in time. Therefore firstly I would like to compute trajectory for DOF with the largest displacement and then trying to fit other DOFs in the computed execution time for the former. However I was not able to find anything about generating s-curve profile with given time. Having tried to solve it by myself I came up with a conviction that it is an optimization problem. I tried several approaches but they all seemed to have non-convex cost function and hardly could they satisfy constraints on final velocity. Having spent much time I wondered if there is an easy way to synchronize them?

A:

I have found a solution. Quiet simple actually. To generate minimum time double s-curve profile I used algorithm presented in this wonderful book. After computing trajectory for the first DOF I perform the same algorithm for the other DOFs but if trajectory is infeasible with given time, it is appeared to be a good idea to make maximum possible acceleration smaller and smaller with some factor(I use 0.95) which leads to longer trajectory execution. Moreover we can do the same with maximum velocity and jerk constraints which will make more trajectories to be feasible. However this will take significantly more time and since all my tests passed with only decreasing acceleration I am satisfied.
