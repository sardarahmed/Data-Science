Q:

Problem with log and home directories and roslaunch handlers

I'm having a problem robot_upstart.  When I start the service it uses a different value for ROS_LOG_DIR, it says that HOME is not defined, and also reports there are no handlers for roslaunch.  I've pasted a log below:
hal@arlobot:~/catkin_ws/src/ArloBot/src/arlobot_apps/arlobot_webif/www$ sudo tail /var/log/upstart/arlobot.log -f

A:

May be a bit late but I had a similar error my upstart was working then it gave the above errors
I put in a extra launch line to start COB face recognition when i remove the line robot upstart worked as before

Did you ever find a fix for this other than removing functionality. I am getting the same errors trying to start an openCV haar cascade filter on startup.
