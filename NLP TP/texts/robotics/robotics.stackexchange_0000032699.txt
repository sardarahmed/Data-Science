Q:

error installing openni_kinnect

I'm using ubunto 10.10 and trying to install the kinect drivers.
I got as far as
sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-openni-kinect
hg clone https://kforge.ros.org/openni/drivers
cd drivers
make
make install
but make install runs for a while then fails. Here are the last few linessudo cp -f ./openni/lib/.so /usr/lib/
sudo cp -f ./openni/lib/.xml /etc/primesense/
sudo cp -r ./openni/include/ni/* /usr/include/openni/
sudo cp -f ./openni/bin/ni* /usr/bin/
sudo /bin/bash ./CONTROL/openni_postinst
postinst called with unknown argument `'
make: *** [install_openni] Error 1
how do I fix it?
Thanks

A:

You only need to install either via packages or from source.
So if sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-openni-kinect ran without errors, its already done.
