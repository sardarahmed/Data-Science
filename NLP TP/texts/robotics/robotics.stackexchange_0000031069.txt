Q:

getting video from canon vc-c50i camera and sensoray framegrabber

I'm trying to get the video stream from a canon vc-c50i camera which connects to a sensoray 311 framegrabber on a MobileRobots Guiabot.  Have tried gscam with
GSCAM_CONFIG="v4l2src device=/dev/video0 ! ffmpegcolorspace ! video/x-raw-rgb ! identity name=ros"
but image is scrambled.  What should the pipeline be for this camera type?

A:

Try video/x-raw-yuv or put ffmpegcolorspace as the last parameter.
