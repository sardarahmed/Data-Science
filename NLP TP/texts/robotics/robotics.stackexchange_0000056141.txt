A:

Declare the lib:
#include <std_msgs/Float64MultiArray.h> //include the lib

use it:
std_msgs::Float64MultiArray Atest; //declare Atest
Atest.data.resize(5); //resize the array to assign to existent values
Atest.data[4] = 5; //put the desired value

This generates the error error: request for member 'resize' in 'Atest.std_msgs::Float64MultiArray::data', which is of non-class type 'std_msgs::Float64MultiArray::_data_type* {aka float*}'

It works but maybe not in your case, as explained here:
