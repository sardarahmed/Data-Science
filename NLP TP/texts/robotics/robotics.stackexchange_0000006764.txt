Q:

How do I get MPU 6050 gyroscope data using "MPU6050_6Axis_MotionApps20.h" library

I'm currently calibrating the MPU6050 chip using an arduino mega 2560. I am using the J Rowberg 12c dev libraries. I can get it to print raw accelerometer and gyroscpe values (very unstable, wildly changing values). In the digital motion processing chip library, I can get it to print euler angles, quaternions, real world acceleration and actual acceleration but there is no option to get gyroscope data. 
can I use the DMP library to get gyro data or is it only possible to get raw unprocessed gyro values?

A:

I went through the header files of the 12cdev lib and I figured it out.
you have to first add the line VectorInt16 gyro; to your motion variables, then you add the line
mpu.dmpGetGyro(&gyro, fifoBuffer);
to your outputs.
