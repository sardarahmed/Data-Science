Q:

how to install usb_cam on groovy

I tried installing the usb_cam driver by following the instruction from

wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/StackInstallation

but it seems the instructions is outdated for groovy and I am currently stuck
What is the current alternative to

rosmake --rosdep-install

Thanks

A:

If you're on Ubuntu and installed via apt, there is a ros-groovy-usb-cam package that you can install.
sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-usb-cam

You can also look at the uvc_camera package. It supports usb cameras.
