Q:

ROS2 launch FindPackageShare vs get_package_share_directory

I've noticed 2 possible ways to get the share directory of a package from within a launch.py file:
from ament_index_python.packages import get_package_share_directory

get_package_share_directory("package_a")

versus
from launch_ros.substitutions import FindPackageShare

FindPackageShare("package_a")

The former returns a string directly, the latter will be evaluated to a string when passed into a LaunchDescription somewhere.
Which one is recommended?

A:

Interesting - I suppose the launch_ros.substitutions is the preferred since somebody spent the time to implement it - and under the hood it actually just calls ament_index_python.packages.get_package_shared_directory (see https://github.com/ros2/launch_ros/pull/57/files#diff-a386f24e1ed85582db84abc87a5bf684R100)

That's what I found already as well, but no recommendation to use one or the other...
