Q:

ros code: expired license svn?

Hi,
I want to download the source code of a few packages to build with rosinstall on armhf, but when i try to register on code.ros.org it says the license is expired ? So how or where can I download the source code ?

A:

code.ros.org is inactive. Most code has been ported to other locations, e.g. github.
Check the package website in the ROS wiki. That should contain a link to the currently maintained code repository.
