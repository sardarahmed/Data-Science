Q:

How to reduce CPU usage

Hi,
Is normal to have a CPU usage of 85% when I am simulating the "empty.world" file?
And, if it is normal how can I reduce it?
I tried with the "update_rate" param but nothing changed
I have a:
Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Quad CPU    Q8300  @ 2.50GHz
ATi Radeon HD 4350
Thanks

It's not exactly an answer to your problem, but I can tell you that it's processor dependent. Using the same amount of RAM and same video card, my CPU usage dropped hugely when switching from a Xeon quad core to a CORE i5.  Everything became a lot smoother too.

A:

I unistalled the proprietary fglrx driver for ATI Radeon and now I have a CPU usage of 5-10%
