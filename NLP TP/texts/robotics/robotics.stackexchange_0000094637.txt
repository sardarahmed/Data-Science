Q:

Upgrade to ros-melodic from ros-kinetic

I want to upgrade to Ubuntu 18.04, so i'm planning to upgrade from Ubuntu 16.04. Since i know ros-kinetic is not supported on Ubuntu 18.04. So i'm ready to use ros-melodic. But the question is before upgrading to Ubuntu to 18.04 should i uninstall ros-kinetic first?

A:

I actually recently did this transition myself for my home machines.
If you attempt to go through the Ubuntu upgrade system to change to 18.04, you'll get about 80% done and it'll complain about some really esoteric things that couldn't be changed. I don't remember off hand. After a few hours of investigating, I figured it may be ROS because that's the only non-vanilla thing I have on my machine.
After uninstalling ROS, and attempting again, it worked fine. So yes, I would recommend fully uninstalling ROS Kinetic. After the upgrade, go through a fresh Melodic install.
