Q:

How to rewrite the frameid in a rosbag?

I  recorded a rosbag and tried to visualize it in Rviz. I get the following message MessageFilter [target=left_hand ]: Discarding message from [unknown_publisher] due to empty frame_id.  This message will only print once. On doing a rostopic echo, I can see that the frame_id is empty. I ran rosrun tf view_frames to generate the pdf.
How do I rewrite the header frame id?

A:

rosbag has a python API that you can use for reading and creating new bag files; have a look at the rosbag cookbook and the rosbag API
