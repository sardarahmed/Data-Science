Q:

roslaunch cannot find package

I have written a .launch file for a CAN bus reader, but roslaunch simple does not see it, and I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. It is especially disconcerting as every other node I've got works just fine.
package.xml:
<package>
  <name>canbus_read</name>
  <version>0.0.1</version>
  
  <description>Can_Bus_ROS_Reader</description>
  
  <maintainer email="bart.milne@pg.canterbury.ac.nz">Bart Milne</maintainer>
  <author>Bart Milne</author>

  <license>BSD</license>
   
  <url type="website"></url>

  <buildtool_depend>catkin</buildtool_depend>
  
  <build_depend>roscpp</build_depend>
  
  <run_depend>roscpp</run_depend>
  
</package>

Launch file:
<!-- %Tag(FULL)%-->
<launch>
    <node name="candump" type="candump" pkg="canbus_read" output="screen" args="any" />
</launch>
<!-- %EndTag(FULL)%-->

The program's name iscandump.

A:

The best way to go about troubleshooting this is to see if it works with rosrun or not. You can start by trying:
rosrun canbus_read candump

If that doesn't work, you probably have a problem with your CMakeLists or your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH; make sure you've sourced your devel workspace, and make sure you're calling catkin_package() in your CMakeLists.txt (even if you call it with no arguments).
If it works with rosrun but not from a launch file, we can look for a more subtle root cause; maybe start by locating the binary and try to figure out why rosrun finds it, but roslaunch doesn't.

Thanks, I will check that. I have a related question that includes the CMakeLists.txt. See http://answers.ros.org/question/171261/catkin_make-ignores-include_dirs-directive-in-catkin_generate_package/
