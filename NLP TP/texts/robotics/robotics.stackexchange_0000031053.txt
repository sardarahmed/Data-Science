Q:

Problem generating PCD from rgbdslam

I've currently been using a bag file approach to run rgbdslam. The procedure I use is as follows:
I record a bag file with rgbdslam using the command:

rosbag record /rgbdslam/batch_clouds /tf

And then I use the command:

rosrun pcl_ros bag_to_pcd <bag_file_name> /rgbdslam/batch_clouds <destination_directory>

However, the error I get when running the above command is as follows:

[ERROR] [######]: Frame id /base_link does not exist! When trying
to transform between /batch_transform and /base_link.

I assume this problem likely has to do with applying the correct transform from the /tf recorded in the bag file. Is there an simple solution to this, or will I need to make an edit to the bag_to_pcd code to work for this specific case?
Thanks

Yes, open bag_to_pcd.cpp and replace the one occurence of /base_link by /openni_camera
