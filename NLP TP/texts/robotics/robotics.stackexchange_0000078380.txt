Q:

How can I make my wiki page mutable again?

As I found the packaging process very confusing I wanted to add a new document explaining it bottom up. Now suddenly the page became immutable and I have no idea why. This is the link (early draft): http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/ReleasingAPackage
Thanks in advance for any help on that problem!

Afaict, the page is editable. I just saved a trivial change. Do you get an error saying otherwise?

Btw: section "4.3 - Update your package.xml" is definitely not optional. If you don't tag the repository and get your manifests to match the tags, things will not work.

Udpate: I appended a screenshot showing you what I a talking about - I can no longer edit the site and on the right panel "Immutable page" has appeared. Maybe it's just been blocked to me but I'd like to know if this persists..

The fact that your screenshot shows a "Login" link tells me you're currently not logged in. Could you login and try again?

Wow thanks, that's true. Interesting as I am logged in here so I assumed I would be there too. I am no longer used to systems killing my Cookies while I am editing stuff, this shouldn't happen..

A:

I think you are simply not logged in...

Good point, see the comment above. However I am not really content the way this is displayed - if I see immutable page I assume it actually is immutable. But okay, my fault in this case so whatever.
