Q:

What are the odometry msg type in ROS SLAM?

We are building a three wheel holonomic motion system. Is there a standard way to publish odometer values? How odometer values are present in gmapping package?

Could you link the stack/package you are looking at?

Is this what you're looking for?

Actually I'm looking for how to acquire odometer data from motor encoders. I need to know what exactly I have to publish from encoders.

A:

The odometry information should be published by the ROS driver for your mobile robot base. Usually, the robot sends encoder ticks via serial or whatever, and the ROS driver then computes the odometry message (i.e., pose and twist; see the link by @stevejp). The formula how to compute the ROS odometry message from encoder ticks depends on your kinematics.
Example 1: Generic differential drive platform

Example 2: PR2 robot (four-wheeled holonomic robot)
