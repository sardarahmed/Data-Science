Q:

Libpython2.7 build error, groovy

Hello all,
Having an issue building some code that worked well in fuerte. As far as I can tell, it has been modified correctly. The compilation error comes from an inability to find libpython2.7.so.
Anyone else have this problem (and perhaps a solution)?

A:

Ok. Fixed it.
Do this:
sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython2.7.so.1 /usr/lib/libpython2.7.so

Note: I am running Ubuntu 13.04. This might not be an issue on previous version of Ubuntu. This fix did work, and the program runs. I am using Groovy.
