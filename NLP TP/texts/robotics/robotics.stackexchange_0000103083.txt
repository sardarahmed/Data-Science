Q:

"xacro: in-order processing became default in ROS Melodic. You can drop the option" error

https://github.com/EuropeanRoverChallenge/ERC-Remote-Maintenance-Sim
Using the link I wrote all commands which is given in "Install on the host system" section.
When I try this command:
$ roslaunch ur3_sim simulation.launch

It gives error like this:
    ... logging to /home/ubuntu4/.ros/log/f2319ee2-b808-11ed-bb34-1be4f5885cab/roslaunch-ubuntu4-6223.log

A:

The --inorder warning message in the title to this question is not the actual problem here.
The error "No such file" indicates that your UR3_sim/ur3_sim_description/urdf/ur3_sim.urdf.xacro file is not compatible with the newest universal_robot ros package. You need to fix the file paths inside that file.
