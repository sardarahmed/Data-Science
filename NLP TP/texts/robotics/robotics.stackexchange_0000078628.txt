Q:

roslaunch error , rplidar

From this part, I have several error.
When I input this,
 $ roslaunch rplidar_ros rplidar.launch

it shows
[rplidar.launch] is neither a launch file in package [rplidar_ros] nor is [rplidar_ros] a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

However, if I input
ubuntu@ubuntu:~/catkin_ws$ source /home/ubuntu/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
ubuntu@ubuntu:~/catkin_ws$ roslaunch rplidar_ros rplidar.launch
... logging to /home/ubuntu/.ros/log/687ff54e-e312-11e6-a5f7-0022cffa2d4b/roslaunch-ubuntu-7014.log

A:

 $ roslaunch rplidar_ros rplidar.launch

it shows

[rplidar.launch] is neither a launch file in package [rplidar_ros] nor is [rplidar_ros] a launch file name

The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

This is completely expected: you appear to not have sourced the correct setup.bash file from the workspace that contains the rpilidar_ros package. Without the information from the setup.bash, ROS cannot find that package, hence the error message.
And I'm slightly confused, as you seem to know that already, seeing as you source /home/ubuntu/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash two lines later.

However, if I input

ubuntu@ubuntu:~/catkin_ws$ source /home/ubuntu/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
ubuntu@ubuntu:~/catkin_ws$ roslaunch rplidar_ros rplidar.launch

... logging to /home/ubuntu/.ros/log/687ff54e-e312-11e6-a5f7-0022cffa2d4b/roslaunch-ubuntu-7014.log

This looks like a problem with the serial port that you are telling rpilidar_ros to use.
Are you sure that you have a ttyUSB0, and that the lidar is connected to that port? Have you also made sure your user ubuntu has read and write access to the serial port?

Thank you for your comment.

Do you have the rpilidar working now?
Comment by sophie.shin on 2017-01-29:
Thank you for your reply.
I remove all and re-install and follow the installation guide step by step again.
There are various version regarding the USB port setting on the web post..
Finally I followed below,
$ ls /dev/ttyUSB*/
$ sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0

Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-01-29:
The sudo chmod 666 .. will not be permanent. I'd advise you to look into udev rules.
Comment by razgrin on 2017-03-29:
hey gvdhoorn, I have the same issue here, and I wanted to know what the permanent fix would be? (I'm really new at this, so I'm still trying to learn all the basic terminology, please go easy on me)
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-03-30:
As I wrote in my earlier comment: look into creating some suitable udev rules. Search for ros udev and you'll probably find some examples.
