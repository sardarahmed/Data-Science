Q:

How do you create a cpp file to make different nodes work together? e.g. a robot to follow people around

I am currently using the kinect_tracker  and p2os_driver base,but i cant seem to make it work with the current cpp that my fren left me with

A:

I assume by "make different nodes work together" you mean "how to make nodes to communicate with each other".
Please see the answer for this question in ROS tutorials, particularly Understanding ROS Nodes, Understanding ROS Topics and Writing a Simple Publisher and Subscriber (C++).
