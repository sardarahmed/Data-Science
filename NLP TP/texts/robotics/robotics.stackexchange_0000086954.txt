Q:

Kinetic kame on ubuntu 16.04 LTS

Hi, guys.
I'm a newbie in the ROS world and i have to install it.
Following this guideline: http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu.
when i reach the point 1.6 and i execute this:
echo "source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc source ~/.bashrc
i get this "error":
bash: source/opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash: No such file or directory
Any advice to fix this problem?
Thanks in advance
P.S. i'm also newbie on Linux, so i have to learn quickly a lot of stuff

Did you run that all in one command? Because those are at least two separate commands: one starting with echo and the other with source.

A:

Nope, i run them separately...anyway i redo the ubuntu installation and then the ROS installation all works fine.
In any case thanks a lot for the feedback! :)
only one more question: is there a link(website) where i can learn, maybe through a tutorial, the main features of turtlesim?

re: turtlesim: that would probably be wiki/turtlesim/Tutorials.
