Q:

people detection error

Hi, all
Regarding people detection(ppl_detection), I have an error. When I run the code below
$ rosrun ppl_detection kinect_detect
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named kinect_detect below home/jkim/ros_workspace/ppl_detection
I followed the procedure introduced in the website. I modified launch/kinect.launch, then
typed
$ roslaunch ppl_detection kinect.launch
I seemed to work showing rviz screen, but when I put this command
$ rosrun ppl_detection kinect_detect
error occurs. please help.
Thank you
Jong

I tried that but It does'n work. It shows an error massage like "[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named kinect_detect below home/jkim/ros_workspace/ppl_detection" when I command "rosrun ppl_detection kinect_detect" What should I do ?

did you did a rosmake ppl_detection to compile the code you downloaded?
