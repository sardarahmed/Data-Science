Q:

Dynamic information flow between ROSJAVA nodes and ROSActivity

Hi All,
When using ROSJAVA with android I'd like to pass information from the ROSActivity gui to the ros_node implementing nodeMain. Is there a way to do this without using the normal ROS message traffic?
If there is, how is it done?
cheers
Peter

A:

There's a lot of options here. You're basically asking how to write a multi-threaded Activity. This tutorial seems to cover a lot of the various concepts:

I looked at the handlers type of processing but in the tutorial, it mentioned that it must be run in the same scope as the main activity. I attribute my failure to the fact that I'm trying to update a handler inside my class and therefore out of scope. What method do you recommend?
