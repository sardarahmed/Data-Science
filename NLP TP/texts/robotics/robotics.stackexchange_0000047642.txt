Q:

PCL point_types.h #pragma warning

I am getting the following warning when attempting to compile a program that includes point_types.h
/opt/ros/groovy/include/pcl-1.6/pcl/point_types.h:56:0: warning: ignoring #pragma warning  [-Wunknown-pragmas]

The warning does not interfere with the build. However, so many of my files include point_types.h, that the build log gets polluted by multiple warnings. Is there any way to turn them off?
I'm using Ubuntu 12.10 and ros-groovy freshly installed from binaries.
Thanks.

A:

I believe this is taken care of in later releases of pcl. For anyone who wants to suppress the warnings while compiling against pcl-1.6, this should do the trick:
rosbuild_add_compile_flags([name-of-target] '-Wno-unknown-pragmas')
