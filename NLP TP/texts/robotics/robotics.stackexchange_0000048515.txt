Q:

command line arguments in launch file

Hi,
I am using pcd_to_pointcloud from perception_pcl and want to remap the output using a launch file.
The problem is that it requires a pcd file as a command line argument which I do not get to work using a launch file. Is there an easy way or should I issue a pull request for a modified node which can also read a pcd file path from a parameter.
Kai

A:

Did you try it? This shouldn't be a problem in general. Pass the .pcd as args in the <node> tag and do the remapping within a <remap> tag in the <node>.
If it doesn't work, something is wrong. The ROS args should be consumed by ros::init and leave the .pcd as a param.

I did try it out, but it did not work. I just tried again and it worked. It turns out I did not specify the full path for the pcd file. Thanks a lot
