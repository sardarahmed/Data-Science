Q:

OpenCR Board Can't Publish, Can Subscribe (WSL)

Hello,
Lately I've been trying to follow the tutorials at the robotis manual to learn about ROS and Turtlebot3. I have a Turtlebot3 Burger.
My setup

Using ROS Melodic
PC OS: WSL Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic
Tb3: Raspberry Pi 3 Ubuntu 18.04 Server Bionic
OpenCR 1.0 firmware: v1.2.3
... Let me know to add any other relevant info.

Question
While trying to get SLAM to work, I was experiencing a common issue of no transform from odom to base_footprint. Upon more investigation, I found that I couldn't see any odom data through rostopic echo odom and rostopic hz odom showed that there were never any messages.
However, I know that I can command the turtlebot using keyboard teleop. I just can't receive any messages that are sent "from" the OpenCR board. Why is this?
I have explored the idea of this being a time-sync issue. I have checked to make sure my ROS_MASTER_URI and ROS_HOSTNAME are correct on all machines.
Any help is much appreciated. Thank you.
--EDIT 0: This doesn't seem like a cross-computer issue to me, but rather something with rosserial that is causing topics to not have messages published.--
EDIT 1: actually, it is a cross-machine issue!
EDIT 2: When I use ROS_IP instead of ROS_HOSTNAME and set ROS_MASTER_URI to be http://ip of pc:11311 I don't see any data on the topics from the OpenCR; when I run everything on the RPi, I do see data.
EDIT 3: I am able to publish from RPi to PC and vice versa, but nothing comes from the rosserial_python node.

A:

I have figured out my answer: issues were due to my use of WSL.
