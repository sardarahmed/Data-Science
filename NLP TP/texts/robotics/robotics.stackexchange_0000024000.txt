Q:

How do you automate fixing formatting errors found by ament_cpplint?

I'm working on a PR for rclcpp, and when I run the tests, I get formatting errors about white space from cpplint. Is there any automated way to fix these? Here is an example:
- rclcpp.cpplint whitespace/comments [2] (/home/tyler/code/ws_ros2/src/rclcpp/rclcpp/include/rclcpp/subscription_options.hpp:188)
  <<< failure message
    At least two spaces is best between code and comments
  >>>

A:

Recently, I've had some success running ament_uncrustify --reformat for fixing issues found by ament_cpplint, since these tools (largely) agree.
Not the answer I like, but ament_cpplint has no similar option unfortunately.
