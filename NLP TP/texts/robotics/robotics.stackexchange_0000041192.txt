Q:

How to tell which version of a package was tagged for a particular release?

Hi, I'm trying to determine which version of joystick_drivers was tagged for electric. I could brush up on my svn foo and sniff around the repository, but I figure there must be a list somewhere which I haven't been able to find. Bonus points if you can then point me to the tarball for that release.

A:

For each stack on the wiki they have a subpage Releases which lists the released versions.  For example see the geometry/Releases page.  This is linked to in the stack header.

According to http://www.ros.org/wiki/joystick_drivers/Releases, the corresponding SVN tag is https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/joystick_drivers/tags/electric/

If you really want the tarball, it is here: https://code.ros.org/svn/release/download/stacks/joystick_drivers/joystick_drivers-1.6.4/joystick_drivers-1.6.4.tar.bz2
