Q:

Messagefilter dropped 100% of messages

When launching the navigation stack (gmapping and movebase) I will frequently receive the following message:
[ WARN] [1477990695.164889638]: MessageFilter [target=odom ]: Dropped 100.00% of messages so far. Please turn the [ros.costmap_2d.message_notifier] rosconsole logger to DEBUG for more information.
[ WARN] [1477990695.175311684]: MessageFilter [target=map ]: Dropped 100.00% of messages so far. Please turn the [ros.costmap_2d.message_notifier] rosconsole logger to DEBUG for more information. 

When looking at my tf tree i see the following information.

I will update this post with rosconsole logger to debug information soon.
The following message is given:
[DEBUG] [1299740216.768663556, 1299651571.155978846]: MessageFilter [target=/odom ]: Removed oldest message because buffer is full, count now 5 (frame_id=camera_depth_frame, stamp=1299651570.618031)

[DEBUG] [1299740216.768820286, 1299651571.155978846]: MessageFilter [target=/odom ]: Added message in frame laser at time 1299651571.154, count now 5

A:

The problem can be found in the debug.
It is in frame_id=camera_depth_frame. I came to this conclusion thanks to this post: gmapping-works-in-gazebo-but-not-on-robot
When running

rosrun tf static_transform_publisher 0 0 0 0 0 0 base_link camera_depth_frame 100

my problems were solved.
