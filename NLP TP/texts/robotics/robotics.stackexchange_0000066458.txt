Q:

error: expected class-name before ‘{’ token

Hi there !
I try to compile a package that I found in the internet but I still get this error:
  In file included from /home/ros/rosbuildstaubli/staubli3/src/controller.cpp:14:0:
  /home/ros/rosbuildstaubli/staubli3/include/command.h: At global scope:
  /home/ros/rosbuildstaubli/staubli3/include/command.h:24:1: error: expected class-name before ‘{’ token
  /home/ros/rosbuildstaubli/staubli3/include/command.h:205:1: error: expected class-name before ‘{’ token
  /home/ros/rosbuildstaubli/staubli3/include/command.h: In constructor ‘staubli::command::Request::Request()’:
  /home/ros/rosbuildstaubli/staubli3/include/command.h:57:27: error: expected class-name before ‘(’ token
  /home/ros/rosbuildstaubli/staubli3/include/command.h:57:27: error: expected ‘{’ before ‘(’ token

The class Request heritate from ros::Message and this is what cause the errors, each time I use:

class Request : public ros::Message

This is the headers that I have in each those two files
commande.h:
 #include <string>
 #include <cstring>
 #include <vector>
 #include <map>
 #include "ros/message.h"
 #include "ros/time.h"

controller.cpp:
 #include "TX60L.h"
 #include <iostream>
 #include <algorithm>
 #include <ros/ros.h>
 #include <std_msgs/String.h>
 #include <sstream>
 #include "command.h"       //command service of staubli
 #include "controller.h"

I'm using ros-Hydro ubuntu 12.04

A:

The ros::Message class appears to be deprecated and has been removed. From a quick look through the version history, it looks like it was removed some time before the Fuerte release.

It's usually a good idea to include your ROS distro in your questions. I checked the version history as far back as I was able to (Fuerte), and didn't find a version where the Message class was available.
