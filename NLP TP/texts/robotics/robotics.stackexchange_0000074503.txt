Q:

converting between costmap_2d::Costmap2D and nav_msgs::OccupancyGrid

Is there an established or convenient way to convert between these two? I don't see any methods that suggest this is possible.
The manual approach of course is to create a message and populate it by iterating over all the cells in  the Costmap2D, but this seems like something that might already exist.

A:

That functionality seems to be part of costmap_2d_publisher See Costmap2DPublisher::prepareGrid()
But I don't know of a more general-purpose function either.

+1 for finding the function that does it. This seems like something that should be added as a method to Costmap2D
