Q:

Cylinder parameters: elements or attributes

In the cylinder SDF specification, the radius and length of a cylinder are children elements, as the example in that website shows:
<cylinder>
    <radius>1</radius>
    <length>1.2</length>
 </cylinder>

However, in Gazebo5 this throws the error:
[ERROR] [1457697849.467197389]: Cylinder shape must have both length and radius attributes
Therefore, it looks like Gazebo 5 requires those values as attributes:
<geometry>
    <cylinder length="1.2" radius="1"/>
</geometry>

And this works OK. Which one is correct? Is it a Gazebo bug?

A:

This error doesn't seem to be coming from Gazebo, Gazebo's errors start with [Err].
Are you sure you're not using URDF instead of SDF? In URDF, radius and length would be attributes.

Oops you are right! I am using URDF.
