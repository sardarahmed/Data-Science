Q:

dc maxon motor control

hello
I am a new user in ROS and i want to build my robot. I have two DC maxon motors with 150 w power and two arduino uno boards. Is it possible for me to control my base with ros_arduino_python package??
I think i need some extra controller like Pololu but i am not sure. Does anyone do this before???
I really appreciate anyone who could help me:))

A:

Yes. As noted on the ros_arduino_bridge wiki page, you need the recommended Pololu motor shield and the encoder shield.
The README for Hydro goes into more detail about the hardware and wiring that is required.
