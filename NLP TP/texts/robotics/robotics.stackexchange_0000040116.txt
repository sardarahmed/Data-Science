Q:

Publishing from Workstation but can't echo from turtlebot

Hello,
After following the Turtlebot networking setup and verifying that both the workstation and the turtlebot laptop are connected via rostopic list I've run into a problem:
On the workstation I run:
rostopic pub -r10 /hello std_msgs/String "hello"
On the turtlebot laptop I run:
rostopic echo /hello
However, nothing prints on the turtlebot laptop. What's even more baffling is that when I run rostopic list on turtlebot I can see /hello listed.
Any help is much appreciated

A:

Please review the Network Setup wiki page.  It sounds like you have not set your ROS_HOSTNAME on the workstation correctly to allow the robot to be able to reach the workstation.
