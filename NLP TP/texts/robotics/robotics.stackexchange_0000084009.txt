Q:

rosbag record error

I am getting the following error when trying to record a bag file about image transport. I thought if the system could send a msg using ros then it should be able to record it and play ?

These look like log messages from several different nodes. Are you running rosbag record from a launch file?

yes...from a launch file...If i take out the rosbag record then I do not get the transport errors.I am running flame_ros.
 <node pkg="rosbag" type="record" name="flame_bagger"  output="screen"  args=" -a -o flameBag"/>

A:

I suspect these errors are actually coming from your image publisher, probably because rosbag is trying to subscribe to a compressed topic that the publisher can't actually publish.
You should be able to confirm this by running your image publisher and rosbag in separate terminals.
Once you've confirmed that this is a problem, I suggest that you adjust the options to rosbag record to limit which topics are recorded; this will both prevent these errors and potentially reduce the size of your recorded bag file.
