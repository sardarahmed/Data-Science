Hello,  sounds a funny idea.
You can use the app_manager to start/stop/lists apps in the robot. Assuming you launched turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch, you can list the available apps with:
rosservice call /turtlebot/list_apps | grep -v data

(the grep is to avoid get spammed with icons binary data)
To start/stop follower:
rosservice call /turtlebot/start_app "name: 'turtlebot_core_apps/follower'"
rosservice call /turtlebot/stop_app "name: 'turtlebot_core_apps/follower'"

Note that start the app takes some time, as it launches opennni driver and some other stuff. Once started, following behavior can be activated/deactivated with:
rosservice call /turtlebot_follower/change_state "state: 1"
rosservice call /turtlebot_follower/change_state "state: 0"

This is much faster and less error prone that start/stop the app. Btw, you can also call services with the service client API.

Yep, in your voice recognition system you can call the above mentioned services. I'm not familiar with Sphinx, but I suppose you have some kind of callbacks in your program when it recognizes a command.
