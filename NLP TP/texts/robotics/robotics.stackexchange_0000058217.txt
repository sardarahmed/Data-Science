Q:

Ground filter package for tilt laser that works under Hydro?

Hello All,
I am using the laser_assembler package to generate a point cloud from the scans of a tilting Hokuyo laser scanner. However, I am struggeling to find an existing ROS package to filter out the reflections of the ground plane that is available/compiles under ROS Hydro on Ubuntu 13.04.
I am aware that there are several established means of accomplishing this task. Unfortunately, none of the ones I came across seems to work under Hydro. This is what I have been looking at:
laser_filters is available on Hydro, but does not come with a ground filter plugin by default. Does anyone know of a ground filter plugin that works on Hydro?
The latest version of pr2_navigation_perception is for Groovy only and has not been migrated to Hydro. It uses the semantic_point_annotator, the launch file is ground_plane.xml. So far, I have  successfully catkinized it but failed to compile it due to pcl header issues
ua-ros-pkg is also outdated (rosbuild/Groovy). I catkinzed it, but also no luck after several hours of trying to get it compile on hydro.
Another related post can be found here.
As this is such a common task, I am reaching out to the community hoping that there is a solution out there.
Thanks!

A:

If you can't find an existing package, you could write a quick node that uses the PCL passthrough filter (http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/passthrough.php). You would first transform the pointcloud into a frame like base_link or base_footprint, and then cut out anything with a z < 0.
