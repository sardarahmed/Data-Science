Q:

Simple problem with TwistStamped msg

hi Ros users:
I am trying to do an array of velocities. This is my code:
  geometry_msgs::Twist cmd;
  geometry_msgs::TwistStamped tiempo;
  cmd.linear.x = 1; 
  cmd.linear.y = 0;
  cmd.linear.z = 0;
  
  tiempo.header.stamp=5;
  cmd.angular.x = 0;
  cmd.angular.y = 0;
  cmd.angular.z = 4;
  vel_pub_.publish(cmd);

But when it is compiled i can see these errors on terminal

/home/alcor/catkin_ws/src/lanzar_velocidades/src/arrayvel.cpp:52:3:
error: ‘geometry’ has not been
declared    geometry::TwistStamped
tiempo;    ^
/home/alcor/catkin_ws/src/lanzar_velocidades/src/arrayvel.cpp:52:26:
error: expected ‘;’ before ‘tiempo’
geometry::TwistStamped tiempo;
^ /home/alcor/catkin_ws/src/lanzar_velocidades/src/arrayvel.cpp:57:3:
error: ‘tiempo’ was not declared in
this scope    tiempo.header.stamp=5;
^ make[2]: ***
[lanzar_velocidades/CMakeFiles/arrayvel_node.dir/src/arrayvel.cpp.o]
Error 1 make[1]: ***
[lanzar_velocidades/CMakeFiles/arrayvel_node.dir/all]
Error 2

Any ideas?
Thanks!

A:

stamp must be a ros::Time object. Also 5 seems quite arbitrary and is probably not gonna do what you want it to do.
