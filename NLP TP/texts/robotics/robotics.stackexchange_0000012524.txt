Q:

Calculating the singular configuration of a 3 revolute joint manipulator

I would really appreciate it if somebody could help me calculate the singular configuration of this simple manipulator
I am confused since J is a 2x3 matrix and I cannot simply calculate the derivative.
Thanks in advance.

A:

If $J$ is not square, solve $$|J^TJ| = 0$$ for $\theta_i$.
