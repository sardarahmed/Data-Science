Q:

getting a C++ Programm run under ROS

hi Im trying to write a RTSP Client for ROS and found live555.com site and there openRTSP / testRTSPClient wich are command line tools that already do what i want. So i thought should not be to hard get that running in ROS. So I created a new package and ctrl+C/V the main file in the src folder and the rest in the Include folder
when i try to Compile it now it does not find all the headers. and im dont know how to tell ROS where it should look for all the .hh files.
I tryed adding them in the Cmakelist.txt file with add_subdirectory and include_directories bot it did not work.
So my next try was to move all .cpp and .hh files from all folders/subfolders into the src folder and now I get "undefined reference to" errors for all funktions
I started with ROS a week ago so maybe its some basic thing i missed in the tutorials.
would be nice if someone could help me
EDIT:
that testRTSP .cpp is a Command line tool wich depends on some librarys and allows me to access an rtps- stream. so my plan was to send that stream over a image pipeline to openCV. but i have no idea what i need to change to compile that code with rosmake.
So i have my src/maintest.cpp file wich includes livemedia.hh
livemedia.hh is located at ../livemedia/include/livemedia.hh
livemedia itself creates a liblivemedia.a file when compiled.
So do i have to make a livemedia ros package first so it creates a libary? when yes how do i create a library.

You need to be more explicit about what exactly you did and what exactly your errors are as a result of every step.

A:

Create a Package:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage

go in the CMakeLists.txt and add following line:
rosbuild_add_executable (example src/example.cpp)
target_link_libraries(example ${PCL_LIBRARIES})

PCL is only an example Library.
Make sure that your cpp file is placed in src/..
The last step is only to call rosmake [pkg-name]
