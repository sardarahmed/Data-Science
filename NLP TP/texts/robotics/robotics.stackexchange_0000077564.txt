Q:

use rtabmap/grid_map for move_base

I can not get move_base to work with the rtabmap grid_map.
I used this link to try and get some direction http://wiki.ros.org/rtabmap_ros/Tutorials/StereoOutdoorNavigation and changed the openni_points to my laserscan but whenever i send a command the robot will just start to rotate (recovery behaviour?) in place.
I am using an roomba 780 as vehicle with an Kinect mounted on top of it for navigation and 3D mapping.
Even when using the Pointcloud2 variable it will instantly go into recovery mode.d

A:

I suggest to read the navigation stack tutorial for more ducumentation on move_base's parameters used: http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup
openni_points is a PointCloud2 data_type, if you want to use a laser scan, it should be LaserScan data_type. See tutorial above.
Your setup is also similar to Turtlebot, you may look at this tutorial as well: http://wiki.ros.org/rtabmap_ros/Tutorials/MappingAndNavigationOnTurtlebot
cheers

Hi matlabbe when using the second link i keep getting problems, my move_base_node won't react to goals anymore also my local costmap still shows an empty map for some reason
Comment by matlabbe on 2016-12-13:
The local costmap is independent of rtabmap, there should be an error with parameters namespace. What are your launch files and move_base yaml files?
