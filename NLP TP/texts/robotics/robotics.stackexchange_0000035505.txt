Q:

Placing the kinect in another place at turtlebot

Hi,
I'm building a robot based on the software of turtlebot, but i need to place the kinect sensor in another place. But the original source code specifies the kinect in another place, so I believe I would get wrong data. So, which files have I need to modify to fix this problem?
Thanks in advance,
Lucas

A:

You will need to update the URDF to reflect the new Kinect placement. Also, if the Kinect is not level as in the current turtlebot, navigation and calibration probably won't work.

I think that must be a way to make the things work properly because i've seen a lot of modifications of turtlebot on the internet that uses the kinect in another places at the robot. I will try to update the URDF like you said and i will post my results. Thanks for the help.
