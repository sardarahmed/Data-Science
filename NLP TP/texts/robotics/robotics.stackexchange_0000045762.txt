Q:

Moving Ros folder

I would like to change the ROS folder location.
The current directory is: root/opt/ros
but if I just move it (cut, paste), ROS it doesn't work
How can I move it to my desktop?

Why would you like it to be placed on your desktop?

A:

Usually you would keep the system folder for ROS there and add another folder to your $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environment variable. I usually like to use ~/ros for my packages or packages I downloaded from other people's repositories.
