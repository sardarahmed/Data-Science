Q:

how to install eclipse in GROOVY

HI, everyone, I want to install eclipse in GROOVY(following the tutorial:http: // www. ros. org /wiki/IDEs) ,however, In the 2rd step-make eclipse-project, I always get error like:make: *** No rule to make target `eclipse-project'.  Stop., I'm sure that I had set my path to the target package, so I have no idea what to do now.

A:

Since groovy, with catkin workspaces, you need to call the standard cmake way of building eclipse projects.
I have added an alias in my .bashrc that says the following :
alias catkin_eclipse='catkin_make --force-cmake -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles"'

But if you don't like aliases, you can just call :
catkin_make --force-cmake -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles"

@Hansg91,I tried to added an alias in my .bashrc, but it seems no use, and when I use catkin_make --force-cmake -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" in the terminal like catkin_make --force-cmake -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles", I just got The specified source space "/home/tishiba/src" does not exist

Are you using a catkin workspace? Then this should work in your root folder of that workspace. If you are using a row workspace then make eclipse-project should still work I believe.
