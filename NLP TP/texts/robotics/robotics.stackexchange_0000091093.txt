Q:

how to view ros package code?

I want to read code for some packages which come with ROS full desktop installation, like robot_state_publisher or turtlesim_node for example. However when I do roscd to reach the directory, I can't find the actual python scripts or cpp files.
How to view the code for these ROS packages? Please help.
I'm using ROS Kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04.

It depends on exactly which package you're referring to, but many ROS packages are found on GitHub. Have you tried searching there?

A:

Turns out there's a very simple solution.
Just go to the wiki page of that package and clone it to your catkin workspace and build it.

Please note that this is a duplicate of at least #q214020, #q295677, #q214020 and many more.
@parzival: could you please try to use the search (or Google: source of package site:answers.ros.org) in the future?
