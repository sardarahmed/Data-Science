Q:

Does anyone know how to install ROS without a graphics card?

I need everything except graphics dependent packages. How do I install ROS this way? More than just the bare bones but without graphics?

A:

You can install individual ros stacks (or by package in new style groovy or later).  They will pull in all their required dependencies if you use apt to install them.
Also even if you don't have a graphics card you can still usually install the graphics libraries.  They just won't be very useful, and will require a little more disk space.
