Q:

Is there a more advanced keyboard teleop controller for pr2

There is a keyboard teleoperation program in pr2_teleop package. But it only provides very basic movement on the base. I am writing a more advanced keyboard controller, just like the Joystick teleoperation controller did, but I was wondering if there is already some similar keyboard controller there to save my work~
Anyone knows this? Thank you

A:

There is a more advanced teleop package for the PR2 called pr2_teleop_general. That allows you to control the arms, head and base.
