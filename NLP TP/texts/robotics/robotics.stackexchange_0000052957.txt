Q:

Can't create a package

I have a problem with creating a package with roscreate-pkg. At the beginning I was create a package without any error messages. Now I get something like this while attempting to create a package:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/opt/ros/fuerte/bin/roscreate-pkg", line 34, in 
import roscreate
File "/opt/ros/fuerte/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/roscreate/init.py", line 36, in 
import roscreate.core
File "/opt/ros/fuerte/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/roscreate/core.py", line 40, in 
import pkg_resources
ImportError: No module named pkg_resources
I have python-setuptools which should have the pkg_resources but somehow it is unable to find it.
I'm using ros-fuerte installed from package.

I also have this problem now. Don't know why. I first could create packages but now I can't anymore.

I was able to solve the problem and I've forgotten to put the solution here. Now I'm doing this.
For me procedure below helped:

A:

Because of comment formatting, the commands are here:
sudo apt-get install curl
curl -O http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py
sudo python distribute_setup.py
sudo easy_install pip
