Q:

Parallax Gyro work on Turtlebot 1?

Hi,
I've built my own Turtlebot using the iRobot create and xBox Kinect. I have the latest ROS installed and running. I picked up a Parallax Gyroscope Module 3-Axis L3G4200D: (www.parallax.com/product/27911) from my local RadioShack and wanted to know if it will work with the ROS software. I found this post: Is an IMU required to run Turtlebot stack?: (//answers.ros.org/question/9749/is-an-imu-required-to-run-turtlebot-stack/?answer=14244#post-id-14244) and was wondering if it would connect to the create the same way.
I've been building this to learn programming/robotics and pretty good at following directions. But don't have the knowledge to start from scratch yet. I want to think everyone that shares their projects and code. It really helps us newcomers getting started.
1/9/14 UPDATE: Would this be the correct connections for this gyro if ROS supports it?

A:

One the Turtlebot1, the original gyro was attached to one of the analog input pins on the Create.
To determine if your gyro is compatible, you'll need to check a few things:

Does it use the same power supply voltage as the original gyro? (5V)
Does it have an analog output pin?
Does the analog output have the same magnitude as the original gryo? The original gyro specifies 12.5 mV/degree/sec

If you find a compatible gyro, make sure that the axis that you hook up to the Turtlebot's analog input pin is the vertical axis.
EDIT:
The gyro you've picked out is a digital gyro, and won't be compatible with the Turtlebot1.

ahendrix, thanks for the reply. I misunderstood the description of this gyro. I thought that it could be wired as a digital or analog ( three or four ) wire setup. I'll look for an analog gyro. Thanks again for your time.
