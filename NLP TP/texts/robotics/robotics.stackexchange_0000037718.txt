Q:

Best way to install from a stand-alone network

I've been having issues installing electric on systems that are deployed to a network that does not have any internet access. I've had limited success using rosinstall on a system that does have internet access to checkout the full install, installing rosinstall on the machines behind the network and then coming up with a custom rosinstall file pointing to both the ros and stacks directories.
However this build does not always work. Just wondering if there's an easy way that given I have all the source code, how do I build the ros core system manually? I managed to get the environment variables setup and build rospack, but couldn't proceed from there.

Which Linux distribution are you using?

A:

If you're on Ubuntu and you only need released packages you can pull all the debian packages needed onto a single CD and install them using apt-cdrom. Or if you can transport a computer between the internal and external networks you can setup an apt-mirror as @Mac suggests.
