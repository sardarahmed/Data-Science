Q:

Install ROS on Windows

Dear all,
I am trying to install ROS on windows from the "http://wiki.ros.org/win_ros/groovy/Msvc%20Compiled%20SDK".
I have installed all the dependencies as stated in this link, but still not able to write command "winros_init_workspace"....it shows that "winros_init_workspace" is not recognised as an internal or external command.
I know that ROS is not fully compatible with windows, but i just wanted to create one subscriber to get values only.
Please help to sove this, I am thanking you all in advance.
