A:

I got the answer from another robotics site.
It says:
  I started the Heaphy project at Willow Garage with the goal of spinning it out as a commercial enterprise. At no stage was it open source. I left Willow at the end of March, however. As far as I know, nothing has been done with it since then.
  
  You might be able to email info@willowgarage.com to get more information on its current status.
  
  Cheers,
  Tim
