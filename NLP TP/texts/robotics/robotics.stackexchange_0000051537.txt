Q:

ROS package wxpropgrid

Does anybody has an idea of how to install the package  wxpropgrid in groovy or if I need to treat it as an external library. And, how to manipulate the manifest and CmakeLists.txt files in case it must be treated as an external library.

A:

The ROS wrapped version of wxpropgrid seems to have been last released in Electric.
You will need to treat it as a system dependency.  And add a rosdep dependency to your manifest.  And make sure there's a rosdep definition for it.

Hi, in advance thank you for your answer. However, would you mind giving me a more precise example of the things you are suggesting to do. I mean, How can I treat it as a system dependency, how do I add  rosdep dependency in the manifest and how can I be sure there is a rosdep. In advance, thank you
