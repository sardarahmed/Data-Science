Q:

How to update the ros driver for the Velodyne VLP-16

Hey,
I am very new to the ROS and 3D LIDAR and today I got the Velodyne VLP-16 LIDAR from our group, somehow I can not let it working properly. Here is some detail description of my problem:
I am using ROS indigo. First we I did is to use the sample data in the flash drive and uses some ROS command (http://www.pcl-users.org/Convert-pcap-to-pcd-Velodyne-HDL32E-td4034165.html) to convert the data from .pcap to .pcd format in order to run some PCL functions. The sample data was from HDL32E LIDAR and I had no problem of this part since the velodyne_pointcloud folder has the 32e_points.launch file.
Next step, I saved a .pcap file from the VLP-16 LIDAR and wanted to repeat the same procedure. Somehow this time I could not make it working since there is no VLP16_points.launch file in the velodyne_pointcloud folder!!! Then I searched online and from Github I saw the newest folder of the Velodyne driver do include the VLP16_points.launch, so I wonder what procedure should I do to upgrade the Velodyne related files to the newest version?
Since I am really new to this area so all suggestions will be highly appreciated!

A:

There has not been an Indigo release of the Velodyne packages in over a year: https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/59
To get the newer features (VLP-16 support) you will have to compile from source. Clone the velodyne repository into your workspace. Then build your workspace with catkin_make.

That is correct. We are working on a new Indigo release that will include VLP-16 support and some other items, but it's not quite ready to go yet. Soon, I hope.

I am using one from github but am curious what kind of issues in the git repo, if any, prevent it from being released.
Comment by joq on 2016-03-02:
Insufficient testing and documentation, and not enough time in my schedule. If you wish to help with the first two, please let me know.

I can help with that, I am using velodyne 32 and two devices of velodyne 16.

That would be great. The code is nearly ready at this point, but the docs need a good review to bring everything up to date.
