Q:

actions: c++ server, python client (smach)

Hello,
Can I implement an action server in C++ and call it from a client in python (i.e. from a Smach script)? As far as I understand the ROS architecture, so long as they share the same .action file, this should work, no?
Thanks.

A:

Yes. If both client libraries have support for actions and have access to the same action definition, it should work.
Python and C++ are both well used and supported.

Hi; What about vice versa? As I have not completely understood it, would you please give me more details and example?
Comment by arennuit on 2015-08-17:
Vice versa will work as nicely. There is nothing special to do, just to implement a action server in a language and the client in another language. So long as the cores are ROS compatible, it will work (because the messages use the same ROS protocol).

There is a reference tutorial here which already explains it all.
