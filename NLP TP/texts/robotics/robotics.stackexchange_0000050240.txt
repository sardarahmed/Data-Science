Q:

error compiling ompl_ros_interface tutorial (calling joint space planner)

Hi guys,
I am experiencing problem when compiling the calling joint spcae planner.
System running on ubuntu 12.04 with ros fuerte.
Error message:

I am referring to: http://www.ros.org/wiki/ompl_ros_interface/Tutorials/Calling%20the%20joint%20space%20planner
is the missing file part of the package in motion_planning_msgs?
Looking forward to any assistance.
Thanks
Ryan

A:

It error states it could not find that file. Is the motion_planning_msgs package in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH?
rospack find motion_planning_msgs

As you can see in the output the compiler finds a reference to the old package at line 3 in the mentioned file:
  /home/anshar/fuerte_workspace/sandbox/ompl_tutorial_example/src/ompl_joint_goal.cpp:3:48: fatal error: motion_planning_msgs/GetMotionPlan.h: No such file or directory

So if your file actually looks different, your make is broken. For a dull test call make clean before.

it is not in my ros package, but some sources mentioned that motion_planning_msgs has changed to arm_navigation_msgs. GetMotionPlan.h does exist in arm_navigation_msgs. Yet, after changing, the compilation still produces the same error.
Comment by ryann2k1 on 2013-04-16:
I Just figure out that arm_navigations_msgs appear twice in my ros path:/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/arm_navigation/arm_navigation_msgs/srv_gen/cpp/include/arm_navigation_msgs$, however it doesn't recognise the directory -> fatal error: arm_navigation_msgs/GetMotionPlan.h: No such file or directory
Comment by felix k on 2013-04-17:
Have you replaced every occurrence of motion_planning_msgs (manifest, that other include, CMakeLists if at all...) Why do you mean twice? The package-named directory inside msg_gen or srv_gen is correct, but of course shouldn't be in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH itself.
Comment by ryann2k1 on 2013-04-17:
Thanks for responding. I am following this tutorial: http://www.ros.org/wiki/ompl_ros_interface/Tutorials/Calling%20the%20joint%20space%20planner , I have replaced all the occurrence of motion_planning_msgs in my example_ompl_tutorials directory.any assistance would be appreciated
Comment by ryann2k1 on 2013-05-09:
I just reinstalled ros and re-do everything and managed to successfully compile it according to the tutorial. I decided to reinstall after trying sudo apt-get update my system and it reported some missing dependencies.Thank you for your respond.
Comment by felix k on 2013-05-13:
Glad you got it. Maybe apt-get install -f or apt-get dist-upgrade could have helped. Haven't thought about that.
Comment by ryann2k1 on 2013-05-20:
I tried before reinstalling but didn't work.Thanks a lot felix for your follow up respond. :)
