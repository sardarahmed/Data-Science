A:

What makes them not thread safe?

The message classes are (de)serialising C-structs from/to a byte buffer.
Buffer accesses are not thread safe, as they don't lock any of the resources that they use.
In addition to that reading and writing bytes from/to the network socket file descriptor is not guarded either.
