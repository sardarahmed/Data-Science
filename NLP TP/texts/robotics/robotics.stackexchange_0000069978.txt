Q:

zbar_ros how to install

Hello,
My goal is to read qr code from video camera stream.
I am first time trying to install zbar_ros.
I am looking for tutorial to configure and install zbar_ros on Ubantu 14.04 . I did look at http://wiki.ros.org/zbar_ros   but there wasn't enough instructions to install.
Please point me to instructions if they are available somewhere.
I have also read that this package can read video stream directly. So we do not need to install openCV.
Thanks,
Hemant

A:

[..] install zbar_ros on Ubantu 14.04

Assuming you are running Indigo, this should be a simple matter of:
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-zbar-ros

as that package has been released for both Hydro and Indigo (has the released badge on the wiki page you linked, and according to debbuild/indigo - zbar). There is no need to build it from source.
As to its usage: the barcode_reader_node node subscribes to a sensor_msgs/Image topic. Anything that can produce such messages would be suitable as input.
