Q:

new package gazebo does not compile!

Hello!
I checked out today the gazebo package, from simulator_gazebo:
https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/simulator_gazebo/trunk
and it does not compile! I get a lot of errors, concerning the urdf2gazebo. Here is the beginning of the error messages:
  /opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/simulator_gazebo/gazebo/src/urdf2gazebo.cpp:755: error: ‘class urdf::Link’ has no member named ‘addCollision’ 
/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/simulator_gazebo/gazebo/src/urdf2gazebo.cpp: In member function ‘void 
urdf2gazebo::URDF2Gazebo::printCollisionGroups(boost::shared_ptr<urdf::Link>)’:
/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/simulator_gazebo/gazebo/src/urdf2gazebo.cpp:801: error: ‘class urdf::Link’ has no member named ‘collision_groups’

...
I reinstalled my ROS-System today, from:
sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-desktop-full
Can anyone tell me what I am missing? thanks

Actually the "edit" link below your posts allows you to edit it after the fact.

If you don't mind, please put the error message in "code" formatting (the button is marked "101010"). It's much easier to read that way. (might want to drop the ! as well)

A:

as mentioned, trunk or development branches are not meant to be stable, but if you really want to try and run from gazebo trunk, try compiling against unstable of robot_model and see if that fixes at least part of your problem as stated?  hopefully a lot of the new features you might be looking for will be in the latest unstable release simulator_gazebo-1.3.0.

what are you looking for in the trunk and also, can you try and overlay/compile gazebo trunk against ros-unstable-simulator-gazebo instead of ros-diamondback-desktop-full?

ah ok, thanks! i tried the new robot_model, and it fixed the errors above! But others occur, so i will stay with the older version of gazebo for now and just exchange my needed files per hand.
