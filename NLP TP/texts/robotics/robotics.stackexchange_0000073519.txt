A:

In the package name that you're trying to install, you should probably replace electric with your version of ROS (probably indigo or jade).
According to the wiki page for pr2_arm_navigation, the last version of ROS that it was documented or released for was Groovy.
You may be able to do the tutorial without using pr2_arm_navigation, or you may want to look for an equivalent tutorial from MoveIt, which is the current motion-planning library that is commonly used on the PR2.
