If I start gzserver independently, then gazebo client GUI do popup but with empty world. No models are shown.
Any idea how this can be sorted out?

It should be fixed now. After I upgraded my gazebo packages, it worked for me:
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-gazebo-plugins-current
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-gazebo-ros-current

Hey @sep300 ,  I am having the same problem as the person asking the question is. I used the two commands you mentioned and found the problem still there. What I realzied was that those two commands update Gazebo not just the ros gazebo pckgs , and it updates Gazebo to 2.2.1. What version do u have?
