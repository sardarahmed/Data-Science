Q:

How to view Jenkins jobs in ROS Index

I am developing on an amd64 system and would like to be able to quickly see if there are binaries available for packages on other architectures (arm).
The ROS1 wiki has a handy section in the Package Links that shows all the Jenkins jobs, but I can't seem to find the same information in ROS Index for ROS2 packages.
How can I see what binaries are available for a ROS2 package?

A:

I'm pretty sure that doesn't exist at the moment, or I at least don't know of a direct analogue of what you refer to on the ROS 1 wiki. (Edit: would perhaps make for a nice contribution: the information is all there).
An alternative, but somewhat different, could be repo.ros2.org/status_page. These are also linked from the Resources section in the Humble Ubuntu installation documentation.
Those pages are periodically updated by the ROS 2 buildfarm, and provide basically the same information as the list you refer to on the ROS 1 wiki, but in a different format.
The names of the pages correspond to the platform/OS a particular ROS 2 version supports and gets packages built for. For Humble fi, there are:

ros_humble_default.html: the "default" OS for Humble, being Ubuntu Jammy
ros_humble_rhel.html: Humble on RedHat Enteprise Linux
ros_humble_ujv8.html: Humble on Ubuntu Jammy on ARMv8 (or arm64, as opposed to something like armhf)

If you open the first one, and filter for rclcpp, you get this page:

The links to the buildfarm jobs are "hidden" in the last two columns: Jsource and J64. That would be the source jobs and the amd64 binary jobs respectively. The squares can have different colours than green, and the page has a legend for what those other colours would mean which I won't duplicate here.
The first square in each column links you to a job. For rclcpp that would be:

Hsrc_uJ__rclcpp__ubuntu_jammy__source: the source job for rclcpp in Humble, on Ubuntu Jammy
Hbin_uJ64__rclcpp__ubuntu_jammy_amd64__binary: the binary job building rclcpp in Humble, for Ubuntu Jammy on amd64

For other supported platforms/OS, you'd have to open the other pages under repos.ros2.org/status_page.
Or perhaps you could navigate to the source job and check what Downstream Projects exist:

As yet another alternative: that same host also serves .yaml files which contain the same/similar information: repo.ros2.org/status_page/yaml. For rclcpp in ros_humble_default.yaml:
rclcpp:
  build_status:
    ubuntu:
      jammy:
        amd64:
          build: 16.0.4-2jammy.20230426.055957
          main: 16.0.4-2jammy.20230426.055957
          test: 16.0.4-2jammy.20230426.055957
        source:
          build: 16.0.4-2jammy
          main: 16.0.4-2jammy
          test: 16.0.4-2jammy
  maintainers:
    ...

This doesn't link to any jobs per se, but if your question is really just:

How can I see what binaries are available for a ROS2 package?

combining the information from all three .yamls for Humble would seem to answer that.

I was indeed just looking for available binaries, but your answer will help me track releases more closely. Thank you much!
