Q:

Rviz unstable rendering

I am learning URDF creation and having arrived at the end of the R2D2 tutorial, I found Rviz unstable and "gittery" in how it's rendering my robot simulation.
I am using the Joint-State-Publisher GUI to publish data to the continueous and revolt joints but the movements are far from smooth and hindering proper testing.
Link to a short video showing the unhelpful behaviour I am trying to resolve.
UPDATE:
Thank you @gvdhoorn
You are correct!
The rosnode list output does show is a joint_state_publisher node and a joint_state_publisher_gui node.

RQT-Graph output:

A:

It's likely you have one instance of joint_state_publisher and another joint_state_publisher_gui.
Please verify with rosnode list and rqt_graph.
Even if this is not the cause in this case, what you show/describe is not a "rendering issue", but you're feeding RViz two streams of data (via the robot_state_publisher, which publishes TF based on the JointState msgs):

one which tells it all joints are always at zero, and
one which tells it, no header_joint is at 0.76

it should be obvious those two will conflict.

Thank you. I corrected my mistake according to your input and all is now well in the Rviz-nivser.
