Q:

How difficult it is to build simple robots (for example Line follower) using raspberry pi and ROS?

I want to build a low cost robot, running ROS for educational purposes. It can be a simple line follower using raspberry pi and an IR sensor. Is it overambitious as a beginner project? How difficult is it to make ROS run on custom hardware?
P.S. I am newbie in both robotics and programming and I am more interested in building actual robots than running simulations. Also, I cant afford to buy ROS compatible robots.

A:

It is not extremely difficult to achieve this. It is probably a great way to learn after you complete the main ROS tutorials. Using ROS will get you free joystick or keyboard teleoperation of your bot along potential integration with the ROS navigation stack.
You have the choice of either interfacing with your robot hardware using the GPIO onboard you raspi or using a microcontroller and interfacing that with the computer using rosserial. I would recommend using rosserial and an Arduino because controlling a small robot and reading analog sensors is better documented on the Arduino platform. Either way is totally doable though. Good Luck!
