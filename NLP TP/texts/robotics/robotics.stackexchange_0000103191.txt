Q:

failed to initialize rcl: Couldn't parse parameter override rule

I'm trying to launch gazebo with a specific rate with the following
gazebo -s libgazebo_ros_init.so --ros-args -p -publish_rate:=100.0

But I get the following error:
[ERROR] [1681606330.311154028] [rcl]: Failed to parse global arguments
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'rclcpp::exceptions::RCLInvalidROSArgsError'
  what():  failed to initialize rcl: Couldn't parse parameter override rule: '-p -publish_rate:=100.0'. Error: Expecting token or wildcard, at /tmp/binarydeb/ros-foxy-rcl-1.1.14/src/rcl/arguments.c:1138, at /tmp/binarydeb/ros-foxy-rcl-1.1.14/src/rcl/arguments.c:325

I'm not sure if this is ROS or Gazebo related but I sure don't have a clue how to fix it (after a lot of internet searches)
Any help will be very appreciated

A:

Hi, try removing the '-' before "publish_rate:=100.0"
gazebo -s libgazebo_ros_init.so --ros-args -p publish_rate:=100.0
