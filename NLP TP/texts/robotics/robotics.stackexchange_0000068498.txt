Q:

How can I put noise to my P3DX model?

Hi Ros Users :
I am trying to put noise to my P3DX model wich is https://github.com/RafBerkvens/ua_ros_p3dx
Because the model behaviour is unrealistic.
Does Anybody know what I must modify in the code to do that?
Thanks!!!!
In respose to your comment @Javi V.
I modify this part of the code:
 <!-- ground truth -->
<gazebo>
<plugin name="p3d_base_controller" filename="libgazebo_ros_p3d.so">
<alwaysOn>true</alwaysOn>
<updateRate>100.0</updateRate>
<bodyName>base_link</bodyName>
<topicName>${ns}/base_pose_ground_truth</topicName>
<gaussianNoise>0.01</gaussianNoise>
<frameName>map</frameName>
<!-- initialize odometry for fake localization -->
<xyzOffsets>0 0 0</xyzOffsets>
<rpyOffsets>0 0 0</rpyOffsets>
</plugin>
</gazebo>

in Gaussian noise but it does the same... any ideas? Do I have to change something else to make this work ?

Have you taken a look at https://github.com/RafBerkvens/ua_ros_p3dx/blob/master/p3dx_description/urdf/pioneer3dx.gazebo ? Different Gazebo plugins are being used and hopefully you can set noise of those.

A:

Have you considered multiplying the data individually by a random number generated from the distribution of your choosing?
Eg a gaussian function  with  mean of 1 and suitably high standard deviation might work well.

First of all, thanks for answering.
Where can I find a gaussian function?
