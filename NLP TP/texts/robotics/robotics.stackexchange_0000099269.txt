Q:

How can i spawn pr2 on gazebo?

Hello
I'm trying to do the pr2_simulator_tutorial and i'm blocked in the first tutorial (http://wiki.ros.org/pr2_simulator/Tutorials/StartingPR2Simulation).
I launched empty world as asked in the tutorials (and the world opened in gazebo) :
roslaunch pr2_gazebo pr2_empty_world.launch

but when i'm trying to spawn a PR2, it doesn't work and i'm getting the following message (I tried first in another terminal and because it was nos working i also tried in the same where i have writen the first roslaunch)
roslaunch pr2_gazebo pr2.launch
RLException: [pr2.launch] is neither a launch file in package [pr2_gazebo] nor is [pr2_gazebo] a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

I saw similar questions with answers and i tried to solve my problem but no solutions has worked until now

writing roslaunch pr2_gazebo pr2_empty_world.launch instead of the previous -> it doesn't change anything and i got the same message
sourcing : i wrote source devel/setup.bash again as i've already did -> it doesn't change anything
i also tried (following this tuto https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/77265386, this one https://programmerclick.com/article/6041534558/ and others that are saying miore or less the same) to roscore one terminal and to retry but once again it didn't work

Seemingly, it could have a link with a .zshrc file in which i should add setopt nomatch but i don't find it (even using  locate)
Maybe the solution is really easy but i didn't find it. I hope someone could help me.
Thanks for reading

A:

I've got an answer so i will share it :
In fact, we can't use pr2 with ros-noetic (it is not available yet) that's why i could'nt spawn the pr2 robot. I don't know if it will be possible and when but for the moment, we can't.

Hi, this piece of information should be more readily available. Where did you find out that pr2 is not available for noetic?
