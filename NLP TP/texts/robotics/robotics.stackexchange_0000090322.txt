Q:

Multimaster-FKIE can make node private?

I am using the Multimaster-FKIE package to connect two ROS cores. I would need a certain node to be private to each ROS core. Is that possible? I need to run two Gazebo simulations with a package gazebo-ros-control which provides controllers for the robots, but it is only possible to run one of the node and so to control only one of the robots. I need to control both and couple them. One sends commands to the other. How can I achieve that?

A:

Yes, there is a parameter ~ignore_nodes in master_sync node that does just that
so to make the /gazebo and /gazebo_gui nodes private, for example, this command is used when launching the master_sync  node:
rosrun master_sync_fkie master_sync _ignore_nodes:=['/gazebo','/gazebo_gui']
