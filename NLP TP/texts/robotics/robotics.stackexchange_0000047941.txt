Q:

How to build just one package using catkin_make?

How do I build just one package using catkin_make? I now that I can cd to the build directory and build there but that is inconvenient. And how do I build one package and its dependencies?

A:

Build a single package including it's dependencies
catkin_make --only-pkg-with-deps <target_package>

Don't forget to switch back to building all packages when you are done
catkin_make -DCATKIN_WHITELIST_PACKAGES=""

Description
Whitelists only the specified packages and their dependencies by setting the CATKIN_WHITELIST_PACKAGES variable. This variable is stored in CMakeCache.txt and will persist between CMake calls unless explicitly cleared. Source: catkin_make --help

But there is an even better way
Using Catkin-Tools:
sudo apt-get install python-catkin-tools

Build specific package
catkin build <target_package>

Build the package from a directory under the package root
catkin build --this

Advantages:

you can call catkin build from everywhere
always builds packages seperately
catkin clean cleans everything (instead of the dangerous rm -rf build devel)
more infos

Important notes for catkin_tools:

You can't mix catkin build and catkin_make (delete your build/devel/install folders to switch tools)
As catkin_build builds all packages seperately there can be problems when passing information between packages via CMake. More Information

  
**Old answer for legacy reasons** 
catkin_make --pkg <my_package_name>

Example:
catkin_make --pkg turtlebot

Multiple Packages:
catkin_make --pkg <package A> <package B>

But as this doesn't work robustly I recommend switching to catkin_tools which allows to build only one package and many more fancy features:

You can also use --from-pkg <package> to skip to that package and then continue building the workspace after that.

Is there any reason why I run this option and it keeps compiling everything within the catkin workspace?
Comment by William on 2013-11-22:
Which option? If you mean the --from-pkg <package> option, if you specify the first package in the workspace then it will build them all. The idea is that it skips all packages which come before the one you specify, but builds that one package and all packages that follow it.

I personally feel this is an important thing that ought to to be mentioned in the tutorials.

I have the same problem as Javi V: I try to use this to make 1 package but it makes all the packages in the catkin_ws
edit: today it worked for reasons I don't understand.

I also occasionally try to use this trick and it rarely works. It just builds all of the packages still. I also can't tab complete my package.

It did not worked for me either. catkin_make -DCATKIN_WHITELIST_PACKAGES="foo;bar" command worked.

How is this an accepted answer? It doesn't work.
