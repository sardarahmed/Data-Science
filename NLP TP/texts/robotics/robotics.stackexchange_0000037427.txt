Q:

roslaunch args with double quote " "

Hi
I like to use roslaunch to start a rosbag recording with regular expression arguments.
How to I substitute the double quote "" to avoid xml problems
The following launch code is NOT working.
<launch>  
  <node pkg="rosbag" type="rosbag" name="rosbag" args="record -e "(.*)image_raw"  "(.*)camera_info" " />
</launch>

Any ideas
Greetings
Markus
