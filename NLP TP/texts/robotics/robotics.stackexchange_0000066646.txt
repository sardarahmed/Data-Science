Q:

razor_imu_9dof on ROS Indigo - ImportError: No module named cfg

Hi !
I'm trying to get the razor_imu_9dof node working on ROS Indigo and Ubuntu 14.04.
It is well detected on ttyUSB0 and I can see the data flow with gtkterm.
I installed the package from the repository.
When I run
roslaunch razor_imu_9dof razor-pub.launch

I got an error saying :
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/indigo/share/razor_imu_9dof/nodes/imu_node.py", line 40, in <module>
    from razor_imu_9dof.cfg import imuConfig
ImportError: No module named cfg

I could get the sensor working well on other ROS versions and different Ubuntu.
Any idea about why this error ?
Thanks!

@Cyril_J Did you solve the error? I'm having the same problem. My workaround was to comment out the lines of the node code where a variable of that file is used. Of course, the Dynamic Reconfigure is not available because of that.

At the time I ended up using an older version of the razor_imu_9dof package which just worked fine. But looking at it now, the reason is that you need to build the package with catkin_make in order to generate the files for the dynamic reconfigure. Let me know if it works.

Yeah, it works! thanks!

A:

The package razor_imu_9dof needs to be build to generate the Dynamic Reconfigure files.
