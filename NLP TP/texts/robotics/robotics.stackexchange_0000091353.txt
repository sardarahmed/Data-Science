A:

This is known as X11 Fowarding and you can setup your ssh to allow X11 forwarding. You will first want to confirm X11 forwarding is enabled on both the client and host computer:
For the client edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config:
X11Fowarding yes
X11UseLocalhost no

For the host edit /etc/ssh/ssh_config:
FowardX11 yes
FowardX11Trusted yes

After this you can connect from the client to the host with the following ssh flag
ssh -X -p SOME_PORT user@server

The -X flag does the magic here, you can test this by running a sample X application on the host computer such as xclock and it should run on your local system
