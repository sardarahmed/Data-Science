Q:

Eigen problems with gazebo

I'm trying to simulate the PR2 in gazebo.  I'm running ubuntu 10.4, 32-bit.  I have both diamondback and electric on my machine (another post leads me to believe that this may cause eigen problems if I use the wrong one).  I keep getting the crash below related to eigen.
If it is a diamondback vs. electric problem, how do I get rid of one.  "rm -rf" doesn't work.
