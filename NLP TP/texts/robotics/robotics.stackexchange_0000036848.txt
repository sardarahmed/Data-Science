Yeah, I need help installing the navigation stack. Unless I am suppose to create the package myself based on the following:

I assumed that it was simply a download like other packages.

Can you be more specific as to what you mean here? Are you looking for documentation? Help on installing the navigation stack? Or something else?

A:

On Ubuntu, you should be able to install the navigation stack as follows:

sudo apt-get install ros-electric-navigation

For details on installing ROS in general, please have a look at: http://ros.org/wiki/ROS/Installation

Hey Eitan.  Thanks for the help.  The problem was definitely that my repository for synaptic wasn't updating properly.

That's what I thought, but I get this message when trying to run that command: E: Unable to locate package ros-electric-navigation.  I just noticed that my other computer it shows up, which tells me that I my synaptic manager isn't setup properly.
