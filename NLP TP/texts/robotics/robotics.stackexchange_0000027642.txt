Q:

Explaining of the work of physics::JointController

I'm want to use PID in my plugin. I use common::PID and it's work fine, and I see that JointController use PID too. But I have problem with compiling plugin with JointController. I think I'm don't understand how to work with explicit constructors. Can anyone show a simple example ?

A:

From a model plugin, you can get a pointer to the model's JointController with:
this->model->GetJointController()

See an example here
