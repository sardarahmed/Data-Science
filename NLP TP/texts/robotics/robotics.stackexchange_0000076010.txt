Q:

problem about ros-indigo-ros for armrf

Recently I tried the Raspberry PI 3 the following installation TurtleBot, enter the command: sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-ros,But failed. I can not install it.
I found the ros-indigo-ros_1.11.13-0trusty-20160627-162641-0700_amd64.deb,But it is only applies to X86.How can I use it in armrf such as Raspberry PI 3? thank you very much!

A:

I haven't heard of any users installing ROS Indigo on the Raspberry Pi 3.
You don't say which OS you're using, or which installation instructions you're following, so I can't you debug your specific issue.
I've heard that most users have success installing Ubuntu 16.04 on their Pi 3, and then install the armhf packages for Kinetic. The Kinetic install on Ubuntu page clearly lists support for armhf on Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial).

The Kinetic have a lot of packages do not support now,so I used the indigo.The OS is Raspbian Jessie,I try to install Turtlebot,install ros-indigo-ros and catkin_make rocon,it is failed.But ROS indigo on Raspberry Pi 3 is success.I can run roscore in Raspberry Pi.
