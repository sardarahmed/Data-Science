3-
Now I set up RoboEarth from this
rosinstall ~/fuerte_workspace /opt/ros/fuerte 'http://www.ros.org/wiki/roboearth?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=roboearth.rosinstall'

so it is in fuerte_workspace and also on home since previous set up.
I have this when run rosmake roboearth , so why does not go in directory of fuerte_workspace ?!
amal@amal-HP-G62-Notebook-PC:~$ cd ~/fuerte_workspace
amal@amal-HP-G62-Notebook-PC:~/fuerte_workspace$ rosmake roboearth

 /opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros

(((6)))- now I have fuerte ros in file system linked with ros in home [in home contain only RoboEarth, KnowRob, ccny_vision and pkgs].
and it is clear in bash file that they are linked, so can I make home/amal/ros to be my work space ?!  and create a sandbox in it ?!

yes, it is normal. Binaries are dowloaded to /opt/ros/fuerte by default. You don't need to link, just try building the stack you downloaded.
Comment by Amal on 2012-11-07:
what do you mean by "try building the stack you downloaded." ?!
Comment by Amal on 2012-11-08:
@dornhege
after I have fuerte_workspace in home I have to add stacks that I wish in it !!
Comment by dornhege on 2012-11-08:
yes.
Comment by Amal on 2012-11-08:
@dornhege
I have this error when try add ccny_vision
ERROR: Error processing 'ccny_vision' : [ccny_vision] Checkout of http://robotics.ccny.cuny.edu/git/ccny-ros-pkg/ccny_vision.git version None into /home/amal/fuerte_workspace/ccny_vision failed.
I do not understand check this link for what ?
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-11-08:
How did you add the ccny_vision repository to your workspace? rosws set --git http://robotics.ccny.cuny.edu/git/ccny-ros-pkg/ccny_vision.git is the right command. What's the content of ~/fuerte_workspace/.rosinstall?
Comment by Amal on 2012-11-08:
I add to ~/fuerte_workspace/.rosinstall  [RoboEarth and KnowRob] and I  then want to add also ccny_vision to fuerte_workspace but get error!! . I already have it automatic when download RoboEarth but in home/ros/stacks.
Comment by dornhege on 2012-11-08:
Did you use the command @Lorenz posted? That is the correct one. If there is an error, update your post by copying that error there and list your .rosinstall.
Comment by dornhege on 2012-11-08:
Can you try rosws set ccny_vision --git hXttp://robotics.ccny.cuny.edu/git/ccny-ros-pkg/ccny_vision.git (remove X from hXttp)
Comment by Amal on 2012-11-08:
rosws: error: Element {'git': {'local-name': 'ccny_vision', 'uri': 'http://robotics.ccny.cuny.edu/git/ccny-ros-pkg/ccny_vision.git'}} already exists, did you mean --detached ?
already exist ?!
Comment by dornhege on 2012-11-08:
If it exists like that, you shouldn't be getting that error. Please remove all lines for this package from .rosinstall and redo the rosws set. Then execute rosws regenerate and source setup.bash. If it doesn't work, post your .rosinstall.
Comment by dornhege on 2012-11-08:
Does it work now? If not post your complete .rosinstall file and the output of rosws info.
Comment by Amal on 2012-11-11:
@dornhege please check last update
Comment by Amal on 2012-11-11:
@moritz @dornhege  Thanks :)
Comment by Amal on 2012-11-20:
all please see my update (((6)))
Comment by dornhege on 2012-11-20:
The manually defined ROS_PACKAGE_PATH should not set /opt/ros/fuerte... entries, but rather extend the current ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. When you use rosws this is done automatically and thus it is recommended.  And yes, sure you can use ~/ros, just do exactly the same using ~/ros instead of ~/fuerte_worksp
Comment by Amal on 2012-11-21:
but I have 3 work space in my home :D , so I try to remove any but it seem that it remove the entries not the hole folders. how ti remove it at all
Tanks :)
Comment by Amal on 2012-11-21:
I want to delete fuerte_workspace http://i.imgur.com/HkaEj.png
and That is ros which I want to be my workspace http://i.imgur.com/Dyv61.png
I mean it is already exist and linked to ros in file system but I want to make it an overlay so can edit not just a user . I need clarification please.thanks
Comment by dornhege on 2012-11-21:
I don't really understand what you mean/want. You can create a new ros workspace from any folder and add things to it via rosws. To enable a specific one for using it, just source it's setup.bash. Likewise removing any workspace is just removing that folder.
Comment by Amal on 2012-11-22:
Ok thanks I will try it
Comment by dornhege on 2012-11-22:
If you get permission denied errors, something with the permissions is wrong. What do you get for ls -l with the files that error? Did you check that out as another user?
Comment by Amal on 2012-11-23:
that is what I have when try  "ls -l"
drwxrwxr-x  5 amal amal   4096 Nov 22 20:53 fuerte_workspace
Comment by dornhege on 2012-11-23:
This is the directory. The errors you get are from other files.
Comment by Amal on 2012-11-23:
I am really sorry for long inconvenience, I am not understand what you want to say ?!
simply I want to remove the work space, but It does not want to be removed I do not know why? . can I skip this and create another one, mean not to asign a path to this that doesnot want to be removed
?!!
Comment by dornhege on 2012-11-23:
As long as you don't source the setup.bash of a ROS workspace it won't be active and doesn't interfere with anything else.
Comment by Amal on 2012-11-23:
oh thanks, it will be good solution
I Really appreciate your patience :)

A:

You should create an overlay with rosws that adds the downloaded stack to your ROS workspace.
