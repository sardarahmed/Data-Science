Q:

if __name__ == '__ STATIC main__' in tf2 tutorials

The tf2 tutorial on static frames abruptly ends without explaining this:
if __name__ == '__ STATIC main__':
    rospy.init_node('my_tf2_broadcaster')

I've never seen __ STATIC main__ and from googling I can't tell if it's a ROS specific thing or general python syntax. I get no hits for it exactly, so I'm wondering if it's a typo. If so and it should be '__main__', I'm still confused as it would appear the second block would never run.
Could someone clarify that section of code?

I'm not quite sure what this means; perhaps it is just supposed to indicate to readers that this is an alternate version for publishing a static transform?

A:

After going through the tutorials more, I agree with you @ahendrix. I submitted a suggestion to just ditch the class-based static transform method for consistency/less confusion for beginners.

ros/geometry2#247 should be in close-able state so this should be marked as an answer.

I just closed that, and this is marked as an answer already.
