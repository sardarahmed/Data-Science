Q:

What would be helpful for newbies to know before getting started?

I've seen several posts sending newbies to the Tutorials, but are there skills, concepts, or useful tidbits that would be useful for our new friends (and help to minimize potential frustration for them and the community.)
I would like to generate a wiki post from the top responses, so if some of these themes have been asked/answered here or elsewhere, the links to that content could be included as comments to the provided answer.
Justification for any answer is not needed, let the upvotes work for us.

@SL Remy have you generated a wiki post ? If yes, please share the link.

A:

First I'll try to elaborate a bit on the already mentioned points:

Basic Linux and especially Ubuntu

Getting used to using the windows and workspaces relevant shortcuts (in Unity, hold SUPER/WINDOWS)
Knowing what apt-get does and how it works
Knowing how to set up ssh connections using keys

Using the terminal

Getting familiar with TAB completion and history
Know the basic shortcuts CTRL+C, CTRL+ALT+T, CTRL+SHIFT+T, CTRL+(+|-|0)

What also helped me:

Having a basic knowledge of threads and their hazards (especially relevant for C++)
Getting familiar with version control systems and their underlying concepts

git, subversion and mercurial are all used in ROS repositories
- Focus on one and use it for your projects (git works best for me)
