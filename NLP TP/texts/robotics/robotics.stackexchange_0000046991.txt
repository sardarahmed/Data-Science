Q:

catkin_make in catkin_ws error

I am new in using catkin, as a former rosbuild user. I was following the new tutorials online. After I learning how to build a package, on website:
BuildingPackages
After I modify the package.xml in the created package, and source the setup.bash in installation directory, the output of catkin_make is :
Base path: /home/wu/catkin_ws
Source space: /home/wu/catkin_ws/src
Build space: /home/wu/catkin_ws/build
Devel space: /home/wu/catkin_ws/devel
Install space: /home/wu/catkin_ws/install
####
#### Running command: "make cmake_check_build_system" in "/home/wu/catkin_ws/build"
####
####
#### Running command: "make -j4" in "/home/wu/catkin_ws/build"
####

and there is no build file of beginner_tutorials in the build/ directory.
However, on another website:
using_a_workspace
I tried another command
catkin_make --force-cmake

since I have compiled the workspace after I made the directory followed by the website:
InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment
I am wondering is it correct to add --force-cmake after the catkin_make command or the problem occurs because some other issues?
Thanks

Yes, this was a bug in catkin_make:

should be fixed with next release of catkin.
