Q:

cloud robotics engine for ROS

Hello,
May I know if there exist a cloud platform for ROS computations. I know one 'Rapyuta' which was pretty much active 2 years ago. Now they have neither support for 14.04 nor for Indigo.
Thanks

A:

Rapyuta is currently going through a major revision and it is planned to be release in early 2016, http://rapyuta.org.
