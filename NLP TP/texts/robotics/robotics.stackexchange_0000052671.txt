Q:

Odometry model two wheeled robot with kinect

I am trying to implement the navigation with ROS and a two-wheeled robot with Kinect, I have access to the readings of the velocity and pose of the wheel encoders , so I need an odometry motion model .
So is there some equation  already done  for the odometry in ROS that I can use for this purpose? or any person have experience with this topic?
