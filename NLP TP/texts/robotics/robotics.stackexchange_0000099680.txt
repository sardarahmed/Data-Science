Q:

node_interface for now?

The node_interfaces (https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/tree/master/rclcpp/include/rclcpp/node_interfaces) are really useful for dependency injection allowing much nicer tests.  There however does not seem to be an interface that provides the method now.  Is there a way to call that method without a node interface?

A:

I found that you can get a NodeClockInterface and gen call now like this: node_clock_interface->get_clock()->now()
