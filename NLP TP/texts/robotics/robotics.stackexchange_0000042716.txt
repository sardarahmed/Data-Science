Q:

problem with p2os teleop

I have pioneer 3-AT robot. It connected my notebook with serial to usb cable.
ROS fuerte has installed in my notebook with Ubutu 11.10.
I installed p2os referred to p2os_tutorial.
When I launch the p2os teleop_keyboard, it works well, but pioneer doesn't move.
The motor is fully enabled with p2os_dashboard. p2os teleop_joy has the same problem.
The pioneer beeps only..in regularly.
Could you give me a help?

A:

It looks that /cmd_vel should be connected to /p2os_teleop/cmd_vel to make it work.
You can verify the connection by using rxgraph command.
If they are not connected, you can remap the topics to solve it.
Another typical problem with keyboard teleop nodes is that they require the focus on the corresponding terminal window. Otherwise, the key strokes are not received by the node.

This is also true for the ROSARIA package, where /cmd_vel should be remapped to /RosAria/cmd_vel.
