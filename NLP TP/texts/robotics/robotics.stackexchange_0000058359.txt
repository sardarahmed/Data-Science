Q:

layered costmap: How to start a local costmap?

I am wondering where the resizing should be taking place.
With the global costmap and a static layer, the map gets resized when a map comes in.
But when I use the local costmap with just an obstacle, footprint and inflation layer there should be a point where the dimension should be read in.
Can you tell me where this should happen? Can't find it...
I am on ROS Hydro with the hydro-devel navigation branch.

A:

I have not worked with this directly, but looking at the example launch and parameter files, it seems there are parameters specifying the dimenstions: https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/blob/hydro-devel/costmap_2d/launch/example_params.yaml#L13-L16

Well, I found it. It's only read in over dynamic reconfigure and I don't use it!
