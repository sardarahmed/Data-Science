Q:

doing mapping for following hardwares?

hello
i have following components

Rplidar A1
SparkFun 9DoF Razor IMU M0
rotarary incremental encoders
differential drive robot
5.ubuntu 16.04 with kinetic

im trying to do SLAM and i dont know which is good option for me with above hardwares , if i use gmapping can i fuse Imu and encoders or can i do gmapping only with encoders ?

A:

You can take a look at ndt_fuser, you can feed this information about odometry and that will help in mapping. To get odometry with IMU and encoder, you can use robot_localization.
NOTE: You cannot use your encoder data directly for robot_localization. You will need to convert it into a twist message or Odometry message.

what about gmapping ?
Comment by Choco93 on 2019-09-17:
For gmapping to work you need to provide odom->base_link transform that comes from robot_localization. In short if this transform is available you can use gmapping and it should output map.
