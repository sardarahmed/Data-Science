Q:

Can I use triangle list from RVIZ to display a polygon mesh from PCL?

Hello,
I am trying to display a polygon mesh in real time in rviz. I am using the mesh from pcl (pcl::PolygonMesh).
I believe that the only way is to use the triangle list method but I cant seem to get it to work.
Thank you

A:

One way of doing this is to publish the mesh using the a marker message containing a triangle list. There's an example of this in the documentation here. You may need to write your own code to convert from the pcl type to the maker message. This should be fairly straightforward though, you build a list of vertices and a list of colors, each triangle contributes 3 vertices and 1 color to these lists.

Should I use the geometry_msgs::Point to build the vertices list?

Be aware of the various issues with _LIST markers. See the rviz issue tracker (search for triangle or list).
