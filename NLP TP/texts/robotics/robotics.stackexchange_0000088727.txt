Q:

android apk map manager "waiting for map list"

Hello,
Can you help me please?
I'm using the rosjava map manager tutorial (in this link https://github.com/DreamFly111/make_a_map ), i've installed the apk file and i'm able to connect with my robot. but after the master connection, i have a waiting dialog with message "waiting for maps" like it's waiting for somethings, the "Make A Map" tutorial is working fine, but the "Map Nav" tutorial show the same waiting dialog with the message "Waiting for map List", i dont why. I have been working with rosjava for 3 month but i admit there are many things i still don't understand don't know what to do. Thanks you
