A:

There are no step by step tutorials, but you are welcome to write some ;) Check http://octomap.github.io/ for information, there is the paper linked there with all details explained and also a mailing list for further questions regarding OctoMap (+a few answers already).
For an introduction you could also have a look at the ROSCon talk (slides + video) about OctoMap:

Hi thank you for the reply. I was able to create 3d maps of the simulated environment from morse. The ROSCon talk was really good and very useful. And yes definitely i will create a tutorial as soon as i have learnt the basics myself ;-p  A tutorial would help lot many people interested in octomap.
