Q:

error compiling g2o about g2o_viewer

Hi everyone,
Recently, I have been studying g2o link:[https://github.com/RainerKuemmerle/g2o] , an open-source C++ framework for optimizing graph-based nonlinear error functions, I followed the README in the file g2o. When i cmake the file, it all went well, but when i make it, it failed, which is run on ubuntu 14.04 indigo. Obviouly, making g2o_viewer went wrong. The details are as follows:

I hope someone can help me solve the problem.
Any suggestions are welcome.
Thanks in advance.

Maybe a version conflict? I haven't got qglviewer installed at all, so g2o_viewer is skipped during compilation.

Do you have qglviewer installed at all?
Comment by jwlifly on 2016-03-15:
i tried to install it, but it went wrong. I don't know why

A:

I came across the same issue,  found that in my system QGL viewer partially installed as some dependencies.
What I done was I build it with ccmake and removed all the QGL viewer part paths. And generated the make file.
Then installed it.
