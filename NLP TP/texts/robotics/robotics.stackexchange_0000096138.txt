Q:

How to Use robot_localization package?

I am beginner in ROS.
I have a differential drive mobile robot.
I want to use  robot_localization package to estimate robot velocity and position from IMU and odometry.
I just download robot_localization package, but I can not use it.
$   rostopic list

/cmd_vel
/control_vel
/encoder/odom
/imu/data
/md49_data
/md49_encoders
/rosout
/rosout_agg
/tf

My problem is how to make a launch file to use this package to estimate robot velocity and position from IMU and odometry?
and what is its location in the  ~/catkin_ws?

A:

Any parameters and configuration of the robot localization package can be found here
Robot Localization Wiki: (http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/robot_localization/html/index.html)
On the page (Preparing Your Data for Use with robot_localization) and (Configuring robot_localization) you'll find everything that you need to use the robot_localization package correctly.
