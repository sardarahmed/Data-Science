Q:

Does a node receive messages sent by itself on a topic that it is both publishing and subscribing to?

I am working on writing some code for a project, but I have a node that will be continuously publishing(30 Hz) to a topic while also subscribing to the same topic to listen for a different pub from a different node.   Basically, node A is listening to topic X and publishing to topic X. Meanwhile another node, node B, will at some time, publish a message to topic X. Will the subscriber callback in node A be triggered every time it publishes sometime? Also, will it be able to pick up the message if node B only publishes once?
Thanks,

May I suggest a title change? Your question seems to be really about whether a node receives its own messages if it publishes on a topic it also subscribes to. You can't actually 'receive callbacks', just messages.

Thanks for the suggestion! It's changed.

A:

If a node publishes on a topic and also has a subscriber for it, it will receive "it's own" message. This is a feature, as components in the publish/subscribe system should not need to care about where a message originates from.
Even though this probably is best avoided, you can check for the origin of a message using the MessageEvent mechanism (e.g. if it originates from the same node) as in this example.
