Q:

Gazebo unable to launch empty world

Hi~everyone
I installed ROS fuerte in Ubuntu 12.04 and I tried to launch the empty world
  roslaunch  gazebo_worlds empty_world.launch

I got the following error message:
  Error [Transport.cc:102] Unable to get topic namespaces in [50] tries.
  Error [Node.cc:68] No namespace found

/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/simulator_gazebo/gazebo/scripts/gui: line 2:  5106 segmentation fault   (core dumped) rospack find gazebo/gazebo/bin/gzclient -g rospack find gazebo/lib/libgazebo_ros_paths_plugin.so

log file: /home/qxesqxes/.ros/log/326a199c-ec38-11e1-a2f0-c446195a3b7d/gazebo_gui-3*.log
Your help would be much appreciated, thank you.

I am having this same issue - Fuerte installed on Ubuntu 12.04 keeps having a segmentation fault when I run:
roslaunch pr2_gazebo pr2_empty_world.launch

I get:
Gazebo multi-robot simulator, version 1.0.2
