Q:

Take over maintenance of packages?

We're using 2 packages that have been neglected by the maintainers: (PocketSphinx and rviz_animated_view_controller). Is it going to ruffle any feathers if I fork rosdistro and update the source url and maintainer names? Our main goal here is a Kinetic version.

A:

@Dirk Thomas just started a related Discourse thread: Releasing repositories form “other” people.
As ROS Answers isn't really suited for discussion, I'd suggest you bring this up there as well.
