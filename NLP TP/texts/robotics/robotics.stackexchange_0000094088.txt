Q:

ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved to system dependencies

I'm trying to build the cartographer from this site https://google-cartographer-ros.readthedocs.io/en/latest/compilation.html
when i ran rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro=${ROS_DISTRO} -y, this error pop up
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
cartographer_ros: No definition of [tf2_eigen] for OS version [buster]

How do i resolve this?
Thanks

A:

So what that means is there's no compiled version of tf2_eigen available on your OS, Buster (I know, obvious, but trying to start with parsing the statement).
So you need to compile that package from source on your (raspberry pi?) or contact maintainers to get a released version on that OS (which will be a longer process).
