Q:

Creating a frictionless caster wheel

I am trying to simulate a robot my team is building using Gazebo. I created a URDF file and I can not get the front caster wheels of my robot to work. I have been following the logic of the code from this site but when I try to drive the robot the front wheels are not actually frictionless. I tried changing the wight of the main body that was suggested in another thread but that did not work. Does anyone know how to fix this problem?
The Code is located here link text
-Thank you

For future questions about Gazebo (robot modelling, physics setup), please ask them on answers.gazebosim.org. ROS Answers is about ROS, and we try to stay on topic as much as possible.
Thanks.

A:

just set mu1 and mu2 values to 0.0
in other words in lines 195, 196, 145, 146 of your code
replace this:
<mu1 value="1.0"/>
<mu2 value="1.0"/>

with this:
<mu1 value="0.0"/>
<mu2 value="0.0"/>
