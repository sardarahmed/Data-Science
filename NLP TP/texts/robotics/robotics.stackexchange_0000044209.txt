Q:

Adjusting the default clipping distance on Gazebo

I have a large world file, and unfortunately the default clipping distance (in UserCamera.cc) is set such that I cannot view my entire world on screen.  So far, I have worked around this by: 

Deleting the ROS_NOBUILD in the gazebo folder located in /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/simulator_gazebo 
Performing a '$rosmake gazebo' as root <br/>
3. Modifying the UserCamera.cc <br/>
4. Doing a '$make', '$make install', and '$ldconfig' as root in the appropriate build folder to propagate the changes.
While this worked on prior gazebo releases, with the newest gazebo release (1.6.16) the GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH does not seem to be set correctly after going through this process.  Besides, I would like to not have to mess around with a rosmake of gazebo (which I know is ill advised) so an alternative solution would be welcome.

A:

Have you tried modifying the farClip and the horizontal field of view?
e.g.
<hfov>90</hfov>
<nearClip>0.01</nearClip>
<farClip>100</farClip>
