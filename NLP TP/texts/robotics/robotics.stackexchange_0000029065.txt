Q:

Error: lidar is not defined in SDF, ignoring lidar

Hello. I'm new to Gazebo and I'm trying to create a 2D-lidar sensor and connect in later on with ROS. Following the tutorial [http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?cat=guided_i&tut=guided_i1] I created the following world file, but instead of ray element I use lidar.

When I run the world file I get the error:
Warning [parser.cc:778] XML Element[lidar], child of element[sensor] not defined in SDF. Ignoring[lidar]. You may have an incorrect SDF file, or an sdformat version that doesn't support this element.

When I change the above file to use ray element it runs smoothly. I follow the SDF format from here:
link text so I don't know where the problem might be. Can anyone tell me what I'm missing here?
I use Ubuntu 16.04 and the pre-installed Gazebo 7 and i would prefer to stay with this version. Thanks in advance.

A:

Hello,
This error means that your SDF is not well formed.
You can find some test worlds in the gazebo_ros_pkgs repository that can help to build your own model/world. For example to include a lidar you can review this file.
Regards
