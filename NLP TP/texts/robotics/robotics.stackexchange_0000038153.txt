Q:

rosmake vs make

Is there a difference between rosmake and make? The way I understand it, rosmake is for building and updating the dependencies of a package, where these dependencies could be other ros packages.
rosdep is for installing dependencies outside the realm of ROS... More like system dependencies for building a ros package.
Then what is the purpose of running "make" in the directory of a ros package?
Thanks
