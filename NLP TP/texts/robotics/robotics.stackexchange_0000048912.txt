Q:

Modify source code of a pre-built Package(external)

Hi, so I am using a couple packages but the "output" that I get from the nodes isn't exactly what I need to work on.
I wanted to know -

If the source code of these pre-built packages can be modified, and if it can then how do we go about "updating" the package after that?
If I can't modify the source code, can I "manipulate" the output at the nodes before I forward it to other nodes if required?

Thank You!

What kind of manipulation do you need to do?
Comment by nemesis on 2013-03-03:
The coordinates that I get from the package are not along the axes I require. That is, Z direction is Y and X is negative Z.
So wanted to check if I can modify the code so that I get it right.
Comment by nemesis on 2013-03-03:
I'm sorry, I should've been clearer. Ignore the previous comment.
What I require is - X,Y and Z
What the package output is ('cause of the way it's in the code) - X, Z, (negative) Y
So I wanted to modify the code to change that.
(I hope you understood this time?)

Oh, that data format is wrong? Is it publishing a custom message type?

A:

EDIT: to answer both questions:

Check out sources into an overlay and modify that copy. See: http://answers.ros.org/question/47563/how-do-overlays-work/

Write another node that subscribes to the original topic, modifies each message as desired, and republishes it on a different topic name. You'll probably need to remap some topic names for that to work properly.

I will give this a try. But I guess after modification, I just have to use "Make" inside that folder to compile it, right?
Comment by joq on 2013-03-04:
It's a good idea to run rosmake first. Later, you can run make, to save build time.
Comment by nemesis on 2013-03-04:
I will try out the second way later and let you know. But modifying the code worked.
Note - I had to use "rosmake", "make" wasn't working. Will update once I figure out why. Thank you!
