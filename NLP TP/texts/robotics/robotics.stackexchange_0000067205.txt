Q:

Rviz doesn't update rolling-window costmap origin

If I disable and then enable costmap view in rviz, it updates. But rviz itself doesn't translate cosmap update, it draws it with old origin.
It even happens for husky_navigation example.
How could I configure rviz to view rolling-window cosmap with moving origin right?
Here are 2 screenshots - first with costmap view shifted and second with correct visualisation after disable and then enable costmap view in rviz:

Here is video:

I use ROS Indigo, Ubuntu 14.04.
I tried at different computers, on VM and without, at just-installed ROS with same result.
Thanks

What version of ROS, OS, and rviz are you using? Can you give a link to the husky_navigation example?

Ubuntu 14.04, ROS Indigo. http://wiki.ros.org/husky_navigation/Tutorials/Husky%20Move%20Base%20Demo

A:

I think, I solved this problem for myself. The issue was that Rviz doesn't correctly use /move_base/global_costmap/costmap_updates (of map_msgs/OccupancyGridUpdate type), so setting parameter always_send_full_costmap: true to costmap does the job.
