Q:

What motors should I use that do not require gearboxes? This is a car like robot

I am new to robotics, and ime looking for a <12v motor that can be used to power a car-like robot.I will have two of these, so I can turn on-spot. Furthermore I want them not to require a gearbox, so I can just attach them to the wheels. I don't really know where to start looking for one. 
I have heard servos have built in gearboxes, but don't they only have 180 degree rotation?
So does any body know a motor like I described in paragraph 1, or at least point me in the right direction? 

A:

Without knowing more about your robot nobody can help size your motor. We would need to know things like weight, desired top speed, desired acceleration, where you plan to drive it (indoor vs outdoor) etc. Here is a good starting point tutorial at Society of Robots that covers how to size a motor. 
That same site also has nice explanations of the different kinds of motors here.
