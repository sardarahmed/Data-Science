A:

If you want to avoid assembling your own cable, you can buy one directly from iRobot. I am not aware of other options, but I'd be interested to know. This will allow you to communicate to the Roomba from a computer.
However, if you are interested in powering devices from the Roomba's battery you can see my answer here about making your own.
