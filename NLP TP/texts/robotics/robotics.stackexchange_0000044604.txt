Q:

weird rosmake error with pr2_description package

Hi,
I'm trying to build the pr2_description package on a ubuntu 12.04 machine with ros fuerte.
I get the following error, which I do not understand. Can someone help me?
Thanks a lot!
$ rosmake pr2_description

UPDATE: ros-fuerte-robot-model is already installed. Maybe the problem is something different altogether ... the reason why I installed and compiled this and other packages to my workspace is that they were required for another package and could not be found. But $roscd robot_model works fine and takes me to /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/robot_model. My ROS_PACKAGE_PATH looks good, too: /home/rico/ros/workspace:/opt/ros/fuerte/share:/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks

Are you maybe using pr2_description from trunk? There is a pretty good chance that it only compiles under groovy. Try using the version from the fuerte branch if you really cannot install from debian packages: https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/stacks/pr2_common/branches/pr2_common-1.8/
Comment by ricoj on 2012-10-04:
I have installed new packages using roslocate info PACKAGE >> .rosinstall and rosws update in my workspace.
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-10-04:
Please have a look at my updated answer. Get rid of your source installation and install it from debian packages: sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-pr2-common
Comment by ricoj on 2012-10-04:
okay, I installed the package I was originally interested in using
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-PACKAGE
this includes all dependencies and should fix the problem :-)

A:

The system is unable to find ivcon which is part of the stack robot_model. Install it with:
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-robot-model

Note that you can get an already compiled version of pr2_description by installing the pr2_common debian pacakge:
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-pr2-common
