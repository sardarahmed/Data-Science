Q:

Installing "Restricted" drivers for turtlebot

Hi,
I'm unpacking and installing turtlebot I just received. The setup tutorial says:
DO NOT INSTALL THE NVIDIA RESTRICTED DRIVERS! Nvidia ION/Optimus is not supported yet in the nVidia restricted drivers. 

On the other hand, Ubuntu Lucid shows an icon on the menu bar at the top of desktop, and clicking it shows a window that prompts installing "NVIDIA accelerated graphics driver (version current)".
So my question is whether I should install this driver as recommended by Ubuntu or not. I'm not yet getting if the 2 drivers above are the same or not.
We're thinking about utilizing ION graphics card.
Thank you.

A:

Do not install the nvidia drivers, this will cause the display to crash and make the machine unusable.

wait for NVIDIA to put a a working driver..(it's the best answer i have) 2) reinstall the turtlebot using the USB stick...

Questions remain (I'm not asking solution here) are 1) how to utilize ION board w/o NVIDIA drivers, 2) how to workaround the possible issues if I already installed it. I have multiple turtlebots and I've actually installed it on one of them already.

@mwise_wg thanks. Then I assume that both drivers I mentioned are the same (or even any NVIDIA drivers should not be installed) and I avoid installing it.
