Q:

How to control turning in Navigation Stack

I have a omnidirectional skid steer drive robot. I am implementing Navigation stack for it. Using default planners and default configuration. Whenever I give a close distance goal to the bot it takes huge turns to correct its orientation and misses the target. What should I do to either make it take sharp turns or disable x velocity while on rotation

A:

Try adjusting min_in_place_vel_theta default is 0.4 not 1.0, setting at 1 rotates at 1 radian or 57 degrees per second.
This parameter sets the minimum rotational velocity allowed for the base while performing in-place rotations in radians/sec.
