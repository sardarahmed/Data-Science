Q:

Changing Rviz item properties on-the-fly

Hi all,
Lets say I have a project involving Rviz and some display types, say, a PointCloud2 I'm listening to.
If I wanted to change the cloud coloring, shpere size, or topic, for example, but through a command from within a node and/or an rqt gui incorporating Rviz, what would I be looking for? Is it dynamic reconfigure or are there more / other ways of doing so?
I'm just looking for a short pointing in the right direction, I would greatly appreciate it because I can't seem to find the correct keyword for this.
Many thanks,
Steve
