Q:

workspaces broken with latest update (1/28/2013)?

I am using a rosbuild workspace overlayed on top of a catkin workspace according to this tutorial. I only source the rosbuild workspace setup.bash in my ~/.bashrc.
The release repository was updated today, and I upgraded my packages. It seems like my existing workspaces broke until I reinitialized them. I didn't think to capture the output before re-initializing.
Can someone confirm that this problem exists? Or did I just experience a weird hiccup?
Edit#1
Never mind, updates on a second machine worked correctly. This was a machine specific issue.

I tried to upgrade my Precise Groovy development system this morning, but there were a long list of packages being kept back. Maybe that caused your problem.

A:

I suspect this bug report (which has been fixed since) was the cause. https://github.com/ros/catkin/issues/329
As far as I can tell, reinitializing the workspaces is sufficient.
