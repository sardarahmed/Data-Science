Q:

Unable to install ROS kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04

When I try to do full install
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-desktop-full

I am getting following errors:
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done

Is still a clean Ubuntu installation? Or have you had ROS and / or Gazebo installed at some point in the past?

I have the similar error for python-catkin-dkpg when I call catkin_install. I previously installed it was using smoothly.

@tolga-uni-lu please create a new question for that problem

A:

try:
sudo apt install aptitude

then:
sudo aptitude install ros-kinetic-desktop-full

This will offer a solution, typically it means uninstalling some stuff to get the one you need, if the tradeoff seems ok to you go for it!
