Q:

problems subscribing to turtlebot_node/sensor_state

Hello,
I am trying to subscribe to turtlebot_node/sensor_state so that I can tell when my Turtlebot has bumped into something and handle it accordingly.  Whenever I try to run it, however, it gives me the error message:
 File "/opt/ros/electric/stacks/turtlebot_apps/turtlebot_teleop 
 /bin/turtlebot_teleop_key", line 35, in <module>
     from turtlebot_node.msg import TurtlebotSensorState
 ImportError: No module named turtlebot_node.msg

My import statements are as follows:
from os import system
import curses
import roslib; roslib.load_manifest('turtlebot_teleop')
import rospy
import random
from turtlebot_node.msg import TurtlebotSensorState
from geometry_msgs.msg import Twist

From other examples I can find online, it seems like this should work.  turtlebot_node is definitely running correctly and I have no trouble getting it to move without implementing a bump correction algorithm.  What do you think is wrong?
Thanks,
Matthew

A:

How did you install the turtlebot_node package? If it is from source, you need to run "make" to generate the message headers.

I recommend using rosmake in your package.  The build system has to generate the message processing code which is failing to import.
