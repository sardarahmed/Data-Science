Q:

ROS2_Control question

Can anyone clarify the units of diff_drive_controller, Command interfaces in velocity are in rad/sec ? and state interfaces for encoders are rotations ? and velocity is again rad/sec ?
Also is there a way in galactic distro under ros2_control to mention the gear reduction so the cmd_vels are generated accordingly or is it going to be part of write function ?

A:

First of all: Galactic is EOL and doesn't receive any updates any more. Please upgrade to a more recent distro.
You are right. The command interfaces is of velocity type (angular speed of the wheels). For odometry calculations, you can use it open_loop (without any sensors), or with sensors: Depending on the parameter position_feedback the state interface has to be of type position or velocity.
For more details check the documentation
