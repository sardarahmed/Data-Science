Q:

Initialize parameters via yaml in ros2

According to this PR, we can now initialize parameters via yaml file. I edited the talker example to have the parameter client so I can see the changes in parameters, but when I try to load the parameters via this line as given in the PR comments
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker_with_params __params:=install/share/demo_nodes_cpp/talker_params.yaml

I get this error
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error' 
what(): Failed to parse parameters install/share/demo_nodes_cpp/talker_params.yaml

anything I'm doing wrong?

A:

Likely the syntax of the yaml file is not correct. Can you post its contents? It should have syntax as described here: https://github.com/ros2/rcl/blob/master/rcl_yaml_param_parser/README.md
