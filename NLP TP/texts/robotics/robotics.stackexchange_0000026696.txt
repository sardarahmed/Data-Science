Q:

Spawn object in specific location

Hey team,
I see a related question about spawning objects into the world via the command line.  Is it possible to spawn them into a specific location via the command line, or is the starting position and orientation set exclusively by the SDF file?  For example, if I have a moving platform and want to spawn objects on top of that, is there a good way to do that?

A:

Use the gzfactory -h command line tool. You can specify an xyzRPY pose for a model.
You can also use ROS way.
