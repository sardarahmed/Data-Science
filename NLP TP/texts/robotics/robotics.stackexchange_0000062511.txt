Q:

sicktoolbox hydro error

Hello folks,
I am using Sick LM291 and usb serial converter.
Ubuntu 12.04 intell 64 bits and hydro.
In fuerte, there was no problem to use this laser but we recently change the ros version and this is the output of the laser LM291 sicktoolbox_wrapper:
   $ rosrun sicktoolbox_wrapper sicklms

[ WARN] [1410366255.940781220]: You are using an angle smaller than 180 degrees and a scan resolution less than 1 degree per scan. Thus, you are in inteleaved mode and the returns will not arrive sequentially how you read them. So, the time_increment field will be misleading. If you need to know when the measurement was made at a time resolution better than the scan_time, use the whole 180 degree field of view.

Aborted (core dumped)

The most strange thing is that the node indentify correctly the laser but when try to publish, appear segmentation fault with unknown error.
Tell me if I am doing something wrong or is just package problem. Some related problems but not the same here:

Best regards.
************* EDIT ***************
I try it in indigo and it works fine. Maybe some problem related to hydro branch?

A:

Use the option connect_delay
rosrun sicktoolbox_wrapper sicklms _port:=/dev/ttyUSB0 _connect_delay:=30
or
rosparam set sicklms/port /dev/ttyUSB0
rosparam set sicklms/connect_delay 30
rosrun sicktoolbox_wrapper sicklms
