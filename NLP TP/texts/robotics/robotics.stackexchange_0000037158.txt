Q:

Target "nodeps" does not exist in the project "android_gingerbread"

I am trying to follow along with the tutorial at http://www.ros.org/wiki/ApplicationsPlatform/Clients/Android to allow an android app to control a robot running ROS. I am getting an error requesting "nodeps" in android_gingerbread.
Can anyone tell me what this means and/or how I can fix the error?
The error follows:
  BUILD FAILED
  /home/steve/ROS_DIR/appmanandroid/build_app.xml:116: The following error occurred while executing this line:
  /home/steve/android-sdk-linux_x86/tools/ant/build.xml:485: The following error occurred while executing this line:

download patch from http://code.google.com/p/rosjava/issues/detail?id=76 then run [roscd rosjava_core] and [patch -p1 < ./rosjava_core.patch]

A:

See: http://code.google.com/p/rosjava/issues/detail?id=76 and apply the patch there to rosjava_core.
