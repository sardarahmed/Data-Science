Q:

Does Gazebo 11 go with both ROS2 Foxy and Dashing?

If Gazebo 11 runs on both Ubuntu Bionic and Focal and the ROS2 Dashing also runs on Ubuntu Bionic does it follow that Gazebo 11 can be used together with ROS2 Dashing? Is that supported?

A:

The official Gazebo version for Dashing (and Eloquent) is the LTS at the time they were released, i.e. Gazebo 9, as documented on REP 2000. That's what you'll get if you install ros-dashing-gazebo-ros-pkgs.
But there's no reason not to compile gazebo_ros_pkgs's dashing branch from source against Gazebo 11. If it doesn't work out of the box, it shouldn't be too much work to open a PR adding support. We could also consider shipping ros-dashing-gazebo11-ros-pkgs from https://packages.osrfoundation.org if there's enough interest.
As for Foxy, Gazebo 11 and Ignition Citadel will be the official versions.

I have the same problem with Gazebo11 and Eloquent. I tried building gazebo_ros_pkgs with branch ros2 and then with branch eloquent (in ros2.yaml) but both builds fail in gazebo_plugins/src/gazebo_ros_ray_sensor.cpp.
Edit: I found a workaround by reinstalling Ubuntu 18.04 and then explicitly installing gazebo9, sudo apt-get install gazebo9 and sudo apt-get install libgazebo9-dev.

@chapulina Where can I express the interest for ros-dashing-gazebo11-ros-pkgs?
