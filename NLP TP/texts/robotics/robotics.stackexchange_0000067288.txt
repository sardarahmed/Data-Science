Q:

What is the purpose of base_footprint?

What purpose does the base_footprint link serve?
I'm reading through the Gazebo simulation tutorial, and it instructs the user to create an infinitesimally small nearly weightless box which is linked to the base_link, but it doesn't explain what this is or what it's used for, nor does it link to any resources that do. I did see this similar question, but that answer doesn't really explain why such a link is used. Why does any part of ROS need to know how the model projects onto the ground?
Does every Gazebo model require this link?
Edit: I've noticed the joint linking the footprint to the base_link has an origin whose z component represents a fixed distance from the ground. What value do you use for a legged model that doesn't have a fixed distance from the ground?

A:

In addition to some empirical answers, there's a REP-120 that defines base_footprint link.
