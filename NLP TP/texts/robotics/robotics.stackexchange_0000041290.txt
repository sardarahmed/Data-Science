Q:

background subtraction of pointcloud

Is there any package for background subtraction of pointclouds?
I mean that "background subtraction" is the filter of pointcloud which doesn't change spatially compared with previous scene.
I want to use velodyne lider sensor, so I can't use depth image.
I know a PCL sample of this filter (http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/octree_change.php#octree-change-detection), and I can implement such package. However, if there is a filtering package, my implementation will come to nothing.
So I asked that anyone implemented such a package.

Please update your question rather than posting new answers on the same. It is more of good practice here for people who go through the answer later.

All right, I updated question.

A:

hi,
if you mean background subtraction as filtering then yes. PCL has filtering functions that you can use. But if you mean to subtract the table when u have objects of attention then there is no ready made package as such but you may go through the segmentation tutorial to get the cloud on top of the table and then process them. If you can specify what is the background in your case then we may be able to give a precise answer here.
Hope it helps!!!
