Q:

getting current angle and position from navigation stack

Is there anyway to get the current angle and x and position from the navigation stack the robot is at? Please note that all my code is in python.

A:

You can use TF to lookup the transform between your map origin and the robot. See the Using Published Transforms tutorial.

thanks that will help with solving a slight problem with my odometry node.

I also need a position/angle the robot will need to go to. Which msg should I subscribe to to get it.

Are you referring to the goal sent to move_base? That is done with either an action call, or on the topic move_base_simple/goal.

more along the lines of the results from the navigation stack, my robot at the moment uses servos for navigation and I am not quite comfortable with speed control by changing pulse frequencies. I need something like a postion stamped to get distance to travel and orientation
