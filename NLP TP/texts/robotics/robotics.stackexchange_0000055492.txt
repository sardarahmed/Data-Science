Q:

How does rqt_pose_view plugin work?

OK this might be trivial but I just can't get it to work.
When I enable the plugin in rqt, I can see the square and the 3 arrows in 3D, I can drag and move to see them from different angles, but, how do I connect it to my topic?
There doesn't seem to be a way to specify the topic name.

A:

Sorry about the long delay for this answer.
I updated the wiki page for this plugin to give a short introduction:
http://wiki.ros.org/rqt_pose_view
Basically it just displays the orientation part of a geometry_msgs/Pose message.
You have to drag and drop the topic onto it...
