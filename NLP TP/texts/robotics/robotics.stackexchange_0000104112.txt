Q:

Nav2 Cart/Shelf Pick

Just starting with Nav2, and curious if there is any example on picking carts after reaching pose from under without being detecting as obstacle ? (Was considering about retro-reflectors on carts)
Would appreciate any thoughts or suggestions !

A:

Most of the times I've seen this done, the robot uses the navigation stack to get "close" to the cart (usually a designated pose in front of the cart), and then uses a custom perception + control loop to actually "dock" with the cart.
There has been a long-standing ticket aimed at a more generic docking controller for Nav2 - but as of yet, no real progress. That ticket does have lots of resources around docking control algorithms (and pointers to some possible open source implementations that might be a starting point for you).
