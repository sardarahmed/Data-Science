Q:

ROS transform Turtlebot Kinect coordinates to gmapping world coordinates

Hello,
We are using gmapping to build our world. And we get the (x, y, z) coordinates from Kinect (PointCloud) by subscribing to the topic /camera/depth_registered/points.
We get the position of our Turtlebot by subscribing to the topic /move_base/feedback. The question is, if we get the Kinect (PointCloud) coordinates from a certain object, how do we tell the robot to go there? We know that you need to send a message to the topic /move_base_simple/goal, but how do we transform the coordinates from Kinect into "world coordinates" (the world that was build by using gmapping).
There is a similar problem in this topic - http://answers.ros.org/question/9506/how-to-transform-a-point-cloud-from-camera but I don't know what is the destination frame and how to use it?

A:

Have you read through the tf documentation ( http://ros.org/wiki/tf ), specifically the tutorials ( http://ros.org/wiki/tf/Tutorials )?
