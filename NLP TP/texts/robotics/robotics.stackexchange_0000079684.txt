Q:

Fail to run bebopś ROS driver as a node

Hi,
I have installed ROS Kenetic and build the workspace successfully and then installed the bebop ROS autonomy following installation steps from official bebop ROS webpage:
to use it with my bebop 1 of firmware 1.98.
But when I tried to run the ROS driver as steps listed in (bebop ROS installation) as a node or nodelet I get problems.
**Here is for example the Error I got when I tried to run it as a Node:
~/bebop_ws/src/bebop_autonomy/bebop_driver/launch $ roslaunch bebop_node.launch

... logging to /home/pi/.ros/log/90cd26b4-0d53-11e7-a150-37eec44f5503/roslaunch-raspberrypiDalia-9215.log
Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.
Press Ctrl-C to interrupt

Invalid <arg> tag: bebop_driver
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/kinetic/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/home/pi/bebop_ws/build/catkin_tools_prebuild

ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/kinetic/share. 

Arg xml is <arg default="$(find bebop_driver)/config/defaults.yaml" name="config_file"/>
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

** And here is the the Error I got when trying to run the driver as nodelet:
~/bebop_ws/src/bebop_autonomy/bebop_tools/launch $ roslaunch  bebop_nodelet_iv.launch

Iḿ aware that the bebop firmware should be at least 2.0.29 but I want to know if the problem that I get is because of the firmware or something else before I update the firmware.

It says "Invalid <arg>" in your first attempt to run the launch file, have you looked into that?

A:

Hello,
I hope it's not too late, when you open a new terminal you have to type:
$ source ~/bebop_ws/devel/setup.bash
Because the catkin workspace must be sourced before running the driver.

Thank you for your reply, yes it is too late however, maybe others can benefit. I was working on a project and needed a library to program and control my drone, I used another library later and it worked with me.
