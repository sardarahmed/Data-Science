Q:

Degree of Freedom

A robotic arm should pick a cuboid up of a table, rotate it around its vertical axis and put it down on all possible positions. How many degrees of freedom are at least necessary?
(All coordinates, that should be reached by the robotic arm, are in its workspace. It is not allowed to put the cuboid down and pick it up, once the robot has it )

The answer is  4 (3 translatory and 1 rotatory).

But I donâ€™t understand why. I thouhgt that it should be 3.
2 prismatic joints:  1 to pick the cuboid up,  and another one to move it anywhere on the table.
1 revolute joint to rotate the cuboid around its vertical axis. => 2 translatory and 1 rotatory. 

A:

The answer is four. The arm needs to be able to move up and down, left and right, forward and backward, and rotate. The robot will need 3 translatory degrees of freedom and 1 rotatory. 

A:

You specified that you need to be able to pick a cuboid up [off] a table(1 dof), rotate it around its vertical axis (1 dof), and put it down on all possible positions - assuming this means, "put it down at any (x,y) coordinate", then you need two more degrees of freedom - one for $x$, one for $y$. Note the implementation may vary - you could use Cartesian (x,y) actuators or you could use Polar (r,$\theta$), but whatever the combination you still wind up with two degrees of freedom.
