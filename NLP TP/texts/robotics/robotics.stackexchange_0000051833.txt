Q:

Add personal parameters at topic-subscriber callback

Is it possible to add a personal parameter (or more than 1) at the normal subscribe function?
..(for example passing an integer that i'd like to use in the callback)
how?

Glad to help! .....but,sincerely your comment is not completely clear: a small explanation of what you don't understand would be really appreciated ;-) Just have a look at boost::bind and tell us what is not clear.

i'm not a computer scientist and so not an expert of programming stuff: i read the documentation but is not clear (at least for me). i'd like to understand what this function does and how i can use it for my purposes

(i have to declare n subscriber (with a for cycle for instance) that writes the data in a vector (of size n)...so i have to pass an integer to the same callback to increment the position in the vector
