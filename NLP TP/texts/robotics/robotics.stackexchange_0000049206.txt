Q:

wstool init fails

I am trying to build catkin workspace following instructions.
mkdir -p  ~/overlay_ws
cd ~/overlay_ws
mkdir -p src
cd src
wstool init   

But it is failing with:
ubuntu:~/overlay_ws/src$ wstool init
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/wstool", line 63, in <module>
    sys.exit(wstool.wstool_cli.wstool_main(sys.argv))
  File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/wstool/wstool_cli.py", line 217, in wstool_main
    'info': cli.cmd_info,
AttributeError: WstoolCLI instance has no attribute 'cmd_info'

You should open an issue on the wstool issue tracker so that a better error message is displayed when this error occurs: https://github.com/vcstools/wstool/issues

A:

This looks like your version of wstool is the most recent, but rosinstall is not up-to-date. This can happen on Ubuntu in particular if you have an old version of rosinstall in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages. Remove anything named rosinstall* or vcstool* in there.
The syntax should be okay, though the added dot as kalectro suggest is also okay, so that might be a workaround. Still you should update.
