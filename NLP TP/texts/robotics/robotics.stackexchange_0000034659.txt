Q:

hector_slam under ROS electric

Has anyone tried to run hector_slam under ROS electric?
I got the error like below all the time..
{-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mkdir: cannot create directory `build': Permission denied
Does anybody have an idea about that?
Thanks!

A:

This most likely hasn't got anything to do with hector_slam but with the permissions you have set for the checked out svn directory. Are you sure that the user you're logged in with has the necessary permissions to create directories there?
