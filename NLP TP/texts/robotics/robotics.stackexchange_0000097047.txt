Q:

rviz2 does not show the images published on the topic

I echoed the topic of senor_images/Image and I see the image matrix on the terminal containing values but when use rviz2 to display this image, rviz2 does not show the image and shows this info on terminal:
INFO] [1599639372.778484561] [rviz]: Message Filter dropping message: frame 'head_camera1_rgb_optical_frame' at time 1599639371.222 for reason 'Unknown'
I see the topic on rviz2 but there is not image. Did anyone have this case before?
