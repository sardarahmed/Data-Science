Q:

roscd finds ros_gazebo_pkgs but rospack find don't

I have installed ROS Lunar in an Ubuntu 16.04.4.
I'm trying to find I package. With roscd I find it, but with rospack find don't.
user@MyPC:~$ roscd gazebo_ros_pkgs
user@MyPC:/opt/ros/lunar/share/gazebo_ros_pkgs$ rospack find gazebo_ros_pkgs
[rospack] Error: package 'gazebo_ros_pkgs' not found

I have tried with roscpp, and both find it:
user@MyPC:~$ roscd roscpp
user@MyPC:/opt/ros/lunar/share/roscpp$ rospack find roscpp
/opt/ros/lunar/share/roscpp

Is gazebo_ros_pkgs not installed properly?

A:

I think that the METAPACKAGE can be found with ROSCD but the rospack doesn't
i tried with the navigation METAPACKAGE , the result is the same.
