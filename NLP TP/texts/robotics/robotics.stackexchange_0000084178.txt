Q:

How to connect ROS(Ubuntu) with Unreal Engine(Windows)

Hey guys,
we implemented a ROS node which publishes messages(velocity, steering angle, ect.). We would like to subscribe this node in windows, so we can can use this data for our car in our unreal engine.
We tried it already with the Tutorial: wiki.ros.org/rosserial_windows/Tutorials/Hello World
but we couldnt receive any messages.
Greetings and thanks for your help.

Hi,
You could use this plugin with Unreal to communicate with ROS :

However, I can't certify this answer is valid since I haven't tested this plugin.
