Q:

Unknown controller type: 'robot_mechanism_controllers/JointTrajectoryActionController'

Hi All,
I am trying to get the robot_mechanism_controllers/JointTrajectoryActionController working as per the standard turtorial. However, when I try to run my RViz, the MoveIt! controller manager claims it cannot find such a controller:
[ INFO] [1411628617.460494704]: MoveitSimpleControllerManager: Added FollowJointTrajectory controller for arm_controller
[ERROR] [1411628617.460587145]: Unknown controller type: 'robot_mechanism_controllers/JointTrajectoryActionController'

What can be done about this?
Here is my controllers.yaml file. Note the FollowJointTrajectory controller works fine. Some of the parameters are out of tune but it doesn't make much sense to alter them yet until the actual controller plugin is working.
controller_list:
 - name: arm_controller
   action_ns: follow_joint_trajectory
   type: FollowJointTrajectory
   default: true
   joints:
     - waist
     - shoulder
     - elbow
     
 - name: r_arm_controller
   action_ns: joint_trajectory_action_controller
   type: "robot_mechanism_controllers/JointTrajectoryActionController"
   joints:
     - waist
     - shoulder
     - elbow
   gains:
     waist: {p: 1000.0, d: 6.0, i: 600.0, i_clamp: 4.0}
     shoulder: {p: 700.0, d: 4.0, i: 450, i_clamp: 4.0}
     elbow: {p: 300.0, d: 6.0, i: 300, i_clamp: 2.0}
   joint_trajectory_action_node:
     joints:
       - waist
       - shoulder
       - elbow
     constraints:
       goal_time: 10.0
       waist:
         goal: 0.02
       shoulder:
         goal: 0.02
       elbow:
         goal: 0.02

How do I get MoveIt! to 'see' the package? I have the package ros-hydro-robot-mechanism-controllers installed already, do I need to install something else?
Kind Regards
Bart

A:

I think it should be just "JointTrajectoryActionController", not "robot_mechanism_controllers/JointTrajectoryActionController".

I tried that, and the same type of error message comes up. Is there any way to list the types of controllers that are available?
