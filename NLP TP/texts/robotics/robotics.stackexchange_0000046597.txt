A:

It has never been released to Fuerte.
I looked around for documentation, which seems have gotten lost on the wiki, probably due to recent rosdoc changes for Groovy.
I found the source code here:
$ roslocate info xv_11_laser_driver
- git:
    local-name: cwru-ros-pkg
    uri: http://github.com/cwru-robotics/cwru-ros-pkg.git

The last update in that package was a year ago. So Fuerte support looks unlikely, unless no changes were required.
It is maintained by @Chad Rockey. If you contact him, he can probably help.
