Q:

Giant Log File Of Doooooooooooooooooooooooooooom

So after running repeated simulations, I end up with the file .gazebo/gzserver.log filling up all the hard drive space on my machine, mostly with the message
[1391718435 38765969] ODE body for link [body] does not exist, GetWorldLinearVel returns default of 0 0 0
[1391718435 38772755] ODE body for link [body] does not exist, GetWorldAngularVel returns default of 0 0 0

repeated over and over and over for 145GB. How can I get it to stop?
Gazebo multi-robot simulator, version 1.9.0

A:

This has been fixed in the Gazebo 2.x branch. It was gazebo issue 983. I've posted there a request to backport the fix to 1.9.
I just created a pull request to backport this fix.

By the way, this is my all-time favorite title of a gazebo answers post.
