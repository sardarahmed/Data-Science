What format is your 3D voxels?  How many voxels are you attempting to simulate?

hi, thx for answering. the voxel map is in binvox format http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~min/binvox/ and the  full map i would like to use is about 100.000 voxels

A:

Gazebo currently doesn't support 3d voxels. Feel free to create a ticket on bitbucket.
