Q:

"website may be down" error when i try sudo rosdep init

I used pip to install rosinstall on my mac (sudo pip install -U rosinstall).
This worked but every time I try to initiate it, the website doesn't connect. I tried disabling my firewall--still didn't work. When I go to the website at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/rosdep/sources.list.d/20-default.list, it doesn't seem to be down. I have macOS Catalina and my software is up to date.
Does anyone know how to get around this error?

Without seeing a verbatim copy-paste of the command and the error message, we cannot help you.
Additionally: the question title mentions rosdep, but the question text only states you've installed "rosinstall". Which of the two is it?

Did you try again some time later?
The website does occasionally go down for a couple hours here and there.

Yes, I did try again, and on multiple days

A:

The most common reason for this failure is that your ssl negotiations are failing. This can be caused by a lack of certificates on your system or your clock is out of tolerance for the ssl negotiations.
There's a lot of other questions related to this: https://www.google.com/search?q=website+may+be+down+rosdep
A few I found quickly are: https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/issues/9721 and https://answers.ros.org/question/316260/rosdep-init-cannot-download-default-sources/ Please try to look in to some of these other threads and edit your question with the outputs of the debugging that you do.
