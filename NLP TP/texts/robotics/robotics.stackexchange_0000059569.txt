Q:

MPU9150 On Hydro

Hello,
Had anyone had any luck getting the MPU9150 9-DOF chip to work well with ROS on the beagle bone black running Ubuntu and ROS Hydro? I'm aware of BB_ROS, but wanted to try to stick to running Ubuntu not Angstrom.
Thanks

A:

I haven't used it personally, but you should be able to check out the bb_mpu9150 package from github https://github.com/vmayoral/bb_mpu9150 and build it on Ubuntu with Hydro.
Note that that node is publishing the IMU information as a std_msgs/String instead of as a sensor_msgs/Imu message; you'll probably need to upgrade it to sensor_msgs/Imu if you want to use it with other ROS nodes that make use of IMU data.
