Q:

Pcl ros image extraction

I have extracted an object of interest using Euclidean Cluster Extraction in PCL. I would now like to extract the corresponding object in a 2D image that has been saved simultaneously. Are there any tools available in ros/pcl that can be used to do this?

A:

PCL has tools to generate an image from the point cloud directly (basic or range image), however not for dealing with two parallel objects. The above links will work if you're willing to take a hit in quality, but if you want to work with the original RGB image, you'll have to do some manual calculations.
You could project the pointcloud onto a plane representing the rectified* image, and use the points to mark which pixels you want to 'keep'. Or just project the bounding box and.
