Q:

Are zero-copy services possible (nodelet + rosservice)?

With nodelets you can have zero-copy message passing via shared pointers. Is there a mechanism to do the same with services? Will data be copied running ros::ServiceClient::call() if both service client and service server are nodelets on the same manager?

I don't believe this has been implemented.

Where should this feature be requested? I believe this is important and would like to know if there's any challenge in implementing this.

You can request it on ros_comm on github. But it will probably be an untargeted enhancement, if you want it soon a pull-request will probably be necessary.

did anything change in that regard in the last few years?
