Q:

openni_launch + USB 3.0 not working?

Hi guys,
Has anyone noticed that when you plug your Kinect to a USB 3.0 port "roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch" seems to be successful but there is no data published in any of the camera topics?
This happens to me with:
Ubuntu 12.04 64bit + Fuerte on Desktop PC
Ubuntu 12.04 64bit + Fuerte on Notebook PC (ASUS U24E)
Ubuntu 11.10 64bit + Electric on Notebook PC (ASUS U24E)

If I plug the Kinect to a USB 2.0 port on any of the previous combinations, it works correctly (though it is still a bit buggy on Ubuntu 12.04 + Fuerte).
Has anyone had the same issue? Any way to get it working on USB 3.0?
Thanks in advance.
