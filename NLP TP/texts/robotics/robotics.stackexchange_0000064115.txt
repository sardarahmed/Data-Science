Q:

What will happen if a 'roscore' has already been run when I run a launch file?

What will happen if a roscore has already been run when I run a launch file?
Does the roslaunch override the old roscore?

A:

Nothing spectacular: roslaunch will detect that a roscore instance is already running and use that (instead of starting a new one).
From the roscore wiki page:

NOTE: If you use roslaunch, it will automatically start roscore if it detects that it is not already running.
