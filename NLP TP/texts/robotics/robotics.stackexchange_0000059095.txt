Q:

Can I add dependencies after using catkin_create_pkg?

I used first
catkin_init_workspace

and thereafter
catking_create_pkg example1 roscpp rospy std_msgs

and building a simple example file works flawlessly.
Now if I run
catkin_create_pkg example2

without specifying dependencies, it doesn't work, even though I edited the package.xml and imported exactly the same source code. The reason I want to do this, is I need to move some source code from Fuerte to Hydro, and I'd rather just copy the <build_depend> tags from one xml file to the other. But it doens't work.

What doesn't work?

A:

Turns out I need to add dependencies in CMakelist also, and I had not seen the one at the top
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
roscpp
rospy
std_msgs
)

This looks like CMakeLists.txt, not package.xml.
