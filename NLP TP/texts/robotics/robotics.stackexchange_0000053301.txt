Q:

error with rviz and .vcg file

this is the error when following the "Building a Visual Robot Model with URDF from Scratch" tutorial with the command:
$ roslaunch urdf_tutorial display.launch model:=01-myfirst.urdf.
ERROR: the config file '/opt/ros/groovy/stacks/robot_model_tutorials/urdf_tutorial/urdf.vcg' is a .vcg file, which is the old rviz config format.
       New config files have a .rviz extension and use YAML formatting.  The format changed
       between Fuerte and Groovy.  There is not (yet) an automated conversion program.
[rviz-3] process has died [pid 7228, exit code 1, cmd /opt/ros/groovy/lib/rviz/rviz -d /opt/ros/groovy/stacks/robot_model_tutorials/urdf_tutorial/urdf.vcg __name:=rviz __log:=/home/jaysin/.ros/log/4bfd76c6-fce3-11e2-9283-902b344ab2c8/rviz-3.log].

A:

As the error message states, the RViz configuration format has changed.
As from the URDF tutorial sources that has already been fixed three months ago.
Where do you cloned your urdf_tutorial package from? And when, is it up to date? Try a git pull. Did you checked out another branch or something?

i entered the command : rosdep install urdf_tutorial
i have both urdf.rviz and urdf.vcg in it just like on the github

And which one is linked within in display.launch? As from the commit that should be urdf.rviz.
