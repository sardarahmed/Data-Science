Q:

ZED_wrapper_node launch is not working

Hello. I installed the zed-wrapper from http://wiki.ros.org/zed-ros-wrapper .
All set up was seems okay, the launch is not working on.
(Regarding the server below, I replaced as *. )
nvidia@tegra-ubuntu:~/jetsonbot$ roslaunch zed_wrapper zed.launch

well, judging from your Output, the node hasn't been built properly. Have there been any Errors during compilation? Otherwise, check the Output of find /home/nvidia/jetsonbot/devel -iname *zed*. If the node is not there, there has been a Problem.

Thank you for your commend, the catkin_make was not built properly, Now  I can access the zed node. Thank you.
