Q:

Why can't I install usb-cam package at RPI3?

Hello,
I have installed Raspbian Stretch at my RPi3 and the ros_comm for the ROS Kinetic package (since it was the recommended one from the ros wiki). However, when I try to install any package  the message I receive is "E: unable to locate package" . For example, I type at the terminal "sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-usb-cam" and the message I receive is the above. Any suggestions about what I am doing wrong?

Update:
I have followed the instructions from this site:
$ rosinstall_generator ros_comm --rosdistro kinetic --deps --wet-only --tar > kinetic-ros_comm-wet.rosinstall 
$ wstool init src kinetic-ros_comm-wet.rosinstall

Can you detail exactly which ros_comm package you have installed? What is the exact package name?
I'm wondering whether you're running into wiki/UpstreamPackages.

I am dealing with the same problem. Could you find any solution?

@lusim: which problem? The two answers already explain that if you've installed ROS from sources, you cannot use apt-get as the OP tries to do. One of the answers then goes on to detail how to start installing a pkg from sources (but the description is incomplete, see #q252478). If you're ..

.. experiencing specific problems with locating or building the pkg you're trying to install, please post a new question.

ok thank you. But is there another way to install ROS on a Raspberry Pi 3? I already tried some ways to install it but installing it from source was the only thing working for me. Having an alternative installation of ROS would actually solve the described problem.

Unfortunately I'm not an RPi user, so I can't really suggest anything.
Binary pkgs for ARM architectures are built for ARMv7 (hard-float) Ubuntu and ARMv8 Debian and Ubuntu. Perhaps that is something you can work with.

A:

If you installed everything from source, then you cannot use apt to install new packages.
You'll have to create an overlay workspace, place the sources of the new package in your new workspace, source your old workspace and then build your new workspace.
