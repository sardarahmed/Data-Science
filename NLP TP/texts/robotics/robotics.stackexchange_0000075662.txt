Q:

rqt gui plugin cpp save and restore settings

Hi,
I am in the process of writing a plugin for rqt in C++ (yes, I did read the note that highly recommended writing in python) but I have other reasons for writing this in C++.
I'm using the rqt_image_view plugin as a reference. I noticed a couple of functions saveSettings and restoreSettings. The former saves all current values from the GUI into a qt_gui_cpp::Settings object and the latter sets the GUI with values from a Settings object.
I am not sure why these particular functions would be called? I tracked it back to the plugin_bridge.cpp file in the qt_gui_cpp. I'm still not sure as a plugin developer, for rqt, why would I need these functions - what state am I trying to save and restore?
Thanks.

A:

I've written a good amount of rqt tutorials but just realized that there's not much info on these 2 methods.
When you run a GUI, close, and re-open, a lot of times you want to resume the configuration from the last run (e.g. value in the pulldown menu, pane size etc.) In these 2 methods you can specify what components restore the config from the last run (in other words, no config gets restored unless defined in these 2 methods, and the GUI always start with default config).

What do you mean by "the next run"? Where are the parameters stored in between runs. Does the software close and restart between runs? Thanks
