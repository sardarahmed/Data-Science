Q:

How do I get ROS to work on Chakra?

I tried to install ROS on Chakra Linux.
Following the installation instructions of http://www.ros.org/wiki/electric/Installation/Arch it aborted the installation because it didnÂ´t detect the os. So I had to add -n for the desktop-full installation to get it work.
Now, whenever I try to use rosdep install it keeps saying:
rosdep ABORTING.  Failed to detect OS: Could not detect OS, tried ['rosdep_test_os', 'debian', 'ubuntu', 'ubuntu', 'opensuse', 'fedora', 'rhel', 'arch', 'osx', 'osxbrew', 'gentoo', 'cygwin', 'freebsd'].
How can I manually tell it, that the os is arch and make it install the necessary dependencies?
Additional info: I am using Linux 3.5.6-1-CHAKRA 64bit (Archimedes)
I hope someone can help me with this problem..

Chakra Linux is based on Arch Linux.. see http://chakra-project.org/ (you can find some more information under "About Chakra")

A:

ROS_OS_OVERRIDE is likely what you need: http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/EnvironmentVariables#ROS_OS_OVERRIDE
