Q:

Data type for yaw angle and barometer height

I am searching for a data type that can be used to publish yaw angle  and barometer height message. Like, for laser scan data we have sensor_msgs::LaserScan scan, what about for yaw angle and barometer height?

A:

Is there any particular reason you wouldn't like to create your own message type? Create a file, say Yaw_Alt.msg in msg folder of your package and fill it with:
time time
float32 yaw
float32 altBaro

Then read here for further instructions. Generally you'll need to add / uncomment genmsg() in your CMakeLists.txt. The message will be generated when you call make (rosmake) on the package. You will find generated header files under msg_gen.
