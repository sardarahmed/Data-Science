Q:

How can I add a floorplan image in rviz?

I would like to be able to add a floorplan image in rviz simply to debug localization. My map is feature-based, so the image would have no other purpose than to make visualization richer.
Is it possible to obtain a result similar to what is observed with the DisplayTypes/Map without having to publish nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid messages? If not, could anyone give me any pointers as to how I would be able to write such a rviz plugin myself?

This appears to be related to this question
I suppose you could publish a rviz display marker  with a custom texture.

This looks like it could work. I will try that and accept your answer if I have good results.
