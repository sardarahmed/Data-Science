Q:

Is the crazyflie control board considered a microcontroller

I am currently doing a project for school and we are told that we must use a micro controller that ends up controlling some external hardware, now i know the crazyflie is controlling the motors which counts as external hardware but is it a micro controller? My second question is i want to purchase the kit so i can assembly it myself however I saw that you can use an expansion board so you need not solder and also i plan on not buying a remote its possible to control the crazyflie via my iPhone correct? I would appreciate it if someone could answer my questions. Thank you in advance

A:

It sounds like your school intends for you to program the microcontroller, in which case the crazyflie -- an off-the-shelf product -- would not be sufficient.
