Q:

openni tracker not producing any output

I am trying to run the openni_tracker node to duplicate the results from the wiki
http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_tracker  although the openni_tracker node just isn't producing any output.  Here is a log from running openni_tracker (openni_tracker.xml set to log info-level messages to screen.)  It looks like openni_tracker is detecting users, but it is not publishing any data or displaying any images.  rostopic -list just returns /rosout and /rossout_agg.
I have visualized Kinect point cloud data in rviz with openni_launch, so I doubt that this is a hardware problem.  Does anyone have ideas on why openni_tracker is not publishing any data?  I'd really appreciate any help in figuring this out!

A:

Starting openni.launch in the openni package should be responsible for creating the links between the kinect and your map/fixed frame (maybe you have to ajjust the tf-frames to your scenario). To track the human, you should additionally start the openni_tracker. It should output if a User is detected and instructions about the calibration step (to calibrate the tracker, the user has to do the Phi-pose). As soon as the calibration was successful, the skelleton joints are posted on tf... (Very often, calibration fails, in this case, donÂ´t worry, just do the Phi-pose again..)

FYI for anyone reading, the Psi pose doesn't appear to be necessary. (Maybe this was once the case but is no longer). It should pick you up immediately.

What this answer doesn't mention is that to visualize in RViz you need to select /openni_depth_frame as your Fixed Frame.
