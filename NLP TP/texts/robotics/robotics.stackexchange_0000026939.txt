Have you run catkin_make in that workspace before launching?

A:

This indicates some kind of problem with your workspace setup. Either your "MYROBOT_gazebo" package could not be found, or your "MYROBOT_gazebo" package could be found, but not the "MYROBOT.launch" launch file inside it. To find out what is happening, you can try
roscd MYROBOT_gazebo

If get a "no such package/stack" error, the package could not be found.

@Stefan Kohlbrecher Thanks very much for your help. God bless you. I tried the command " roscd MYROBOT_gazebo " & I found the error that you mentioned ( roscd: No such package/stack 'MYROBOT_gazebo' ) . what should I do if the package are not found? Should I remove the catkin_WS & then recreate it & recreate the package?

This means you either made a mistake when following the tutorial, or there is an error in the tutorial. IÂ´d suggest re-doing the tutorial and taking extra care not to miss anything. Hopefully that solves the problem, otherwise report back. Note that MYROBOT_gazebo should be replaced with your own package name, for example "eman_robot_gazebo". It seems the tutorial also requires some basic knowledge of how catkin and ROS work.
