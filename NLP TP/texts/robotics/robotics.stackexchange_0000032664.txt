Q:

openni_camera glibc error

I am using ROS on Ubuntu 10.04, and the command "roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch" has suddenly started to give me an error. Is there a way to fix this?
robot@peoplebot2:~$ roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch

I have followed dornhege's advice from the comments in the answer by fergs. When I only use the command "roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch", it runs correctly. However, when I try to use other packages that require the openni_camera, such as rviz or openni_tracker, this new error occurs. Does anyone have an idea for fixing it?
