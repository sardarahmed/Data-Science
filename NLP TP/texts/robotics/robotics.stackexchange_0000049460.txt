Hmmm... I read the C++ code in the link but it contains only a Class TurtlebotTeleop which is not doing the autonomous navigation and object searching. Not the right code...

i read the report ,, it depends on measure the max distance from the sensors and the kinect to determine the way to exit from enclosure ,, when press Up keyboard key it begins to circlinig to calculate the max distance and begin to move ,, but still rosmake the pack give me errors in matcher.h code

Hi chik, Turtlebot Teleop is the wrapper main class used in the project. The report describes the algorithm (in simple its a state-machine implementation), checking different conditions. The matcher.h has to do with ros distribution (esp. opencv), as the project is developed under ros-electric.
