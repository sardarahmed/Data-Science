Q:

Cleaning up when moving a stack/package to a different directory so rosmake won't complain

Background: I just had some difficulty rebuilding a stack (openni) after copying it to a new directory, and the failures were due to the old path being cached somehow, even when using rosmake --pre-clean. The solution seems to have been to do 'make wipe' in the affected packages. Is there something like rosmake --wipe? Was there a better way to do this?
(edit: question title was originally "Should I always use rosmake or can I use make sometimes?" but I went on a bit of a tangent in the body. The new title is a bit better I think.)

A:

I think you want:
find -name CMakeCache.txt -delete
I'm guessing it is the cmake generated makefiles that are problematic (they don't like being moved around).  The missing CMakeCache.txt will force regeneration.
