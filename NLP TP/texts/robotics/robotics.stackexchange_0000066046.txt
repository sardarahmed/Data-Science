Q:

which rosserial to use?

Hi all,
based on this question: http://answers.ros.org/question/196204/unable-to-sync-with-device-arduino-uno/, I wonder which one should be installed and used:

ros-indigo-rosserial (and everything
relates to it) or
the one from the rosserial
repository, under
indigo-devel branch

Thanks.

A:

If you are using ROS Indigo, either one of the ones you mentioned should work fine.
I installed ros-indigo-rosserial via apt-get and it works flawlessly.
