Q:

RoS and OSX issues: No handlers could be found for logger "roslaunch"

Hello,
I'm new to RoS, I'm installing it on my OSX machine (following http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/OSX/Homebrew/Source) and I have been having various issues during the setup, however I managed to make it compile successfully. However, now when I try to run the core it's giving me the following error:
Cesare:~ cesare$ roscore 
WARNING: unable to configure logging. No log files will be generated
Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.
Press Ctrl-C to interrupt

Invalid <param> tag: Cannot load command parameter [rosversion]: command [rosversion roslaunch] returned with code [1]. 

Param xml is <param command="rosversion roslaunch" name="rosversion"/>
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file
No handlers could be found for logger "roslaunch"

Here is my Env
Cesare:~ cesare$ env | grep ROS
ROS_ROOT=/opt/ros/indigo/share/ros
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/opt/ros/indigo/share:/opt/ros/indigo/stacks
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
ROSLISP_PACKAGE_DIRECTORIES=
ROS_DISTRO=indigo
ROS_ETC_DIR=/opt/ros/indigo/etc/ros

Do you have any clue about what have I done wrong ?
Thank you

A:

The key error here is command [rosversion roslaunch] returned with code [1]
What are the results if you run rosversion roslaunch ?
I most commonly see this error when users haven't sourced the setup.bash for their ROS installation.

I've added source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash into my .bashrc, any other check I can run ? I added my env to the answer
