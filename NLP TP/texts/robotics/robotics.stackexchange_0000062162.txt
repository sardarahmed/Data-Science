Q:

Setting up wireless connection b/w Parrot drone and GCS

I have set up Odroid-U3 board with a WiFi module running ROS
I would like to maintain wireless contact with the drone from my computer
What command will enable me to do so?

A:

Creating this contact is completely unrelated from ROS.
The drone hosts its own WiFi-Network, which you have to connect to. Once this is done, you should read the documentation from here. Also, have a look into this tutorial. It might not be completly compatible with the current AR-Drone-Driver, but when you use the virtual machine everythink should work. Nonetheless, it is a great introduction to accessing and programming the drone with ROS.
Good Luck!

Hi Rabe
I am using the Parrot Drone with Pixhawk controller (PX4FMU + PX4IAOR) and that's the reason for using WiFi module with the drone
I believe $ssh command would do

Oh, my bad, I was assuming you were going to use the ROS-Package. AFAIK there should be a Telnet port open on the drone, I think it was port number 21.

The drone doesn't use any of Parrot central unit, but only its frame, motors and ESC
I need to view the 3D map from the Structure Sensor
connected with the ODROID-U3 board
How do I achieve it
