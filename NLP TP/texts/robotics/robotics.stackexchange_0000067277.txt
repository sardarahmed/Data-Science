A:

Just copy paste one answer from stackoverflow. Cannot find the original link.
I've changed the line in the src/rgbdslam_v2/CMakeLists.txt to the following:
SET(LIBS_LINK GL GLU cholmod /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcxsparse.so.3.1.2
#/usr/lib/libcxsparse.so.2.2.3
${G2O_LIBRARIES} ${QT_LIBRARIES} ${QT_QTOPENGL_LIBRARY} ${GLUT_LIBRARY} ${OPENGL_LIBRARY} ${OpenCV_LIBS})
And the package compiled. I guess author haven't made a proper cmake search module for it just yet.
The version of libcxsparse on my 14.04 machine is 3.1.2, and it is in folder /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu, change the path and it will compile.
