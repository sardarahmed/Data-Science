Q:

compilation problem in rosjava (master branch)

I'm following this tutorial http://wiki.ros.org/rosjava/Tutorials/hydro/Source%20Installation and I'm getting these compilation errors: http://pastebin.com/LV31s8g0 after issuing catkin_make
can anyone help ?

A:

There was a recent commit in master for this that is probably causing the problems. You might like to follow this up there: https://github.com/rosjava/rosjava_bootstrap/pull/19/.
Master is also pretty volatile. Been hard to manage/maintain it so that the various build workflows stay working. Unless you're experimenting with the rosjava code (and know well what you're doing), hydro is a better choice to base your own development on.

Thanks Daniel. the only reason that I've tried to work with the master build, is that when I've used the hydro build, and then went on to compile android_apps (after it compiles with catkin_make) - I've tried to import the project into android studio, and started getting errors

If you have errors with the hydro build, post some issues on github. I can remedy them much faster in hydro than master. Recently there was an android studio upgrade - that may have been your source of errors. I'll be going through the pull requests up on github now to fix them early this week.
