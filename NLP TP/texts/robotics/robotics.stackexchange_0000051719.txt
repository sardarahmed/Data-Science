Q:

Place operation times out

Good afternoon,
I was trying to use the pick_place_tutorial tutorial, in pr2_moveit_tutorials, and I am able to pick the object successfully, but the place operation always times out. I don't know why this is happening. Has anyone had a similar problem before?
[ WARN] [1370458323.163467101, 1184.034000000]: Fail: ABORTED: Timeout reached
If you need any more information just ask for it please.
Thank you,
Tiago Pimentel

I figured it out, the computer was just really slow, but if I change the position of the pole in 0.05 m.u. forward it can plan correctly.
Change line:
co.primitive_poses[0].position.x = 0.7;
for this:
co.primitive_poses[0].position.x = 0.75;
Have a great day,

I would suggest posting this to the MoveIt! mailing list, as there is quite a bit of activity over there

Thanks, I posted the question there already, but I found the answer by myself, I'll just edit the question with it.
