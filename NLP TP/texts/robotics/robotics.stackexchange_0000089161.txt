Q:

Documentation for recovery behaviors in move_base

I am looking for documentation or research material on recovery_behaviors in move_base, if such thing is available as I couldn't find any. I am assuming someone must have published something.

Thanks, Well recovery behaviors are kind of stupid so I guess I shouldn't expect any publication on that.
