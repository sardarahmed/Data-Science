Q:

How to make 4 wheeled robot work with DiffDrive plugin and ROS2 Control?

I have a 4 wheeled robot with mecanum wheels (in real life), I have been able to simulate it and get it to work with the ROS2 DiffDrive plugin (replicating the skid steer plugin from ROS1) but now that I want to implement ROS2 Control with it I cannot get it to work. I have been following the Articubot tutorials but his robot only has 2 wheels. I can't find anything online regarding a 4 wheeled robot that would make use of the DiffDrive plugin on ROS2 while using ROS2 Control. At the moment My aim is to only simulate the robot in gazebo so that I can better understand how ROS2 control works but I am stuck.

I hope the question is clear.
Some guidance on how to make ROS2 Control work with this robot with be very much appreciated. Thanks

A:

There is currently no ros2_controller supporting omniwheels. If it has standard wheels, use the diff_drive controller as in this demo. Consider the wheels_per_side parameter.
