Q:

is it possible to get all possible solutions of inverse kinematics of a 6 DOF arm?

I would like to know if there is any way to get all the possible solutions of inverse kinematics of a 6 DOF robotic arm?
I have found some good Matlab codes but gives only one solution like in Peter corke's book .
Thank you in advance. 

A:

I suggest you look at Craig's book Introduction to Robotics Mechanics and Control.  In the inverse kinematics chapter he addresses the multiple closed-form solutions obtained analytically.  Many other texts address this issue also.  
In general, if the wrist is spherical (i.e., all three axes intersect), you can enumerate all of the various closed-form solutions through a method known as wrist partitioning.   This method uses the three arm joints to solve for the position of the wrist center.  It then uses the wrist joints to determine the joint angles which orient the end effector properly.  Multiple solutions are possible from "wrist up" and "wrist down" options, "elbow up" and "elbow down" options (for an articulated arm), and "over the shoulder" options also.   For other robot geometries the options would differ.  
If the wrist is not spherical, it becomes quite challenging to find a closed-form inverse solution.   But you still have the various geometric options for inverse kinematics solutions.  
One way to make sure you are identifying all of the solutions is to recall the fundamentals of trigonometry.   Recall that $\sin(\theta) = -\sin( - \theta)$ and $\cos(\theta) = \cos( - \theta)$.  So when you are solving for $\theta$ you have to consider the other angles which produce the same result using these and other trigonometric identities.
