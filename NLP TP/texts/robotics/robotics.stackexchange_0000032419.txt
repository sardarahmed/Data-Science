Q:

ROS Answers Search Bar Broken?

At the risk of sounding foolish, is the ROS answers search bar broken?  It doesn't seem to operate at all like your traditional search bar, and as such I've found the site to be of very limited use.  For example, if you search for "dsp" it does not return any results, even though I'm sure this word is in a posted question and is also a tag.
i.e. http://answers.ros.org/question/1183/real-time-digital-signal-processing-dsp-library
P.S. I've also tried searching for "ROS" and it has shown no results, but maybe this search term was purposefully removed.

A:

I assume there is a minimum search length, searching for other three letter words also did not return anything. Searching e.g. for "rviz" works, as does for "roscpp" or "eigen". If that's the case, then it is indeed restricting the search functionality as three-letter acronyms are not that uncommon.
