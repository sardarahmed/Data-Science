Did you install ROS following the instructions in http://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Installation/Ubuntu?
Comment by gustavo.velascoh on 2014-01-30:
The command should be `$ sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-ros-tutorialsÂ´

gustavo.velascoh thank you very much for your great help and I could really solve my problem with the help of gustavo.velascoh you are all very friendly. good evening

A:

When replacing <distro> with the name of your distribution, the angle brackets typically delimit the thing to be replaced, and should be removed in the final command. Thus, you should be running:
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-ros-tutorials
