Q:

Connecting laser scanner and pose messages

How to connect laser scanner and pose messages considering I have underlying timestamp? It is by using TF? Do I need to code explicitly in my source code or just by configure TF in rviz? My goal is actually to build a point cloud using these 2 messages.

A:

ROS contains functionality for converting LaserScans into PointClouds. Those functions are located in the laser_geometry package. The function transformLaserScanToPointCloud() takes in a LaserScan, a tfListener, and a desired frame_id and converts that LaserScan into a PointCloud in that frame.
