Q:

Cannot import custom rosmsg (actionlib)

Hi,
I have very strange problem related to my custom action msg. I compiled my msg, but I can't import it. When I try to run my py action server I am getting next error:

raceback (most recent call last):
File
"/home/ivan/infocom_robotics_ws/src/dock_station_goal/src/turn_for_specific_angle_server.py",
line 5, in 
from dock_station_goal.msg import DoTurnAction, DoTurnFeedback,
DoTurnResult ImportError: No module
named msg

But I can at the same time I can find my msg with: rosmsg list | grep DoTurn

ivan@ivan-desktop:~$ rosmsg list |
grep DoTurn

dock_station_goal/DoTurnAction
dock_station_goal/DoTurnActionFeedback
dock_station_goal/DoTurnActionGoal
dock_station_goal/DoTurnActionResult
dock_station_goal/DoTurnFeedback
dock_station_goal/DoTurnGoal
dock_station_goal/DoTurnResult
ivan@ivan-desktop:~$

Another strange thing is that when I am checking: rosmsg packages, the pkgs with my custom msgs are doubled:

ivan@ivan-desktop:~$ rosmsg packages

actionlib actionlib_msgs
actionlib_tutorials base_local_planner
beginner_tutorials beginner_tutorials
bond control_msgs costmap_2d
diagnostic_msgs
dock_station_goal dock_station_goal
dynamic_reconfigure
geometry_msgs map_msgs move_base_msgs
nav_msgs realsense2_camera robot_drive
roscpp
rosgraph_msgs rospy_tutorials
rosserial_msgs sensor_msgs shape_msgs
smach_msgs std_msgs stereo_msgs tf
tf2_msgs trajectory_msgs
turtle_actionlib turtlebot3_msgs
turtlebot_msgs turtlesim
visualization_msgs

You can see that beginner_tutorials and dock_station_goal are doubled
I am stack and getting crazy((( Can somebody help me?
Thank you!
EDIT
I am using catkin_make, the output of $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH is:
/home/ivan/infocom_robotics_ws/src:/opt/ros/melodic/share
And my Cmake list is:

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)
project(dock_station_goal)
find_package(catkin REQUIRED
COMPONENTS   message_generation
actionlib   actionlib_msgs
move_base_msgs   roscpp   rospy
std_msgs   genmsg )
add_action_files(   DIRECTORY   action
FILES   DoDocking.action
DoTurn.action )
generate_messages(   DEPENDENCIES
std_msgs   actionlib_msgs )
catkin_package(   LIBRARIES
dock_station_goal   CATKIN_DEPENDS
move_base_msgs roscpp rospy std_msgs
actionlib_msgs   DEPENDS system_lib
DEPENDS message_runtime )
include_directories(
${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS} )

Another weird thing is that I can import my msg from /home/usr/my_ws by running python! But I cant import from my_pkg/src

Could you please edit your post and provide the following information:

the CMakeLists.txt of your package (remove all comments, though),
the build tool you use (catkin_make or  catkin_tools / catkin build)
the output of echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
if possible, a link to your package source code (GitHub or similar)

@mgruhler I edited my post
Unfortunately I don't have this project on a github

A:

Sorry, it was my fail. I had the file with the same name as pkg in that folder and didn't notice that. Thank you for the response.
I will delete the question

I've undeleted your question, as it is a valid question.
The fact that it has a "trivial" answer does not change this.
I've also accepted your comment as the answer.
