Q:

Is there a Clearpath Husky simulator for Jade?

I have installed ROS (jade) in ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS.
I was going through the Clearpath tutorials to better understand ROS. Clearpath has done a great job. I was following the instructions in "ROS 101: Drive a Husky" tutorial. The instructions said to run the following two commands:
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-husky-desktop
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-husky-simulator
I replaced "indigo" with "jade" to match the package I have installed.
The install cound not fine the packages.
"E: Unable to locate package ros-jade-husky-desktop"
and
"E: Unable to locate package ros-jade-husky-simulator".
Did I make a mistake or does these packages not exist for jade? I there anything I can do to resolve this problem? Thank You.

A:

It seem like no.
At wiki page, there is no jade tab. Also in github repo, there seems no jade branch.
And finally, you can check debbuild page for jade in the future for state of necessary packages.
Maybe you should wait a little.
