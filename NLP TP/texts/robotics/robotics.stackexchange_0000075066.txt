Q:

Is a catkin package a node?

Hello I am very new to ROS. I did most of the tutorials but have some questions still. This question: Is a catkin package a node?
More in-depth: So I have my catkin workspace and within that workspace I can have multiple packages. Is each package supposed to be a node? or are there multiple nodes within one package? I guess I'm asking what is the standard layout of the catkin workspace? Sorry for such a primitive question and thanks for the help! :)

A:

A catkin package is not a node.
A package may contain multiple nodes. Usually, developers use packages to group nodes together when those nodes share a significant amount of code or have a similar purpose.
