A:

Sometimes ROS doesn't always find newly added packages. From the root of your workspace, try running
rospack profile

and see if that helps by running
rospack find 

or any command that failed earlier.

Edit:
I can confirm that (at least for me) that this method works. I just installed a new package and it was not found by ROS using the tab auto-complete. I followed the instructions in this answer and now tab auto-complete works.
