Q:

problem with running rgbdslamV2

My computer configuration: a quad-core CPU with 4GB of memory.
When I run rgbdslamV2,  Memory usage reaches 100%。
How can I do to reduce memory usage? Or I must extend memory？

I suppose rgdbslam is not very memory efficient. In my experiments I switched from 16 to 32 GB.

Thank you for your answer!

A:

Hope it's not too late for some tuning advise. If you don't need the point cloud map increase the cloud_creation_skip_step to a higher power of two. If you do not have fast motions increase data_skip_step.
You could also experiment with the options create_cloud_every_nth_node and store_pointclouds, but I suspect that they don't work anymore.
