Q:

Quadcopter Roll, Pitch Fluctuation

For my quadcopter, i turn on the quadcopter while letting it stable on the ground. But i see that the Roll, Pitch fluctuate with the max difference being 15 degree. When i protect the sensor with soft material, then i observe the max difference is around 6 degree. Is this fluctuation for the quadcopter? By the way, i use complementary filter and DCM with scaling factor being 0.8 gyro and 0.2 accel
Thanks in advance!

Very nice question , 
Kindly check EMF and make sure to isolate the MPU9150 from any EMF and Make sure that it's temperature is Stable and change in the temperature will lead to huge drift in reading regardless the filter you are using
