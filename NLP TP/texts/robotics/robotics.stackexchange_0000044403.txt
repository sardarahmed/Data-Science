Does anybody have any idea of what to do to fix this problem?

A:

You get a warning from the linker:
ld: warning: in /usr/lib/libwx_macud-2.8.dylib, missing required architecture x86_64 in file

Which means that you are building 64-bit, but that library is not built for 64-bit.  If that is the case it might contain the undefined symbols which appear later in the error message.
How did you install wxPython?  The recommended method is using a binary from wxPython's website.

Yes that is how i installed it.
I looked into the wxPython again and found I'd installed the 32bit version only because I had Python 2.6. I've now installed Python 2.7 and a new wxPython however when I run CMake it says:
Unable to find either executable 'empy' or Python module 'em'...

You'll need to install empy (sudo pip install empy)
Comment by heyfred on 2012-09-28:
It was complaining about empy because it was installed in the Python2.6 folder instead of the python 2.7.
I've fixed that and I'm still getting the same problem. I also reinstalled wxPython from the link in the wiki page. Any other suggestions?
