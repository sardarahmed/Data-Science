What is exactly the problem? There are some build warnings but nothing critical. I would recommend to install ogre support.
Comment by Mohsen Hk on 2013-03-13:
tnx :) do you have any direct link to0 install ogre?
Comment by iche033 on 2013-03-14:
looks like you are running 1.4, so see the Compiling from Source section on this page: http://gazebosim.org/wiki/1.4/install
