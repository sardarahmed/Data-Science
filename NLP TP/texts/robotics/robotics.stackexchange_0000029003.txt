Q:

Is it possible to directly use a model from ignitionrobotics.org in gazebo9?

I want to include in a gazebo9 world file a model that is available in  ignitionrobotics.org  using only the link generated in the website, is it possible?
Something like:
<include>
      <uri>
      https://fuel.ignitionrobotics.org/1.0/OpenRobotics/models/hatch
      </uri>
</include>
<include>
      <uri>
      https://fuel.ignitionrobotics.org/1.0/OpenRobotics/models/Survivor Female
      </uri>
</include>

When I do this I get the error:
[Err] [FuelModelDatabase.cc:255] Unable to download model[https://fuel.ignitionrobotics.org/1.0/OpenRobotics/models/hatch]
[Wrn] [SystemPaths.cc:464] File or path does not exist [""] [https://fuel.ignitionrobotics.org/1.0/OpenRobotics/models/hatch]

A:

Hello,
If you check the dependencies of gazebo9 with sudo apt-cache showpkg gazebo9. There is no dependencies of ignition-fuel-tools. You will need to compile this from sources.
There is a tutorial here to download models with the command line:
