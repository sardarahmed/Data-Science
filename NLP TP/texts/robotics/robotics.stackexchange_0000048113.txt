Q:

IPC between 64-bit and 32-bit installations

I have two different packages that I need to run in ROS (fuerte), but one works correctly in the 32-bit installation, while the other works only in the 64-bit installation. I do not have the skill set to force either package into the opposing version of ROS.
So, can I run two computers, one with a 32-bit installation and the other with 64-bit, and communicate between them normally? In other words, can I set up a standard roscore on one machine and have the other simply feed data to it?
I've been trying to test this with simulated data, and gotten some errors - but I'm not sure if it was because the difference in 32 vs 64 bit, or because I made some other mistake. And, unfortunately, I need to answer this question before buying the sensor, so I can't test it in hardware yet.
Thank you in advance

A:

Since ROS message exchange is based on TCP-sockets, it shouldn't be a problem mixing 32- and 64-bit computers. We are using two 64-bit clients with a 32-bit roscore ourselves, because we need a 32-bit only CANBus driver on our robot.
But you should consider, that depending on your sensor, the network connection can become a bottleneck. So if your sensor requires some heavy bandwidth you may be forced to go the painful way and port one of your components.
