Q:

No 'ros' stack detected in candidates, Â¿where is the stack?

Hi.
Sorry for disturbing you, i'm trying to install ROSGroovy in Slackware 14.0.
How can this be solved?
(Over-)Writing /home/user/ros/.rosinstall
(Over-)Writing setup.sh, setup.bash, and setup.zsh in /home/user/ros
ERROR in rosinstall:
No 'ros' stack detected in candidates [].
Please add the location of a ros distribution to this command.
I have googled this error, and found that rosinstall is pointing to an empty url.
I also found that the ROS files coulbe in the /ros directory, but there are no files in the ros directory
My problem is, how can i fix that rosinstall is pointing to an empty url?
Or where are the files to install ROS?
I would greatly appreciate your help.
Thanks in advance.

Well, for some reason, i discovered that i can download diamondback in a laptop and i can download hydro and groovy in a desktop. Wonder why does this happen?
Anyway, i'll post another problem that i encountered, the problem is "rospack could not be found, you cannot have rosbash features until you bootstrap ros".
How can i fix it?
