Q:

CLion and messages

For CLion users out there:
I'm trying out CLion, and wondering how to deal w/ msgs that are created by the build process. I was able to make CLion happy by hacking up my src/myproj/CMakeLists.txt file:
## Set up include directories
include_directories(
  include
  ../../devel/include # Hack for Clion
  ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS}
)

Is there a better way?

Hi Clyde,
Did you try to: (1) compile the package containing the new messages, (2) source catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash (3) launch Clion from the terminal where you sourced catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash?
It works on my machine. Maybe have a look at this other post: link text
Cheers,
Marco.

Ah... I was confused about proj/devel vs. proj/src/cmake-build-devel. I [re-]built the targets using CLion and now it's all happy.
It appears that CLion users to be careful about managing 2 build environments: CLion and catkin.
Thanks!

For future users, go to proj/src/cmake-build-devel and run "make". This will generate the custom messages and then Clion will pick up on the new included messages.
