A:

Open gazebo place all your objects  go to SaveAs and save it, then change your launch file to reference you saved file. After that if you want to replace it, just repeat the process using the SaveAs to replace your launch file.

what about if the terminal show some errors like " Error [Param.cc:363]  Unable to set value [-nan -nan -nan -nan -nan -nan] for key acceleration"?  and when i reopen the world file after i saved it ,the world has not changed?
