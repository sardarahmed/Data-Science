Q:

Cropping Occupancy Grid Maps directly from msg.Data

Hello,
I am trying to compare two occupancy grid maps "at runtime", a ground truth map and a map generated from multirobot map merge. The reason I want to crop the generated map is because the map produced by multirobot_map_merge does not have the same dimensions or center with me maps that it merges, they are slightly off. Let's say that I have a 480x480 map.
Does anyone know how I can crop this map (edit the tuple  given by gm message) to 450x450?
I tried making the tuple into a 2d list so it can be more intuitive and then flatten it again but it doesn't work. Has anyone done this before? I would appreciate some tips.
Thanks in advance.

A:

The map is published as a list. First convert that list to a numpy array so it'll be easier for you to play with it.
Create a new numpy zero/ones array of whatever height X width you want and copy the corresponding elements from original map array to it.
