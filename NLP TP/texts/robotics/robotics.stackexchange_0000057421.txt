A:

You can get eclipse to pull in whatever rosjava maven dependencies you need or if you want to just drop in some jars, you can download them directly from https://github.com/rosjava/rosjava_mvn_repo.
There are various other ways of building your android apps, but given your setup, this is probably the easiest recommendation.
