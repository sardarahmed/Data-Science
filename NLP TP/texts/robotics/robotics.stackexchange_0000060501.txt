Q:

Using isight/facetime builtin camera

Hello,
I am trying to get the builtin camera of my MacBook Pro to work with the libuvc driver:
rosrun libuvc_camera camera_node vendor:=0x106B
[ INFO] [1404251751.441933000]: Opening camera with vendor=0x0, product=0x0, serial="", index=0
uvc_find_device: No such device (-4)
What am I doing wrong?

A:

Turned out the new facetime cameras are pci devices so there is no libuvc support

Hi, do you know by any chance from  which macbook model onwards this happened?
I have a late 2011 macbook pro, on OS X 10.11.12, and i was wondering if it supports uvc.
