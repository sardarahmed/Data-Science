Q:

transformPoint using tf::Transform?

Hi,
I need to save a transform (world->Kinect frame) at a specific time, and use this transform to convert a point in world coordinate frame to a point in that old Kinect frame after several seconds.
To do this, I first tried using tf::Listener::transformPoint. However, to my knowledge the only way to save a transform at a specific time is by using tf::lookupTransform, which can save the transform at specific time in tf::Transform type. My problem is that in this tf::Transform type, there is no function such as transformPoint.
Am I left to implement such function myself, or is there a one that is named differently?

I took a look at time travel tutorial in tf wiki: http://www.ros.org/wiki/tf/Tutorials/Time%20travel%20with%20tf%20%28C%2B%2B%29, but it does not explain about transforming a point.

A:

The tf::Transform class overloads the * operator. One version takes a tf::Vector3 which is how a point is represented and returns the transformed point.
