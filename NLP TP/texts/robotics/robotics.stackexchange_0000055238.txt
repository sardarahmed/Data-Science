Q:

Does roboearth plan to support newer ROS distros eventually?

The current code base and tutorials only support Fuerte.
Are there plans to actively support newer releases?
I found this related question about porting the Fuerte code to Groovy.

A:

I have no plans to port the object recording packages to Groovy in the near future (due to lack of time).

How about the distant future? We have students working on object recognition with Hydro on Precise. Right now roboearth is not an option. Will it ever be?
