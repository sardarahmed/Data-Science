Q:

Is there any benefit to write a driver node based on driver_base package

Hi,
I'm using a customized 2D laser range finder (not SICK/HOKUYO).
This laser range finder has its own protocol so I must write my own driver node to get the 2D scan and publish it in "sensor_msgs/LaserScan".
I'm wondering if I should write my own driver node based on "driver_base" package, like "hokuyo_node" package.
Is there any benefit to use the "driver_base" package?
Thanks.

A:

I have never used it myself, but having a look at the WikiPage, it does not seem to be a good idea to use it, as it is deprecated.

A framework for writing drivers that
helps with runtime reconfiguration,
diagnostics and self-test. This
package is deprecated.
API Stability This package is for
internal use only. Its API is stable,
but not recommended for use by new
packages.
