Not sure if the ROS 2 for Android developer is watching, @esteve, but you'll probably want to provide more information, like what tutorial you're following and/or what exact commands you're running to get the error.

A:

Thanks @william for tagging me, this is the first question on ROS answers about ros2-java, woohoo! :-)
@pedestrian1671022 Could you provide a little bit more of context? ros2-java uses ament, the ROS2 build system, so you can't use Gradle directly with the Android examples. Let me know if you need help with the instructions in https://github.com/esteve/ros2_java#sounds-great-how-can-i-try-this-out Thanks!
