Getting this error after the update.

I agree Stefan Kohlbrecher and got to visit question posted by you just after posting it here. But i do not know what to do. I admit your words.

A:

I was just getting this error also,
bash: /share/rosbash/rosbash: No such file or directory
I actually just reinstalled groovy, but pointed it to an old catkin_ws in my bashrc.  I ended up doing a catkin_make in my catkin_ws and it cleaned up the error.  I am not sure if this will help, but saw your post as I was trying to figure out my issue, so figured I'd let you know of a potential fix to your problem.
Hope this helps!

It worked. I just changed directory to catkin work space and run the catkin_make and it all gone well.
