Q:

ROSJava PubSub tutorial not publishing chatter topic

I have followed all the steps at http://docs.rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/rosjava_core/html/getting_started.html to attempt to get rosjava working.  I see no errors or significant warnings while following the steps to install and build the roscore.  However, when I attempt to launch the PubSub tutorial with this command: "roscore &
./build/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub/bin/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub org.ros.rosjava_tutorial_pubsub.Talker &
./build/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub/bin/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub org.ros.rosjava_tutorial_pubsub.Listener",
it does not seem to publish the 'chatter' topic.  Here is what I see in the terminal after I run the command: NODES
auto-starting new master
process[master]: started with pid [2937]
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://ubuntu:11311/
setting /run_id to 12c61b96-a542-11e1-9d85-000c29358351
process[rosout-1]: started with pid [2954]
Furthermore, the directory that is referenced in the command (./build/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub/bin/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub) doesn't seem to exist.  However, when I build the nodes with "roscd rosjava_tutorial_services
../gradlew installApp", it says the build is successful.
I am running ros electric on Ubuntu 11.10.
Thanks for the help
-Andrew

A:

Try to look for the files in ./build/install/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub/bin
