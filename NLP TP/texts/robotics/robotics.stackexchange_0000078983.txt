Q:

Does we always have to first build catkin_workspace and then only build the catkin_package present in the src of catkin_workspace?

Hi,
I was reading ROS tutorials page on creating and building package in which I came across how to build the ROS packages. In the page it is shown that first the author has build the catkin workspace using catkin_make command and then he/her has build the beginner_tutorials package present in the src directory of the catkin_ws using the same command. So I want to know that whether we always I have to follow the above mention steps or we can directly build the catkin packages as shown in the tutorials inside the catkin_ws.

A:

Everytime you need to build your packages, only thing you need to do is to run catkin_make in root of your catkin workspace. That's it.
