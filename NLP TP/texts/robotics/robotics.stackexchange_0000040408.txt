Q:

calling xacro:macro from within xacro:macro

can I include and call an xacro:macro from within an xacro:macro?
alternatively, can I pass a variable to an xacro if it is not an xacro:macro?

For question2, if it is not a xacro:macro, what is it?
Comment by dsolomon on 2012-12-21:
xacro:macro refers to an xacro that contains a macro. In my answer below, I include an xacro file "irb_5400_macro.xacro" that contains the macro "irb_5400". Then I call that xacro:macro from THIS file. An xacro file can also just contain a set of commands, or even constants (like an include file).

A:

For question 1, yes you can. Recursive macros are allowed.
