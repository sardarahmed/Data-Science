Q:

'Unable to locate package swig-wx' Error When Trying to Install swig-wx

Hi All,
I'm trying to build rxtools and turtlesim package (following ROS tutorials '8. Using rxconsole and roslaunch'), but when I try the command
 mehrdad@ubuntu:~$ rosdep install rxtools turtlesim </samp></p></blockquote>
I get: 
<blockquote><p><samp>executing command [sudo apt-get install swig-wx]
<br>[sudo] password for mehrdad: 
<br>Reading package lists... Done
<br>Building dependency tree       
<br>Reading state information... Done
<br>E: Unable to locate package swig-wx
<br>ERROR: the following rosdeps failed to install
<br>  apt: command [sudo apt-get install swig-wx] failed </samp></p></blockquote>
Then, when I try the above command (<samp>sudo apt-get install swig-wx</samp>), I get this error: 
<blockquote><p><samp>mehrdad@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install swig-wx
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package swig-wx
How do I resolve this?
Thanks

A:

I found a rosdistro commit related to swig-wx:
Added swig-wx rules to base.yaml
But I can't find the package named 'swig-wx' in packages.ubuntu.com.
So I removed the following lines from ~/.ros/rosdep/sources.cache/0a12...(please check that this is a cache of https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/raw/master/rosdep/base.yaml)
swig-wx:
  debian: swig-wx
  ubuntu: {lucid: swig-wx, oneiric: swig-wx, precise: swig-wx, quantal: swig-wx}

Then rosdep seems to work well.
