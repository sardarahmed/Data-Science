Q:

Stabilizing a quadcopter with optical flow

My quad copter can balance itself in the air using data collected from mpu6050. With the sonar sensor, it can hover at a specific height, but it  moves on the horizontal plane in a random direction.  If i put an object below it, it will ascend to keep the distance between the sonar senor and the object.
Now i want to make it have the ability to hover stably. Is it possible to add a downward-facing camera to calculate the speed of optical flow in order to keep it hovering on the same point in the horizontal plane?  Could I use a forward-facing camera to stabilize its vertical speed?

A:

The following diagram (1) illustrates a method by which a Lancaster navigator determined airplane height above the water of a lake. Such a method is useful if the ground lacks features needed for other forms of Visual Servoing.  A program I saw about mission Chastise showed one spotlight shining green and the other red, to avoid confusion about which way to go to get to correct altitude.  Note, the bomb aiming rangefinder used similar geometric principles.

With a quadcopter, you could use red and green lasers, eg from a red laser pointer and a green laser pointer.  You could also add servos to rotate one or both of the lasers to adjust the altitude setpoint.  A camera or a line sensor would detect the relative positions where the lights hit the ground.

A:

Using a so-called optical flow sensor is the best way to help with holding the horizontal (i.e. in X-Y plane) position. I don't see any reason why you couldn't do the same for vertical control, although a sonar is probably easier and cheaper to use for this (likewise, if you are indoors, you could use 2 sonars for the horizontal position as well)
People used to hack the sensors of optical mice to achieve this:

Some ready-made sensors are available: http://www.buildyourowndrone.co.uk/Optical-Flow-Sensor-p/op-fs.htm
Some explanation on how to use such device with an Arduino can be found here:https://code.google.com/p/arducopter/wiki/AC2_OptFlow
Nowadays, better sensors are out there (but much more expensive) that works in low-light conditions (i.e. indoors) and are even combined with a sonar (as it makes senses to hold altitude in order to get a better/stable optical reading for XY positioning), such as this one:
