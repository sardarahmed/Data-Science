How exactly can a Robot Operating System benefit from a 3D game engine?
Or do you just mean Gazebo? In newer versions of Gazebo there are already four physics engines implemented I think.
I also could imagine that the license of Unity 3D is not that compatible with the BSD license of ROS

The integration is very useful for research. Unity is great for 3d graphics of life like arenas. ROS is good for hardware integration. People who are working with robots whose actions are dependent on real world objects would find this awesome.
These guys did this!

I don't think there is anything Ros-Unity available. This question on the same issue also stayed unanswered:  http://answers.ros.org/question/123641/has-anyone-integrated-ros-with-unity-3d/
