Q:

How to play ROS bag file frame by frame

rosbag play bagfile.bag

ROS's bag player provides a nice tool to replay the data but it's kind of difficult for debugging as we can't control frame-by-frame play. I know it's possible to control replay speed by the -r option but is it possible to play it frame-by-frame? e.g in rqt_bag we can move frame by frame to see the value (although it can't publish the single frame).
How do you debug your program with ros bag file?

A:

You can start your bag in a paused state using
rosbag play bagfile.bag --pause

And then you can step through your bag by pressing the s key.
I believe each step is a message from the bag file.
