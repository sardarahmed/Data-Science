Q:

Problem with the packet of ROS Hydro

I'm using the ROS packet of Gazebo:
http://gazebosim.org/tutorials/?tut=ros_installing
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-gazebo-ros-pkgs ros-hydro-gazebo-ros-control

But have problems when used:
roscd
rosmake
rosrun gazebo_ros gazebo

say:
roscd: no se encontró la orden
rosmake: no se encontró la orden

I have included this instruction in the .bashrc
source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash

When use "cd" and "make", example:
cd ~/NAO/nao_gazebo_plugin
~/NAO/nao_gazebo_plugin$ make
make: *** No se especificó ningún objetivo y no se encontró ningún makefile.  Alto.

I don't have problems with:
rosws init
rosws set

I want to know how I can solve this problems
A lot of thanks!!

The link you posted makes no reference to the now outdated rosmake command. Did the apt-get command above work?

A:

Could you try the following:
apt-get install ros-hydro-ros
. /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash

And if this is not working, please use pastebin.com to copy the content of:
set

Thanks.
