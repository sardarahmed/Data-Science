Q:

ReIn-like framework for OpenCV+ROS+Python?

Hello,
I am working on using ROS + OpenCV via the cv_bridge package to process 2D video images using a sequence of filters.  One example is finding the Good Features to Track (GFTT) in a face by first doing face detection, then passing the returned bounding box as the ROI for GFTT.  Right now I am just combining these filters within a single node (Python script) but I was looking at the rein package/library and was wondering if something similar has or is been done for OpenCV and Python?
Thanks!

patrick

A:

Your approach is completely appropriate.  rein should be considered no man's land and is unsupported at the moment.

Sounds exactly what I was looking for.  I'll put my own work along those lines on hold until I see what you have developed.

We are working on an OpenCV + Python graph based modular vision framework, that will be released with docs in a couple of weeks.  Its more low level then "object recognition", but does enable higher level vision pipelines.

Thanks for the response.  I've got a got a good start on a more modular vision framework similar to rein and will post back once I have something to show.
