Q:

override default obstacle avoidance in turtlebot navigation

I have built an obstacle avoidance algorithm based on 3D optical flow via PointCloud on a TurtleBot platform. I would like to test it with the navigation stack but the obstacle avoidance is already implemented by default.
I would like the robot to ignore the obstacles that are not on the map.
Can I remove the automatic obstacle avoidance or deactivate it to plug in my node (or code) ?
That would be of great help, since I don't have much time to write by myself whole global and local planners.
If I set the static_map parameter of local_costmap_params.yaml to true, will it do the trick ?
Thank you for your suggestions.

3D optical flow is interesting... could you make the code available for people to use.

I cannot release my code for now, it's still in development, but I will as soon as I finish my project.

A:

To "remove" the automatic obstacle avoidance on the amcl navigation, I modified a setting : obstacle_range in turtlebot_navigation package, in costmap_common_params.yaml. So I put it to 0.05, like that no obstacle will be detected unless it's almost touching the robot.
