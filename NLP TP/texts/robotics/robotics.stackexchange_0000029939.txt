Q:

rosoct wiki, rosoct with octave3.2

Hey all, my first post here :)
I'm trying to compile rosoct.

The svn on the rosoct wiki does not work. After browsing, I found this one: https://code.ros.org/svn/ros/stacks/ros_experimental/branches/cturtle/rosoct/ Should this be the one on the wiki?
Is there some way to make rosoct compile with octave3.2headers instead of the older octave3.0headers? While compiling with 3.2 I receive the following errors:

~/ros/rosoct/rosoct.cpp: In member function ‘virtual void RoscppSubscription::dowork(OctaveMsgDeserializer*)’: ~/ros/rosoct/rosoct.cpp:455: error: ‘class uint8NDArray’ has no member named ‘resize_no_fill’ ~/ros/rosoct/rosoct.cpp: In member function ‘virtual void RoscppService::dowork()’: ~/ros/rosoct/rosoct.cpp:582: error: ‘class uint8NDArray’ has no member named ‘resize_no_fill’
Thanks in advance!

A:

FYI: rosoct has been retired, which is why it is no longer present on the wiki.  Also, it is not compatible with ROS Diamondback.
