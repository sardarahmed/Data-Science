Q:

Native spherical (WGS84) coordinates?

Hello all,
I'm looking to build a simulation where I can accurately bookkeep my robots position in geodetic coordinates (WGS84 datum).
Unfortunately the ROS+Gazebo+Hector GPS plugin route isn't likely to work, exactly because I'm trying to simulate vehicles at high latitude (near the poles), and traveling large distances O(10 km).
Is it possible for Gazebo to run a simulation natively in spherical coordinates? I haven't been able to find any resources to date on this.
If not, have any others found themselves in a similar situation? Outside of writing a dynamical model in MATLAB or similar, have others found an acceptable solution?

A:

Take a look at Gazebo's spherical coordinate class, and the GPS Sensor which makes use of it.

Thanks @nkoenig.
So if I understand correctly, underlying cord sys is still XYZ, but Spherical Coord. class implements proper WGS84<-->local XYZ (via intermediate ECEF frame), with local XYZ origin at the lat/long specified in world file (as defined here: http://sdformat.org/spec?ver=1.6&elem=world#world_spherical_coordinates). Local XYZ is in an ENU orientation.
Does this sound correct?

That is correct.
