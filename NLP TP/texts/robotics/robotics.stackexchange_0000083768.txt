Q:

Unable to compile server node

Hi: I am getting the following error:
error: no matching function for call to ‘ros::NodeHandle::advertiseService(const char [15], void (&)(beginner_tutorials::stringEditor::Request&, beginner_tutorials::stringEditor::Response&))’
   ros::ServiceServer service = n.advertiseService("editBaseString", editor);

This is my stringEditorServer.cpp file:
#include "ros/ros.h"
#include "beginner_tutorials/stringEditor.h"

 void editor(beginner_tutorials::stringEditor::Request  &req,
     beginner_tutorials::stringEditor::Response &res)
{
  res.output = "count to 100 ";
  ROS_INFO("sending back response");
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  ros::init(argc, argv, "stringEditorServer");
  ros::NodeHandle n;

  ros::ServiceServer service = n.advertiseService("editBaseString", editor);
  ros::spin();

  return 0;
}

This is my stringEditor.srv file:
string input
---
string output

A:

Your callback has to return a bool.
