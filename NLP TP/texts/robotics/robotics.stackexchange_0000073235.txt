Q:

How to publish an array of 3D points for visualization in RVIZ? [Solved]

Hello all,
I did all the basic tutorials of visualization_msgs for publishing points as different shaped markers.
is it possible for anyone to let me know how to publish an array of points so that I can see them in rviz in real time.
I have an array of 20 points in 3D and I want to publish them as visualization_msgs/markerArray. But I have no idea how to do that.
It will be a great help if anyone can provide a snippet in c++ for this purpose.
Thanks,
Prasanna.

A:

You can use a simple Marker (no Markerarray!) and use the Points-Type (http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/DisplayTypes/Marker#Points_.28POINTS.3D8.29). The Marker (http://docs.ros.org/jade/api/visualization_msgs/html/msg/Marker.html) has a points member that can be used to pass a list of points to RVIZ. If you want to have a nicer output you could also use the SPHERE_LIST although all spheres will have the same color.

Thanks for your quick reply. what if the points are not fixed and are changing and then I have just an array. I know only that it is of 3d type and I don'n want to change the points manually? the points are also not linear in spacing. I mean to say that the points of my array can be any where.

You can just republish your points after their position changed. How often do you want to update the position in RVIZ?

I want to publish all the points at once. is it possible? and then delete in next iteration.

Yes. You send one marker that contains your 20 points. If you publish again (with the same namespace and id), the old points are replaced by the new ones.

I'm sorry But I can't figure out how to do that. I followed http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/Tutorials/Markers%3A%20Points%20and%20Lines this tutorial and used only points and not lines. Still now I'm unable to solve this problem.
