Q:

imu position without GPS or camera

I have a IMU that has 3-axis accelerator, 3-axis magnetometer, 3-axis gyroscope and row, yaw, pitch value. I want to get the location of the IMU coordinate(the beginning point is (0,0,0)) but I know just using double integration will has dead reckoning problem. And I found a lot of paper just talking about combining IMU with GPS or camera by using Kalman filter. Is it possible that I just use a IMU to get a slightly precise position data? Because in the future work I will use multiple IMUs bounded on human arms to increase the accuracy. 

A:

No, it is not possible to eliminate the cumulative position error caused by sensor noise and bias without using an additional sensor which can report any kind of position measurement.
Even the best sensors and filtering will not be able to eliminate in a closed-loop fashion the position error.
