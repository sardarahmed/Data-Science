Q:

Install Hydro from source: unexpected keyword argument 'timeout'

I am trying to install Hydro from source following these instructions on Ubuntu 12.04 32 bit.
After this command: wstool init -j8 src hydro-desktop-full-wet.rosinstall
I got several errors of this type:
TypeError: checkout() got an unexpected keyword argument 'timeout'

How can I solve this problem? Thanks!
The whole traceback of the command is:

A:

Judging by the output I have to conclude that you have a version of vcstools which does not line up with the version of wstools you are using. This might be a case of a pip installed version of vcstools overlaying the apt-get version, see:
http://answers.ros.org/question/49143/problems-with-rqt-groovy-ubuntu/?answer=49153#post-id-49153
You can check by seeing if the output of this:
python -c 'import vcstools; print(vcstools.__file__)'

Is prefixed with /usr/local/lib.... If it is then the default version of vcstools is coming from pip and not apt-get. In which case you'll need to sudo pip uninstall vcstools repeatedly until it reports that nothing was uninstalled, then do sudo apt-get install --reinstall python-vcstools. Hopefully that should clear up your issue.
