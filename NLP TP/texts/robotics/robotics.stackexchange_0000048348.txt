Q:

wget http://kforge.ros.org/rososx/homebrew/raw-file/tip/electric/rosdep.yaml Unauthorized

Dear all,
A while ago I successfully installed ROS Electric on Mac OSX, now I am trying to re-do all the steps on another Mac but there is an issue that wasn't there last time (that my fish memory can recall).
When trying to get the rosdep.yaml file from kforge.ros.org:
wget http://kforge.ros.org/rososx/homebrew/raw-file/tip/electric/rosdep.yaml -O ~/.ros/rosdep.yaml
--2013-02-15 16:28:13--  http://kforge.ros.org/rososx/homebrew/raw-file/tip/electric/rosdep.yaml
Resolving kforge.ros.org... 70.35.54.212
Connecting to kforge.ros.org|70.35.54.212|:80... connected.
HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 401 Unauthorized
Authorization failed.

Should I get the file from somewhere else? I have been "googleing" but don't seem to find it.
Thank you very much in advance

A:

Do you have the original rosdep.yaml on another machine?
If so I can put it back up in its original location.  I think I might have removed the repository thinking it was no longer used.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
UDPATE:
It has been restored:

I was thinking the same, I have the rosdep.yaml file from the other computer, I will post it on Monday and let you know how the installation went. Thanks!
