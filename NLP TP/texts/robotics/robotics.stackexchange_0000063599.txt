A:

You can add a package directory to your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH using the export command in your shell:
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH="$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:/home/chhonkar/Desktop/mypack"
This sets ROS_PACKAGE_PATH to the previous ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, and appends the path seraparator (a colon :) and the path to your new package.
