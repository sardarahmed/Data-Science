Q:

Quadrocopter build - Do these parts look fine?

I am completely brand new to quadrocopter building. I am currently about to start building a Quad. I have done a little bit of research and was thinking of buying the following parts:

KK2.1 Hobbyking Flight Controller
Turnigy H.A.L Quadcopter Frame
4 x NTM Prop Drive    35-30 1100kv / 380w
Turnigy 9X 9CH
Turnigy Plush 40A ESC
Slow Fly Prop Left
Slow Fly Prop Right
Quad Power Dist Board
Turnigy 5Ah 3S25C LiPo

What do you think of these parts/Do you have any complete builds with instructions that you would recommend instead?
Thanks

A:

Since your frame is about (220g + other parts' weight), you need to make sure that your 4 motors give you a combined thrust of atleast 100 g more than, just to get off the ground and maneuver. Anything greater than that is good. (Thurst Calculator). Just looking at the numbers, I think it should work out fine.
You battery amps * burst C / constant C should be greater than the motor amp pull * 4 (using same units, mAh or Ah).
Your ESC amp rating should be higher than the Max current pull of a motor (which it looks to be).
Propellers look OK. Make sure their inner diameter matches motor shaft diameter, else buy adapters.
Rest all looks good to me.
