Q:

Unable to locate package ros-groovy-desktop-full

My ubuntu linux is 12.04. And I want to install ROS, but when I followed the instruction in ros.org, in the step of "sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-desktop-full", I got this problem "Unable to locate package ros-groovy-desktop-full". And I tried other version of ROS such as hydro and diamondback and other version of ubuntu such as 12.10, this problem can not be solved.

A:

Have you checked if your ubuntu allows  "restricted," "universe," and "multiverse" ?
if not-easiest way is to download Synaptic Package Manager, run it and check settings in Settings->Repositories and in the first tab "Ubuntu Software" there is all wrote down.
than you have to add good repo for your ubuntu, as in tutorial and u should not forgot about
sudo apt-get update

than you can check if apt-get finds sth (find or just type sudo apt-get install ros- and press tab)
