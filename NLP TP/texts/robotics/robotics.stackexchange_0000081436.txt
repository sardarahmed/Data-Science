Q:

ROS TurtleBot2 Unable to Communicate?

Hello Everyone.
I am currently doing research using the TurtleBot 2 and ROS Kinetic Kame. I'm trying to set up an Orrbec Astra camera with my TurtleBot. Instead of a netbook, we use Intel NUC nooks.
roslaunch astra_launch astra.launch 

The above launch works, and several camera/ topics can be seen running; however, nothing is subscribing or publishing to any of the topics.
I pulled the driver from the ros_astra_camera repository (https://github.com/orbbec/ros_astra_camera), and used catkin build to build the astra_camera package.
This is what I get with lsusb -v
Bus 001 Device 012: ID 2bc5:0401

, so my hub recognizes and identifies the astra.
Does anyone have any ideas? Thanks!

A:

I tinkered a bit and restarted my NUC and the camera communicates now! :D
