Q:

rosjava and Android dependencies

I'm new to ROS and android, but I would like to use rosjava to drive my robots. Can rosjava work on non-android OSes, such as Debian? Or, must my robot be deployed with android?

A:

rosjava is a pure Java implementation of ROS. It can run anywhere you have a VM that supports Java.

Great - thank you for the clarification!

You don't need the Android SDK to build rosjava. You only need it if you intend to build an Android app.

Ok thanks for that info! So, as I understand it, the Android SDK is only for building the rosjava. Is that correct?
