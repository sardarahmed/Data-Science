Q:

xacro dependency problem while installing gazebo_ros_pkgs on ROS Groovy

I'm running ROS Groovy on Ubuntu 12.04, and I'm trying to install Gazebo 1.9 from sources, as explained in the online tutorial on the official wiki.
I can clone the repos (including ros_controllers) and update rosdep without problems, but when I get to
rosdep check --from-paths . --ignore-src --rosdistro hydro

I get the following error
ERROR[joint_trajectory_controller]: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [xacro]
    rosdep key : xacro
    OS name    : ubuntu
    OS version : precise
    Data: <no data>

Looking around for solutions, I found out here that the problem is probably that xacro is a dry (rosbuild) package and so it cannot be referenced from a catkin package.
If I ignore the error and go on, after a catkin_make I get
Set xacro_DIR to the directory containing a CMake configuration file for xacro. 
The file will have one of the following names:

xacroConfig.cmake
xacro-config.cmake

Can you suggest any way of dealing with this problem?

A:

Try the groovy-devel branch, it's currently the same as hydro-devel but without gazebo_ros_control.
git clone -b groovy-devel https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs.git

Alternatively, try checking out a copy of xacro in your catkin workspace.

gazebo_ros_control is slated for release in hydro, so @hsu's suggestion is a good one. If you are still interested in giving the hydro stuff, use a recent version of rosdep to resolve missing dependencies.

I first removed the references to xacro to build anyway, today I removed the package and downloaded it again using your solution and it worked. Thanks!
