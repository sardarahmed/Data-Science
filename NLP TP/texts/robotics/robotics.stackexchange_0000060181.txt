A:

While rosserial has been released into Indigo (see debbuild/indigo.html?q=serial for instance), it appears it hasn't yet been synced with the main repositories, which could be why apt-get cannot find it.
It is currently available from the ros-shadow-fixed repository, see ros-shadow-fixed/pool/ros-indigo-rosserial.
So it appears we'll have to wait for the next 'sync', which will be announced on the mailing lists.

Can we use any methods other than apt-get to install rosserial in indigo?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2014-06-19:
Sure. If you already have a catkin workspace (for your own pkgs fi), just checkout rosserial into it (look on the wiki for the github url), then build it like any other catkin package. Alternatively (but not really recommended), you could try to download the *.debs and install those using dpkg.

Please share the links from which we can get the *,debs, if you know.
Thanks for the help.

I would build from source, but I already gave the link: go to the ros-shadow-fixed/pool/ros-indigo-rosserial link I posted, go up one level, then down to ros-indigo-rosserial-{client,server,..} you'll find the debs for each supported architecture. Dependency resolution might still fail though.

If you are using indigo right now, it's still in beta and so you might as well be using ros-shadow-fixed. Update your /etc/apt/sources files to point at ros-shadow-fixed and you should have rosserial.
