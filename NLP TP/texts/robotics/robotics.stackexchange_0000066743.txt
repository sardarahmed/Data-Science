Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Mapping SLAM

Hey, I want to build a map with my robot that uses wheel odometry and a laserscanner and I also want to use the Navigation Stack. I already made a map with the map_server gmapping. But actually I want that my robot is building the map the same time it is driving around. So that I can navigate my robot while it is mapping. And I also want to give that map to the Navigation Stack. Can I also use gmapping for that?

A:

In principle yes. You only have to consider that the map changes and the robot pose in the map might also change as it is built online.
