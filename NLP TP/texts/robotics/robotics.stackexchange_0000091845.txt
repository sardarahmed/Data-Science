Q:

Rosdep Import error

Hi,
I am trying to install a ros package on ubuntu 16.04 and ros kinetic version. However, the rosdep init seems to give following error:
 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/rosdep", line 3, in 
    from rosdep2.main import rosdep_main
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rosdep2/__init__.py", line 45, in 
    from .lookup import RosdepDefinition, RosdepView, RosdepLookup, \
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rosdep2/lookup.py", line 44, in 
    from .sources_list import SourcesListLoader
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rosdep2/sources_list.py", line 49, in 
    from .gbpdistro_support import get_gbprepo_as_rosdep_data, download_gbpdistro_as_rosdep_data
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rosdep2/gbpdistro_support.py", line 18, in 
    from .platforms.debian import APT_INSTALLER
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rosdep2/platforms/debian.py", line 34, in 
    from rospkg.os_detect import OS_DEBIAN, OS_LINARO, OS_UBUNTU, OS_ELEMENTARY, OS_MX, OsDetect, read_os_release
ImportError: cannot import name OS_MX

This seems some python issue, but I have tried reinstalling: rosdep, ros kinetic, python and even did a reset of bashrc. If I remove the OS_MX, some OS_EMBEDDDED gives import error.
Rospkg version is 1.1.9
What could be the case here?

A guess, but seeing as you're on Ubuntu 14.04: it could be that rospkg is not up-to-date enough on your system. Causing rosdep to fail when it tries to import symbols that should be part of rospkg but aren't on your system.

Thanks @gvdhoorn,
The rospkg is also up to date (V 1.19)
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-05-30:
Did you mean to write 1.1.9?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-05-30:
Just noticed this:

ubuntu 14.04 and ros kinetic version

Kinetic is not supported on Ubuntu 14.04; are you building things from source or is this a typo?
Comment by elementaryshr on 2019-05-30:
I am extreamly sorry, I typed out both the things rather quickly.
The Ubuntu version is 16.04.6
The rospkg is also 1.1.9
I have installed it via package manager.

Have you tried upgrading packages: sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade before installing?
Comment by elementaryshr on 2019-05-31:
Yes indeed. All the packages are up to date

Have you solved the problem? I meet this problem too today.

A:

Solved the issue by updating pip2. Apparently I had 3 pip installations pip (this should be pip2), pip2, pip3.

This didn't solve it for me on one of my machines, but for completeness:
sudo -H pip2 install --upgrade pip
