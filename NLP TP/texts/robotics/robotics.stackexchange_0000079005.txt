Q:

list dependencies of a pre-built package of ros?

I have installed the full desktop version of ROS kinetic instead of building it from the source files. I would like to know the list  of dependencies for a pre-built package in ROS ( for ex, turtlesim ). Is there a command that can list all the dependencies of a pre-built package. Any help is much appreciated. Thank you in advance.
