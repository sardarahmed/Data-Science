Q:

ROS build a package but can't run

Hello ROS users,
I build a workspace folder which called jade_workspace in the home directory. In the jade_workspace folder, there are 3 files here which are the "setup.bash" , "setup.sh" , "setup.zsh", and I also create a folder here called sandbox.
In the sandbox, I want to create a package calls "beginner_tutorials", and I use the command as
"roscreate-pkg beginner_tutorials std_msgs rospy roscpp" , after that, I use "rosmake beginner_tutorials" to build some data in this folder.
After that, because I run the example of "Creating a ROS Package" and "Writing a Simple Publisher and Subscriber (C++)", and I can run the talker and listener successfully in the example. I copy the file of "talker","listener" and "CMakeLists.txt"
, "package.xml" to the jade_workspace's beginner_tutorials folder.
And after I source it and ran the talker, it shows the error as below:
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named talker below /home/terry/jade_workspace/sandbox/beginner_tutorials

A:

Sounds like your workspace does not have the correct folder structure.
Part 4 on this page http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment tells you how to set up a workspace with the correct folder structure.

Hello Ntckw, I followed the "rosbuild"part of part 4 of your link, I think my path is right, but it can't be executed,too. I put my terminal reply in the next

The sandbox folder is not part of the usual folder layout for a workspace (unless it is the name of a package that you have created, but that would be in the src folder). I would expect the setup files to be in folder called devel inside your workspace if initialising the workspace had run correctly
Comment by nickw on 2015-12-29:
I just realised you are using rosbuild, I misread the title,sorry. Thats why you have a sandbox folder. Unless you need to use rosbuild for backwards compatibility with something it is more common to use catkin now.

Now, I use the catkin instead of rosbuild. It is easier. But in any case, thank you.
