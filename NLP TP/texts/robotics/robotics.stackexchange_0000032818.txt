Q:

image_proc warning /camera/camera/

Hi all,
I am receiving warnings from image_proc every 30 seconds or so:
[ WARN] [1310053249.262781753]: The input topic '/camera/camera/image_raw' is not yet advertised
[ WARN] [1310053249.262963275]: The input topic '/camera/camera/camera_info' is not yet advertised
Note the doubling of 'camera'.
The prosilica_camera node is publishing /camera/image_raw and /camera/camera/info, and image_proc is subscribed to them with no problem, other than the persistent warnings. I am launching the nodes with:
<launch>
  <node name="launch_prosilica_camera" pkg="prosilica_camera" type="prosilica_node" output="screen">
    <param name="~trigger_mode" type="str" value="streaming"/>
  </node>
  <node name="launch_image_proc" pkg="image_proc" type="image_proc" output="screen">
    <env name="ROS_NAMESPACE" value="camera"/>
  </node>
</launch>

It could be me, but I think this behavior just began recently, perhaps due to an update.
Any ideas?

Ah, found it. Not sure why the behavior changed recently, but the fix is to launch image_proc in the "/camera" name space, not in "camera". The modified .launch file is:
<launch>
  <node name="launch_prosilica_camera" pkg="prosilica_camera" type="prosilica_node" output="screen">
    <param name="~trigger_mode" type="str" value="streaming"/>
  </node>
  <node name="launch_image_proc" pkg="image_proc" type="image_proc" output="screen">
    <env name="ROS_NAMESPACE" value="/camera"/>
  </node>
</launch>

Thanks for the views!

It's also recommended to use the  roslaunch tag instead of the ROS_NAMESPACE environment variable.
