Q:

Problem importing scenes/objects into environment

Hello everyone,
I installed moveit from the repo and am running it with ROS Hydro on Ubuntu 13.04 (although I've also tried on 12.04). Things seem to work fine with the pr2 tutorial. I followed the same steps to configure a schunk 7 DOF manipulator and then roslaunch demo.launch from that config.
Everything seems ok except that I cannot import anything into the environment. When the select file dialog box appears, it isn't able to navigate through folders. It's strange because I can do it (although slowly) with the pr2 demo.launch.
Any ideas why this is happening?
Thank you

A:

In case anyone else has this problem, it turns out that it was a symptom of my link meshes being comprised of multiple separate meshes per file rather than one mesh. Once I joined all the meshes, the problem went away.
