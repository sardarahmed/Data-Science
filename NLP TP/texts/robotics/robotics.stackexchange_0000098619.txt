Q:

roslaunch file contains multiple nodes named [/robot_state_publisher]

straight dump of the error:
'roslaunch file contains multiple nodes named [/robot_state_publisher]. Please check all <node> 'name' attributes to make sure they are unique. Also check that $(anon id) use different ids. The traceback for the exception was written to the log file'

I am using move_base_flex for turtlebot3 navigation when I am launching the file got the error. Can anyone please tell me how to solve this error? It's really helpful for me. I tried to find [/robot_state_publisher] where this file is overwritten but I can't.

Check all launch files that you start, and therein the respective node tags. The error message is pretty self-contained. if you want more help from us, you should at least tell us what launch files you are running, and whether they are from a released package or something your crafted yourself. If it is the latter, you need to share the contents of that file...

A:

Actually, the AMCL node launched multiple times in different launch files. So, this is the reason I got the error. Now, everything works perfectly.
