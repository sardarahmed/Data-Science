Q:

How to use bullet in gazebo 3.0?

Hi,
How to select bullet as a physics engine in gazebo 3.0? I am using ubuntu 13.04 with gazebo installed from debian. Also ran the bullet installation from here.
If I do it from the world file, with the tag
<physics type="bullet">

gazebo does not starts without giving any error.
starting it with:
$ gazebo -e bullet

it runs with the default one, ODE. Following code outputs 'ode'
this->world->GetPhysicsEngine()->GetType()

Cheers,
Andrei

A:

To get the support for physics engine different than ODE, a full from source installation of gazebo is needed, since it has to built the binary support at compilation time. I'm afraid that you can not use the debs to get this kind of support.
The good news is that is in our roadmap for Gazebo 4.0 to implement plugin support the physics engines, so hopefully you can do this from .debs in the future.
I've clarified the need of a from source installation in our install document a bit more.
Thanks Andrei.

It makes sense, thanks for the answer :) And having a plugin type support of the physics engines won't slow down the simulation?

When speaking about plugins, think on dynamic symbol loading, which should happen just once and load the library in memory (via dlopen). I would say that it won't mean a big overhead speaking about performance.
