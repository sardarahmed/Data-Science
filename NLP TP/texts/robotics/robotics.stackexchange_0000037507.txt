Q:

Planning for your own robot arm

Anyone got a simple way or easy to understand tutorials for planning for your own robot? Can't seem to understand the OMPL tutorials on ROS.

A:

Oh, I thought OMPL is just the library used in arm_navigation and is not to be used directly.
Have you seen the enclosing [arm_navigation stack](http://www.ros.org/wiki/arm_navigation arm_navigation) (with its arm_navigation_experimental sibling) at a whole? There are tutorials to get it running. You will need a simple URDF robot model for the kinematics, but it's not that complex and there are tutorials, too.
