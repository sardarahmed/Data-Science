Q:

Create 2 CAD files

I found CAD files for the Create on the ROS TurleBot download page (.zip),
and shells on the gazebo sim page. 
Any ideas where the files for the Create 2 could be found?

A:

The CAD you pointed out is for the Turtlebot, and includes electromechanical CAD for that assembly. I only spot-checked a few files, but the only Create-relevant CAD in that package I found was an STL of the robot's outer dimensions. The Create 2 manual should have enough information for someone to produce a solid model of similar precision, but I do not believe iRobot has released a shell for the robot, yet. Maybe you should make one and put it on a site like Thingiverse? There are other designs by iRobot that can be found there for various parts of the robot, like the bin.
