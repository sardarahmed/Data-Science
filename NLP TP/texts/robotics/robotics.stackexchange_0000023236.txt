Q:

What common device uses 7 pin mini DIN plugs, that could be used for the Roomba serial port?

I have a Roomba that I'm planning to hack on the cheap, using junk cables and other parts. The excellent book Hacking Roomba suggests using Macintosh serial cables as a cheap surrogate.
However, as a hopeless Macintosh aficionado, I am somewhat loath to start chopping up my precious Mac cables. Plus the 8 pin Mac cables aren't an exact match anyway
So, I was wondering what other, hopefully commonly available, devices use a 7 pin mini DIN plug, that could be used instead?

A:

Core Electronics sell the cables...

you can also find the plugs on ebay, just google "ebay roomba din plug"
