Q:

PCL ROS and system install clashing?

Compiling object_recognition_tabletop from source on Hydro throws lots of warning like this one:
CMake Warning at object_recognition_tabletop/src/db/CMakeLists.txt:2 (add_library):
  Cannot generate a safe runtime search path for target tabletop_db because files in some directories may conflict with libraries in implicit directories:

  /opt/ros/hydro/lib

Some of these libraries may not be found correctly.

What do I need to do to fix this?

A:

@vincent-rabaud found out the cause. I'll just quote him:

You still have the ros-hydro-pcl package. You should remove it since that is now a system dependecy (hence in /usr/lib). It is not even part of the Hydro distribution anymore (as of 2 weeks ago)
