Q:

roslaunch + screen

Has anybody had any luck in setting this up?
I don't know how to tell screen to launch different ros nodes in different screen-windows of the same screen-session.
I can do it manually, but i would ideally like to make it part of my boot script.

I think you can use "screen -X screen -U" in the launch-prefix attribute.
-X option sends a command to a running screen.
But I don't know how to set the "default" launch-prefix, you may need to
edit all the node tags like below:
