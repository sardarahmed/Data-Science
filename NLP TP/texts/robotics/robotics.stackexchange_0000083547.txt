Q:

RTABMAP with multiple ZED stereo cameras

Hi,
I would like to use multiple ZED stereo cameras for the 3D mapping with RTABMAP. But I notice RTABMAP only supports single stereo camera or stereo camera+laser. Could anyone kindly give me some insights on how to do the multiple ZED cameras mapping? Thank you.

Hi,
Take a look at the multiple Kinect demo launch file.
You would have to remap rgb/depth/camera_info of the zed cameras. Another similar post for ZR300 cameras.
cheers

Hi Matlabbe,
Thank you so much for the insight. May I know if I would like to use the ZED odometry, how can I revise the launch file accordingly. :)
cheers

Remove rgbd_odometry node, then remap the zed's odom topic in rtabmap/rtabmapviz nodes: <remap from="odom"       to="/zed_camera1/odom"/>

Hi
Thank you for the help. I have rewritten the launch file and run the two cameras simultaneously. I paste the details in my own "answer". I am not sure if the "static_transform_publisher" node is correctly defined since for both cameras, I use the same child_frame_id "zed_center". Is it correct?

emm, I have tried to use the ZED odometry by removing the rgbd_odometry node and remap the "odom" as you suggested based on the same code in my own "answer". But I receive the error "TF of received depth image 0 at time 1509441479.227963s is not set!". I am not sure how to fix...

base_link ->zed_center, as you set, would put both cameras exactly superposed. You would also want to set base_frame (zed1_center and zed2_center), camera_frame and depth_frame of zed_camera.launch to something different for both cameras, otherwise you will have multiple TF having the same name
