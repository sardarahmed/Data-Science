Q:

Has anyone tried integrating RTKLIB into ROS?

Rtklib is a software for the enhancement of precision of data derived from satellite positioning system. I am trying to integrate some features of this software in ROS. I had few questions on this so wanted to know if there is anybody who has worked on it before.
Rtklib information can be found on
http://www.rtklib.com/

A:

Yes, I recently found this package from ETH Zurich:
https://github.com/ethz-asl/rtklibros
You can even find the associated report in the repository: https://github.com/ethz-asl/rtklibros/blob/master/documents/Grieneisen_SA_Final.pdf
I don't know that you should expect centimeter-level accuracy online with something like the uBlox receivers, but it should be better than a single-ended solution.

@mjcarroll I am trying to display detected satellites in rviz/tf and I am encountering some problem. As you have worked on this so you might be able to help me here. I have opened the question on this link (http://answers.ros.org/question/70690/failing-to-displaying-information-in-tf/)

Hello, I am fairly new to ROS in general and have just finished all of the beginner tutorials. In search for an RTKLIB in ROS I came across this github link and the associated report but I have no clue where to start. Any advice about ROS or this package is helpful!
