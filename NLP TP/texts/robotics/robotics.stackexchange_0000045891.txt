A:

I didnt use that packagage but I assume u want to get a fake laserscan out of the kinect?
If I assume right you can use the node "depthimage_to_laserscan"
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-depthimage-to-laserscan

and then start the node with the param:
<launch>
    <include file="$(find openni_launch)/launch/openni.launch"/>
    
    <node pkg="depthimage_to_laserscan" type="depthimage_to_laserscan" name="convert">
        <remap from="image" to="camera/depth/image_raw"/>
    </node>
</launch>
