Q:

OSError when running roscore

I am new to ROS and trying to install everything correctly and test that roscore is working. I know there are previous questions like this, but none were able to fix my problem. I get the following error messages when running:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/indigo/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/roslaunch/__init__.py", line 307, in main

Can you clarify which OS this is? If this is Win10 with WSL, make sure to run a very recent build.

Yes Windows 10 and I got Ubuntu. Not sure why python is in the error messages

A:

Please see #q238646. You'll need to run a really recent Win10 build. Possibly even at least the Creators Update or an insiders build.

Also: could you please for the future remember to always mention at least the OS that you are running, and in cases of Win10/WSL mention that? I know the idea is that WSL is as-close-as-possible (sort-of) to a regular Linux kernel+userland, but that is not the case right now and there are multiple areas in which bugs/unimplemented features in WSL actually cause problems with software that otherwise is perfectly ok.
Without such information we cannot help you.

Edit:

Not sure why python is in the error messages

Well .. roscore and large parts of ROS are written in Python, so that would explain it.

Edit2:

Could you please explain what a recent Win10 build is and how I can get this correctly installed on my machine? Sorry, I'm very new to ROS.

This is not really a ROS-issue: Windows 10 is currently still being developed and the problem you report is in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). The ability to use the Bash shell as MS calls it was only added in relatively recent releases of Windows 10. The problem is that it is not a finished piece of functionality. Lots of things are still missing. Especially pieces that ROS needs to work under Win10/WSL.
Only in very recent releases has WSL matured enough for it to run ROS successfully. And most of those releases are not available without being on the Windows Insider program, and then specifically in the fast ring.
Bare-bones ROS appears to work relatively ok on Windows 10 build 16188, which was only released a week ago (2017-05-04). The error message that you included in your post suggests to me that you are on a relatively old release of Windows 10, as that specific issue was resolved in WSL a couple of releases ago.
To check which version you are running: win + r, then type winver and press enter. The dialogue that pops up should tell you the version and the build.

I looked at the referenced question above and couldnt really understand where to go from here
Comment by njames8 on 2017-05-11:
Mine is: Version 1607 (OS Build 14393.1198). So I need a newer build correct? If so, how can I get that? Thanks again for the help!
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-05-11:
Yes, you need a much more recent build. Yours is almost ancient (when it comes to WSL at least). As this is really no longer a ROS issue, I would advise you to search around a bit for how to get into the Insiders program. Be aware of all the consequences of that though.
