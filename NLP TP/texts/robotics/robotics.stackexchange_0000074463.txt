A:

Hello Himanshu,
You can access the x,y data of all the channels of sonar in the following manner.
` void sonarCallback(const sensor_msgs::PointCloud::ConstPtr& msg)
{
for(i=0;i<16;i++)
{
    datax=msg->points[i].x;
    datay=msg->points[i].y;
    ROS_INFO("[%f]",datax);
    ROS_INFO("[%f]",datay);
}
ROS_INFO("....");

}`
you can refer to the sensor_msgs/PointCloud for details.
