Q:

Issue with eros_python_tools and roscreate-qt-ros-pkg

I am having trouble with roscreate-qt-ros-pkg. I cannot manage to get it working. I got the package eros_python_tools as per these instructions; however, upon running the command to make a qt package, I get the following:
allenh1@allenh1-U50F:~/ros_workspace$ roscreate-qt-ros-pkg
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/allenh1/ros_workspace/eros_python_tools/scripts/roscreate-qt-ros-pkg", line 3, in <module>
    from ros import eros_python_tools
ImportError: cannot import name eros_python_tools

Did I do something wrong in my .bashrc or my setup.sh file?
Thanks,
-Hunter A.

Which ros version are you using (i.e. diamondback, electric, fuerte)?
Comment by allenh1 on 2012-04-06:
I am using fuerte.

A:

Eros is still catching up (due to the big change in build environment over electric and fuerte).
The same tools have migrated to qt_ros. If you're on ubuntu, just
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-qt-ros

and follow the instructions on the roswiki.

Hi, I am not trying to run roscreate-qt-pkg but I can into the same error with rostoolchain. I did install ros-fuerte-qt-ros but now I can't find rostoolchain. Did that get installed?

rostoolchain was in the old eros system. Your best bet is to upgrade to groovy and get familiar with catkin. That makes the cross compiling process natural (wrt cmake processes).
