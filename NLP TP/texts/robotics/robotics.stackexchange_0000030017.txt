Q:

Using version control git for ROS development

Hi,
I am in favor of git in using version control. I would like to know the best practise to do it since I have my own node (myNode) in /opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/myNode.
Should I wrapped the myNode folder/node with repo01.git(for example)? I mean the path now becomes /opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/repo01.git/myNode.
Is there any better way doing it?
Thanks in advance..

A:

Usually one does not write new nodes or code in the /opt/ros/<distro_release>/stacks/ area, but rather somewhere on the system when permissions are not an issue, e.g in the /home/<user>/, then you can let ros know of these packages but just doing export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:<path_to_own_packages>. For version control, say git one can then easily set up using git init in the say /home/<user>/packages directory.
