ROS Answers SE migration: ROS and C++11

Is C++11 currently supported by ROS? If not is this support planned for the near future?

A:

According to REP 3:
"We use the C++03 (ISO/IEC 14882:2003) standard, and are compiler-agnostic. While we mainly develop with gcc, no use of compiler-specific features is allowed without proper use of macros to allow use on other platforms.
Use of C++[0|1]x or tr1 features are only allowed if support for that feature is checked at compile time, and equivalent functionality exists without requiring C++[0|1]x code. A wholesale jump to C++[0|1]x will not happen until all commonly used OS platforms fully support it."

Distributions up to Jade use C++03, but Kinetic uses C++11. http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0003.html
