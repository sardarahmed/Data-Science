Q:

Get articulation from/to Rviz (Communicate with Rviz)

Hey there !
I'm working with Rviz modeling my robot.
what I want to do is to change there articulations depending on real robot articulation !
I already get the articulation from real robot in ROS, then all what I have to do is to apply those articulations in RViz
=> So my question is how can I do that !
The final resulat that I want to get is in this video:
Get exactly what I have in Rviz in real robot; like moving the real robot from Rviz !
NB: I already have a package that can get Cartesian coordinates and joints values from the real robot to ROS.

A:

If you have cartesian control of the robot already worked out, you can use an interactive marker in rviz to control the robot: http://wiki.ros.org/interactive_markers

I was thinking about Markers but actually I need little bit more details.
I already have an interactive marker in my arm-robot in the end effector.. so how could I start ? Do I need an interactive marker for each articulation ? Do I need to communicate with this/those markers ? if so how ?

I'm not sure about that, maybe someone with more experience in arm's can give you a pointer.
