Q:

How do i remove this error while executing publisher subscriber in ros?

i've got this error:
The specified base path "/home/dinesh/catkin_ws/src/beginner_tutorials" contains a package but "catkin_make" must be invoked in the root of workspace. 

How can i remove it? I'm trying to run the pub/sub program.

A:

As the error says catkin_make must be invoked in the root of the workspace. What this means is that you must change your directory to be in the root of the workspace before running catkin_make.
cd /home/dinesh/catkin_ws
catkin_make

The tutorials make reference to this behavior. Although I think they often leave out an explicit call to cd. Hope that helps!
