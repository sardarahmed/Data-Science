Q:

Has anyone installed Indigo on the rpi 2?

I got my rpi 2 yesterday and was wondering if the guide for installing indigo on the original rpi would work?

I just received mine and didn't have time to try yet but I would be very interested if you find an easy/convenient way to do it!
Seems that this is working: http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Installing%20ROS%20Indigo%20on%20Raspberry%20Pi
I'll give it a try in a few weeks

A:

Yes, the guide works. Make sure to install all the patches it mentions. It took a day or do to get a fully working installation.
I have ROS indigo working on the Pi 2B, including rviz. I'm still working on installing Gazebo and PCL.
If there is a suitable place to post it, I'm happy to post the complete OS image to save everyone a lot of time.
