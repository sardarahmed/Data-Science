Q:

tf2 view_frames under namespace

Hi community,
env: ROS2 Galactic
how can I view the frames of a name-spaced simulation ? the command ros2 run tf2_tools view_frames does not work when I set a namespace.

Thanks

I'm interested as well

A:

I've checked the package code and figure out that the command should be run like this:
ros2 run tf2_tools view_frames --ros-args -r __ns:=/robot1 -r /tf:=tf -r /tf_static:=tf_static
Where "robot1" is the targeted namespace.
