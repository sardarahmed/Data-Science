By reading documentation for SLAM launcher and for navigation launcher you can see, that only the first one launches SLAM. Second one only navigates TB3 on the map. As I understood, you want to have SLAM and navigation at the same time, right?

very close, but I mean when the robot turns around and the lidar will follow the robot turns. The lidar will not match the map. However, thank for your help

A:

SLAM is mapping here. And navigation is localization within a known (static) map. It does what it should do. You could take a look at slam_toolbox its an alternative to gmapping (used in your turlebot example), with many more features. It can expand/refine the map in multiple sessions, though I dont know if it can be done during localization.

Thank you for your the detail. I found my real problem is the robot moves in real, but the robot model is static and the direction keep from the north.
