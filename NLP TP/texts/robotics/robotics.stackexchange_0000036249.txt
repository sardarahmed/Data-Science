Q:

Publish a latched message in rosjava

Hi,
I am trying to publish a latched message in rosjava so that my arduino only receives a command when it is different than the preivous one. Currently, it is constantly polling and that makes my program not to work.
In roscpp, I know that you can set the boolean latch = true.
Is there an equivalent in rosjava?
Thanks.

Yes, see the javadoc here: http://rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/rosjava/doc/org/ros/node/topic/Publisher.html#setLatchMode(boolean)
