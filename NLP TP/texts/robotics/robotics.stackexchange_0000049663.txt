Q:

Error : Could not retrieve list of models from database?

Hi, I'm working with household_objects_database , Service [/objects_database_node/get_model_mesh] is available.
,but I got this error :

Could not retrieve list of models

I have downloaded the database manually from here:

and I'm not sure that I have put it in the right place !
