Q:

Add 3D visualizer in Ros-Qt project

I m using ROS noetic in Ubuntu 20.04 with Qt5. I m trying to develop a module to visualize point cloud data on a 3D visualizer. I noticed RViz utilises a 3D visualizer as highlighted in below image:

I m interested to integrate only that window in my Qt project. How can I include it?
I have worked earlier on similar project and used VTK library's 3D visualizer window plugin(QVTK Plugin) in Qt. Now I want to replace the VTK library dependency.

I m aware about the RViz's functionality and visualizing camera and point cloud data in it, I m trying to develop a Qt application which has a point cloud data visualizer, I can use RViz as well but it has lot of other functions which are not required.

in that case, RVIZ is also a library and it's open source: https://github.com/ros-visualization/rviz
Here is an example how to access some of the RVIZ functionality in C++: https://docs.ros.org/en/kinetic/api/librviz_tutorial/html/index.html
and in Python: https://docs.ros.org/en/indigo/api/rviz_python_tutorial/html/

I think that also can be helpful.

Follow of tutorial installation: sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-visualization-tutorials

Thanks @Osilva and @Ranjit Kathiriya, I m going through the RViz project and it is huge, for now I m going to survey, what is this window they are using, how to extract only the visualization part from the code and its dependencies.
