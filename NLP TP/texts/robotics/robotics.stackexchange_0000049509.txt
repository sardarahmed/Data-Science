A:

WHy are you building in /opt/ros/fuerte? If you installed from debs, then the package is already built. If you did a source checkout, you should not do it into /opt/ros.
simple_arms is building under Fuerte on the build farm, so I don't think there is currently anything broken in the repo. Where did you check your source out from?
