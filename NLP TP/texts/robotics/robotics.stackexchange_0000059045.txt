Q:

Error while loading nodelet [/velocity_multiplexer]

Hi,
I am using ROS fuerte version on Ubuntu 10.04. I use the velocity multiplexer (sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-yujin-ocs) designed by YujinRobot(http://wiki.ros.org/cmd_vel_mux). I modify the one header file and one cpp file in the installed package, to incorporate one more subsrciber (so that nodelet manager subcribes to amcl_pose topic).
I compile the code and it gets compiled perfectly.
root@ubuntu:/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/yujin_ocs/cmd_vel_mux# make
But when I RUN following command:
roslaunch cmd_vel_mux standalone.launch
The errors can be found below::

Some files that you may be interested are given below:::::
CMakeList.txt
http://pastebin.com/FfJaZF7v
nodelet_plugins.xml
http://pastebin.com/S1ZxgW9M
header file
http://pastebin.com/PcuNaWYm
Source cpp file
http://pastebin.com/gZUfqEu3
manifest.xml
http://pastebin.com/vS0w7Tiq
Question1:: why the error  says "Make sure that you are calling the PLUGINLIB_REGISTER_CLASS macro in the library code, and that names are consistent between this macro and your XML."???
Question2:: why new function APPEARS to be UNDEFINED?? Even if it is included in Header File and there is no problem in compiling the new package.
Please HELP
NOTE
In CMakeLists.txt (http://pastebin.com/zCzZ7fG6), even if we link directories explicitly, still '.so' file can't  figure it out where the cpp or header file

Is the function that it can't find implemented with exactly the same name?
Comment by RB on 2014-04-27:
I have uploaded the 'source cpp file with highlighted portion.' There is no such mistakes, I think.

A:

You're implementing your new function in the global namespace, rather than within the class.
In you cpp file, you have a global function:
void currentPosCallback(const geometry_msgs::PoseWithCovarianceStamped::ConstPtr& msg)

But it should be namespaced to your class:
void CmdVelMux::currentPosCallback(const geometry_msgs::PoseWithCovarianceStamped::ConstPtr& msg)
