Q:

ROS2 colcon build on windows no error message shown when it failed

I want to know what and where are the bugs  in my code,however, using the colcon build only show failed when there are something wrong.
I've tried colcon --log-level debug build or colcon build --log-level info build but still no error message shown
Is there any way to fix this out?

A:

Unfortunately the Visual Studio compiler outputs error messages to stdout instead of stderr. By default colcon build hides the stdout output and only shows stderr output.
You can configure the output using the option --event-handlers .... In this case you likely want to use console_cohesion+ to enable always outputting all output after a package has been finished. Another option would be console_direct+ but that would interleave the output from packages processed in parallel so only recommended when you build a single package.
