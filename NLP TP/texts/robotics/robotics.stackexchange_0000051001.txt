Q:

RGBDSLAM_freiburg : 'node not found' on groovy

I installed and built rgbdslam_freiburg as given in http://www.ros.org/wiki/rgbdslam. When I tried to execute the following command
roslaunch rgbdslam kinect+rgbdslam.launch
I got the following error:
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [rgbdslam/rgbdslam]: can't locate node [rgbdslam] in package [rgbdslam]
'roscd' is able to locate the package rgbdslam. It is found inside my catkin workspace, where I downloaded the code from this link http://alufr-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/rgbdslam_freiburg given in the tutorial
However
rosnode info rgbdslam
returns
cannot contact [/rgbdslam]: unknown node
I'm running ros groovy on Ubuntu 12.10

A:

Have you compiled it? It's not a binary download. See the wiki page for how to do it.

compiled it. but still it shows same error..
Comment by Felix Endres on 2014-01-23:
And compilation was successful, I assume. You have to find the binary then. Try searching in your workspace with "find -executable -name rgbdslam -type f".

I have the same problem. Compilation was succesful. Any update on this?
Also, I noticed that I can't use rosrun or roscd, altough I included "source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash" in my ~/.bashrc file. The other ros-commands are working.

I have migrated rgbdslam to hydro. Let me know whether you would like to test a probably unstable release.
Comment by leo pauly on 2014-02-22:
im running on ros hydro.but still the error continues
Comment by Felix Endres on 2014-02-25:
Leo: Please be specific. You are running what on ros hydro? The rgbdslam package from googlecode?
Comment by Felix Endres on 2014-02-25:
Michiel:Have you created a workspace and sourced the respective setup.bash, so that rgbdslam is in your package path? Check with "echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH"
Comment by pinocchio on 2014-03-26:
@leo pauly @Michiel @Felix Endres Do you use catkin workspace or rosbuild one? The instruction uses a rosbuild ws. I am not sure which is correct to install this package on hydro.
Comment by Felix Endres on 2014-03-27:
For fuerte I am using rosbuild. For the (yet unreleased) hydro version I use catkin
