Q:

Tutorial 15 - ExaminingServiceClient(python)

I've gone through the previous tutorials and am now having a problem with running the server.  After entering "rosrun beginner_tutorials add_two_ints_server.py" in the commmand line, I'm receiving the following error:
...
line 4, in <module>
    from beginner_tutorials.srv import *
ImportError: No module named beginner_tutorials.srv

A:

That tutorial assumes that you have completed these tutorials:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage

and
 http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingMsgAndSrv

If you have not completed these tutorials the beginner_tutorials package will not exist nor will beginner_tutorials.srv.

Also it should read "from beginner_tutorials import *".
