Q:

Incorrect gripper joint visualisation for Franka Panda

Hi,
I am using the Moveit Setup assistant to generate the inertial tags and manually adding the transmission tags to get a URDF for the Franka Panda to be used in ROS Sharp. ROS Sharp like gazebo requires the inertial and transmission tags to work and Franka ROS doesnt provide such a urdf or xacro which is why I used Moveit setup assistant to generate it.
When using it, the gripper's fingers (prismatic joints) move weirdly although the arm's revolute joints move perfect. I am not sure if this is an issue with the autogenerated URDF from the moveit setup assistant? To inquire if it is an issue with ROS Sharp I have posted an issue for it there.
Here is the urdf generated with MoveIt plus the transmission tags I have added. Also here is an image showing the weird gripper positions

Please attach images to your questions directly. If your google drive account or the files ever get deleted, this question loses quite a bit of its value.

Closing this as it has been solved in ROS Sharp Issue #176
