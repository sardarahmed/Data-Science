create inflated map

Dear ROS Users
is it possible to create an inflated map from a static map? It would be useful to know if a measurement of a laser sensor come from object in the map or not
Thank you!

A:

AFAIK no tool to edit map files for your specific purpose is provided by ROS. You can edit maps manually. See 1, 2 for example.
