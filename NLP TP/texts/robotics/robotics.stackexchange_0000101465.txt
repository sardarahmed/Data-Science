Q:

Actions example server for MicroRos Arduino

Hello,
Is the 'action's (vs publisher/subscriber and 'service' server/client) ready for use in MicroROS for Arduino? Is "https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro-ROS-demos/blob/galactic/rclc/fibonacci_action_server/main.c" the reference that can be used?
If above it true, then are the C++ examples under "https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro-ROS-demos/tree/galactic/rclcpp" also applicable? These examples seem to be pub/sub only, i.e. I do not see any examples of Service/Actions. Are there examples for Service/Actions as well that are elsewhere?

A:

Hello, actions should be usable in Galactic in Arduino but you will need to rebuild the library in order to adjust the number of entities required: Action server will need and an Action client will need 2 subscriptions and 3 service clients and Action server will need 3 service servers.
In any case, in Galactic you will need to use the RCL API, meanwhile, in Rolling (and in future releases) you have a new RCLC API, take a look here.
Regarding the C++ examples, they are not applicable. The micro-ROS API is RCLC and it's C99. In fact those examples has been deprecated.
