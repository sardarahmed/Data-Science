A:

If rosrun cannot locate the move_base node in the move_base package, then it is likely that the built version of the move_base package is not on the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.
Make sure the move_base package is on the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH (an environment variable). If it still doesn't work, then please post your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH and your CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.
