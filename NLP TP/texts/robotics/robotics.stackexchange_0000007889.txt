Q:

Forward kinematics of constrained double pendulum

I was wondering whether maybe you could help me with this problem. I have a double pendulum. I have set the origin of cartesian coordinates to be the "head" of the first arm, which is fixed. The end of the second arm is attached to a block that slides along the x-axis. What I want to do is to derive the equations relating the pendulum's angles with the distance from the origin to the block. 
Now, I know how I could go about deriving the equations without the constraint. 
$$x_1 = L_1cos(a_1)$$
$$y_1 = L_1sin(a_1)$$
Where $x_1$ and $y_1$ is where the first arm joins the second arm and $a_1$ is the angle between the horizontal and the first arm. 
Similarly, I can derive the equations for the end of the second arm 
$x_2 = x_1 + L_2 cos(a_2)$ and $y_2 = y_1 - L_2 sin(a_2)$
Now then, if I attach a sliding block to the end of my second arm, I don't know whether my equation for $x_2$ would change at all. I don't think it would but  would I have to somehow restrict the swing angles so that the block only moves along the x direction? 
Well, basically the problem is finding the equation of $x_2$ if it's attached to a block that only moves along the x- direction.

What you are describing is a crankshaft.

if I attach a sliding block to the end of my second arm, I don't know whether my equation for $x_2$ would change at all. 

No it wouldn't, because your restraint:

the second arm is attached to a block that slides along the x-axis

doesn't restrain $x_2$ but $y_2$
"Being on the x axis" basically means $y = 0$, which in your case means $y_2 = 0$, which is where you "lose" the second degree of freedom.
Take a look at the following image:

The formula for the relation between $x$ and $\varphi$ in the image is:
$$x=l_1\cos \varphi + l_2 \sqrt{1-\left(\frac{l_1}{l_2}\right)^2 \sin^2 \varphi}$$
To get there:

use the Pythagorean theorem for the second summand in the formula
for $x_2$ instead of trigonometry
replace $y_1$ with its definition

$$
\begin{align}
x_2 &= x_1 +  \sqrt{l_2^2 - \underset{\overbrace{l_1\sin\varphi}}{y_1^2}}\\
\end{align}$$
The relationship between the two angles can be derived from their shared opposite side in their respective triangles:
$$l_1\sin a_1 = l_2\sin a_2$$ 
$$ a_1 = \arcsin \left(\frac{l_2}{l_1}\sin a_2\right)$$
