Q:

ros serial Arduino, Propeller

I was hoping to get ROS-serial and the Arduino working together -  but I keep getting stuck with the librxtx.  There always seems to be a version mismatch between the architecture and the module.
Also, has anyone got ROS serial working with the parallax propeller chip -  it seems to be a much more capable controller than the Arduino

I have solved lib errors these issues by loading a new ros (diamondback,  and new libboost.
Now I am getting a traceback import error on serial_node.py  no module rosserial_msgs.msg
thanks.
