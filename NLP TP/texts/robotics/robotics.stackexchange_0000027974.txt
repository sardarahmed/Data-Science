Q:

How to add a gps plugin using gazebo ui?

Hi,
I have an iRobot Create that I could spawn into gazebo, and I would like to add a gps plugin to it in gazebo so as to send the robot to a specific gps location (within gazebo-world).
Any help with this, would be highly appreciated!
Many thanks!

A:

Unfortunately, there's no easy way of doing this through the UI at the moment.
Your best bet is to directly edit the SDF file to add the sensor plugin. This tutorial has a contact sensor plugin example.
