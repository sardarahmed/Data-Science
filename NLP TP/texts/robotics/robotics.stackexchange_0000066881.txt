Q:

Z-coordinate has to be 1 or -1

Hello,
I'm starting to build a map using gmapping, but whenever I start slam_gmapping, the following warning is shown:
Laser has to be mounted planar! Z-coordinate has to be 1 or -1, but gave: 0.00000

This is one of the published transformations:
<node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="link2_broadcaster" args="0 0 0.1 0 0 0 1 base_link camera_link 100" />

When I change the X argument into 1 or -1 the warning is gone! I don't know why!.But I'm sure there is something wrong!! and  I need the X to be 0.
any idea?
UPDATE:
These are the frames in rviz:

and I cannot change the values of the orientation in rviz.

A:

That error message is a bit confusing. It is just saying that the plane of the laser needs to be parallel to the ground plane. I would check the transform chain you are using (i.e., what is the orientation of base_link) and make sure it has z facing directly up or down. You can do this in rviz using the tf plugin.
if you're curious, the code producing the error message can be found here
