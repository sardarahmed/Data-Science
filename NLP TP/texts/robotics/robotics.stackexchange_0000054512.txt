Q:

Simulating a person for use with Turtlebot_simulator and turtlebot_follower

Running Ros Hydro and Gazebo 1.9
How would I go about creating a human model or even just something similar that would allow the follower package to work effectively.
I just need to have marginal control over the path the simulated human takes, something like, walk in a square over and over again.
Thanks.

A:

It is rather easy to add static human 3D models from google sketchup, for instance see http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=45a705cf8bbfbcc771a53b84547e90a&ct=mdsa&prevstart=0, following instructions in this gazebo tutorial. These models are quite realistic and face detectors work well with them. Nevertheless, how to animate them is an open question that we are interest in too.

This looks great, I don't necessarily need it animated. I would settle for just having move my sliding along the ground. I'm assuming this won't be too hard. If you have any pointers, let me know.
