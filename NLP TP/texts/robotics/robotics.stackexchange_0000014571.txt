Q:

Between which joints does a given DH table row represent?

Say for example
                          __
         _____           |  |          ____
--------|_____|----------|  |---------|____
                         |__|

That ASCII art is supposed to represent a "rolling" revolute joint followed by a "Yawing" revolute joint, followed by the tool frame. 
Would the rows in the DH table represent
BASE-J1
J1-J2

Or would they represent
J1-J2
J2-Tool Frame

A:

tl;dr
The rows (I guess you refer a row to a set of 4 DH-parameters) represent, roughly speaking, every link. So it's  BASE-J1, J1-J2, and J2-Tool Frame.

When deriving DH parameters, the base frame usually situates at the robot base, where it is mounted on to floor. This DH convention is a convention that tells you how you put reference frames on a robot. How many frames you need (apart from the base frame) depends on how many joints there are. This corresponds to how many links you have.
So for a 2 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) robot as shown, you would have 3 sets of DH parameters. Each set, consisting of link length, link twist, link offset, and joint angle, describes each link.
