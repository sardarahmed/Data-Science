Q:

Error launching "pepper_bringup pepper_full.launch"

Hello !
Thank you for viewing this question.
I have recently tried to launch pepper_bringup pepper_full.launch on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. I use ROS kinetic.
But I couldn't connect to pepper. In this August, I could connect to pepper that command.
When I tried it in this November , it was failed !
I was following this site from http://wiki.ros.org/pepper_bringup
Please help me !!
$ roslaunch pepper_bringup pepper_full.launch nao_ip:=192.168.11.24 network_interface:=wlp2s0

Please use the Preformatted Text button (the one with 101010 on it) to properly format console copy/pastes, launch files and code. That makes things much easier to read. Just select the text and press the button (or ctrl+k).
Thanks.

Thank you for your comments.
I changed text format.

A:

I try "roslaunch pepper_bringup pepper_full_py.launch ... "    I succeed in connecting to pepper !
But I cannot "roslaunch pepper_bringup pepper_full.launch..." .
I edit "pepper_full.launch" file after.
<launch>

  <arg name="nao_ip"              default="$(optenv NAO_IP)" />
  <arg name="nao_port"            default="$(optenv NAO_PORT 9559)" />

  <arg name="roscore_ip"          default="127.0.0.1" />
  <arg name="network_interface"   default="eth0" />

  <arg name="namespace"           default="pepper_robot" />

  <!-- naoqi driver -->
  <include file="$(find naoqi_driver)/launch/naoqi_driver.launch"  >
    <arg name="nao_ip"            value="$(arg nao_ip)" />
    <arg name="nao_port"          value="$(arg nao_port)" />
    <arg name="roscore_ip"        value="$(arg roscore_ip)" />
    <arg name="network_interface" value="$(arg network_interface)" />
  </include>

  <!-- launch pose manager -->
  <include file="$(find naoqi_pose)/launch/pose_manager.launch" ns="$(arg namespace)/pose" >
    <arg name="nao_ip"            value="$(arg nao_ip)" />
    <arg name="nao_port"          value="$(arg nao_port)" />
  </include>

  <!-- launch perception -->
  <include file="$(find pepper_bringup)/launch/perception.launch.xml">
    <arg name="namespace"         value="$(arg namespace)" />
  </include>

</launch> 

I can launch "pepper_full.launch" !
