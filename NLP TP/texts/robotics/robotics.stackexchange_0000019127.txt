Q:

Is Ultrasonic Self Balancing Robot Possible?

a quick question, can i make a SBR using UNO and two HC-SR04 knowing that this configuration offers a 1.36 mm resolution  (i.e it increment 1.36mm) ?

A:

Probably not - it can take about 60ms to get a reading from those sensorsâ€ , which is quite slow for the loop updating a balancing robot.
