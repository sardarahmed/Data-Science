Q:

Where can I find this lib --> libgazebo_ros_gpu_laser.so

Hey guys, I am searching for this particular library here:
libgazebo_ros_gpu_laser.so
I have it on my pc and wanted to transfer my program to another one. I guess I could just copy the file itself, but I am pretty sure this is not how I got it in the first place (it is located at /opt/ros/hydro/lib). So I guess I installed some ros package, which included this library. Does anyone of you nice smart people know which one that might have been? Maybe one of the PR2 packages?
Thanks a lot
Marcus

Alright, thanks, I guess it was always there, but not working the same way as on my other pc -->everytime I try to access the plugin for the hokuyo this way my node crashes :(
But thanks again,
Marcus

Sounds like that is an issue for another question. This one is answered then?

Yup, this question was answered and I solved my other problem by choosing another lib (dunno why, but now it works). Anyways, thanks again and I flagged your response as an answer :)
