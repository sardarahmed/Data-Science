Q:

how to generate documentation for msg/srv files using rosdoc

Hi
I want to generate Msg/Srv API documentation for my local ROS package. I run
$./rosdoc -o docPATH <package>

But I only see documentation for autogenerated code from srv.
Thank you in advance.

A:

Did you run rosmake before running rosdoc?  The msg and srv documentation requires the generated outputs.
