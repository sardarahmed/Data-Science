Q:

can a Robot with ROS_comm draw map using SLAM?

Hi everyone,
I am new to ROS, i have used to for small projects but i still did not understand it very well.
I have a Robot with raspberry pi on it( raspbian jessie ). i have installed ROS Kinetic  and the ros_comm package.
i followed this page
http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Installing%20ROS%20Kinetic%20on%20the%20Raspberry%20Pi
and i will install the gmapping package. my question is, is that enough to run gmapping ? or do i have to install the
ROS Desktop ?
because from what i understood the ros_comm have no GUI tools. but i have seen people run SLAM on their computers and the rviz instead of running on the robot.
Sorry if i am missing major concept in ROS but i am learning, thank you

A:

Map making composes of two main modules .

Actual mapiing
Localization

Mapping is straight forward if you have a Kinect like sensor (RGB-D) , publish the topics and feed it to gmapping module .
The tricky part is that with the Odometry , odometry can be achieved vai a couple of ways

Encoders + IMU fusion (EKF based)
Visual Odometry (rtabmap , ORB-SLAM2...)

If you are lucky enough to have a 360degree lidar , you can use hector mapping (This is a slam algorithm which works without encoder feedback )

thanks a lot for the help. yeah i actually happen to have put my hand on RPLIDAR A1.
i will try to look and understand how i can integrate everything together
