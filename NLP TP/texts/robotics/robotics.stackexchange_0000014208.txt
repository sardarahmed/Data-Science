Q:

Can Lego Mindstorms EV3 be run on Intel Atom 1.33 GHz CPU?

The specifications at Lego official site here say that Dual Core 2.0GHz CPU or better is needed. Still, maybe quad core with 1.8 GHz (like Prestiogio Multipad Visconte's Intel Atom quad core) would work smoothly enough?
Have anyone tried to run Lego Mindstorms EV3 on such kind of CPU?

A:

Most probably, yes but performance will be slow because you have a very slow CPU. You can increase performance of the software by disabling visual effects in Windows and by closing background apps.
