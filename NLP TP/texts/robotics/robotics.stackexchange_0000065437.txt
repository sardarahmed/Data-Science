Q:

Could you please help me understand the error log?

Hi everyone,
I am completely new to ROS or any distribution computing system for that matter.
I was working with my tutorials from class. When I tried to build using catkin_make, I encountered an error.
Since I have never worked with ROS before, I don't understand what the error log says, thus have no idea what the root of the error is.
Could someone kindly tell me why the error has occurred and how could I solve it?
Here's the error that occurs.

Thanks in advanced for you help.

A:

This error is telling you that the file /home/mechuser/catkin_ws/src/beginner_tutorials/action/DoDishes.action doesn't exist. Does it? If it does, are the permissions correct (owned by you)?
