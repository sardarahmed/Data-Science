Q:

A lost and confused newbie - installation

I am new to Linux, Ubuntu, and ROS.  From the installation page:
I ran this in the terminal, and there were no problems:
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu lucid main" > /etc/apt  /sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
And no problems with this:
sudo apt-get update
I ran this a couple of times in the terminal:
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-desktop-full
and the terminal gave this:
Reading package list...  Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information...  Done
ros-fuerte-desktop-full is already the newest version.
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 13 not upgraded.
Now what?  Remember, I am clueless about the whole thing.  I am running Ubuntu 12.04.

That means you've completed the installation. Good start!
The tutorials are the thing to do next.
