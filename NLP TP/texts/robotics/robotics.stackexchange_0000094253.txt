:P oops Sorry , Thanks for the help :)

A:

So whe i type
 /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash

is that a verbatim copy-paste of the command you're trying to use?
If so: that's not the correct command. You'll want to use source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash or . /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash (note the first dot there).
Also note: Indigo is EOL. Ubuntu Trusty is also EOL.
