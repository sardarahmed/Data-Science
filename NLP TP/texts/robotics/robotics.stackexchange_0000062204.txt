Q:

Using Motoman MH6 with ROS On-the-fly path planning

I am interested to work with ROS and a Motoman MH6 DX100 robot about On-the-fly path planning. This robot model isn't available yet, but I want to include it. However, I dont know what we need in order to do it (I read something about MotoPlus SDK, MotoROS, a ROS package) but I amn't really sure with this.  Thank you
