Q:

Draw a circle with a robotic arm?

I believe the technical term for this would be "arm navigation planning with hard dynamic geometric constraints". But my question would be how can I implement trajectory planning of a circle or similar geometric path with a robotic arm?
Using a series of concentrated waypoints in the arm navigation would be one way I would guess. But slow to compute and carry out?
To want to draw a circle or other geometric object with a robotic arm seems fairly fundamental, yet it actually appears to be quite complicated.
Any advice?

I don't work with arms but I suppose you can set something similar to a nav_msgs/Path sampling your trajectory.

A:

Look at the ROS Scan and Plane application from ROS-Industrial.
you can use the Descartes planner for that.
Here is a link to the ROS-Industrial training examples.
I just took the training and I made a UR-5 Arm follow a complex trajectory.  Getting the robot to move in a circle will be very easy to do.  You need to feed the Descartes planner a list of trajectory points for your circle and it will take care of the rest.

Review Session 4 and then do
Application Demo - Descartes Planning and Execution
that will get you want you need.
