Q:

ROS2 runtime launch of nodes

Hi!
I have a need to run ROS nodes from other ROS nodes at runtime. Composition look like that I need. But it using C++ and rclcpp. My nodes are written in Python. Does ROS2 have ways to run nodes at runtime from other nodes for python?
Thanks!

A:

Managed and life-cycle nodes are currently not supported in Python, as far as I know. See also #q328772 -- I don't believe the situation has changed.
The Features Status page seems to confirm this:

Composition of node components at compile-, link- or dlopen-time: Currently only in C++.

It might be possible to load ROS 2 Python nodes at runtime using some Python 'tricks', but it would not seem to be officially supported at this point.

We could wait for other board members to respond.
They may know of a way I'm not aware of.
