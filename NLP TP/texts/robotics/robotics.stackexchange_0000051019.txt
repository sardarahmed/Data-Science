Q:

tf frames in different time epoch from ros time?

I am trying to tackle the following warning when running Navigation:
[ WARN] [1368081077.201722266]: Could not get robot pose, cancelling reconfiguration
[ WARN] [1368081077.401579990]: Costmap2DROS transform timeout. Current time: 1368081077.4015, global_pose stamp: 136.4000, tolerance: 0.3000

The transform timed out because the time & the pose stamp are extremely different. Are they in different time epochs? If so, how can that be solved?
Thanks,
Ernest

A:

You're probably running Gazebo and missing the use_sim_time parameter. Try the following:

roscore
rosparam set use_sim_time true
Now start launching the rest of your system.

The explanation is that the navigation stack was probably launched before the use_sim_time parameter was set (so it uses wall time: 1368081077.4015), and the thing publishing the TF transforms was launched afterwards (so it uses sim time: 136.4000).
