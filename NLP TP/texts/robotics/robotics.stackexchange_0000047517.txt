Q:

Installing ROS fuerte on Fedora 17

Hello,
I am installing ROS fuerte in fedora 17 following the installation guide at http://www.ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Installation/Fedora
I have no problem until step 1.4, when I run rosdep install -a I get the following errors:

ERROR: the following packages/stacks
could not have their rosdep keys
resolved to system dependencies:
roslaunch: No definition of
[python-yaml] for OS version [17]

python_qt_binding: No definition of [ros] for OS [fedora]

simmechanics_to_urdf: No definition of [python-yaml] for OS version [17]

rviz: No definition of [ros] for OS

[python-yaml] for OS version [17]
librviz_tutorial: No definition of [ros] for OS [fedora]
rviz_plugin_tutorials: No definition of [ros] for OS [fedora]

I have also add the yaml file on ticket #3929 with no luck.
System information: Fedora 17 64bits
Thank you very much. Regards!

A:

Fedora support is experimental.  You will probably need to [contribute definitions[(http://ros.org/doc/independent/api/rosdep/html/contributing_rules.html) before rosdep will work for your packages.
