Q:

How do i switch between planners at runtime

I need to be able to switch between two planners based at runtime based on some logic devised.
How exactly do i do this if both are ros nodes?
(Is it possible to do this even if these nodes are not registered as planners)

A:

If you are talking about move_base local_planners, you cannot switch between runtime out-of-the-box.
What you could do is to write a "Default plugin" which allows you to take in Topics/Services/Actions from a stand-alone node, and handle switching via a state machine or something.
Also, there are two new approaches that extend move_base and could help you with this, that might be worth investigating (however, I cannto guarantee for anything ;-) ):

nav_core2 by locusrobotics link
