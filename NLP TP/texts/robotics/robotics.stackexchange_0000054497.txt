Q:

ImportError: No module named 'rospkg' on hydro 

Hi poeple,
In installed ros-hydro on ubuntu 13.04.
I am trying to get the "morse-simulation":  http://www.openrobots.org/wiki/morse/
to work with ros hydro. but I always get an error message when starting my simulation (for example the "tutorial-1-ros.py"):
[helpers.loading] Module not found: Could not import some ROS modules. Check your ROS configuration is ok. Details:
No module named 'rospkg'
[helpers.loading] Could not load the class RosRequestManager in morse.middleware.ros_request_manager
[helpers.loading] Could not create an instance of morse.middleware.ros_request_manager.RosRequestManager

when running "import ros" in python3 i get:
>>> import ros
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/opt/ros/hydro/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ros/__init__.py", line 41, in <module>
    import roslib
  File "/opt/ros/hydro/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/roslib/__init__.py", line 50, in <module>
    from roslib.launcher import load_manifest
  File "/opt/ros/hydro/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/roslib/launcher.py", line 42, in <module>
    import rospkg
ImportError: No module named 'rospkg'

any idea for a solution of this problem?

What if I do not use catkin? Because all along I am using rosbuild. Sorry if making any inconvenient I am a new programmer.

A:

well.. after some more tinkering I found out how to solve this.
I found a solution for the problem:
it seems that python3 finds ros, but it does not find specifically the packages rospkg, catkin_pkg and yaml, which are required for morse-simultion to work.
Thus you can just do:
after using virtualenv for a virtual python3 installation you can just do:
pip-3.3 install catkin_pkg rospkg yaml

(if yaml installation does not work this way, then just do sudo apt-get install python3-yaml)
After that reconfigure morse with the new python directories (in my case /home/user/bin/python3.3) and everything should work fine.

You should edit this, and place the answer here..

I second to @trinighost; separating question and answers makes it so easier for other readers to find what was the effective solution/workaround. I've moved the finding to this answer.
