Q:

Converting Collada to urdf

When running rosrun urdf check_urdf my_collada.dae, I get this error.
COLLADA error: Trying to load an invalid Collada version for this DOM build

I have looked at the source in collada_parser and urdf and cannot seem to find which version is required (I have tried 1.4.0 and 1.5.0)
I need to be publishing joints on /tf, so I want to convert my Collada file into an URDF, which robot_description  requires as input.
Will this method work on a full-robot model with kinematic information, or would I have to convert each part to an urdf?
Here's a link to an example file that gives the error
Thanks

Can you post the model, or a similar one that gives you the same error?

A:

Perhaps I am misunderstanding something, but as I see it you are testing a COLLADA format to see if it is URDF. They are two different formats. You can include a reference to a .dae file within a URDF file as a link, but .dae themselves are not URDF.
I would recommend you check out this excellent video on URDF from ROSCON

At 15:30 in the video you will see the format to include .dae into your URDF file. I've followed this, and it works perfectly. I have about 10 different mesh links in my URDF with no problems.

Except it's possible to load a COLLADA file and construct a C++ URDF object with this library: http://www.ros.org/wiki/collada_parser

@jbohren Exactly, the ideal would be to support full kinematic chains, as mentioned here, but right now I am just going for a simple shape
