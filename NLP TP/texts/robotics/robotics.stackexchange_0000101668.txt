Q:

IMU shows continuous slow spin around z axis

I am trouble shooting this problem and I thought maybe someone else had seen it. I have an 9250 IMU installed, callibrated and launched through an IMU node. When I display the TFs in RVIZ they look right. When I move the robot around in the air, they seem to be right. But when I place the robot stationary on a table, the z-axis is slowly spinning around. Any immediate thought on where my problem might be?

A:

It's called 'drift' and it's quite standard for IMUs to have, especially one as inexpensive as the one you're using.
Usually the way to solve this is to do some sort of sensor fusion between multiple sensors. That way you can (partly) compensate for the drift.
More expensive IMUs have less drift, but that's more often than not some sort of software in the IMU that tries to filter out the noise.
