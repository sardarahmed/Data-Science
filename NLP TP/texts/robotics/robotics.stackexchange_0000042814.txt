Q:

RGBDSLAM Fuerte rosmake problem

Hi, I have been fighting to rosmake the RGBDSLAM tutorial, and I have fixed many problems already. However, I am stuck at this point. I have checked the many other errors that are being asked about, and this doesn't seem to have come up. Does anyone know how to fix the following errors from the build (it looks like I am missing a stack or something)?

Thank you for the reply. The post you have linked is what I have used to solve many of the problems up to this point, however the missing declarations in glviewer don't seem to have been addressed yet. I was hoping someone could give me some more information about what is missing.

A:

RGBDSLAM is not yet released to Fuerte.
You may get some help from this question.
