Q:

View Angle plugin missing from Gazebo Garden install

I'm a beginner at Gazebo and I was trying to install Gazebo Garden for Linux (specifically Ubuntu). I can launch the program fine, manipulate the shapes in shapes.sdf, but when I try to use the View Angle plugin I get the following error:
[GUI] [Err] [Plugin.cc:147] Failed to instantiate QML file [:/ViewAngle/ViewAngle.qml].

file::/ViewAngle/ViewAngle.qml:220:5: IgnSpinBox is not a type

I don't know if this is relevant but ROS installed a version of Gazebo Fortress with ros-humble-desktop-full. I want to use the latest version though so I want to figure out if I can use Garden.
Thanks.

I think this is a bug with a fix here: https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-sim/pull/1877
