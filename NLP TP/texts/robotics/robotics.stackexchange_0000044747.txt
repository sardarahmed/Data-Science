Is this for a class?
Comment by kush6791 on 2012-10-10:
No it's for the mini project to be submitted at the end of the semester.

Then if you're really confused, go talk to your professor or TA.

A:

The ROS tutorials are always a good starting point.
Essentially, you will have to write an android node that fills and periodically publishes a turtlesim/Velocity message on the correct topic.

I've studied the ros tutorials and i've also run turtlesim using the keyboard but how to connect the android mobile to give the same instruction as are given using roscore -> turtlesim turtlesim_node ->turtlesim turtle_teleop_key

You need to implement an android app that uses rosjava and publishes the same data as turtle_teleop_key. But please note that rosjava is still under heavy development and should be considered as unstable.
