Q:

Package for Generically Listening to Topics

Is there a way to get a list of topics while running a node.  For example, if a new message is published, is there a way to programmatically get the topic name posted (equivalent to running rostopic list in a terminal).

A:

I used this to add topics of a certain type to a GUI selector:
ros::master::V_TopicInfo ti;
if(ros::master::getTopics(ti)) {
    for(ros::master::V_TopicInfo::iterator it = ti.begin(); it != ti.end(); it++) {
        if(it->datatype == _topicType)
            ui.topicsList->addItem(it->name.c_str());
    }
}

Looks good to me.  I will try it and see if it works for my needs.  However, I may also need to do this in python.  I figured before I start digging I could ask if you knew of a solution for that as well?

Yes and no: I don't have code, but there are python APIs that do exactly the same thing. If you can't find that easily in the rospy documentation, just see what rostopic list does.

So I setup and have the ability to get topics whether it be C++ or python.  I started looking further through the code to see if there was a way to listen for a new topic as a callback (similar to subscriber), versus a ROS loop, but did not see one.  Curious if I just missed it?

You want something that tells you if a new topic has come up? I don't think that exists. So you'd probably need to keep polling.

That is what I assumed.  I just made a polling method to take care of it.  Thanks.
