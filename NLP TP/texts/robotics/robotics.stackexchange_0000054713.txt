Q:

hector package problems

I have ros hydro full and I installed the hector_slam package with the command
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-hector-slam
I then tried to follow the tutorial but I had several problems.
when I try the command "rosmake hector_slam" I get multiple errors like this:
"[ rosmake ] WARNING: The stack "hector_geotiff" was not found. We will assume it is using the new buildsystem and try to continue..."
I think it does not work because in the end it says:
"[ rosmake ] Built 0 packages with 0 failures."
I continued the tutorial after this because I have no ideia on what to do, and I did the command
"roslaunch hector_slam_launch tutorial.launch"
It gives me the following error:
"while processing /opt/ros/hydro/share/hector_geotiff/launch/geotiff_mapper.launch:
Invalid roslaunch XML syntax: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: u'/opt/ros/hydro/share/hector_geotiff/launch/geotiff_mapper.launch'"
I really lost now. I can't even start the tutorial.
thx so much for the help.

A:

I don't know if its against the rules responding to my own question, but I solved the problem.
The sudo apt-get command doesn't update the hector_slam library.
It's not the most recent one. I found that there are missing files in the hector_geotiff paste.

It's great to answer your own question.  This will help anyone who has the same problem, and others won't spend time trying to answer it again.

Where did you find the missing files? It sounds like there's a bug in the hector_slam packaging.
