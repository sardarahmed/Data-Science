Q:

Assigning mass property to collision objects in MoveIt

Hello everyone,
I just want to confirm if there is a way to assign mass property to collision objects in MoveIt?
Thank you

A:

No. There isn't.
To avoid an xy-problem: what is it you're actually trying to do / solve?

Thank you for your answer and apologies for not including the complete task in the question. I am trying to create a scene with objects of different weights and use a robotic arm (panda) to pick from one location and place it to another site. The objective is to find the energy/power consumed by the robot in various pick and place movements of weighted objects.

MoveIt's default planners do not take dynamics into account, so they will not create different plans with "different payloads".
For simulating dynamics you'd perhaps be better off with using an actual dynamics simulator, such as Gazebo or Webots.
