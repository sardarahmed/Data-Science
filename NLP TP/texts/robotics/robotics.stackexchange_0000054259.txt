Q:

can't create actionlib client

Hey, I'm kinda new to this as well as c++ so plz bear with me.
I'm trying to get a simple_action_client working in roscpp, but cant seem get the template constructor to accept my action. Here's an example:
#include <ros/ros.h>
#include <control_msgs/JointTrajectoryAction.h>
#include <actionlib/client/simple_action_client.h>

typedef  actionlib::SimpleActionClient<control_msgs::JointTrajectoryAction> Client_t;

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  ros::init(argc, argv, "move_joints", ros::init_options::AnonymousName);
  ros::NodeHandle nh
  ros::AsyncSpinner spinner(1);
  spinner.start();
  Client_t client;
[  ....   ]

It's giving me a "no matching function" error for the client typdef. Looking at the api documentation does not tell me much. I'm confused as an equivalent python script such as the following works just fine:
import rospy
import actionlib
from control_msgs.msg import *
from trajectory_msgs.msg import *

def main():
   rospy.init_node("move_joints", anonymous=True, disable_signals=True)
   client = actionlib.SimpleActionClient('follow_joint_trajectory',FollowJointTrajectoryAction)
  [...]

Any suggestions?

A:

You need to specify the action.
Do this (if you want to call the action 'follow_joint_trajectory'):
Client_t client("follow_joint_trajectory", true);

This actionlib tutorial is very easy and well written.

Thanks for the response. That was pretty silly of me to overlook that. I'll be more scrupulous next time :)
