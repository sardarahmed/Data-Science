I install rosjava from her but it is in my_workspace
http://docs.rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/rosjava_core/html/installing.html
, but still get the same error
http://answers.ros.org/question/46915/problem-in-knowrob/
so what is the the proposed solution ?!!

A:

There are two versions of rosjave, one based on a JNI wrapper around roscpp and one native implementation written by Google. You can get the former one with
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-rosjava-jni

Note that when you already installed knowrob from debian packages (sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-knowrob), you will have it installed already.
For installing rosjava_core, follow the install instructions here.

Your question was just about how to install rosjava. You do not provide enough information about any other problem.
