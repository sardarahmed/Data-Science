Q:

Transferring Images through rosbridge

I am using the rosbridge websocket server to establish communication between ROS and an environment simulation tool. I can easily exchange scalar values like the object list and the control signals.
Now I want to transfer the images from the camera of the environment simulation tool to ROS, also through the rosbridge.
Is there a small example ?

A:

roslibpy works exactly the same as roslibjs, so you could -most likely- check this example using roslibjs for video publishing (using message type sensor_msgs/CompressedImage) and adapt it to roslibpy, all the subscribing part should be almost identical, then the decoding will be python-specific, but it should not be any problem.

@gonzalocasas thank you for this example. One question here... is it necessary to use the (sensor_msgs/CompressedImage) as the message type ? Cant i use the normal (sensor_msgs/Image)

you can also use image, of course, but you'd need to adapt it to do the corresponding decoding.
