Thanks!  I have a lenovo thinkpad w520 which comes with nvidia quadro card but I did not install any additional drivers. It is currently using the default ubuntu drivers.  I did not see nvidia drivers for quadro board on the list of nvidia drivers anyway.

check if your GPU is properly installed, here is a way: install mesa utils $ sudo apt-get install mesa-utils and then run $ glxgears
