Q:

usb_cam and image_view keeps giving "videre INI" error

I'm using usb_cam and image_view packages to capture images from a usb camera. However, after I launch the nodes, the image_saver node in image_view package keeps giving me the same errors:
Videre INI format can only save calibrations using the plumb distortion model. Use the YAML format instead.

I did some research, and guess that it is complaining that I did not supply a calibration yaml file when launching the node.

A:

Just a try out, can you check the package.xml in camera_calibration_parsers? Is the build and run dependent are "yaml-cpp". if not, try changing it to "yaml-cpp" as follows It might help.
(I am using ros-kinetic)
<build_depend>yaml-cpp</build_depend>
 <run_depend>yaml-cpp</run_depend>
For Navigating to "camera_calibration_parsers" type the following command:
rospack camera_calibration_parsers
