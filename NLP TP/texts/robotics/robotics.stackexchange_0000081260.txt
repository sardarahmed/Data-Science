Q:

Nextage ros bridge simulation issue

Hi everyone,
I think this is not a question, but a suggestion.
I have been following rtmos tutorials, and I found an Issue with in the http://wiki.ros.org/rtmros_nextage/Tutorials/Operating%20Hiro%2C%20NEXTAGE%20OPEN "Running ROS process, operating via scripts and GUI.", and specifically, in the third part: "Run python script for interactive operation".
The point is that when I run a simulation with:
ipython -i `rospack find nextage_ros_bridge`/script/nextage.py 
It always return error to connect with my simulation model.
At this point, I found the path to the main.wrl modelfile, so I satarted to use this in calls to nextage.py script by:
ipython -i `rospack find nextage_ros_bridge`/script/nextage.py -- --modelfile  /opt/ros/indigo/share/nextage_description/models/main.wrl
Checking the nextage.py script, I figured out what was happening, and is that modelfile hardcode does not exists on my system (I have installed all following tutorials).
Now I have changed the path to  /opt/ros/indigo/share/nextage_description/models/main.wrl  
and everything works as described in tutorials.
I have been reading how to suggest a change  but I am not sure how to proceed, so if anyone can explain me how to proceed or suggest this change himself I would be really thankful.

Thanks for pointing that out. While I agree that particular error is annoying and could be confusing for novice users, all system should be working without significant issue despite the error message. I opened a ticket on the devel repository to discuss any improvement.
