Q:

Which 6D pose estimation package works best and will be supported?

I have seen several different solutions to 6D pose estimation in ROS/opencv:
checkerboard_detector
checkerboard_detector2
checkerboard_pose_estimation
datamatrix
fiducial
datamatrix seems less accurate than the checkerboard approach, but the checkerboard packages seem to no longer be supported.  The fiducial package seems new (used in the tod_training contest), but there is no documentation.
Is willow/openCV settling on the fiducial package?  I'd like to choose the one that works best right now and also won't disappear any time soon...
Thanks!

A:

We have used fiducial markers from tod_training for collecting training data and pose estimation and it worked fine so far (using object_recognition in SVN 50321).
