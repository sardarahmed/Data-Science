Q:

best practice for multi robot simulation

Hi,
Could anybody let me know what is the best practice for multi-robot simulation in ROS ?
I want to simulate both an aerial vehicle and a ground vehicle in gazebo, and control them for the missions such as path-following and tracking objects.

To get meaningful answers, you need to say a lot more about what you are trying to accomplish.

I edited the previous one about what to do for multi-robot simulation.

Incase you had not seen, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UmtylLDErQ shows multi robot simulation in stage (not in gazzebo)

A:

You might also be interested in the MORSE simulator:

I remember a video where Gilberto Echverria simulated an aerial vehicle following a ground vehicle or several robots following each other:

ItÂ´s release 0.5 at the moment but works with ROS...
