when i use hydro to work through TF tutorial. it says There is no attribute "Velocity" in the module.(listener part) and I tried to change it to cmd_vel but it still does not work......
where can I find the parameter in Hydro instead of "velocity" in groovy ?? There may be other parameter changed in Hydro, how can I get them??

the tutorial's link: http://wiki.ros.org/tf/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20tf%20listener%20%28Python%29
the problem is about line 19 of "nodes/turtle_tf_listener.py"

those tutorials are a bit outdated. You could file an issue: https://github.com/ros/geometry/issues?state=open

A:

It looks like the command message type in turtlesim has changed from turtlesim/Velocity to geometry_msgs/Twist.
I've updated the tutorial: http://wiki.ros.org/tf/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20tf%20listener%20%28Python%29
