Hi @pnambiar, I think you need to execute some command like a playstation3 on the web( http://ros.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/roswiki/turtlebot_teleop%282f%29Tutorials%282f%29PS3%2820%29Joystick%2820%29Teleop.html ).

Is your joystick connected with workstation? I think joystick is used instead of keyboard, because you need kind of like driver to communicate with your turtlebot. I have moved a turtlebot with PS3joystick.

@pnambiar, Could you tell me more detailed information about your using joystick? I think there is a few information on ROS tutorial too. Does your joystick have either a USB cable or USB wireless? I think it doesn't have a bluetooth.

@pnambiar, I think you should write your answer. Please inform all of your solution.

A:

The Hoystick has a usb cable. The problem is actually solved. I was using it on a windows machine with though a virtual box and I gould not get it to work. But on a linus machine it seems to work work. No additional steps needed.
