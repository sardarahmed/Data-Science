Q:

How do I UNinstall and run a ROS Package?

I have a ROS package and I want to remove it to create a new one with the same name and same nodes. I'm using ROS FUERTE

A:

Type sudo apt-get remove ros-fuerte-package_name in the terminal if you have installed a Debian package. Delete the folder otherwise.

How do you do it from a source installation that doesn't use apt?

Just delete the folder of the package.
