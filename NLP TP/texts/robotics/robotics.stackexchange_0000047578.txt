Q:

ROS unable to function after fuerte update (due to python)

Since finding myself victim of the infamous multi-master roslaunch problem I updated my fuerte installation.
Now nothing works anymore.
erupter@FCD-04-Ubuntu:~/Apps/ROS$ roscore
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ros_comm-1.8.12-py2.7.egg/roslaunch/__init__.py", line 222, in main
    uuid = rlutil.get_or_generate_uuid(options.run_id, options.wait_for_master)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ros_comm-1.8.12-py2.7.egg/roslaunch/rlutil.py", line 170, in get_or_generate_uuid
    param_server = rosgraph.Master('/roslaunch')
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ros_comm-1.8.12-py2.7.egg/rosgraph/masterapi.py", line 97, in __init__
    self._reinit(master_uri)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ros_comm-1.8.12-py2.7.egg/rosgraph/masterapi.py", line 118, in _reinit
    self.handle = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy(self.master_uri)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/xmlrpclib.py", line 1549, in __init__
    raise IOError, "unsupported XML-RPC protocol"
IOError: unsupported XML-RPC protocol

Tried compiling ros_comm from source, it's now 1.8.15 yet it still provokes the same error.
Which at this point I suppose has something to do with python rather than ros...

A:

Found the culprit: these errors spawn if, for some reason, the ROS_MASTER_URI is malformed.
In my case it was something like
htpp://hostname:11311/

notice the htpp.
Correcting this everything gets back to working.
