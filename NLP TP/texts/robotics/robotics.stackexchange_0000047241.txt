A:

The two boards are not interchangeable, the TurtleCore board is meant to be runs as a standalone processor or as a means of communicating with the TurtleBot. While the gyro board is meant to provide gryo data and a means of powering the kinect sensor from the create. As far as I know the TurtleCore does not provide a gyro.
