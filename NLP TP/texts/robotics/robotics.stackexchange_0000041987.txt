Q:

ROS not working when Home directory is renamed

Hi all,
I'm using ROS Electric on Fedora 14.
I have changed my home directory name from A to B by editing the /etc/passwd file and moving the files to the new directory (mv /home/A /home/B).
Now, i'm not able to work on ROS as the system is not able to launch ROS.
Naturally, some path of ROS still points to the old home name (A).
Can someone tell me where all i need to rename the path (from A to B) so that ROS works fine ?

A:

If you have compiled packages in the old location, run make clean to regenerate the cmake files.
EDIT: To regenerate a list of packages and all their dependencies, run:
rosmake --pre-clean package_name1 package_name2
