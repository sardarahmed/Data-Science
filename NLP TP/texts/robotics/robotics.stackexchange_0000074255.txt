Q:

What can I do to install kdl?

Hi everyone,
I'm traying to install kdl but I'm having some problems.
I followed this site link and when I tried to write "rosdep install kdl" I had the following error:
ERROR: Rosdep cannot find all required resources to answer your query
Missing resource kdl
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/jade/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/home/user/catkin_ws/src
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/jade/share
ROS path [3]=/opt/ros/jade/stacks

I read that this command installs  some system dependencies for source packages but not the package. Indeed if I type "roscd kdl" it turns out that it doesn't exist. How can I do to install kdl?
Thank you

Do you need to build it from source?

Also: the wiki page you refer to shows that the last version of that package was for Groovy. You are running Jade. They may be / are probably not compatible.

A:

The wiki page you link points to orocos_kdl for ROS versions hydro onward. If you don't need to build from source, a sudo apt-get install ros-jade-orocos-kdl should work.
