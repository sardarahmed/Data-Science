Q:

how do i make source devel/setup.bash permanent

Every time i open a new terminal i have to type the following to set directories
 $ ~/catkin_ws/ source 
 $  source devel/setup.bash

and for once i forget to set it takes me a while to detect.
I wanna make this change permanent so i could skip this step

A:

you need to source  in .bashrc file.

open .bashrc file by gedit .bashrc
add line source /FULL...PATH../devel/setup.bash at the end
