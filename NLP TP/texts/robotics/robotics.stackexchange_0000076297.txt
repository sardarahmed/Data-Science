Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: IMU selection

Hi,
I'm just getting started with the robot_localization package and may aim is to fuse odometry and IMU data for a car like robot. I have an odometry sensor setup, but was wondering if there was an IMU someone suggests using for easy integration with robot_localization package.
I currently have a vn-100, but have been having a lot of difficulty with just getting it to give repeatable values. I am using the driver, but the orientation seems to differ at the beginning of every time the imu is initialized.
Is the VN-100 a good IMU for my robot platform, or would another IMU be easier to integrate with ROS and robot_localization?
Also, should gravity be included in the IMU reading for accelerations?

A:

Just make sure that the IMU produces data in ENU frame. Most IMUs produce NED-frame data by default, which will not work with r_l. I may be incorrect, but looking at the VN-100 driver source, it appears to be copying data straight from the IMU, which indicates to me that it may be in the wrong frame. Please correct me if you find that's not accurate.
