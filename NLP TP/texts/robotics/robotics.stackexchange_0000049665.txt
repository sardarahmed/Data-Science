Q:

MoveIt! endeffectors and groups

It seems like the way MoveIt! uses planning groups has changed a bit from the last time I tried it. Now, to be able to specify a goal pose using interactive markers, the arm planning group has to be split up into a arm part (for which the kinematics solver is set) and a endeffector part (see for example the PR2 tutorial). This works well if the arm used has a dedicated endeffector link rigidly attached to the last link of the arm. But what should be done if that is not the case? I suppose one could add "fake endeffector link" to the URDF, but that seems a bit cumbersome and unnecessarily complicated.

A:

Agreed.  I believe the "end-effector" group is used for some grasp-planning activities, and to display a "pretty" model at the desired end-effector location when using the planning tool, benchmarking tool, etc.
I talked some with Ioan (one of the primary moveIt developers) about this, and I think he's already implemented a cleaner solution for robots without a true "end-effector".  It looks as if some fixes were implemented on March 18th, so you might keep an eye out for when these fixes are pushed out to the main debian-package repositories.
For now, the best solution is to create a "dummy" end-effector link in the robot's URDF:
<link name="dummy_eef"/>
<joint name="joint_6-eef" type="fixed">
  <parent link="link_6"/>
  <child link="dummy_eef"/>
</joint>
