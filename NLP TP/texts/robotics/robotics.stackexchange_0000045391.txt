Q:

Gmapping overwrites map

I'm using a simulation with p2os package and I built my own map (a simple map, with some walls) in order to check if everything was going well. When I start moving the robot, the map is done correctly at the beginning, but when I drive the robot out of the main room, the generated map gets wrong. We obtain something like different parts of the map in wrong places, overwriting one each other. Does anybody know why it is happening?
(obs: I'm building a 2D map with a laser scanner)

The image link doesn't work. From the description it might just be the case that gmapping failed.

thanks, I have fixed it. I'm new at ROS so I don't know if this map is considered complex.

A:

From your images, it looks like something wrong with the rotation odometry. GMapping can usually close loops for small rotational errors, but once that gets large, the map will mess up badly.
Have you run through these yet?
