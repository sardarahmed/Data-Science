Q:

package suggetions for tracking simple object/marker?

Hello,
I want to determine the 3D movement (instantaneous pose) of a simple object, e.g., a green tennis ball in a 2x2x2 meter space using a realsense D435 camera. I read the similar questions in the forum and found for example find_object_3d, tod, vr4, but based on the answers i could not conclude which would provide the best results.
The realsense is placed ~1.5meters from the workspace (that should be recorded), and i highly suspect that it will provide quite unreliable results, especially if the tennis ball is 3 meters far from the camera..
Could you recommend what setup/solution/package should be used for the aforementioned problem?
So the pose of a simple green colored marker is required to be determined. Maybe OpenCV-based method suits for this task?
Thank you for the help in advance.

maybe this package can give you initial start... it is not mine, https://github.com/dovanhuong/object_detection_2d
