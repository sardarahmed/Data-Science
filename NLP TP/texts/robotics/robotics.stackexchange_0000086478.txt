Q:

How to use single line installation for Kinetic

At http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation/TwoLineInstall, I'm told that I'm able to install ROS by using this command
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oroca/oroca-ros-pkg/master/ros_install.sh | bash -s %NAME_CATKIN_WS% %NAME_ROS_DISTRO_LOWERCASE%

(e.g.)
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oroca/oroca-ros-pkg/master/ros_install.sh | bash -s cws_oroca kinetic

My question is, what does %NAME_CATKIN_WS% mean? I can guess that %NAME_ROS_DISTRO_LOWERCASE% is substituted with the ros version I wish to download (e.g. Kinetic), but what about %NAME_CATKIN_WS%? Is it the name of the directory I want to use to store my work? (e.g. ~/catkin_ws)

A:

For context, the single install is running a shell script which essentially mimics the steps in this tutorial for installing & configuring ROS (it isn't exactly the same, but close enough).
To answer your question: Yes, the single install script is just going to create a folder named %NAME_CATKIN_WS%, initialize it as a catkin workspace, run catkin_make, and source it for your ROS environment. This folder / workspace is where you'll create and build your own ros packages (or where you could build existing packages from source). The catkin tutorials are definitely worth going through to get a conceptual understanding of the role of the catkin_ws in development.
