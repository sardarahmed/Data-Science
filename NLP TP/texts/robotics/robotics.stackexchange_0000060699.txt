Q:

Openni_launch cannot subscribe both to depth_registered and rgb

I installed ros-hydro-openni-launch to my Odroid-U3. When I ran
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch

it successfully streams as I can see the topics send average at 30 fps via the command
rostopic hz /camera/rgb/image_rect_color

However, once I subscribe also to
rostopic hz /camera/depth_registered/hw_registered/image_rect_raw

Both of the subscribers do not receive any more images as shown below..
Is this a bug? I also downloaded the latest commit of openni_launch and openni_camera in the github. But it was still the same... But they DO WORK alone. But subscribing to both of them fails....

A:

Looking at Openni.launch shows:
  <!-- Use OpenNI's factory-calibrated depth->RGB registration? -->
  <arg name="depth_registration" default="false" />

meaning you need to instead run
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch depth_registration:=true

Although you are reporting that depth_registration works without setting that argument to be true, which is odd. Regardless maybe this will fix the issue? worth a shot...
