Q:

ROS Hydro on MINT 15, ROS_OS_OVERRIDE

Hi all,
My name is Boles≈Çaw and I am new user of ROS.
I have installed ROS on MINT 15 system, all installing procedure went fine.
All packages installed correctly apart from ubs_cam lib! It throws:
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
usb_cam: Unsupported OS [mint]

I have searched the net, ROS wiki and ROS answers. What I found is basically some old posts, which were not connected directly to any ROS release (quite confusing!), something about rosdep.yaml file as well.
And I found env ROS_OS_OVERRIDE. I put to terminal:
export ROS_OS_OVERRIDE=ubuntu:raring

When I check rosdep resolve usb_cam
ERROR: No definition of [usb_cam] for OS version []

No definition of [usb_cam] for OS version []
    rosdep key : usb_cam
    OS name    : ubuntu
    **OS version :** 
    Data: _is_ros: true
debian:
  apt:
    packages:
    - ros-hydro-usb-cam
osx:
  homebrew:
    packages:
    - ros/hydro/usb_cam
ubuntu:
  precise:
    apt:
      packages:
      - ros-hydro-usb-cam
  quantal:
    apt:
      packages:
      - ros-hydro-usb-cam
  raring:
    apt:
      packages:
      - ros-hydro-usb-cam

Here comes my question: how to "convince" ROS that beneath MINT there is UBUNTU Raring?
Or maybe there is workaround through OpenCv?
Thanks for any help You can provide.

A:

have you tried to add  --os=ubuntu:raring flag to rosdep call?
something like:
rosdep resolve usb_cam --os=ubuntu:raring
