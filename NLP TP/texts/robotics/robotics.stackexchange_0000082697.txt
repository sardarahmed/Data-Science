Q:

rosserial_windows help,compile error on windows

I`m trying to use  rosserial_windows .
And I operate as the tutorial instructed .
The difference is that I use visual studio 2010.
After Step 4--Add code to main for Hello World,  I begin to build the code on visual studio 2010.
And there are same errors with these two documents, duration.h , time.h :
error C3861: 'round': identifier not found

how can i solve this problem?
Is that because I didn`t use visual studio 2013 like the tutorial does??

A:

VS2010 doesn't support c99.
VS2013 will work out.
