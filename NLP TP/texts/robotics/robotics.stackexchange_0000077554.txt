Q:

Node Specific Parameters in YAML

Right now, for every node I am creating a yaml file and put all the parameters inside and call this file in the launch file under the corresponding node.
Is it possible to create only one yaml file where I can specify name tags for parameters? Something like;
Node name:

param1: 1.0
param2: 2.0

Node name2:

param1: 3.0
param2: 4.0

A:

The yaml is not associated with any particular node, but more to do with namespaces. That is, a yaml that looks like:
settings:  # Arbitrary settings
  camera:
    format: "jpeg"
  wheels:
    max_speed: 3.0
    min_speed: 0.2

would create three values in the parameter service. If you type in rosparam list, you would get:
/settings/camera/format
/settings/wheels/max_speed
/settings/wheels/min_speed

(You can get the actual values with rosparam get [param]).
The point of this is that a node can get any of these parameters. In your launch file, instead of putting the <rosparam> tag inside the node (which I understand you have), you can have it at the top. Something like:
<launch>
  <rosparam file="$(find package1)/config/settings.yaml" command="load" />
  <node pkg="package1" type="node1" name="node1" />
</launch>
