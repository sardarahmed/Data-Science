Q:

openni rviz not working

hello.
I was trying to install openni_kinect on ROS in order to use NXT robot with the kinect.
However, I faced this problem with the Rviz software. adding of PointCloud2 display but there is nothing in the "topic" directory to choose from.
So right now the display screen in Rviz is just blank grey colour.
what is the cause for this problem and how do I fix it?
Thank you. (:

A:

check if you've set the fixed frame and target frame fields correctly.
If you set both of them to openni_camera then you should definitely be able to see something.
