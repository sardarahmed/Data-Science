Q:

Avoiding Jerk during trajectory preemption in MoveIt!

Hi
I have noted that the robot is jerking a bit during cancelling the existing trajectory goal. What can be the reason?
Regards

A:

I got the solution. There is a parameter  called "stop_trajectory_duration" in trajectory controller. Just adjust this value to make the ending smooth.
