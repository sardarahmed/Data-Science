A:

There is no (official) pcl package for Python afaik, so that won't work. You can try and see whether strawlab/python-pcl can do what you want, but it appears not to have been kept up-to-date with PCL.

Thank you @gvdhoorn for your reply. Can you please tell me how to install python-pcl from strawlab. I did a git clone from their repo to my working directory. I then in my py script said , "import pcl", it wouldn't wok giving the error mentioned above in my question.
Thanks!

That is really more of a Python question than a ROS one. Check whether Installing Packages - Installing from a local src tree helps.
