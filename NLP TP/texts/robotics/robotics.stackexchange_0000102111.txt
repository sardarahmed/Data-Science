Q:

Why do we use equal sign?

In these two lines, the author has used the equal sign inside the parenthesis.
self.vel_pub = rospy.Publisher(name=self.cmd_vel_topic, data_class=Twist, queue_size=10)

and
self.front_topic_subscriber = rospy.Subscriber(name=self.front_sensor_topic, data_class=Range, callback=self.front_callback)

for example: name=self.cmd_vel_topic
Why did he do that?

A:

The author is telling the function (in this case the constructor for the rospy subscriber class) which particular arguments the value they are passing in is for. If you look at the documentation for the subscriber class you will notice the __init__() function has name,data_class, and callback as arguments in the function definition. You don't necessarily have to do that, but then you need to be careful about the order you pass in the values to the function. Basically, the authors are explicitly telling the function which argument each value they pass in relates to.
