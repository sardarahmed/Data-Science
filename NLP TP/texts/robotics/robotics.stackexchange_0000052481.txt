Q:

Not able to visualize or record point cloud using openni_viewer

I am not able to visualize the point cloud data using the openni_viewer and further not able to capture .pcd image. There is no error message anywhere. Although, point cloud stream is getting displayed using rviz. I am using kinect sensor.
I am using pcl17 library. And trying to view Point cloud live stream using the inbuilt binary called ./pcl_openni_viewer and  to capture/record i am using the ./pcl_openni_pcd_recorder .
Any possible suggestion, what am i missing ?

These are pcl methods.  I suggest you ask on the pcl-users mailing list. Information on joining is here: http://pointclouds.org/contact.html
