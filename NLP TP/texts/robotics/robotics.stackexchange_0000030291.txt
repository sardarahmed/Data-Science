Q:

Renaming a topic inside a bag file

When we record a bag file for example X.bag and it contains the topic data /a_topic
Is there any way to rename the topics name inside the X.bag /a_topic to /b_topic?
Best regards..

A:

I know this is quite old, but there's also this option:
rosrun rosbag topic_renamer.py <in topic> <in bag> <out topic> <out bag>

Another option is to simply remap the topics when you use rosbag play. For example, if you have the topic /foo inside the bag, you can to this to rename it (when published) into /bar:
rosbag play file.bag /foo:=/bar

The leading '/' might not be needed.
