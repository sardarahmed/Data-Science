Q:

Phidgets interface kit 8/8/8 with EZ1 sonar sensor and ROS Hydro

Hello, I implemented a c++ code with phidgets interface kit and the ez1 sonar sensor to be used as collision avoidance on a robot. But I'm having trouble creating the package or somehow building my code with ROS hydro.
So far I used catkin to build the examples for the tutorial as well as building this package : http://wiki.ros.org/phidgets_drivers with success but as far as I understood the package is only for phidgets_ir and phidgets_imu.
Should I try to adjust the package mentioned above or look for something more specific?
Thanks.

A:

Problem solved: had to add "phidget21" on the target_link_libraries section of the CMakeLists.txt file of the package.
