Q:

Marker-like functionality in Gazebo

Are there any plugins for Gazebo that provide functionality similar to the Marker plugin for rviz? If not, I'll look into creating a visual plugin that wraps the DynamicLines class to support ROS nodes creating dynamic and generic geometric visualizations.
Thanks.

A:

Visual markers have been added to gazebo8. Use gz marker -h for help.
