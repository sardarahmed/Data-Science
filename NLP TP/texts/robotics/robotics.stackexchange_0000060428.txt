Q:

about resolution on yaml

My question:
As hokuyo laser URG-04LX has 1mm resolution, I should set 0.001 as resolution on global_costmap_params.yaml?
Because the resolution of hokuyo laser URG-04LX is 1mm. or Should I edit this parameter to match unit [m/pixel] in case that pgm has 312X512 pixels and actual map size has 2.7m wide and 5.3m height?
Could anybody tell me your experience?
Next article says more detailed information.
I have a laser3.yaml and laser3.pgm like this.
laser3.png
laser3.yaml

image: /home/turtlebot/laser3.pgm
resolution: 0.050000
origin: [-1.000000, -12.200000, 0.000000]
negate: 0
occupied_thresh: 0.65
free_thresh: 0.196

So, I'm editing my code like this.

map_upperboud = costmap_->getSizeInMetersX() -costmap_->getOriginX();
map_lowerbound = costmap_->getOriginX();
ROS_WARN("Setting upper bound and lower bound of map x-coordinate to (%f, %f).", map_upperbound, map_lowerbound);

When I execute this program, I get a next message.
[ WARN] [1404074825.515283246]: Setting upper bound and lower bound of map x-coordinate to (16.975000, -1.000000).
[ WARN] [1404074825.515418641]: Setting upper bound and lower bound of map y-coordinate to (37.775000, -12.200000).

I think getOriginX() reads laser3.yaml.
Actually, The map have 2.7m in X-axis and 5.3m in Y-axis. But, The result has 16.95 in X-axis and 37.775 in Y-axis.
laser3.png that actually is laser3.pgm has 320X512 pixels.
If calculating pixels, origin data and resolution in yaml with getSizeInMetersX(), I get 16.975 and 37.775.
So, resolution of parameter is written on laser3.yaml after reading a resolution in global_costmap_params.yaml.

I think I should set 0.01[m/pixel] as a resolution, if I follow the map that has 312X512 pixels.

A:

Do NOT do this. The resolution in the map's yaml file is the map's resolution, not the laser's. Those are two completely different things and manually changing the map resolution will almost surely make the map unusable.

Thanks @dornhege! Do you mean that you don't change a resolution of yaml? I also think that I should not change the resolution after building a map.

Exactly. The resolution is part of the map and was generated when building it.
