Q:

OpenCV in ROS indigo

Hi Ros users:
I have a script where I use OpenCV functions and ROS functions.
But I have a problem when I run this script.
Mi question is:  What version of OpenCV have I to install to work with Ros Indigo?
Thanks a lot!!!!!

What problems are those? And just to be sure: you use python, right?

And further: How did you install ROS and OpenCV?

A:

cv_bridge works with opencv2 (http://wiki.ros.org/cv_bridge/Tutorials/UsingCvBridgeToConvertBetweenROSImagesAndOpenCVImages)
