Q:

View from virtual camera in uwsim

How to get a view of an object from virtual camera in robot in uwsim?There is not much documentation for uwsim. So how to learn using it . Should i try to understand its coding first because that also requires a lot of time , reading its sources , its libraries, osg, various classes in osg, etc ??

Hi,
Documentation is a pending issue in UWSim, but for installation and first steps you can check the wiki . In the case of virtual cameras you can access to them pressing "c" on uwsim window or check the topics where they are published (stated on xml scene config file), for instance in cirs.xml is "/uwsim/camera1"
