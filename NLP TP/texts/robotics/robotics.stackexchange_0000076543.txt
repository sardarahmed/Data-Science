Q:

Downloading Tutorial

Hello!
Im running ROS Kinetic on Raspbian with a RPI 3 and Im having trouble installing the kinetic tutorials, specifically this step from the wiki (http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/NavigatingTheFilesystem):
$ sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-ros-tutorials

I am running it as
$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-ros-tutorials

But get the following error:
E: Unable to locate package ros-kinetic-ros-tutorial

Does anybody have an idea of what am I missing?

A:

How did you install on the Raspbian? I did a compile from scratch on Jessie on Pi and for installing extra packages there is a process with it, vs using apt.

Hi!
I followed these steps:
http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment
I think it is installed properly since the enviroment variables are properly set and that's the way this group of steps begin.

As tfoote mentioned, you should have used http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Installing%20ROS%20Indigo%20on%20Raspberry%20Pi. If so see section 4.2 Adding Released Packages

Got it. I ran those as
pi@dex:~/ros_catkin_ws $ rosinstall_generator ros_tutorials --rosdistro kinetic --deps --wet-only --tar > kinetic-custom_ros.rosinstall and then all of the other spaces. So just to check, apt-get will not work?

I don't see how, you are installing from source.
