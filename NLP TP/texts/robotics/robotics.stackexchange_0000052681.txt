Q:

trying Camera in Rviz, transform?

Hi all.
There are videos on youtube  where people manually moving the camera, and use Rviz to visualize the pointscloud, images etc. But to view the pointscloud 2, Rviz acutally requires transform of /map to /[name of the camera_frame]
I do have a camera working. I am wondering how should I archeive such requirement?

A:

You need to have your camera localized with respect to the world. /map is the conventional frame name associated with the world. You need a SLAM node (or whatever that can localize the position of the camera in the world) that will publish the transform from /map to /your_camera_frame.
I suggest you have a look at rgbdslam, that will probably help you obtain what you want with very little effort.
