Q:

rviz - storing point cloud selection

Hi,
using the "select" tool in rviz you can easily select points from a point cloud. The selected points will then show up in the selection panel.
My question is: Is there any possibility to export this selection? E.g. store the indices in a file? Or republish them on a different topic?
The reason is I would like to manually segment a point cloud in rviz in order to provide ground truth for comparing it to a segmentation algorithm.
I believe one idea would be to write an rviz plug-in for this. But I wonder, whether somebody has already stumbled upon this problem and found an easy solution (less hacky than http://answers.ros.org/question/12806/interactively-access-to-laser-point-in-rviz/)?
Best,
Sebastian

Hello,
finally we wrote a plugin, as there is no such feature in RVIZ. It provides a new tool that inherits all features of the default 'select' tool and additionally publishes all selected points on the ros topic '/selected_points'.
It can be found at:

Hi, just implemented the plugin, but crashes upon doing the selection printing some storage-access-failure in the terminal. Anybody got an idea? I'm running ROS kinetic 1.12.7
thx in advance ^^
