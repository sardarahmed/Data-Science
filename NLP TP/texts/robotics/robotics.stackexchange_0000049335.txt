Q:

Hokuyo_node single scan mode

Hi
Is it possible to configure the hokuyo_node to produce a scan at a specified time, as in single scan mode? As i understand the current default configuration is continuous scan mode where the node continuously publishes laser scans in the topic

A:

AFAIK there are no such settings, but you can subscribe to the laser topic and pick out the frame you want. Timestamp is stored in header of the topic message. See
LaserScan message
for details.
