Q:

rosmake ccny_rgbd_tools errors

Hi,
Thank you so much for providing this valuable open-source package on ccny_rgbd! ! It goes well when I followed the installing procedure: http://wiki.ros.org/ccny_rgbd_tools.
However, it encountered some rosmake errors as the following:
make[3]: *** [CMakeFiles/rgbdtools.dir/src/rgbd_frame.cpp.o] Error 1
make[3]: Leaving directory `/home/lili/fuerte_workspace/sandbox/ccny_rgbd_tools/lib_rgbdtools/rgbdtools_git/build'
make[2]: *** [CMakeFiles/rgbdtools.dir/all] Error 2
make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/lili/fuerte_workspace/sandbox/ccny_rgbd_tools/lib_rgbdtools/rgbdtools_git/build'
make[1]: *** [all] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/lili/fuerte_workspace/sandbox/ccny_rgbd_tools/lib_rgbdtools/rgbdtools_git/build'

Could anyone provide some suggestions? Thanks in advance!

A:

Please try setting the branch in github to fuerte and download that package.
Also remove the existing libg2o from the system software
and
do rosmake --pre-clean ccny_rgbd
With these two steps it might work.
EDIT 1:
Can you please try with the package from this link
https://github.com/ccny-ros-pkg/ccny_rgbd_tools/releases/tag/0.1.1

It doesn't work. Still thanks a lot! Have you successfully compiled?
Comment by sai on 2014-07-03:
@Lili Meng, Yeah I have a compiled version.
Please look at the edit 1 in the answer. If it does not work, then I ll try to provide a link to the version which I was able to compile.
