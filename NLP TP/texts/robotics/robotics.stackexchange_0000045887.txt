Q:

gazebo plugin undefined symbol

Hi all,
I am trying to make a gazebo plugin work now. The plugin compiles just fine but when I run it, it gives the the following errors:
undefined symbol: _ZN6gazebo18GazeboRosApiPlugin16spawnGazeboModelERN11gazebo_msgs18SpawnModelRequest_ISaIvEEERNS1_19SpawnModelResponse_IS3_EE
Does anyone know what causes the problem? Thank you!!

A:

Figured it out... I forgot to uncomment the definition of spawngazebomodel function. I think that the problem is I declared the function but didn't define it. So the library cannot actually use it.
