Q:

Missing resource tf

I'm trying to install RGB-D SLAM on Ubuntu 12.04 as per these instructions
http://www.ros.org/wiki/rgbdslam#RGB-D_SLAM_for_Non-ROS_Users
However, when I get to the
rosdep install rgbdslam_freiburg

part, I receive this error:
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
rgbdslam: Missing resource tf
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/home/paul/ros
ROS path [2]=/home/paul/ros

I know that the package tf is here
http://ros.org/wiki/tf
but I don't know how to install it.
How do I go about installing this package?

I believe it is in the full desktop install of ROS. Is this how you installed ROS? For me tf is located at /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/geometry/tf, I would check if that is the case for you. If it is, add /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks to your package path and rosdep should be able to find it

Oh yeah, I can find tf under /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/geometry/tf, but how do I go about adding it to the package path?

A:

I figured it out! I used:
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/paul/ros:/opt/ros/fuerte/share/:/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/

Managing ROS_PACKAGE_PATH manually is not recommended. You should instead use rosws. Have a look at this page.
Comment by dornhege on 2012-11-04:
At the very least, you should only add to ROS_PACKAGE_PATH and source /opt/ros/fuerte/setup.bash first.

You probably skipped the step ". ~/.bashrc" in the manual.
