Q:

Modify model names during simulation

When I 'insert' a model from the Gazebo GUI, it seems I could not change its model name anymore. Is there any way to change its name after drag it into the simulation world?

Hey winston. I managed to change the name internally using Entity::SetName inside a model plugin. On the other hand, the gzclient doesn't update the name and when i delete one model using gzclient's graphically way of deleting a model, the model disappears but it doesn't disappear from the world's model list ...

but like.... why? why are you relying on model name, and why do you want it to change?

A:

Unfortunately, I don't think it's a good idea to change a model's name after it's been spawned. There's a lot of internal code which assumes the name stays the same. You can see by the comment on the Entity::SetName function. I can imagine all the topics staying the same and so on...
As a side note, every model has a unique id, but that's more meant to be a way to lookup faster (comparing ints instead of strings), than a way to keep track of a model if its name changes.

Sorry I cant really understand that behavior. When the API gives me the option to change the name of a model, then it should have influence on all other aspects. To restart the GzClient is really unsatisfying!
I also wanted to change the model name due to some custom algorithms in the load method, so the numbering is for me important. Do I really have to adjust my algorithm because Im not able to change the name that its indicating the model instance number?

I agree with you. I think the API call shouldn't be there if it doesn't behave properly.

I think it is good if Gazebo provides a built-in command line tool that enables use to spawn a model with custom name, pose, orientation or etc. Then I don't have to change its name, pose, etc. after I drag it into the world.

The gz model tool should do it, try gz model -f ~/.gazebo/models/beer/model.sdf -x 1 -y 2 -z 3 -R 0.1 -P -0.3 -m my_beer for example
