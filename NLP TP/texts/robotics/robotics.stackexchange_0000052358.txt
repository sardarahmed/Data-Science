Q:

pcl 1.7 install on groovy

Hey,
I'm trying to install the pcl1.7 from https://github.com/ros-perception/perception_pcl.git (the groovy-unstable-devel) in ubuntu 12.04 64 bits with ROS Groovy.
I has still using the rosbuild system, but it appears that the pcl git is allready made for catkin. So i created a catkin workspace as the the tutorial, clone the git to the src dir, and making catkin_make i get this:
Base path: /home/joao/catkin_ws
Source space: /home/joao/catkin_ws/src
Build space: /home/joao/catkin_ws/build
Devel space: /home/joao/catkin_ws/devel
Install space: /home/joao/catkin_ws/install
####
#### Running command: "cmake /home/joao/catkin_ws/src -DCATKIN_DEVEL_PREFIX=/home/joao/catkin_ws/devel -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/joao/catkin_ws/install" in "/home/joao/catkin_ws/build"

CMake Error at /opt/ros/groovy/share/catkin/cmake/catkin_workspace.cmake:88 (message):
  This workspace contains non-catkin packages in it, and catkin cannot build
  a non-homogeneous workspace without isolation.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  CMakeLists.txt:48 (catkin_workspace)

-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
Invoking "cmake" failed

What should i do? I've read the tutorials and it didn't give me a answer.
Thanks

A:

" and catkin cannot build a non-homogeneous workspace without isolation."
-> use catkin_make_isolated
