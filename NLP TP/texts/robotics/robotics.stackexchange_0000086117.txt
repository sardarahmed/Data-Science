Q:

Find dependents of ROS Message and Service statically

There used to be a command rosmsg users back in ROS Electric (!) or earlier that seems to return the list of ROS Messages that depend on the given Message type. Is there a ROS-way of achieving the same in the post-Electric era?
Also curious why rosmsg users was dropped if anyone remembers.

It was removed in ros/ros_comm@b6cfd8aa. Ken's commit message:
