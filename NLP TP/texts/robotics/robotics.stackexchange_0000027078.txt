Q:

Tutorial Question dealing with interaction with ROS

in this tutorial we see two packages being created by "you" one of them has a CMakeLists.txt and a package.xml as usual, and the other one, MYROBOT_gazebo has neither. Yet later, we see it being roslaunch 'ed like it is a package. Did the author just forget to include a package.xml in this package or is there something else going on?

I've created an issue for this on the gazebo_tutorials repository. I'll be working on it there. Thanks for the report.
