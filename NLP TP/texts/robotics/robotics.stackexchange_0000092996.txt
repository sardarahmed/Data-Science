Q:

Ackermann robot gazebo simulation?

Hi,
Does anyone know of an existing ackermann robot available for use in gazebo? I require an ackermann robot for a simulation task but don't have the data to construct a replication of my own robot (inertial and dimensions). Just want to throw it on an ackermann robot and see how it goes  :)
Thanks, Grant

I have cleaned up  the robotnik rbcar simulation .
Hope someone finds this useful

A:

I made one to teach students about Ackermann kinematics:
https://github.com/robustify/audibot
The control interface is throttle percentage, brake torque, and steering wheel angle. It attempts to implement as realistic of a dynamic response to those signals as possible. There are some example launch files in the repo to get you started.
