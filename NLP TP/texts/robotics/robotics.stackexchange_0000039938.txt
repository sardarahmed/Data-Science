Q:

react on diagnostics (eg shutdown on low battery)

I saw the diagnostics stack, but is there a package that actually reacts on those diagnostic messages in terms of issuing a given message or shell command?
I'd like to shutdown the robot PC if the battery goes low (which the OS isn't aware of), and thought using diagnostics would be the right way.
Is there a prepared solution to that, or do I have to write a special node?

A:

What I do on my project is have a backing message format (just a few strings and integers) to represent system state for things like power and temperature.
I then have a separate node that bridges these messages into the diagnostics message format, so that I can get a human readable log of robot diagnostics.
To make decisions based on battery capacity or state, I can use the backing message.
