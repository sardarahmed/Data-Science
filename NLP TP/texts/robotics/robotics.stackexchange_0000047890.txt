Q:

Kinect with zoom lens calibration: Bad link on ros wiki

I am trying to view documentation about calibrating the Kinect using a Zoom lens.  The link suggested by
www.ros.org/wiki/kinect_calibration/technical)
leads to this dead link:
www.ros.org/doc/api/kinect_near_mode_calibration/html)
Why is this documentation no longer on the server?
