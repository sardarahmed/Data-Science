A:

In short: You are missing the hokuyo_node package.
(Also rosdep install does not run the hokuyo node, rosrun does.)
This could be either because it is not installed (then you need to install it) or your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environment variable is not containing the directory for the hokuyo_node.
Did you install diamondback from packages? Then you should have /opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/laser_drivers/hokuyo_node. If that is the case source /opt/ros/diamondback/setup.sh and roscd hokuyo_node should work. If it is not there you need to install ros-diamondback-laser-drivers.
Otherwise, you need to give some more information on your system and ROS setup.
