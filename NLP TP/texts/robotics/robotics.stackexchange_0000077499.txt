Q:

Novatel GPS Smart6 with ROS

Hi to all,
I have a novatel GPS system composed by a Smart6 base station and a rover station capable to provide sub-inch accuracy.
I would like to mount the rover station on my wheeled robot and record GPS data in order to use these data for navsat_odometry and robot_localization.
What I need to do in order to read and record data coming from my smart6 rover station?
The novatel_span_driver is the only packet I need to read data from my novatel device?
It describes a connection on the ethernet port, but the smart6 device only provides a serial interface.
Can you help me, please?

A:

I realize this question is pretty old, but in case you're still working on it or somebody else finds this, you might try novatel_gps_driver, which I just recently released.  I haven't tested it specifically with a Smart6, but it looks like it should use the same command set as the OEM6 device family, so I expect it will work.
