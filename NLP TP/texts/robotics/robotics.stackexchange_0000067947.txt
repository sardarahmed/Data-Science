Q:

Can I change the initial pose of my p3dx when I launch the .launch file?

hi ros users:
How can i do that my model of p3dx appears where I want when I run gazebo? For example on x=3 y=3.
is there anyway to do that? so, change the initial pose of my p3dx.
My pkg of the model is this https://github.com/RafBerkvens/ua_ros_p3dx
Thanks!!!!!

A:

You can do this by modifying your gazebo.launch file.
<node name="urdf_spawner" pkg="gazebo_ros" type="spawn_model"
        respawn="false" output="screen" args="-urdf -model p3dx -x 3 -y 3 -param robot_description" />
