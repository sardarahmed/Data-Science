Q:

How to start using OpenCV and ROS

Hi
Im new in OpenCV and would like to learn using it with ROS fuerte. I am using Ubuntu 12 and 14 and ROS fuerte and Microsoft Kinect. Any good tutorial to start install OpenCV in ROS and start using it with some basic functions to hit the ground? Any help would really appreciate
EDIT:
Do I need to change my CmakeList.txt file ? I found that I you need to include it into my CMakeList.txt (here i mean the CMakeList.txt in my package):
find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED)

target_link_libaries(your_node ${OpenCV_LIBS})

True?
Thanks

A:

 sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev

Then I would suggest using python first. All you need to do is to import opencv in the top of your python script.
import cv2

and then do whatever you want. Opencv functions can be called in ROS callbacks. Most interesting thing would be probably converting ROS image messages to opencv format as explained here. This would allow applying image processing algorithms implemented in opencv on the images you get from ROS.

Thanks. Im not familiar with python actually. is any option for using C++?

Yes, you can use OpenCV with C++. Installing it is done the same way.

Here is an example to publish webcam images using opencv and ros

Thanks,. I followed the example. when tried to run make I got the following error:
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lcv_bridge
I already installed before the cv_bridge package. Should I modify my CmakeList as well?Any help?

Comment by Astronaut on 2016-05-12:
