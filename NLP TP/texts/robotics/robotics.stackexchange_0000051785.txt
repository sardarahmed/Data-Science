@Mohsen Hk  did you manage to make this work? Im having problem accomplishing it, and would really appreciate some help

A:

Create  msg file "geometry_msgs_vector.msg" in "msg" directory of ur package. In msg file write

geometry_msgs::PoseStamped [] msgs_vector

In ur code write the subscriber like this

void callback(const package_name::geometry_msgs_vector::ConstPtr &msg)
{
}

To access the vector use "msg.msgs_vector"
Hope this works
PS:Dont forget to include this msg header file "package_name/geometry_msgs_vector.h" and they might be some syntactical error in the code i have mentioned but the logic is correct
