Q:

How to send data from kinect SDK 2.0 Visual Studio to ROS turtlebot 3?

Im new to ROS. How would I go about sending gesture data / skeletal data or any data to ROS turtlebot 3 from visual studio for the Kinect 2.0 sdk.
My goal is to send a gesture from the Kinect (e.g. wave my hand and that tell that turtle bot 3 to move forward). I want to be able to control multiple turtlebot 3's, but getting one would be good enough for now.

A:

you can use http://wiki.ros.org/rosbridge_suite to connect you VisualStudio Project with ROS.
or if you have a Windows 10 you could try to use this http://wiki.ros.org/Installation/Windows and develop a ROS node
