Q:

Issues installing gazebo7

I am running ROS Kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04. As per http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_wrapper_versions I need Gazebo7. I want to install the latest LTS version (which I believe is 7.16.0-1).
The link to the instructions for installing Gazebo on Ubuntu does not work. Try it: http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?cat=install
The installer download link also doesn't work. Go to http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?cat=guided_b&tut=guided_b1 scroll to "installation for Ubuntu" and click on "link to the installer". didn't work for me.
No worries. I'll just download the software and off I go, right? I wish. On this page (http://gazebosim.org/distributions/gazebo/releases/) there are 7 files that are "Gazebo7 ... 7.16.0-1 (docs, dbg, plugin-base, libgazebo7, common, and gazebo7), and every one depends on the other. I tried installing each one over and over in different orders, but I keep getting unmet dependencies.
Installing Gazebo from source makes my head spin (I'm not a programmer, and this is too much for me: http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=install_from_source&cat=install)
Gazebo is so cool, and I need the latest Gazebo7 version. What do I need to do to install Gazebo7? Thanks for your time.

A:

gazebo7is an official package in Ubuntu Xenial 16.04. The tutorial says that it should be automatically installed when you need to install ROS packages. So a simple apt-get install ros-kinetic-desktop-full should just work.
If you want to get the latest gazebo7 then you can follow these instructions to proceed step by step. Basically add the OSRF repository together with the key.

Back to the original question of getting the latest gazebo7 version after installing ros-kinetic-desktop-full and got 7.0.0: steps should be the same as detailed in the step by step tutorial basically add the osrfoundation.org repository and run apt-get install gazebo7. That should give you the following output:
root@f8f9dfa4bc91:/# apt-get install gazebo7

When I installed Kinetic, the version that came with it was 7.0, and I jumped through hoops to get 7.16 working (which is where this question came from). first I uninstalled gazebo7*, then I installed gazebo7-common for 7.16, then I did run the apt-get install ros-kinetic-desktop-full and everything worked. The only problem is the 30 other commands that may have done something useful. My conclusions is it's possible to delete 7.0 and reinstall 7.16. Good luck....
