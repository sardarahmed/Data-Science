Don't post errors as images, there is no need to do that. Copy-paste the error text directly into your questions and format it using the Preformatted Text button (the one with 101010 on it).

Hi!
When that error happens, that means that the compiler didnt find the package. So is it the package name correct? Did you compile, using "catkin_make", after creating the moveit_config package? did you write on the terminal "source devel/setup.sh"?
