Q:

Wifi communication. Alternative for wifi_comm?

I'm trying to establish ad-hoc wifi communication between two Raspberry Pi, both will be running roscore and a full set of applications. I just want to exchange information between them.
I found wifi_comm package, it seems to do what I want. However, it seems to be discontinued and a little bit incomplete (not criticizing). Are there any alternative for this package?
