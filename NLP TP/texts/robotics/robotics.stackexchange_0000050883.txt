Q:

Are package maintainers allowed names with apostrophes?

I get errors like this from the Debian source build of a released package:
Now running lintian...
E: ros-groovy-libfreenect changes: changed-by-address-malformed Jack O'Quin <jack.oquin@gmail.com>, Piyush Khandelwal <piyushk@gmail.com>

Is it complaining about my name? Or about having two maintainers?

A:

From the Debian Policy Manual the field must conform to RFC 822
From a quick scan it looks like it would work if enclosed in double quotes.  It will take some more reading but 3.1.1 suggests you can do multiple people in one line.
And REP 127 allows multiple.  I don't know bloom's merging behavior, but the above RFC suggests it's dooable.
I'd suggest filing a ticket against bloom to put the control file output in double quotes, or escape the open field correctly.
Also to double check about multiple maintainer status for the debian control file.

I'll do that. Wasn't sure where to file it. Fortunately, it does not seem to break anything important. I was just curious about the message.
