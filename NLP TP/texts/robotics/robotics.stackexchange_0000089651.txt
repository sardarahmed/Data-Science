Q:

Intel realsense D435 Pointcloud2 without RGB

Dear all,
I was wondering if there is a way to have access to the XYZ PointCloud2 instead of the XYZRGB PointCloud2 in the realsense2_camera ROS Package.
The idea is to use as less as possible the CPU computational power.
I have looked at this solution but it was not working properly.
Thanks,

A:

I got the solution in the last version of the  realsense2_camera.
The following configuration should be defined in order to achieve the PointCloud withou RGB:
<!-- Intel Realsense D435 driver -->
<include file="$(find realsense2_camera)/launch/rs_camera.launch">
<arg name="pointcloud_texture_stream" default="RS2_STREAM_ANY"/>  
<arg name="enable_pointcloud"         default="true"/>
<arg name="enable_color"        default="false"/>
<arg name="enable_depth"        default="true"/>
<arg name="enable_infra2"        default="false"/>
<arg name="enable_infra1"        default="false"/>
<arg name="align_depth"         default="false"/>
<arg name="depth_width"         default="640"/>
<arg name="depth_height"        default="480"/>
</include>

Unfortunately the current version does not support the RS2_STREAM_DEPTH therefore the result is not the same as I wished cause when you choose the RS2_STREAM_ANY the PointCloud will have more than twice of Points which leads to have even a higher CPU consumption with respect to the PointCloud with RGB.
