Q:

No root joint specified. Assuming fixed joint, moveit

Hi,
I am importing a 6 DOF arm using setupAssistant. When I load the urdf for the robotic arm, all the parts of the robotic arm are at the same plane. It shows a message  "No root joint specified. Assuming fixed joint".
I searched in other threads and came across that there is some information to be added in the SRDF file.
Since I have generated the URDF from Solidworks, so please tell where should I create a SRDF for the same and whether we have to load the URDF or the SRDF of the robot to fix this.
Here are the console logs:

Strange as it may sound, when running in debug mode using gdb worked around the issue for a person I was helping.
$ roslaunch moveit_setup_assistant setup_assistant.launch debug:=true

You did not get the message No root joint .. when running the Setup Assistant in gdb?

Not that I know of (this was happening on someone else' computer I was helping).
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2015-04-24:
That sounds rather strange: the message essentially tells you that there is no joint connecting base_link to the 'world' (however that is defined). Running in gdb or not should not affect this.
