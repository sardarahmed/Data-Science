Q:

Turtlebot - Unable to acquire data image from camera

Hello everybody,
I looked for a solution in the forum, analyzing the different answers/questions but I still don't find a solution to my problem.
Some basic information:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 32 bit
Groovy
Turtlebot with Kobuki base

I followed the guide and there are no problems for communication, teleoperation and so on.
However, I am complitely not able to use the camera: basically, I don't acquire data information.
At this step, I have problem (reference: turtlebot_bringup/Tutorials/groovy/3D Visualisation )
In netbook:
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup 3dsensor.launch

Workstation:
roslaunch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_robot.launch

Everything seems ok but when I go in rviz, I have a warn in Image: No Image Received.
I tried different solutions but no ones worked. I am going to explain you.
First of all, kinect seems connected to my netbook. The light of kinect flashes green.
I tried all the possible USB port (to avoid USB 3.0 problems) but the result is the same.

Bus 003 Device 035: ID 045e:02ad Microsoft Corp. Xbox NUI Audio
Bus 003 Device 038: ID 045e:02ae Microsoft Corp. Xbox NUI Camera

So...This is the list of rosnode list from workstation
cvassall@hagurosan:groovy$ rosnode list
/app_manager
/bumper2pointcloud
/camera/camera_nodelet_manager
/camera/depth/metric
/camera/depth/metric_rect
/camera/depth/points
/camera/depth/rectify_depth
/camera/depth_registered/metric
/camera/depth_registered/metric_rect
/camera/depth_registered/rectify_depth
/camera/depthimage_to_laserscan_loader
/camera/disparity_depth
/camera/disparity_depth_registered
/camera/driver
/camera/ir/rectify_ir
/camera/openni_camera_loader
/camera/points_xyzrgb
/camera/points_xyzrgb_depth_rgb
/camera/register_depth_rgb
/camera/rgb/debayer
/camera/rgb/rectify_color
/camera/rgb/rectify_mono
/camera_nodelet_manager
/cmd_vel_mux
/diagnostic_aggregator
/master_sync_turtlebot_W110ER_7065_566021383
/mobile_base
/mobile_base_nodelet_manager
/robot_pose_ekf
/robot_state_publisher
/rosout
/rqt_gui_py_node_11279
/rviz
/zeroconf/zeroconf_avahi

Then I tried to get the image directly from kinect using the command
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/rgb/image

I obtain a white image.
Then, the last try. I killed 3dsensor.launch and I runned
cvassall@hagurosan:groovy$ rosrun openni_camera openni_node

but in turtlebot-pc and workstation, the answer is the same:
[ INFO] [1392211004.943802894]: Initializing nodelet with 4 worker threads.
[ INFO] [1392211005.029530557]: No devices connected.... waiting for devices to be connected
[ INFO] [1392211008.034147743]: No devices connected.... waiting for devices to be connected

What can I do to solve the problem?
I am beginner and maybe I skip some "basic" step about kinect but I followed everything in the Tutorial.
Thanks a lot

A:

You can use rostopic list to see what topics you can subscribe to. You will see a lot of image related topics. Particularly, you can

rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/rgb/image_color compressed

And that should work. Notice that the compressed is optional. /camera/rgb/image_mono is also working for me. I cannot see depth images using image_view yet (http://answers.ros.org/question/134686/turtlebot-depth-image-not-showing-in-image_view/) but they do show in RVIZ.
In RVIZ, expand the IMAGE line and try subscribing to some topic.
