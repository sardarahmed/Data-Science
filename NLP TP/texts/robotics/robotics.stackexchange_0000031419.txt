A:

We at CWRU did a little bit with JAUS+ROS for IGVC 2010. See cwru_jaus. That code relies on having the appropriate JAUS SDK installed (either OpenJAUS or JAUS++, I honestly can't remember; shouldn't be too hard to figure out from the code or makefiles/CMakeLists).
That code was basically supposed to carry out the interoperation required by the JAUS competition in IGVC 2010, so looking into those rules should give you an idea of what cwru_jaus was trying to accomplish.
If you have any questions, feel free to ask and I'll try to answer. Keep in mind that that code is experimental and not really documented.
