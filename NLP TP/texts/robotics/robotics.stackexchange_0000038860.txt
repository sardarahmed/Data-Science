Q:

rosjava install uri

I found two different rosjava install uri
The one in the rosjava tutorial: https://rosjava.googlecode.com/hg
AND
The one in googlecode page: https://code.google.com/p/rosjava/
Is there any difference between these two uris and which one should i use?
Thanks a lot :>

A:

The two URIs are equivalent. I believe the SSL cert is assigned to the https://code.google.com/p/rosjava/ one though and hg may complain if you use the other. However, that shouldn't be a problem unless you're trying to push to the repo.
