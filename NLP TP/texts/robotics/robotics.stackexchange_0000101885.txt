Q:

cmd vel - control robot

Hello.
I have a problem using ROS. I'm a beginner. I want to move this robot in the Gazebo simulation.
What I'm doing is the following:
I open a terminal and type:
roscore
Then I open a new tab and I type:
cd catkin_ws
roslaunch p3dx_gazebo p3dx_empty_world.launch
So Gazebo opens with the robot inside.
Now I want to move the robot (send  command via cmd_vel topic).
What I'm doing here is this:
rostopic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist -r 10 -- '[2.0, 0.0, 0.0]' '[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]'
But the robot doesn't move.
What should I do?
Thanks in advance.

Check if Simulation is not paused.

A:

Check your topics using rostopic list. By default your robot launches with the namespace pioneer according to this line. I'm guessing your cmd_vel topic is actually called /pioneer/cmd_vel in that case publishing to cmd_vel isn't going to do anything.
If you do not want to use a namespace, you need to launch roslaunch p3dx_gazebo p3dx_empty_world_no_ns.launch.
