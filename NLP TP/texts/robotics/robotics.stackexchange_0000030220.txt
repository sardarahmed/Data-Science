Q:

subscriber over ip

Hi all,
I have a low speed cpu connected to a hokuyo laser. I would like to see its output on rviz. An example launch code is provided on ROS https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/laser_drivers/trunk/hokuyo_node/hokuyo_test.launch
However, since rviz and other GUI tools require some good amount of memory, I need to find a way to see the output on my laptop. Is there any way that I could send the hokuyo data over the ethernet?...so that I can view the data on an rviz running on my laptop?
Could I write any subscriber that listens to a node name on a particular ip? Hope my question is clear.
Thanks in advance

A:

If you run only the hokuyo node on your 'limited' CPU and have it connected with setting your environment variables correctly (look at ROS_IP, ROS_MASTER_URI and ROS_HOSTNAME). Then you can run a roscore on your laptop and visualise all data with rviz. The communication will be handles for you over the published ROS topics as a sensor_msgs laserscan msg.
You want to export the ROS_IP of your limited CPU on that CPU and also export the ROS_MASTER_URI to http://<your_laptop_ip_or_hostname>:11311
