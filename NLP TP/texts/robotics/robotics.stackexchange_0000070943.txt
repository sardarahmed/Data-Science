Q:

Installation of ROS on Ubuntu 15.10

Hi everybody,
I've just installed a fresh version of Ubuntu 15.10 "Wily Werewolf" on my VMWare Player.
I want to install the latest version of ROS (which is "Jade Turtle" I assume).
When going through the installation tutorial
I've noticed already on step 1.2 the first problem.

ROS Jade ONLY supports Trusty (14.04),
Utopic (14.10) and Vivid (15.04) for
debian packages.

As I am running 15.10, I assume, that ROS Jade doesn't support debian packages on my special system.
As I am not experienced with Ubuntu, I can only guess that the next steps of the tutorial won't for me as this is a pretty basic requirement for the system.
Does anyone has a easier-to-understand installing guide for me (I know that the tutorial I mentioned above is really simple already)?
Thanks in advance!
Che.
