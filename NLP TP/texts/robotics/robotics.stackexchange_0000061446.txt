Q:

Installing PCL after Hydro

Hello all,
I have some issues installing PCL with Hydro. As I understand it PCL is not included in ros-hydro-desktop-full anymore so after I installed ROS I tried to install PCL with
sudo apt-get install libpcl-all.

However this only installs ~1.5KB of files which is obviously not normal. The pcl header files are nowhere to be found (/usr/local/include is empty). This is a problem since the pcl_ros header files include the pcl header files which means that I cannot compile anything.
What am I missing here?
Thanks a lot for your help.

A:

libpcl-all doesn't appear to be a valid Ubuntu package.
Ubuntu packages are usually split into runtime packages which contain the shared libraries, and development packages, which contain the headers and build files, and have a -dev suffix.
I suspect you need to install the libpcl-1.7-all-dev package.
Note also that locally installed headers get installed into /usr/local/include, such as when building from source, but headers for system packages, installed through the package manager, are usually installed directly into /usr/include. (This helps make sure that the user doesn't mess with the package manager, and the package manager doesn't overwrite the user's files).
On my system, with libpcl-1.7-all-dev installed, the PCL headers are in /usr/include/pcl-1.7/pcl
