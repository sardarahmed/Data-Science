Q:

Transforming linear acceleration data of IMU to linear velocity data

Hi,
How to transform linear accelerating data of IMU to linear velocity data? I want to obtain linear x and y velocity value from IMU. How can Ä± do this? Thanks in advance.

Integrate. Acceleration is the derivative of velocity. So, to get to velocity from acceleration you need to integrate.

A:

Assuming the x and y axes of your IMU are aligned with your robot and you want the x and y velocities with respect to the robot:
delta_t = time between accelerometer readings

loop:
velocity_x += (accel_x * delta_t) 
velocity_y += (accel_y * delta_t)

thank you sir

Just keep in mind that by integrating the error will grow to be quite large over time.
