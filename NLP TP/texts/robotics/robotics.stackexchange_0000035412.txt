along with the above lines, I had few more lines of error, i read somewhere that, if you delete the .pyc file and change the name of the .py file the error goes off, and it did... was that the right solution???? Well i tried the same thing with above and it didnt work...

Hey thanks for responding, the output of the export PYTHONPATH=${ROS_ROOT}/core/roslib/src:${PYTHONPATH}, and yes after the ros setup, I am adding a line " $export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/youbot/ros_stacks" in the setup.sh
Comment by Felix Endres on 2011-11-02:
Sounds like problems with the python path. What does a "echo $PYTHONPATH" output? Are you changing PYTHONPATH after sourcing the ros setup file in your ~/.bashrc?

A:

Sounds like you redefined $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH so it no longer includes the stacks of the ROS distribution. That could explain your import failure.
The root problem seems to be misunderstanding environment variables, so here is the corrected export command, as explained in several comments below:
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/maneesh/ros_stacks:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

Now, i am able to run the process.... but i seems to have a problem regarding the command, rosmake...., for example When i type" $rosmake youbot_oodl" I get an error stating:  [ rosmake ] ERROR: No arguments could be parsed into valid package or stack names. So what does that mean now???

Thank you so much for your help guys, it seems to be working fine now..... the process works....:)

As others have noted, you need to append to your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.  The sample you pasted redefines it.  Append looks like "export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/maneesh/ros_stacks:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH"

and the last line was : if [ ! "$ROS_MASTER_URI" ] ; then export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311 ; fi                                                                       now please let me know what i need to modify in order to get rid of this error....:)

export ROS_ROOT=/opt/ros/diamondback/ros
export PATH=${ROS_ROOT}/bin:${PATH}
export PYTHONPATH=${ROS_ROOT}/core/roslib/src:${PYTHONPATH}
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/maneesh/ros_stacks
Comment by Maneesh on 2011-11-03:
Yes, i tried that, but still i am getting the error... let me post the contents of the setup.sh file, that might help...
Comment by Felix Endres on 2011-11-03:
You must keep the original ROS_PACKAGE_PATH and prepend or append to it. Use: export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/youbot/ros_stacks:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
Comment by Maneesh on 2011-11-03:
I dint delete any line or path from the setup.sh, just added an additional line, which is export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/youbot/ros_stacks..... however, there was another line : export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks....which still present in the setup.sh.... is this causing the problem?
Comment by Maneesh on 2011-11-03:
So how do i go about eliminating this failure / error, so that i can go ahead and launch gazebo with the ros command.... I am sorry, i am very much new to this and I have less knowledge in this field... if you can help with this, it would be grateful....

I see the same error.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/kinetic/bin/roslaunch", line 34, in <module>
    import roslaunch
ImportError: No module named roslaunch
