Q:

dwa_planner: trajectory_cloud topic not showing up

Hello,
When we run move_base with dwa_local_planner, doing a rostopic list shows a topic named /move_base/DWAPlannerROS/trajectory_cloud, and another named /move_base/DWAPlannerROS/cost_cloud. However, nothing ever seems to get posted to these topics, even when there's an active nav goal in play. Should we be seeing output on these topics? We're debugging some strange behavior and would sure like to see what the planner is thinking.
Thanks,
Rick

I think there are parameters that you have to set to enable these topics.

A:

If you want to visualize the trajectory cloud and the cost cloud, you have to set the publish_traj_pc and publish_cost_grid_pc parameters respectively. These aren't dynamic_reconfigure parameters, so you'll have to set them directly in your local planner parameters.
This isn't well documented. I had to go to the source to find the relevant parameters: https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/blob/ab3cdff51fa062845be8da4cf1e58f5fc56abab9/dwa_local_planner/src/dwa_planner.cpp#L154-L163
