Q:

Package Dependency Rules?

Hi all,
I read in this document p05-ros-navigacija.pdf
Create Package with its dependency, then launch folder with launch file to load TurtleBot in simple office environment. Then when run $ roslaunch ros_liv_turtlebot office_turtlebot.launch
get this message
cannot locate [office_turtlebot.launch] in package [ros_liv_turtlebot]

I try to follow error
 amal@amal-HP-G62-Notebook-PC:~/ros/sandbox/ros_liv_turtlebot$ roswtf

Please update your question to show how you currently refer to that package.

OK, I see now I have to change Q at all
Comment by joq on 2013-02-25:
Is your $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH set correctly? What does rospack find ros_liv_turtlebot display?
Comment by Amal on 2013-02-25:
amal@amal-HP-G62-Notebook-PC:~$ rospack find ros_liv_turtlebot
/home/amal/ros/sandbox/ros_liv_turtlebot
:
yes, I am sure that package path is set correctly

A:

This looks like your homework. In general, you should do your own homework.
Re-read pages 5 and 6 carefully.
The error you're seeing indicates that roslaunch can't find a file named office_turtlebot.launch anywhere inside of the ros_liv_turtlebot package.

1- it is not a homework, ROS is my self study to do my graduation project..
2- page 5 and 6 where ?!
3- yes, I know that it can not find the launch file, but this file is exist so why it can not find it ?!
Thanks
Comment by ahendrix on 2013-02-27:
Pages 5 and 6 of the document you linked to describe how to create the appropriate launch file. If the file exists, there's probably something wrong with your directory structure; can you add a recursive directory listing to the question?
