Q:

fuerte machine tag changes

rep 124 describes the changes made in the machine tag syntax in the ROS fuerte release [1], and states:
The env-loader file must be an executable script that accepts variable-length arguments. After performing environment setup, the script must then execute its arguments as a command. ROS installations come with a default environment loader file.
Can someone give an example of how such a script would typically look like?

A:

I don't really get how this script works. Executing it once prints the first echo statement, executing it a second time only prints the second statement. Must be my lack of bash script understanding.
Anyway, I put together a simple script that does the job for me:
#!/bin/bash

export ROS_ROOT=<ros-root>
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=<ros-package-path>
export ROS_IP=<ip>
export ROS_MASTER_URI=<master-uri>

exec "$@"

This script should be placed on the remote computer. In the machine file, remove all definitions of ros-* variables, and use the env-loader="" attribute, e.g.
<launch>
  <machine name="<machine-name>" env-loader="<path-to-env-script>" address="<remote-ip>" user="<username>">
  </machine>
</launch>
