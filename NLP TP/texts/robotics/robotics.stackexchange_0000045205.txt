Q:

ardrone_ brown ardrone error in camera

hi!
i would like to use ardrone_brown on my ArDrone 2.0. but i have a error.
when i use this package with this tutorial " http://dasl.mem.drexel.edu/wiki/index.php/Controlling_the_ARDRONE_with_the_Brown-ROS_package"
I can take off/ land and Move my ArDrone but I have problem with the camera.
I type
$ roscore
$rosrun ardrone_brown ardrone_driver
$rosrun drone_teleop drone_teleop.py
but when I type :
"  rosrun image_view image_view image:=/ardrone/image_raw "
in my terminal, i can not watch the signal of my Ardrone Camera.
P.S. I use UBUNTU 12.01 and ROS FUERTE
P.S.2 It is not a error in my camera because i also try to use the drive Ardrone _ autonomy and i can watch  my camera but i want to use the other driver because i want to use for navigation on vision.
Sorry for my english.
Thank you!

A:

ardrone_brown is now deprecated.  I have been using the ardrone_autonomy fork, and it seems to work well.
I also recommend using mjpeg_server to view images through browsers.
