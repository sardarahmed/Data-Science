Q:

GPS data on TCP IP, not on /dev/tty

UBuntu 12.04 and Fuerte
Hi ROS users.
I understand that gpsd_client ROS package needs "gpsd" process to be run on a  physical device port /dev/tty.
But my case is different, I am getting the GPS data in NMEA format over an IP 192.168.0.61 and 10002 port. I can connect to it using telnet 192.168.0.61 10002. I cannot access the server side of it, so cannot run any other process other than to accept the data from TCP IP.
I am wondering if any one of you can tell me how I can get the GPSD to take the data from TCP IP port. I want to use the ROS package which relies on GPSD process.
I found a similar question, but was not answered.

Thanks and Have a Good Day!

A:

Found the answer at http://gpsd.berlios.de/gpsd.html under section TCP feed.
Just use
gpsd -S 10001 tcp://192/168.0.61:10002
So the final data will be on local host and port 10001.
