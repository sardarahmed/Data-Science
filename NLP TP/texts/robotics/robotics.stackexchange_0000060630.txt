Q:

udoo and sicklms

Hello, i am running ubuntu 13.04 on UDOO and ros hydro. I have been trying to install sicktoolbox_wrapper on udoo since yesterday by following the "using sicklms" guide but unfortunately i get stuck at the first step, when i try to do "rosdep update" i get an error which says "AssertionError: unable to handle 'index' format version '2' please update rosdistro.
But when i try to update it tells me "python-rosdistro is already the newest version".Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

This was resolved by switching to the current ARM repository at http://packages.namniart.com/ros . See: http://answers.ros.org/question/190925/udoo-sicktoolbox/
