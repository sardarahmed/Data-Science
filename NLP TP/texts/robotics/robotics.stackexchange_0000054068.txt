Q:

rqt loading with requested perspective

Hi!
I'm having a problem with roslaunch rqt_gui rqt_gui. When I launch this command in terminal, only upper bar appears, then it disappears and appears again in different place, but the rqt_gui itself does not launch eventually. I believe it's connected to some plugin I wrote, though there are no error msgs in terminal. Is it possible to somehow run rqt_gui with requested perspective?  I'd like to run rqt_gui with default perspective and try adding my plugin again, to see if it is the cause of my problem - now I'm not able to do anything in rqt.
Thanks in advance,
da-na

A:

First, I believe you just put typo rosrun as roslaunch; roslaunching rqt_gui that doesn't have launch files shouldn't do anything.
You might want to look at help by $ rqt -h, that says a few options available regarding perspective:
  -p PERSPECTIVE, --perspective PERSPECTIVE
                        start with this named perspective
  --perspective-file PERSPECTIVE_FILE
                        start with a perspective loaded from a file
:  
  --list-perspectives   list available perspectives

If you want to reset all settings from previous runtime, run $ rqt --clear-config. Again from help:
  --clear-config        clear the configuration (including all perspectives and plugin settings)

Finally, you can ignite rqt_gui by just rqt as I did in the above.

Hey!
Simply typing rqt doesn't work for me (there's a msg in terminal saying haven't found rqt command). But I typed "roscd rqt_gui/src" and then "./rqt_gui --clear-config" as you suggested.
It worked :) Thank you
Could anyone put this on tutorial page?

Hi. It worked also for me. In my case I had two click twice on the icon of my plugin for making it appear.
Many thanks.

@da-na looks like you're on fuerte where rqt command isn't there yet.

@130s where does rqt save perspectives that can be called with the -p option?
