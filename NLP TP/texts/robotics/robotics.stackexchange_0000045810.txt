Q:

what is the best way to install ros on ubuntu 12.10

Hi
I tried installing ros on ubuntu 12.10 but the normal method doesn't work (i tried desktop and desktop-full). Has anyone installed ros on ubuntu 12.10. I saw some questions but i'm new to ubuntu and linux so those answers were a bit advanced for me.
Also when will groovy be released ? I thought it was nov 15. Should I just try installing the groovy barebones/stack instead ?
Thanks

A:

EDIT:
official repositories out (compiled for ubuntu 12.10 and 64 bits only as of 19 nov):
You can follow the installation instructions here:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation
Old answer:

Actually, ROS is already ready for
Ubuntu 12.10 via apt-get install. You
just need to use the following
repository:
 sudo sh -c 'echo "deb
http://packages.ros.org/ros-shadow-fixed/ubuntu
quantal main" >
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'

and then do
 sudo apt-get update 
and install ros and your favourite
stacks with
 sudo apt-get install
ros-groovy-STACKNAME 
Hope this helps, remember to switch
back to the main repository in some
days when the official version is
ready. The repository I gave your is
not the main one.

This will install groovy which is not even beta at the moment and it is still changing a lot. I really would not suggest to use it yet.

It has been tested in my robotics lab and works perfectly as of today. Moreover, release date is today, I hardly doubt that it will change a lot.
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-11-15:
The ROS developers are close to releasing the first beta release but I would not expect a final release before December. At the moment, 32 bit packages for 12.10 are not even built. Related post on ros-users.
