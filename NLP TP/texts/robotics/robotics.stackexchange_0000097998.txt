Q:

Confusion in ROS2 default middleware

I have noted that FastRTPS is the default middleware in ROS2 Foxy.
But again, there are 2 version of FastRTPS too: a) FastRTPS dynamic (rmw_fastrtps_dynamic_cpp)  and b) Plain FastRTPS (rmw_fastrtps_cpp).
So which one exactly is the default middleware in ROS 2 Foxy Fitzroy ?

A:

The default for Foxy Fitzroy is rmw_fastrtps_cpp.
It is the first one listed on REP 2000.
