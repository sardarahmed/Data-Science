Q:

Install turtelbot simulator on mac os?

How to install turtlebot on mac os ?
I have tried to complie the source from github and when I run rosdep install --from-paths src -i -y
I get
the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
kobuki_ftdi: No definition of [ftdi-eeprom] for OS [osx]
kobuki_qtestsuite: No definition of [pyqt4-dev-tools] for OS [osx]

Any ideas ?

A:

The error is telling you that it doesn't know how to install two required system dependencies because they don't have rosdep keys for OSX.
If you can figure out how to install these dependencies with homebrew or pip, you can fork rosdistro, add the keys, and submit a pull request.
