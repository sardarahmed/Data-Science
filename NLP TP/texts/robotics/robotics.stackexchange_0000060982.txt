Q:

CMakeLists.txt: Install Python

What is the best way to install python libraries with a package?
This tutorial says how to do Python scripts, and I know you also need a setup.py, but I'm having trouble running import easy_markers with the deb package generated from easy_markers
(and now that I checked, I apparently can't run either of my scripts in the package either using rosrun)
You can download and test this package with apt-get install ros-groovy-easy-markers

Does the import easy_markers work now?

A:

For Python 3 migration reasons, the recommended install method has changed from install(PROGRAMS ...) to catkin_install_python(PROGRAMS ...).
See the how-to page for installing Python scripts and modules.

Then it is unfortunate that the tutorial on the wiki is out of data: http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/CMakeLists.txt#Installing_Python_Executable_Scripts

Yeah. It's hard to find and fix all the stuff on the wiki. If I still remember about this problem, I'll fix it when I get back from vacation. Please open an issue for catkin, so it does not get lost.

I will open an issue. Keep enjoying (hopefully) your vacation and not worrying about caktin :-).
