Q:

2 questions about distro and map

1、can I connect my laptop(running Hydro) to the robot(running Indigo)?
2、How can I generate a map of the environment(this map I can store it and use it on RVIZ to do the simulation work)?I want to compare the real condition with the simulation condition.
Thanks!

A:

Yes you can communicate with the ROS Topics independent from the ROS Version
Is likely more difficult to answer because I have no Idea about your robot, environment and map.
But the problem you want do solve is commonly named SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). There are two most popular SLAM packages in ROS:

GMapping
Hector SLAM

Both of them need a laserscan and GMapping also a Odometry (in form of a transformation from odom to base_link)
You can save and load the created map with the Map Server package.
