Please help and explain. I'm also facing the same problem. Currently doing this roswtf tutorial
Comment by alienmon on 2016-08-15:
Eventhough I already roscd It still says No package or stack in context .
According to tutorial it should display stack:ros:
"Stack: ros": roswtf uses whatever your current directory is to determine what checks it does. This is telling us that you started roswtf in the ros stack.

@ahendrix can you help to answer please?

It looks like that tutorial was written for an old version of ROS, and the package layout on newer version of ROS is different.

@ahendrix can you elaborate more please?thanks

A:

I found the roswtf tutorial was outdated (using output from old packaging concept 'stack'), so I've updated where you're no longer expected to see stack output from roswtf and what you're seeing is right. Also see #q41808 for more explanation about the roswtf output.
