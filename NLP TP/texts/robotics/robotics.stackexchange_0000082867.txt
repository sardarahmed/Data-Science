I have the pocketshpinx installed and the sphinxbase as well
the error is same as here and here and I saw the answers says to run this command which I have done
sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-gconf

I tried also to run
 sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-pocketsphinx

but it gives me the following error
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package gstreamer0.10-pocketsphinx
E: Couldn't find any package by glob 'gstreamer0.10-pocketsphinx'
E: Couldn't find any package by regex 'gstreamer0.10-pocketsphinx'

and still having the same error if any one have suggestions or any one can help please
thank you
