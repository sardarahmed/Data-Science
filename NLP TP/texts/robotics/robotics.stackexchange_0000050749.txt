Q:

how to run carrot_planner on stage

I build the package under the sandbox named carrot_plan.
when I run the package shows the results as :
administrator@cpr-det-01:~$ rosrun carrot_plan carrot_plan
%!PS
%%Creator: Eitan Marder-Eppstein (Willow Garage)
%%EndComments
%Insertion Time: 0.004618883
%Footprint calc: 0.000008106
%Illegal footprint
showpage
%%EOF
I saw the  (Willow Garage). Then I run the world file first then run the carrot_plan, but still got the same results.
Anyone can tell me how I can run the carrot_plan on the stage.

A:

The error suggests that the footprint of your robot is inadaquately defined or improperly defined.  You should check how that is defined and make sure it's defined correctly.
