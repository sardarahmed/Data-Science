Q:

camera_calibration package not detected and cannot locate rosdep definition for sensor_msgs

Hi,
ubuntu 12.04 and ROS Fuerte
I downloaded the camera_calibration package using
git clone https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline.git
When I do
rosdep install camera_calibration
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
camera_calibration: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [sensor_msgs]
rosmake camera_calibration
[ rosmake ] rosmake starting...

sai@sai-HP-EliteBook-8460w:~/fuerte_workspace$
finally when i do roscd camera_calibration
roscd: No such package/stack 'camera_calibration'
***There is no issue with sensor_msgs and is working well
Any help on how to solve these issues and get camera_calibration to work.

This means ROS_PACKAGE_PATH is not set properly and hence ROS is unable to locate sensor_msgs and camera_calibration packages. Are you using a ros workspace or are you installing in some directory. In the latter case, are you setting the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH to include that directory as well?

Hi, I am using ROS workspace and am able to roscd to sensor_msgs and all the issues are solved with camera_calibration...Only one thing  is left..when I do                                rosdep install camera_calibration it says camera_calibration: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [sensor_msgs]

A:

It will be much simpler to just install the Ubuntu package:
$ sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-image-pipeline

Hi, I tried this and now I am struck with one thing .when I do rosdep install camera_calibration                    it says           camera_calibration: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [sensor_msgs]

The point of using apt-get was to avoid building image-pipeline from source. Common messages should have been installed automatically, they are a dependency. You should not need that rosdep install.

@sai @joq Hey. I have the same problem and it isn't yet solved.
For "sudo apt-get install camera_calibration", I am getting "Unable to locate package camera_calibration"
For "sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-image-pipeline", I am getting Unable to locate package ros-fuerte-image-pipeline

This answer dates back to 2013. ROS Fuerte is no longer supported. Substitute the name of the ROS version you are actually running.
