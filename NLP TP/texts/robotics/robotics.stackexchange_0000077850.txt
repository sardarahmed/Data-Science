Q:

rtabmap odometry rate in rviz

/rtabmap/odom runs at about 16Hz. However, when visualizing it in RViz, the vector seems to move at a much slower rate: 1-2 Hz, in spite of rviz reporting that it receives messages from rtabmap at the rate I expect. How can I make rviz visualize the rtabmap data at the same rate as the white line in the rtabmap viewer?

A:

Did you compare with TF shown in RVIZ? For the Odometry display in RVIZ, there are "Position Tolerance" and "Angle Tolerance" parameters that can be set to 0 if you want to show all odometry messages.
