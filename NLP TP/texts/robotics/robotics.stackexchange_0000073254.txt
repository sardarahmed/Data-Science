Q:

Temporary deactivation of a subscriber

Hey!
I'm thinking about possibly useful feature that I'm currently missing in ROS and would like to hear your opinion on it.
I'm currently writing a node that subscribes to a pointcloud-Topic but in fact only uses a pointcloud every minute or so. It would be useful to be able to temporarily disable the subscriber so that the pointcloud-publisher can use getNumSubscribers to decide if the CPU-hungry stereo-algorithm has to be run or not.
This effect could currently only be achieved by calling subscriber.shutdown and subscribing again later but that requires to store the topic_name and more boilerplate code.
Who would use this feature?

A:

Wouldn't ros::topic::waitForMessage(..) work here? See ros::topic for the docs.

Perfect example of an xy-problem this then :).

If that was the case, how could you post that answer without asking which problem I really wanted to solve? I provided X and Y ;)

I've seen my share of "I need to temporarily disable a publisher/subscriber" questions.

I provided X and Y ;)

True. That made it easier :).
