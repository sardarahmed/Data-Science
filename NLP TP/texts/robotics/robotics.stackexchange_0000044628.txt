Q:

Can't build Ardusim

I'm trying to build Ardusim for use on my turtlebot.  ROS Electric, Ubuntu 10.04 and I issued these commands:
alan@alan-desktop:~$ cd ~/ros_workspace
alan@alan-desktop:~/ros_workspace$ svn checkout http://isr-uc-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/stacks/lse_arduino/trunk/ardusim
alan@alan-desktop:~/ros_workspace$ cd ardusim
alan@alan-desktop:~/ros_workspace/ardusim$ rosmake
But, I don't think it found everything:
Failed to find stack for package [lse_sensor_msgs]
Failed to load rosdep.yaml for package [lse_sensor_msgs]:Cannot locate installation of package lse_sensor_msgs: [rospack] couldn't find package [lse_sensor_msgs]. ROS_ROOT[/opt/ros/electric/ros] ROS_PACKAGE_PATH[/home/alan/ros_workspace:/opt/ros/electric/stacks]
Failed to find stack for package [cereal_port]
Failed to load rosdep.yaml for package [cereal_port]:Cannot locate installation of package cereal_port: [rospack] couldn't find package [cereal_port]. ROS_ROOT[/opt/ros/electric/ros] ROS_PACKAGE_PATH[/home/alan/ros_workspace:/opt/ros/electric/stacks]
So what is the proper way to get and build Ardusim?
Thanks,
Alan

A:

I don't know if there is an automatic way to install the dependencies, but you can find the missing stacks at:
lse_sensor_msgs -> http://isr-uc-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/stacks/lse_messages/trunk/
cereal_port -> http://isr-uc-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/stacks/serial_communication/trunk/
If you installed ROS from source you can use the tools roslocate and rosinstall to do it.
Maybe some installation guru can give you a better approach or take a look at this answer: installing ros packages from source.
