Q:

Is ROS 2 compatible with the stage simulator?

I mean we can use stage with ROS1, but can we use it with ROS2?

Hi
I more or less rewrote stage_ros as stage_ros2. It differs from the previous stage_ros interfaces in its modularity.
It is available under https://github.com/tuw-robotics/stage_ros2 and tested for humble. 
An installation description is also available.
