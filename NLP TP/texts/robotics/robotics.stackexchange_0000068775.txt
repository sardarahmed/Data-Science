Q:

coffeebot webserver open problems

Hi!
I am currently using the LAMP stack as explained in the http://learn.turtlebot.com/2015/02/01/20/ tutorial. The goal is to order a coffee (robot driving to specific location) through a chrome extension. I am running the turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch and loaded my map on the turtlebot laptop. I installed the LAMP correctly and entered the public_dns where I had to.
Here is my traceback:
nicolas@nicolas-Precision-WorkStation-T3400:~/helloworld/turtlebot$ python coffee_bot.py 
[INFO] [WallTime: 1437468105.504769] wait for the action server to come up

  File "coffee_bot.py", line 102, in deliver_coffee
    data = json.load(urllib2.urlopen(self.server_public_dns + "/var/www/html/turtlebot-server/coffee_queue.php?pop"))
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/urllib2.py", line 127, in urlopen
    return _opener.open(url, data, timeout)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/urllib2.py", line 404, in open
    response = self._open(req, data)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/urllib2.py", line 422, in _open
    '_open', req)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/urllib2.py", line 382, in _call_chain
    result = func(*args)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/urllib2.py", line 1214, in http_open
    return self.do_open(httplib.HTTPConnection, req)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/urllib2.py", line 1184, in do_open
    raise URLError(err)
urllib2.URLError: <urlopen error timed out>

I changed the path from
self.server_public_dns + "/turtlebot-server/coffee_queue.php?pop

to:
self.server_public_dns + "/var/www/html/turtlebot-server/coffee_queue.php?pop

because when ssh into the server, this is where it is located. But either way it is not working. Can anyone help?
Thanks in advance!
Cheers

Without knowing anything about this particular system: servers typically have a DocumentRoot dir, from which they serve pages. All URLs are relative to that root, which here seems to be /var/www/html/turtlebot-server. Adding the full local filesystem path wouldn't seem like a good idea.

A:

The problem was that I didn't allow http in my security preferences of the web server ...
