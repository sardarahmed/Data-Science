Q:

3D velodyne pointcloud to occuppancy grid

Hi, I intend to use this package http://wiki.ros.org/amcl or one similir to initially localize my self in a prebuilt map. I wnat to convert my 3D map to an occupancy grid, I know how to convert it to a 2D pointcloud or a laser scan, using http://wiki.ros.org/pointcloud_to_laserscan or http://wiki.ros.org/velodyne_height_map However I dont know how to convert that to an occupancy grid.
Thanks a lot!

A:

To pipe laserscan or pointcloud data into an 'occupancy grid' style data structure, you can use the costmap_2d library.
http://wiki.ros.org/costmap_2d
You can run a standalone costmap as a node (costmap_2d_node), and configure the costmap's layers (particularly obstacle layers) to take in sensor data.
Users typically use costmap_2d as part of the navigation stack, which integrates the costmaps together with planners to give an end-to-end-ish solution for 2d navigation.
