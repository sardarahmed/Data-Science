Q:

Focal Length from Monocular Calibration

I was wondering if the parameters saved from running the cameracalibrator.py node contain the focal length/s of the camera somewhere inside. If not, is it possible to determine a focal length based on these values?
Thanks

A:

The camera matrix, as written out by cameracalibrator.py is as follows:
Fx  0  Cx
0   Fy Cy
0   0   1

where Fx and Fy are the x and y focal lengths in pixels, and (Cx, Cy) is the principal point.

hi, but these Fx and Fy can be found from camera parameters (intrinsic), but what is the actual focal length of the camera ? in formula Fx = f * Mx , where Mx is pixel/mm on image sensor. how can we get that !! any idea !
