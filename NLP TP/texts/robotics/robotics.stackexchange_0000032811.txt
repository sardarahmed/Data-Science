Q:

Multiple / in computation graph names

Is it officially OK to use multiple / in names for the computation graph, similar to Linux  file systems, e.g.:

    //test1 will point to /test1
    /test1//test4 will point to /test1/test4

I have tested and used this for parameters. It does what I expect.
My question is: Is this behaviour guaranteed?

A:

No, there is a good chance that not all client libraries will catch this.  There are generally libraries in each language to help with constructing names, e.g.
C++:
ros::names::append
Python:
roslib.names.ns_join
