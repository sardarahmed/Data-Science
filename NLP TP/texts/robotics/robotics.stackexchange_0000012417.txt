Q:

Math behind trajectory planning

Let's assume the very simple case of a particle and a control system in one dimensional space therefore our particle can move only in a straight line and dynamics of system is described by:
$m\vec{a} = u$.
Now the problem: we would like to make our particle move from point $A$ to point $B$ in time $t$ and constrain our acceleration with some  value $a_{m}$ i.e. $a$ can not exceed $a_{m}$ at any moment.
How would one do this assuming that our control system allows us to control either velocity or acceleration?
The most important things here are names of mathematical methods behind this task and explanation of how to apply them. 
Also consider that
$x(0) = A = 0\\ x(t) = B\\ v(0)=0\\a(0)=0\\ v(t)=0\\ a(t)=0$

A:

Since the problem is one dimensional, you are actually asking to compute a velocity profile. (A velocity profile is the information of how a path is traversed with respect to time.) Now the problem is "How to travel for $B$ units within time $T$?" (Let's call the duration $T$ instead.)
A velocity profile can be viewed as a curve in the $v$-$t$ (velocity vs time) plane. And as we all know, the area under a curve in that $v$-$t$ plane is the displacement. So any curve which passes through points $(v_0, t_0) = (0, 0)$ and $(v_2, t_2) = (0, T)$ with the area $B$ will be what you are looking for.
One velocity profile which solves the problem is as shown below.

It contains two segments. From time $0$ to $t_s$, you travel with a constant positive acceleration. Then after that you travel with a constant negative acceleration (of equal magnitude). The peak velocity $v_p$ can be easily computed since we know that 
$$
\frac{1}{2}v_{p}(T) = B.
$$
This is fine as long as the magnitude of acceleration of both parts, $|a| = v_p/t_s = 2v_p/T$, does not exceed $a_m$.

Normally, people would ask how to get from $x_0 = A$ to $x_1 = B$ the fastest possible. When there are only velocity and acceleration limits, the time-optimal velocity profile can be computed analytically (see, e.g., this paper ) using polynomial interpolation. People may also be interested in other higher-order constraints such as jerk limits (i.e., limits on the rate of change of acceleration).
I don't think there is any more specific name for these things than something like trajectory generation using polynomials or splines, etc.
