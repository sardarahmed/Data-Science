Q:

Rviz .vcg vs .rviz (fuerte vs groovy)

I just to groovy and realized that my rviz config file, xx.vcg, no longer loads in rviz. Instead, if i save a configuration, it is saved as xx.rviz.
Is there any way to create a config file that will load in both fuerte's and groovy's rviz? I ask because I am creating a stack to run on either and would like to have as few differences as possible.
Thank you in advance.
Alex

A:

Sorry, the RViz config mechanism in Groovy is not backwards compatible.
