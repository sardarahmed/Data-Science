Q:

common_msgs package missing sensor_msgs/point_cloud2.py in Groovy/Precise?

The github repo for common_msgs/sensor_msgs contains a point_cloud2.py that looks useful for accessing the data in PointCloud2 messages in Python, however it doesn't seem to get installed when you install the common_msgs from debs using Groovy/Precise. Is it deprecated or something? Is there another way to get the data from a pointcloud2 in Python?

A:

You are right. It looks like that module was forgotten in the catkin conversion.
Please open an issue to get that fixed. You can link back to this question to avoid repeating stuff.

Looks like the documentation for that module is also missing.
