Q:

package installation

Hi there,
I am using ROS noetic on a ubuntu 20.04.1.
I am new to ROS and I am so confused about the package installation.
For example, if I want to install the
robot localization package,
Do I just git clone it using the following command into my workspace?
$git clone -b noetic-devel https://github.com/cra-ros-pkg/robot_localization.git

I notice that package can be install through apt, but how can I know that apt command for the package I want?

sudo apt-get install ros-neotic-robot-localization
Usually, I do sudo apt-get install ros-neotic-robot and then search the available packages using tab.

See #q320046 for a related Q&A.
Summarising: do not build from source, unless there is an absolute need.

A:

You can check if a specific package is released for a specific distro using the repositories.ros.org Status Pages. Choose the appropriate distro and architecture. I.e. for Noetic, go for ros_noetic_default. Then you can search if a package is released and which version has been synced to which package repository (testing, main).
To install packages, basically what @praskot said, is: sudo apt install ros-<DISTRO>-<PKG> with all underscores in the package name converted to dashes -.
