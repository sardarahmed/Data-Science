Q:

New to ROS - Want to get quadrocoptor or drones

Hi -
Hobby robotics/AI builder.  I have done a bunch of projects with the NXT and some C-based programming, but I would like to get into ROS and pick up either a quadrocoptor or a set of small drone-like coptors I could use to program.  Is there a good quadcoptor that isn't too expensive for me to get started on that would be recommended for a beginner on ROS?  Also - I would like to get into swarm robotics and perhaps have 5 or 6 drones behaving in unison.  Is this something that is possible on a hobbyist's budget or is it a higher level project?
Thanks in advance

A:

That question depends on what kind of budget you have but it's likely a higher level project. The cheapest quadrotor on the market at the moment is the AR Drone. While a lot of fun to fly they are limited and may or may not be applicable to your project. You can build something considerably more capable for about $600. I've done this by combining a Guai 330X chassis (which is no longer for sale) and an ArduPilot Mega. Beware that this route requires a sizable time investment to achieve programmatic control over such a device. If you are not tied to the idea of using real robots you could consider the hector_quadrotor statck. IIRC it is a quadrotor simulator built on Gazebo and should allow you to work with a swarm.
