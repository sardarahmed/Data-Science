Q:

(solved) How to glue syringe?

I foud tons of answer how glue with syringe, but I need to glue syriges together to be airtight and glue some silicon tube there too  and cannot find a hint how to do it. 
Does anybody know what glue does stick with syringe (eventually dissolve it a little)?

A:

I used just hot soldering rod and it went well. I need to keep the heat low, but was able to solder the plastick together to be airtight. Just to be sure more I use the hot glue afteward to enforse the connections and make them more smooth. Not exactly nice looking, but works well enough.
