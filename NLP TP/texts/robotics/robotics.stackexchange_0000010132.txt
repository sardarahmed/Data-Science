Q:

What is the best way to plug in more than 3 stepper motors into a Arduino Uno board?

I'm developing a 5 axis robotic arm with stepper motors and I am getting around to ordering most of my parts. I plan on using 5 EasyDriver shields to drive all of my motors. I am also planning on using just a basic arduino uno board to go with it. So here are my questions:
Is there any alternative instead of buying a ton of Easy Drivers and connecting all of them to a single board?
And if there isn't, then how would the setup look to use more than 3 stepper motors? This is the most useful picture I found, however It only shows 3 and while I know I could plug in a 4th I am unsure whether I could plug in a 5th.

A:

Each EasyDriver takes two digital inputs - step and direction. These do not need any particular protocol so you can use any pin capable of digital output. 
The Arduino uno has 14 digital outputs and 6 analogue inputs which also can be configured as digital outputs, so you could drive up to ten of the boards from an Arduino without any other hardware. 
Just connect the two digital inputs for each board to two more digital pins of the Arduino, for example 8 and 9 for board four and 10 and 11 for board five. This leaves 0 and 1 clear for serial communications.
