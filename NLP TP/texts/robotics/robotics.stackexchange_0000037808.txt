Q:

Navigation Stack Localisation Method

Is it necessary to use AMCL in order to localise and path plan in the navigation stack?
I have a good estimate of the position of my robot in the map from using a kinect and RGBDSLAM. Can I just use this somehow or do I need to localise again using laser data?

A:

In principle you can use any localization method you want.
During navigation you just have to look out for how stable and accurate it is.
