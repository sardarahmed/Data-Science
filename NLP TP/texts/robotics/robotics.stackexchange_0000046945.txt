Q:

Segfault: rosrun collada_urdf urdf_to_collada

I've been working with OpenRave to get their IKFast IK solver to work, and I have been using the urdf_to_collada tool to convert my urdf to dae format. However, with the upgrade to Groovy this tool now seg faults. All it says is:

Segmentation fault (core dumped)

I tested this with both my custom urdf and the standard pr2.urdf. Having this tool back would be really nice!
Update the gdb backtrace:
urdf_openrave:gdb --args /opt/ros/groovy/lib/collada_urdf/urdf_to_collada clam.urdf clam.dae
