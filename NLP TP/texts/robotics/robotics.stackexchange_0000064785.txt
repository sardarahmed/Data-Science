Q:

bash: /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash: No such file or director

I have installed ros indigo on ubuntu 14.04.1 following the instructions. But met a problem, details like below:
bash: /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash: No such file or directory

Then i check the directory of "/opt", found that it is empty, like below:
ros@ubuntu:/opt$ ls -al

total 8

drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Dec 21 13:40 .

drwxr-xr-x 23 root root 4096 Dec 21 13:35 ..

ros@ubuntu:/opt$

And when i executed the commands(like following), it gave the same error.
echo "source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc

source ~/.bashrc

Could someone help me? Thanks a lot!

Did anything fail during sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-destop-full ?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2014-12-22:
Also: which "instructions"?

@Wolf  I used sudo apptitude install ros-indigo-desktop-full instead of sudo apt-get.
But there were no error.

Hi friends
I am also suffering from same problems in my raspberryPI 3B. My operating system is NOOBS, but i found command line instruction for Wheezy or Jessie.  How can i solve these problems.

@krishna890227 please open a new question, with sufficient info of your situation.

A:

You simply didn't install anything.
Since you are going to use Ubuntu 14.04.1 it is for you the best option to simply install from the repository.
Here you have the procedure. Just pay attention to every code of line, don't forget any instructions. Later on you can configure your environment accordingly. The first 2-3 times I had problems too. The first problem to understand,why and what you need to run ROS. But after that you can fast realize that's quite normal and it won't be  a problem anymore :P
