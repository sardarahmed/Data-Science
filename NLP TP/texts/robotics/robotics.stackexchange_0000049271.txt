Q:

Problem with ros networking

I am using a Desktop Pc and a Remote pc on a pioneer base as my Ros fuerte architecture. On this one I ran my roscore and some nodes to interact with the pioneer. The rest nodes I run them on the PC. I am having a problem with the network. When I launch a launch file from ros with the machine tag from the Desktop computer to the laptop on the pioneer.
as explained here: ros.org/wiki/roslaunch/XML/machine
I get an error:
remote[higgs-0]: failed to launch on higgs:
Unable to establish ssh connection to [higgs:22]: No authentication methods available
But I am able to connect each machines using the ssh command bidirectionally.
I use the ROS variables ROS_HOSTNAME(name of each machine) ROS_MASTER_URI(higgs_ip). You can rostopic echo from the different machines, or see the rviz on the Desktop computer from the information on the sensor on the pioneer base. But I have to launch the nodes on the laptop directly.
I will appreciate any help.

Thank you for your help tbh.
I have set the sshkeys correctly, I do not have to enter the password anymore. But I am still experiencing the same error.
remote[higgs-0]: failed to launch on higgs: Unable to establish ssh connection to [higgs:22]: No authentication methods available
Maybe is the fact that I am using different users in each machine?
I have checked .ssh/autorized_keys in higgs (robot laptop, where I want my remote launch to execute)
ssh -rsa blablabla agonzamart@arturo-desktop (my user and computer) ssh -rsa blablabla higgs@higgs (the user I use in the robot laptop) ssh -rsa blablabla root@arturo-desktop (root user from my computer)
I will appreciate any help.

A:

When you ssh to higgs, do you usually need to enter a password? If so, then you probably need to set up your sshkeys. Here's a guide on how to do it.
