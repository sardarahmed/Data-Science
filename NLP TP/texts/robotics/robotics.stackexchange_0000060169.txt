Q:

It is possible to get deb from jenkins before debian repo sync?

I released new package. Build on jenkins.ros.org successfully completes. Where i can get these package(s) for inspection?

A:

For each distro, there is a status page for debs (for indigo, it's http://www.ros.org/debbuild/indigo.html, for others, replace indigo with the distro). This will tell you what version is in what debian repository. The second column under each heading is the "ros-shadow-fixed" repository, which is probably what you want.
If you want to download an individual deb for inspection, you can find them at http://packages.ros.org/ros-shadow-fixed, or you could update your /etc/apt/sources files to point at "ros-shadow-fixed" rather than "ros", which will allow you to install and test (but, of course, things might be broken -- the "fixed" in ros-shadow-fixed is kinda wishful thinking, not a guarantee)
