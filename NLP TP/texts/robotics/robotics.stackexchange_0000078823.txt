Q:

ROS and DOCKER installation?

Hi,
Can someone clarify my doubt regarding ROS & Docker installation ?
My doubt is that whether we have to install first ROS on Ubuntu and then Docker in ROS environment OR we have to install first Docker on Ubuntu and then ROS on it.

A:

Both are possible, but only one order of installation (ROS in your Docker image) would seem to make sense (or at least: would allow you to exploit the isolation that Docker containers provide).
If you want to run nodes in a Docker container, then install Docker, create an image that install ROS (or use one of the osrf/ros images) and then start containers from those images.
