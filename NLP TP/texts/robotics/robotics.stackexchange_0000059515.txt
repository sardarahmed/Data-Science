Q:

Why is plugin of eband_local_planner named bgp_plugin.xml?

I noticed that a plugin name of eband_local_planner is bgp_plugin.xml. Eband_local_planner is a kind of like local_planner. Why is the plugin named bgp_plugin.xml instead of blp_plugin.xml? Actually, if I rename bgp_plugin.xml to blp_plugin.xml, Errors happened.
Does anybody know the reason?

A:

The name of the xml file that defines the plugins doesn't matter; it just has to match between the package's package.xml and the filename.

Thanks, @ahendrix: I wanna ask you one more question. I think that move_base calls bgp_plugin.xml and blp_plugin.xml. In this case, move_base can't call other global_planner. I think so.  Is this idea wrong?
Comment by ahendrix on 2014-05-20:
No. The name of the file is not related to how move_base interprets it, and it shouldn't prevent you from loading other global planners.

Thanks, @ahendrix: Actually, I check that default global planner(global_planner/GlobalPlanner) is called.
