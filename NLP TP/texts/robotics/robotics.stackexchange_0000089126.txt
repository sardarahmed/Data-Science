Q:

How to set RViz (in PC without ROS) to access remote PC (with ROS)

I am working on a project that has a Robot with Raspberry Pi controlling it and the data of the Robot's diagnostics is sent by Raspberry Pi to a Desktop PC over Wifi. I am able to establish the communication between Desktop PC and Raspberry Pi over Network by referring this: Running ROS across multiple machines
I am already done with the results if both the Raspberry Pi and Desktop PC are having ROS installed.
I have a launch file called "view_robot.launch" that invokes the RViz and sets the Robot Parametric Environment. Here is the content of the file:
    <launch>
<arg name="model" />
<!-- Parsing xacro and setting robot_description parameter -->
<param name="robot_description" command="$(find xacro)/xacro.py $(find mobile_robot_description)/urdf/robot_model.xacro" />
<!-- Starting robot state publish which will publish tf -->
<node name="robot_state_publisher" pkg="robot_state_publisher" type="state_publisher" />
<!-- Launch visualization in rviz -->
<node name="rviz" pkg="rviz" type="rviz" args="-d $(find mobile_robot_description)/config/robot.rviz" required="true" /> </launch>

Now I need to remove ROS from Desktop PC, Open RViz in it and connect to my Raspberry Pi's roslaunch server that is not having a unique address. Is it possible? If Yes, then I need some references with which I can implement this.

A:

RVIZ is part of ROS if you uninstall ROS you can' run RVIZ? It's not a stand alone application but a fully integrated part of ROS that can't work on it's own.

Thank you for clearing the confusion.
