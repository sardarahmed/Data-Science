Q:

ROS package not found after catkin_make

Hello :)
I'm quite new to ROS and tried to install a package (laser_line_extraction) from github.
I completely followed this instruction https://wiki.nps.edu/display/RC/Setting+up+a+ROS+package+from+Git step-by-step.
But after creating the package with catkin it's there as a directory but can't be found with "rospack find ...".
[rospack] Error: package 'laser_line_extraction' not found
Online I found something about "sourcing the launchfile" but no explanation on what this means or how to do it.
Can anyone help?

A:

If the package was compiled successfully, try â€œsource ~/.bashrc" or "source /path-ws/devel/setup.bash" and then "rospack find" again
