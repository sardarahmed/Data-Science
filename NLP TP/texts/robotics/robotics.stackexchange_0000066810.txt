Q:

How to add more robots to stageros?

Hi,
I want to add another robot to this stage:
http://wiki.ros.org/stage/Tutorials/SimulatingOneRobot
but I don't know how. I just found this tutorial
http://wiki.ros.org/stage/Tutorials/Creating%20Custom%20World%20in%20Stage
about how to personalize a stage in stageros but unfortunately it is incomplete.
Can someone help me in that please?
Best,

A:

Hi,
I answer to myself: You can add more robots editing the .world file of the stage that you are using. For example, if you are using willow-erratic it would be willow-erratic.world. This file is located at /opt/ros//share/stage_ros/world/
You need to add the following definition to the file:
erratic( pose [ -13.277 23.266 0 180.000 ] name "Quasi" color "blue")
Best,
