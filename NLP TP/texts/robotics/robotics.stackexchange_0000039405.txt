Q:

Passing a pointer as a ROS msg

Hello, im creating a basic vision system which implements filters through a pipeline structure. My point cloud is grabbed by a kinect. The thing is i would like t send just a pointer to the cloud as a ROS message, in order to get a faster and more efficient processing. Is there a way to do this? thanks

A:

...not as such. ROS messages are transmitted over the network; as a result, "passing a pointer" doesn't make any sense.
But wait, there's more!
One possibility is to just implement your pipeline in a single node; then it can pass pointers around because it's all in one process.
Another is to use nodelets, which offer a way of defining something that behaves like a node, but lets you have several in the same process; these were devised to solve exactly the problem you're talking about.
A third option is ecto; where ROS is by-design asynchronous (which makes multi-input perceptual pipelines very painful), ecto is by-design synchronous, to make such pipelines easy. Ecto's still in heavy development, but it'll be seriously cool when it's done.
