Q:

ros-fuerte-pcl missing dependency libmysqlclient_16

I'm currently working on releasing a stack into fuerte.  It depends on pcl and currently when I try to compile I am getting the following error:
Linking CXX executable ../bin/pointcloud_snapshot
/opt/ros/fuerte/lib/libpcl_surface.so: undefined reference to `__cxa_pure_virtual@libmysqlclient_16'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
After doing some web research I found a link to this ticket: https://code.ros.org/trac/ros-pkg/ticket/5415
While I believe that the fix (sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev) will work to get it to install properly on my machine I need to make sure that for a generic install my code can be released.  Is there something I need to do or should I open a ticket.

A:

It turns out I was having dependency issues.  If you see this error you should make sure that your dependencies, libmysqlclient_16 and libmysqlclient-dev have been updated.
If using ubuntu/debian, make sure to check that the update repositories are enabled by checking that /etc/apt/sources.list has something like:
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu lucid-updates universe main multiverse

with lucid replaced by whatever ubuntu release you have.
Or by checking in Synaptic in settings>repositores>updates>recommended updates checkbox.
