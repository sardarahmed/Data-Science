Q:

I am trying to start a robotics club

I am an IT guy.  I have a 2 year degree in web design and computer networking.  So I know C++ ,HTML, CSS, and PHP.  When I found out that robots use the C++ I almost fell out of my chair.  So I am trying to start a robotics club in NC.  I have not been able to find robotics clubs in NC.  Do you have any suggestion's?  What is the hardest part of robotics?

why you almost fell out of your chair? is that so surprising?

A:

The biggest upfront challenge is getting enough equipment available for a club to work on.  A TurtleBot is excellent.  I'd also recommend getting an Arduino.  You can experiment with OpenCV with just a standard webcam.
