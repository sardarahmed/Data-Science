Q:

interfacing hardware with diff_drive_controller

Hello,
I am building a differential drive robot and I want to exploit the power of the diff_drive_controller
but I have faced a couple of problems to interface my hardware to the controller I am using a tiva c launchpad as my embedded board but the real problem is, where can I get the velocity output of each wheel from the controller then I can transfer it with the appropriate method to the motors?

Yup I know about this rosserial_tivac
but if you can help me with getting the output of the controller I couldn't understand how can I get the velocity command output there is no such topic published for each wheel so I can transfer it to the tivac
I appreciate your time and help

after a good research I have found that I should write a hardware_interface in order to take the cmd values for each wheel and give feedback of each one as well then I can expose these values to a topic to use rosserial in order to transfer it to the tivac, please correct me if I am wrong
