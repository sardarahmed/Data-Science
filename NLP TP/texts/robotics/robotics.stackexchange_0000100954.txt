Q:

Issues: Motion Planning & Trajectory Waypoints

I'm following MoveIt Quickstart in RViz tutorial. I chose the Specific Start/Goal States then I pressed "Plan" from the Motion planning panel but it didn't change anything or show the trajectory path.
Also in Motion Planning Slider, the waypoint is still numbered 0.
I set the start/goal of the robot arm to a different location without any collision.
Does anyone know why I cant witness any changes when I press Plan?
I'm curious about the error I got when I ran "roslaunch panda_moveit_config demo.launch rviz_tutorial:=true". It still opened RVIZ and I was able to upload panda_arm(motion planning).
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [moveit_ros_move_group/move_group]: Cannot locate node of type [move_group] in package [moveit_ros_move_group]. Make sure file exists in package path and permission is set to executable (chmod +x)

A:

Most likely your MoveIt package didn’t build properly.
Start by checking if the package is there:
rospack find moveit_ros_move_group

If it’s present, then you may need to look at reinstalling, try using apt instead.
