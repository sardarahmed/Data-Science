Q:

Unable to locate package ros-kinetic-desktop-full

I recently changed my mac osx into ubuntu purely for the sake of installing ROS. I updated my ubuntu system to the latest ubuntu bionic beaver version(allegedly called 18.04 LTS). I started to install ROS Kinetic Kame by following the instruction provided by the official ROS website. When I typed in
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-desktop-full

I received
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-kinetic-desktop-full

I would like to know the reason. Was it because of the latest version of ubuntu ?

Yes. Kinetic is only supported on Ubuntu 15.10 and 16.04, see REP-3 - Platforms by Distribution: Kinetic Kame (May 2016 - May 2021).

I updated my ubuntu system to the latest ubuntu bionic beaver version(allegedly called 18.04 LTS).

There is currently no official support for any ROS version on Bionic Beaver.
