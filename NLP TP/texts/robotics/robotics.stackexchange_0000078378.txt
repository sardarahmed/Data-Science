Q:

Using cartographer for creating map, how?

Hello, I just installed cartographer package and I am trying to use it in order to create a map and visualise it in rviz.
I am using vrep, where I have a robot with laser scan publishing data to laser scan topic and odometry data to odom topic.
I am trying to make the cartographer_node to subscribe to these topics and produce the map, just like I did with gmapping before.
However I am lost in the launch files and in how I pass these parameters to cartographer. I am in beginner level. I have read the ros tutorials but still it doesn't make sense. Could anyone provide me with an example of how to do this?
Thanks in advance.

A:

Hey,
you need a IMU topic that publich /imu msg. I d'ont know, if you can use it only with /scan and /odom topic
you have to change the configuration in your backpack_2d.lua.
use_laser_scan = true,
use_multi_echo_laser_scan = false,
