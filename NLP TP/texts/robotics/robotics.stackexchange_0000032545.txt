Q:

Is visualization OK on laptops with Optimus+Bumblebee?

I'm mostly interested in whether rviz will work if I install bumblebee on a laptop that has NVIDIA graphics and Optimus (in which the NV card sends its output through the Intel graphics hardware, which sends everything out to the display).
Has anyone tried this?

I know some colleagues that have an Optimus laptop on linux and they are NOT happy. I would stay away from that for now, although the latest I have heard is a couple of weeks old. Whatever you do: Use the latest bumblebee, there was a bug deleting /usr.

A:

The Optimus on the TurtleBot laptops does not currently work.  The Nvidia card cannot be used.
