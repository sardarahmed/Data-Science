Q:

rviz window closes itself

Hello,
I am trying to visualize the simulated of particles in rviz using points. But in the middle of simulation process, the rviz is getting crash. It gives the following description of problem.
rviz: /tmp/buildd/ros-diamondback-visualization-common-1.4.0/debian/ros-diamondback-visualization-common/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/visualization_common/ogre/build/ogre_src_v1-7-1/OgreMain/include/OgreAxisAlignedBox.h:252: void Ogre::AxisAlignedBox::setExtents(const Ogre::Vector3&, const Ogre::Vector3&): Assertion `(min.x <= max.x && min.y <= max.y && min.z <= max.z) && "The minimum corner of the box must be less than or equal to maximum corner"' failed.
Aborted
Can any one help? thanks.

I've seen a similar problem in gazebo when fiddling with the stepsize parameter.  "The minimum corner of the box must be less than or equal to maximum corner"' failed.

The resolution and rviz window size is fine. I just noticed that with other simulation display, the rviz is working fine but with the points simulation it gives the error. Can it be something wrong with the point simulation?

I've seen this before but I can't quite recall in what cases... are you running the window under a weird resolution or making the rviz window very small/oddly sized?

I also come across the same problem these days, can you tell me how to fix it? thanks.

I just had this when publishing an incomplete odometry-orientation and opened a bug report on github.

Happened to me too when I was accidentally publishing messages with illegal values, in my case NaNs in a PoseStamped. Once I made sure there were no NaNs in the message, the error no longer occurred.

A:

If you can provide minimal code to reproduce this, you should file a bug.
