Q:

Are there any open-source congnative planing frameworks for robotics?

I have seen a lot of academic papers, but no framework that I can download and use. There are even projects, such as OpenCog, which might be usable in a few years.
I would like to know of the existence of any open-source goal/cognitive/planning frameworks now.
There is a lot of software for motion planning, but I would like a way to determine where the robot wants to do before planning how to get there.

A:

KnowRob is a knowledge processing system that combines knowledge representation and reasoning methods with techniques for acquiring knowledge and for grounding the knowledge in a physical system and can serve as a common semantic framework for integrating information from different sources. KnowRob combines static encyclopedic knowledge, common-sense knowledge, task descriptions, environment models, object information and information about observed actions that has been acquired from various sources (manually axiomatized, derived from observations, or imported from the web). It supports different deterministic and probabilistic reasoning mechanisms, clustering, classification and segmentation methods, and includes query interfaces as well as visualization tools.
