Q:

study orientation for ROBOT "GO TO SPECIFIED DESTINATION"

Hi
I'm studying ROS, my goal is to build a robot that I can inform a target point on the RVIZ map (2d nav goal).
I would like to use the laser scan RPLIDAR A1, raspberrypi + PC and robot with two motorized wheels.
I already conclude the initial tutorials of WIKI-ROS (http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials) what would be the next studies that suggest me?
I do not know where to start.
Example:
1ยบ tutorial WIKI-ROS -> 2ยบ ........ -> 3ยบ ........ -> 4ยบ ........

A:

I suggest that the next set of tutorials for you to look at is for the navigation stack: http://wiki.ros.org/navigation. The navigation stack has very extensive tutorials and is made for navigating to a point specified by 2d nav goal. Reading all of the documentation on this will give you a much better understanding of tf_frames and other basics that are necessary for successful navigation.
