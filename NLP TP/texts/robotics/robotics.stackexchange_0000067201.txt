Q:

rosrun beginner_tutorials error

I am following the beginner tutorial, when I run 

roscore

then from within catkin_ws I run

catkin_make

rosrun beginner_tutorials talker

I am geting an error 

[rospack] Error: package
'beginner_tutorials' not found

what would cause this error?
could it be file ownership?  so far everything was thru command line but after i installed eclipse this error started happening.

when i run

rosrun roscpp_tutorials talker

it runs ok but I am not sure where this package resides.

A:

From within the catkin_ws: source devel/setup.bash, then try to rosrun again.

when do i need to "source" catkin_ws? in other words what would cause me to have to do this?

So the script setup.bash is a config script that will set some environment variables. Without those variables being set then ROS is not aware of the new executables that you have created during build.

source the environment

I thought catkin_make took care of compiling node changes
