Q:

hector slam not disaplying map in rviz

hi i am following these steps below to run my hector slam in rviz :
** README.txt**
  Postprocessing Logfile example ==

Download this file:
http://code.google.com/p/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/downloads/detail?name=Team_Hector_MappingBox_RoboCup_2011_Rescue_Arena.bag&can=2&q=
   Open a new terminal window, type:
       rosmake hector_slam

 Launch the tutorial launch file provided in the hector_slam_launch package:
     roslaunch hector_slam_launch tutorial.launch

    Open another terminal, enter the directory of the .bag file and type:
  rosbag play Team_Hector_MappingBox_RoboCup_2011_Rescue_Arena.bag --clock

Before this i installed ros using  this command sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-hector-slam
But when I am running my second command which is the Ros launch its showing a warning sign:

[ INFO] [1439891300.286474566]: HectorSM p_map_update_angle_threshold_: 0.060000

  20.002011 seconds of waiting. This warning only prints once.

In the rviz display panel its also showing a warning sign
Global Status: Warn   
  Fixed Frame
 No tf data. Actual error: Fixed Frame [map] does not exist

The rosabag file is running but no map /visualization is being displayed in rviz

Hi, what do you get when you run rosrun rqt_tf_tree rqt_tf_tree? I don't need you have the /map frame. You need that to produce the map.

Put this line in your .launch file:
or

I'm having the same issue! I edited tutorial.launch in the hector_slam_launch/launch folder, adding:
as psprox96 suggests.
This got rid of the warnings but still no map...

Nevermind, it is making the map, I just didn't have the right topics watched in RVIZ, doh!
Comment by psprox96 on 2015-08-18:
You run that command in the terminal, like how you rosmake the packages. Do you know where is your .launch file? The one you need to run to get the INFO.
Comment by psprox96 on 2015-08-18:
Yup, and make sure you set your Global Frame in Rviz to /map and LaserScan to /scan.

I just directly type the rosmake command and the follow up code in the terminal and then open an another terminal then go to the directly that contains the bag file and then execute it. I don't go to  any directory that contains the .launch file.I  just type it when i open my terminal

Have you run rosrun rqt_tf_tree rqt_tf_tree? Can I know the result?
Your command is: roslaunch hector_slam_launch tutorial.launch. So the package is hector_slam_launch.
Type:
roscd hector_slam_launch
in your terminal.
And open up the tutorial.launch file and add the node pkg line inside.

A:

It appears the rviz config does not get loaded correctly (at least on Indigo) and for this reason the rviz Displays are not properly set up. You'll have to manually add the "Map" display to see the map. See also the rviz Map Display wiki page.
