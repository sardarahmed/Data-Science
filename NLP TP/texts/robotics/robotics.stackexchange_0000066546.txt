Q:

Twist values for robot insanely large

Hi All,
I am making a robot based off of a wheelchair. When I try to run the bot with the teleop_twist_keyboard node I have to turn up the speed to over 20 in order for the motors to move and then they run extremely quickly. Is this normal? All of the programs I have tried for teleoperation have been in the range of +/- 1.5 or less for all axises. The github repo with the code is here: https://github.com/kk6axq/ros_arduino_bridge.git. Thanks for helping a beginner get on in ROS!
Thanks,
luketheduke

A:

That is very high. Units on Twist should be in m/s (see rep 103) 20m/s is ~ 44mph which is a little fast for any wheelchair type application.
Requiring a command that high suggests that your platform's controller is not controlling for speed properly.
