Q:

Gazebo Garden: change noise characteristics of IMU sensor

I am compiling Gazebo from source on my Ubuntu 22.04 Mac M1 Parallels VM.
I am wondering how I can change the noise characteristics (like standard deviation) of the default IMU sensor in Gazebo Garden.
I noticed that there is already a class that handles these IMU sensor changes, but I am unsure of how to use it. https://gazebosim.org/api/gazebo/6.9/classignition_1_1gazebo_1_1Imu.html
Where would I insert this class? Would I treat like a plugin and put it into the SDF? I see it has something to do with the Component Inspector. Or would a different method be more convenient?
Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!

A:

The noise characteristics can be configured through the SDF. Currently the following characteristics are supported:

"none" (no noise)
"gaussian" (draw noise values independently for each measurement from a Gaussian distribution)
"gaussian_quantized" ("gaussian" plus quantization of outputs (ie. rounding)

It can be configured for the x, y and z coordinates for the angular velocity and linear acceleration.
