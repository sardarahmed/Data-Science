A:

This error is because you are trying to link to a library "ptedit_1" which still do not exist. You probably expect cmake->makefile->make to generate "ptedit_1" library.
You must add following command to CMakeList.txt.
rosbuild_add_library(${PROJECT_NAME} your_source_files)

This will result in required library. Command target_link_libraries( ptedit_1 ${KDE4_KDEUI_LIBS} ) must come after rosbuild command.
