Q:

Message Format or Description

Hello everyone,
Is there a way we can know the description of the data that is logged for each topic ?
For example the data logged to the topic /navsat/fix contains altitude ,longitude and latitude and also many other fields. Is there a way we can understand what these other fields are ?

A:

Do you mean like knowing the rest of the fields of that message type? that can be done through rosmsg show <message>, as described here here. If you wish to know the message type of the topic, the you can run rostopic type <topic>, or in your case, rostopic type /navsat/fix.
The source .msg file will also often contain documentation describing each field.

Thank you , where exactly is the source .msg file for each datatype , I need a detailed description of different datatypes.

Each message type is specified by its package name and then the message name, e.g, geometry_msgs/Pose refers to Pose.msg in the geometry_msgs package. Hence navigating to the package first and looking for the .msg file should be fruitful. You can learn more here http://wiki.ros.org/Messages
