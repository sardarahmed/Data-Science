Q:

explore_lite does not work with cartographer

As mentioned in https://github.com/hrnr/m-explore/issues/28
there is a bug where explore_lite does not work with cartographer.
I tried to modify code of explore_lite, but it wasn't successful.
Does anyone have an idea how to fix?
Which other package I can use with cartographer to autonomously explore map?
What do you do to autonomously explore map?
