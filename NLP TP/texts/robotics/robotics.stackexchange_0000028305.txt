It have to be 7.1? I think the latest version of gazebo7 is something around 7.8.1.

Follow the alternative installation here:

I tried this. It upgrades to Gazebo7 not Gazebo7.1.

Do you see 'packages.osrfoundation' with the command 'cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list'? If you're getting from there, you should actually get the latest version, which is 7.8.1
