Q:

navfn compile error

Hello ,
for writing my own global planner, i cloned source of navigation stack
git clone https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation.git
i copied navfn package to my own workspace and built with catkin_make but this weird error comes;
/home/largo/ws/src/navfn/src/navfn_node.cpp: In member function ‘void navfn::NavfnWithCostmap::poseCallback(const ConstPtr&)’:
/home/largo/ws/src/navfn/src/navfn_node.cpp:85:34: error: no matching function for call to ‘costmap_2d::Costmap2DROS::getRobotPose(geometry_msgs::PoseStamped&)’
   cmap_->getRobotPose(global_pose);

I had built this package before with the same steps!!!
Any help will be appreciated.
Best regards

A:

Did you only copy the one package to your workspace? You probably want to build the whole navigation stack from a consistent version. Also -- pay attention to which branch you are using -- we've made a lot of API changes in the melodic-devel branch (the default branch when cloning). If you are on Kinetic, you want to "git checkout kinetic-devel" within the git repo to get the right version.

thank you very much,
you are right, it is because of the wrong branch, i use kinetic but cloned melodic-devel branch
