Q:

Text input for InteractiveMarker

Is it currently possible to set up a text input for an interactive marker? Specifically in order to change the label that sits above the interactive marker. I see that it's possible to have a right click menu that works well in rviz, so when an entry is selected such as 'Rename, it would be something similar to the Rename View dialog.
I am currently using ROS Kinetic, but this is a general question for any distro.

A:

No, this is currently not supported (or at least not by the 'standard' implementation of interactive_markers).
