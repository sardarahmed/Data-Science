Q:

Roadmap for tod_detecting?

What's on the roadmap for tod_detecting such that I can see what I can expect in future revisions of tod_detecting? I'd be happy to have a rough frame about the bigger changes and improvements that are certainly to come, given the recent activity on this package.

A:

tod_detecting is meant to go away in favor of a simpler and more generic object recognition ROS API: give me data and I'll tell you what's in there.
It will share components with TOD but also with our other object recognition pipelines.
Timeline: always easy to give one but harder to stick to it :) We are working on getting all that ready by the end of August.
