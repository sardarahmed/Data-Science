A:

Possibly, it is related with your workspace and package path. Please make sure that you sourced the bash file, i.e; source /home/user/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
If so, your package setup may be the problem. Your package should be listed when you run rospack find relaxed_astar .
If these are not related, please supply more details like directory tree of your workspace and contents of package.xml file.

****-Does the file actually exists? Yes, the file is in the launch folder.
-Did you source the setup.bash file? Do you mean source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash ? Yes, I did.
-What does rospack find relaxed_astar output? [rospack] Error: stack/package relaxed_astar not found
what's Next Please

With setup.bash file I do not mean /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash. I mean the setup.bash file of your workspace. It is located in your workspace, in "devel" folder, as I mentioned in my answer above (source /home/user/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash).

Go to foulder where you have your work_space (normally your catkin_ws), open the file .bashrc is hiden,
and seach if you have:
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
source /home/(username)/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash .
Can do rospack find relaxed_astar or rospack profile(list all packages)
