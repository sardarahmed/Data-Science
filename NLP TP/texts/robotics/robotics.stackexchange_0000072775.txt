And what is your target audience? 'No knowledge' is really nothing. They will probably know something, right?

The target audience is Computer Science Undergraduates with no exposure to ROS and robotics.

A:

Personally, I would copy pasta text and pictures from the website and Wikipedia. I'd pick and choose things from those sources based on the audience. No need redoing something that someone has already put time into doing.

I've seen OSRF basically present that same website, starting at http://www.ros.org/is-ros-for-me/ , to programmers and companies when introducing ROS to them.
