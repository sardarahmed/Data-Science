Q:

uuid and rosdep on OSX 10.9.2

Hi all,
I am trying to install ROS Hydro through Homebrew on my laptop with mac os x 10.9.2. The process of solving the dependencies seems to be not easy, and I not able to complete this phase due to this error:
$ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro groovy -y

WARNING: Metapackage "diagnostics" must buildtool_depend on catkin.
Error: No available formula for uuid 
Error: No available formula for tango-icon-theme 
executing command [brew install uuid]
Error: No available formula for uuid 
Searching taps...
ERROR: the following rosdeps failed to install
  homebrew: command [brew install uuid] failed

What is uuid? Can someone help me please?
Thanks in advance,
Andrea

A:

Are you following the instructions on the wiki [1]? The two formulae are in the ros/hydro tap, so execute brew tap ros/hydro (which is part of the install instructions) and then try the rosdep command again.
Also I just noticed that you are using the option --rosdistro groovy. If you want to install hydro, choose hydro instead of groovy here...
Moreover, depending on which variant you are installing, you might need some or all of the fixes described here, in case you are not aware of that yet [2].
You should be able to install the desktop-full variant of hydro on OS X 10.9.
