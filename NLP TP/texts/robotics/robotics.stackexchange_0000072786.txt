Q:

 in launch file does not work?

I'm trying to launch the turtlebot_rviz_navigation from a launch file using the machine tag.  The launch file exists on the robot and rviz will be run on a remote computer.  Both have ROS installed and both can ssh into the other without any problems.
Here is my definition of the machine and the node:
<machine name="comp" address="comp@192.168.1.11" user="comp" env-loader="/opt/ros/indigo/env.sh" />
          <node machine="comp" name="view_navigation" pkg="turtlebot_rviz_launchers" type="view_navigation.launch" output="screen" launch-prefix="xterm -e" />

/opt/ros/indigo/env.sh in the remote computer has the contents:
#!/usr/bin/env sh
. /opt/ros/indigo/setup.sh
exec "$@"

When I run the launch file I get the error: "cannot resolve host address for machine [comp@192.168.1.11 The traceback for the exception was written to the log file"
Any ideas?

A:

Address should just be your IP address, no need for the username.

I get the error:
remote[192.168.1.11-0]: failed to launch on comp:
192.168.1.11 is not in your SSH known_hosts file.
Please manually: ssh comp@192.168.1.11
then try roslaunching again.

Do as the error message says. After you ssh in the first time, it'll get added to your .ssh/known_hosts file. You can also manually add it yourself.

I ssh'ed into comp@192.168.1.11 then exited and relaunched and got the same error.  I have ssh'ed into my remote computer before.  How do I manually add the IP to the known hosts file?  "nano ~/.ssh/known_hosts" shows two illegible lines.

Okay, I successfully added the address to my known_hosts file but now I get the error "error launching on [192.168.1.11-0, uri http://comp:57183/]: Name or service not known" for the node that I am trying to run through the ssh.

Hm. That doesn't seem right. It should look like ["username"-0, uri http://"ip":11311/]. Are you sure you put everything in the right order?

Ah, I was trying to launch a launch file as a node instead of as an include.  However, now I am getting the problem that I can't launch a launch file from a remote computer.  The include argument only looks for files locally.  Is there anyway to include a file from a remote computer?

I don't think so. However, you can launch nodes on a remote computer so you can launch a file locally that launches remote nodes. An example would be here: https://github.com/PR2/pr2_robot/blob/indigo-devel/pr2_bringup/config/kinect2_bridge.launch

I tried to create a similar workaround by writing a .py node on the remote computer that will execute the desired file.  Then I try to launch that .py node from the launch file using the  declaration include the machine tag but I get the "Name or service not known" error
