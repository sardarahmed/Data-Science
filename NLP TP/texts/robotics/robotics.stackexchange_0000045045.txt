Q:

kinect or monocular camera?

Hi,should i use kinect to do a semantic map ? can i use just monocular camera  ?
what all benefits to use a kinect in roboearth robots that can't done using normal camera ?
and if i want to navigate my robot within a room to reach the table , and begin to infer what is missing components in this table
to do this i must upload object maps of the all table components to Roboearth server
using ( kinect or camera ?? )
and this semantic mapping(must be kinect or can use camera) ??
and begin to  matching a picture of object with these models in the Database so it takes a pictures when reaching the table ?
all these using of camera in the project make me Confused
thanks in advance :)
