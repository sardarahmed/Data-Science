Q:

The issue came by catkin_make of Open_manipulator

During catkin_make of the package of Open_manipulator, came the Problem,

I have tried
$ rosdep install -r --from-path src --ignore-src
but the issue still come.
And it is also the same problem by catkin_make of Svenzva,

i also used
$ rosdep install -r --from-path src --ignore-src
but it make no sense.

Please use the preformatted text button (101010) to format large code snippets and error messages. Also, please do not write answers to questions that are not actually answers. If you'd like to provide more information, please edit your original question.

A:

Both of your issues boil down to required packages missing from your workspace. In both instances you seem to think that the rosdep command that you issue should somehow mean that you won't have missing packages. However, rosdep is only capable of installing packages that have already been released to a package manager (e.g. apt-get or pip).  My guess is at the top of your rosdep command you actually had errors related along the lines of Cannot locate rosdep definition for [robotis_manipulator]. You could also check which packages are missing dependencies with rosdep check --from-paths ~/catkin_ws/src. For any package that cannot be installed automatically from a package manager, you'll need to get the source code. Tools like rosinstall and rosinstall_generator can help with this, but if the package developer hasn't provided you with that infrastructure, you'll have to get the code yourself.
For open_manipulator their official install instructions  show you a bunch of packages that you'll need to clone into your workspace.
For svenza_ros, they do include a rosinstall file and instructions for using it to ensure you have required, unreleased packages (including mx_msgs which is causing your error).
