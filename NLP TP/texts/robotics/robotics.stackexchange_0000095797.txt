Q:

build VS build_depend

Hello,
I saw in different tutorials two different way to add dependencies in package.xml:
<build_depend>package</build_depend>
<build_export_depend>package</build_export_depend>
<exec_depend>package</exec_depend>

and
<build>package</build>

I would like to know the difference, and which one I should use.
Thank you.

A:

The difference is that build_depend et al. are legal values, while build is not a legal value for an element in a package manifest.
Perhaps the author of the "different tutorials" you mention (please always link to what you mention, we cannot guess) intended to actually write depend, as that would be a legal value.
See REP-149: Package Manifest Format Three Specification - Dependency tags for allowed elements and what their purpose is.
