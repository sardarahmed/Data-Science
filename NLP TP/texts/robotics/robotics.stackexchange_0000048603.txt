Q:

Installation error: "E:Unable to locate package ros-groovy"

I'm trying to install the full desktop version of ros on ubuntu 12.04, but I'm getting two errors:
Reading package lists... Done
mdegges@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install ros-groovy desktop-full
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
**E: Unable to locate package ros-groovy
E: Unable to locate package desktop-full**

I'm new to linux & ros, so not sure how to proceed from here.

A:

Try this:
$ sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-desktop-full

Note the dash between groovy and desktop.
