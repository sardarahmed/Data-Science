Q:

What default ports are used in ROS2 DDS implementations?

Its seems like the default ports for DDS communication are not specified. What deafult ports do the different DDS stacks use?

Thx. Worked just fine with these ports. If you repost I'll accept as answer.

Looks like youâ€™re links are a better answer. Maybe just repost your links as an answer and accept your own? I only noticed you linked to the same thing after sending the comment.

I don't have enough rep here to edit yet, or I would've just edited the accepted answer. As of 2019/07/17, the links in the accepted answer for eProsima FastRTPS are invalid. Correct links:

eProsima FastRTPS documentation, p.27.
docs.eprosima.com - advanced - listening locators

Given that links often go stale, I think appropriate to post the relevant info here:

By default eProsima Fast RTPS calculates the listening locators for the built-in UDPv4 network transport using well-known ports. These well-known ports are calculated using the following predefined rules...

(see page ~49, as of v1.9.0 PDF documentation)

A:

eProsima FastRTPS: eProsima FastRTPS documentation, p.27. Usually the ports will be as described in docs.eprosima.com - advanced - listening locators
RTI connext: UDP transport the RTI Connext DDS stack 4.x "what network port numbers does rti connext use".
