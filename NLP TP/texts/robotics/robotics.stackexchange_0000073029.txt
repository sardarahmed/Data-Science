Q:

What ROS packages shall I install

Hello there, I have just installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my Raspberry Pi 2 and have also installed the ROS base (bare bones). So my question is that what packages do I need to make a bot that could make a map of the surrounding a and then autonomously navigate? For ex- SLAM, gazebo, etc
Thanks & Regards
Mukut

A:

Definitely not Gazebo if you're putting together a real robot :P
I'm guessing you're planning on placing the RPi on a chassis and hooking it up to motors/wheels and a LiDAR, right? Once that's done, I would download gmapping for SLAM and navigation for localization and moving around in the map created by SLAM.
You'd also need to find or write drivers and ROS bindings for the motors and LiDAR of course.

Okk...but I am thinking of using an Ultrasonic Sensor or an IR Range finder, because LIDAR is just too expensive. And  what bindings and drivers do I have to write? Do u mean the program to run the motors and get data from the sensor?

OK. Loosely speaking: Drivers = ROS-independent code that interfaces with the sensors/actuators and ROS bindings = ROS code (node) that uses ("wraps") the drivers in order to, among other things, publish the streams of sensor data. Here's a good example: https://github.com/mikeferguson/neato_robot

Okk thanks spmaniato, I am facing some problems installing the navigation package, I found some similar posts but found no suck answer to it. Here's the link : http://answers.ros.org/question/230117/ros-navigation-package-error/

What do you mean by " navigation for localization and moving around the in the map created by SLAM "? Do you mean the navigation stack?
Comment by mukut_noob on 2016-03-30:
Can I use the nav2d instead of navigation? Because I am facing some problems installing it as told in my earlier post.
Comment by spmaniato on 2016-03-31:
Yeah, I meant the navigation stack (ros-indigo-navigation). I don't know much about nav2d, sorry.
