Q:

ROS cannot be compiled, tested on RPI 3 and 4

Hello,
I installed the latest version of raspbian on both RPI 3 and 4 and it just does not compile
/home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/src/rospack/include/rospack/rospack.h:108:10: fatal error: boost/tr1/unordered_set.hpp: No such file or directory

I first read it was becos RPI4 was too new, but apparently something is broken
I followed this tutorial : http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Installing%20ROS%20Kinetic%20on%20the%20Raspberry%20Pi
I use : 2019-09-26-raspbian-buster.img
how can I fix this ?
thanks

A:

There is currently no version of ROS targeting Debian Buster.
It looks like you're trying to install a version of ROS targeting an older version of boost (<1.63) than the one available on your system (Buster 1.67). In your version these headers don't exist anymore.
The header names have been updated in later versions of ROS https://github.com/ros/rospack/pull/80.
You could to try to compile ROS Melodic rather than ROS Kinetic that targets more recent OSes.
You should be able to follow the same instructions and just replace kinetic with melodic in the commands.
