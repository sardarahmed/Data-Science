Q:

Error playing bagfile ~4GB on 32bit system

Hello, I have no problem with the info comand, but when I am trying to play a bagfile but i am gettint an error.
[FATAL] [1425331406.887155495]: Error opening file: 2015-02-13-10-04-56.bag

Bagfile Info:
duration: 1:40s (100s)
size: 3.8 GB
83651 msg

My friend has no problem in play this bagfile. I have test the example with the turtle and I can reproduce it well. May be the problem because the baffile is very large and my computer is not very new?
I am using Xubuntu 32bit and my friend is using Ubunt 64bit.
Thank you.

Can you post the bagfile or get a backtrace?

The bagfile is arround 4gb. So it is difficult to post it. How can I get a backtrace?

32 vs 64 bit issue perhaps? You haven't stated which OS you are using (and which version), nor the ROS release this is happening on.

I am using a 32bits Xubuntu version. So what do you think I should do?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2015-03-03:
I don't know, but 4GB is close to typical 32bit filesize limits. Please update your original question with OS info for your PC and that of your friend.

I've taken the liberty of updating the question title to better reflect what the issue is.
Comment by carlogarro on 2015-03-03:
Ok, there is no problem!

A:

I'm not sure, but ros_comm/issues/464 ("rosbag throws rosbag::IOException at 2GB mark") could be related.
You did not update your question with the version of ROS you are using, but the last comment on ros_comm/pull/554 ("support large bagfiles (>2GB) on 32-bit systems in rosbag_storage") seems to suggest this hasn't made it into Hydro yet, so you could be running into issue 464.

In the end, my teacher uploaded the same bagfile with less size and it has worked perfectly, so i suposed it has been the problem.
Thank you so much for your help!
