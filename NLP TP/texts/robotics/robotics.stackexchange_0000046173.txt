Q:

rosrun string parameter syntax

I am trying to read an integer parameter as string however ros::param::get() does not read it.
std::string my_param;
if (ros::param::get("~x", my_param)) {
   ROS_INFO("value=%s", my_param.c_str());
}

rosrun planning planner _x:=12
rosrun planning planner _x:="12"

It cannot read parameters either way.

Private parameters have to be read this way: http://www.ros.org/wiki/roscpp/Overview/Parameter%20Server#Accessing_Private_Parameters

have you tried itoa() ? http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/itoa/

I solved my problem, but I just want to speculate that there might be a bug or a better explanation for such an unexpected case.

A:

I hit on this too: programs must know in advance the type of the parameter they are fetching, otherwise they may end up getting nothing from the server.
And there is no way to check the parameter type.
