Q:

drcsim problem to show ground truth odometry by rviz

Hi,
It seems there is a problem to show ground truth odometry by rviz. In rviz, I have added the odometry and the topic ground_truth_odom. However, there is an error in Transform.
The error code is
Transform [sender=/gazebo] For frame [/world]: Frame [/world] does not exist
How can I solve this problem and show the ground_truth_odom in rviz?
Thanks,
Weiwei
