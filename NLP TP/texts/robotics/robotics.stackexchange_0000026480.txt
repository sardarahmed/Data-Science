Q:

Is there a means of setting way point poses or selecting a particular animation in "real-time"?

From the animated_characters tutorial, it seems that way points can be scripted, and animations can be selected/blended etc. Is there (or will there be) a means of controlling this actions via a plug-in?

Admittedly, I ask before digging into the codebase (honestly a bit intimidated by some of the changes)

I have the same question.

A:

You can write a model plugin to generate and control animations
