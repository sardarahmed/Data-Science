Q:

kinect virtual machine

Does anyone know how to have it correctly configured.
I found these 2 blogs which basically say the same thing:
http://blog.justsophie.com/installing-kinect-nite-drivers-on-ubuntu-14-04-and-ros-indigo/
http://www.20papercups.net/programming/kinect-on-ubuntu-with-openni/
Except when it is run i get the following output:

It says it started but when using rostopic no messages will be published. Does anyone know how to fix this?

A:

Are you using virtual machines for installing ROS?
I tried using VMs for ROS but they often don't function correctly.
I would suggest using a real PC install for ROS.
