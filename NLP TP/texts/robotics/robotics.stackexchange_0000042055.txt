Q:

Caster wheel "drives" the robot instead of following it

Hi everyone:
You may be familiar with my robot and its problems by now... here comes a new one, yay!
I think that I'm going to let the problem self explain with a video. As you can see, on ~0:30 I turn the robot 90ยบ and then, when I tell the robot to go straight forward again, the caster wheel oscillates instead of just following the main body of the robot, making the robot move more like a snake than a car.
Hints?
Thanks a lot,
Miguel.
Update: I've noticed that if I add a lot of weight to the caster, the oscillation tends to stabilize, but I don't think that's a solution, because I'm increasing the weight of the caster wheel by 300 times its original weight (3g to 0.9kg). Any other ideas?

Well, I managed to solve this problem by changing the <inertial> matrix to something smaller... but since I'm not familiar with this calculations, I'm not sure if this is a good idea.
Anyway, it seems to work pretty well now, so I'm not touching it anytime soon :)
