Q:

Planning with OMPL using a subset of joints

I would like to be able to treat the PR2 as a planar three link manipulator and test out some built in planners (openrave or OMPL).
Is there a way to restrict openrave and/or OMPL to use only the shoulder pan, elbow flex, and wrist flex joint of the PR2?

A:

Yes,
ompl_ros_interface is setup to plan for a group of joints - you can setup a group to consist of just those three joints. When you make a planning request, you do have to make sure you specify where the other joints of the robot should be - they will stay fixed at those positions for planning.
Let me know if you run into problems.
