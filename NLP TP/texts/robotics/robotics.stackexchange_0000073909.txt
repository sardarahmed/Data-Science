Q:

Trouble with python nodes in launchfile

Hi everyone!
I am trying to start some additional nodes together with the minimal.launch file, so I made the following additions for my nodes.
I sourced the devel/setup.bash file so the package can be found and made sure the py files are executable using chmod +x.  Nonetheless, when I try to run the launch file, I get the following errors. It does seem quite generic to me, has someone experienced this before and has an idea?
Thank you!
The lines I added:
  <node name="webcam_pub" pkg="webcam_pub" type="webcam_pub.py" />
  <node name="pos_pub" pkg="stop_snap" type="pos_pub.py" />
  <node name="go_to_goal_v5" pkg="stop_snap" type="go_to_goal_v5.py" />

What I get as output in the console (log files are empty).
process[webcam_pub-14]: started with pid [6036]
: No such file or directory
failed to start local process: /home/turtlebot/library_ws/src/stop_snap/src/pos$
local launch of stop_snap/pos_pub.py failed
[pos_pub-15] process has died [pid -1, exit code 127, cmd /home/turtlebot/libra$

Do you have the required shebang for Python at the top of your file? If not, roslaunch cannot start it, as it tries to start your scripts directly (ie: it doesn't prefix it with python /path/to/your/script.py).
If you have it, make sure your files have the proper Unix line-endings. If you have edited thins under Windows (fi because you have ROS in a VM), they can be changed / mixed, which will lead to all sorts of strange errors (they're not actually 'strange', but the symptoms can be confusing).
