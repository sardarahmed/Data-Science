Q:

turtlebot.launch location if Electric is complied from source

Hi all,
I am just having a problem with localization on the Turtlebot clone I have here.
Firstly, where do I set the calibration parameters if I compile from source on the machine?
In the Tutorials they say to change them in /etc/ros/electric, but am I right in thinking that
that is only visible if I have installed from and sourced the Electric from the debs?
Thanks in advance.

A:

If you want the files in /etc configure upstart
Configure Upstart
It is recommended to use Upstart to start your robot:
roscd turtlebot_bringup/upstart
sudo ./install.bash wlan0

You should replace wlan0 with the name of your wifi interface.
For Ubuntu 11.10 , install daemontools which is need by turtlebot_start.
sudo apt-get install daemontools

Setup NTP
Clock synchronization is important for ROS. Chrony has been found to be the best ntp client over lossy wireless.
manually sync NTP
sudo ntpdate ntp.ubuntu.com

Install Chrony
sudo apt-get install chrony

These are the last half of the instructions here: http://ros.org/wiki/Robots/TurtleBot/Robot%20Install

Hi Melonee, thank you. However, I did manage to get upstart installed it wasn't running as expected. So, say I reboot the Turtlebot, then tried to run teleop, there would be no movement. So, I reverted back to minimal.launch. I've a Turtlebot Clone not installed from an image.
