Q:

libtf.so cannot open shared object file

I was using a package done by myself on fuerte and I have moved this package on Turtlebot which is on electric. But it's not working on electric, I have a error message when I execute roslaunch mypackage mylaunchfile.launch:
error while loading shared libraries: libtf.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory 
process[vision_odometrie-1]: started with pid [30562] [vision_odometrie-1] process has died [pid 30562, exit code 127]. log files: /home/turtlebot/.ros/log/2827a526-d4ef-11e2-a445-047d7b6f6b57/vision_odometrie-1*.log

The rosmake works without error and I have libtf.so in my directory /geometry/tf/lib
If I write:
ldd bin/vision_odometrie
libtf.so => /opt/ros/electric/stacks/geometry/tf/lib/libtf.so (0x00007f356cd0f000)
I have added this line on my .bashrc but that doesn't solve the problem:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/electric/stacks/geometry/tf/lib.libtf.so"
( I cannot do all the update because the linux version is old: Lucid Lynx 10.04LTS )

A:

Try running make clean in the package that throws the error, and then make .

Thanks for your answer. I did that and it's now working well. On the other side I have modified other stupid mistakes so I'm not sure my question was relevant.
