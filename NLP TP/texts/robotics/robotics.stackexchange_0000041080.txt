Q:

broken dependencies in fuerte on Ubuntu 12.04

Hi,
I'm trying to install ros-fuerte-arm-navigation in 12.04 but get broken dependencies in image-common, navigation, robot-model, and visualization. The problem seems to be a conflict with oneiric versions of libassimp-dev and yaml.cpp. Here are the messages I get when I run apt-get -f install (to try to fix the broken dependencies):

The following extra packages will be installed:

E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)

If I try to remove the oneiric versions of assimp-dev or yaml-cpp in Synaptic, then a bunch of other packages in both electric and fuerte get marked for removal. Any idea how to fix this?
Thanks!

A:

Unfortunately, I don't know exactly what the root of the broken deps are, but a few people I know have had the exact same problem.
Either way, the tool I relied on at first was aptitude instead of apt-get, aptitude does a better job dealing with dependencies.
Also, I believe I had to first remove fuerte, then remove/reinstall yaml-cpp and libassimp-dev, then re-install fuerte.
Good luck

It looks like you have upgraded from oneiric and there's old conflicting packages still installed. You'll need to clean them up manually.

Yes the upgrade apparently caused some problems. I'm usually hesitant about manual re-configuration possibly leading down the rabbit hole, but in this case it was enough just to fix the two packages I mentioned.
