Q:

Mordern CMake for Gazebo

Hi everyone!
I was wondering if the "modern" cmake implementation for configuration file was implemented somewhere on gazebo?
By modern cmake I'm talking of this. So to use add_library(gazebo STATIC IMPORTED) instead of the traditional GAZEBO_LIBRARIES cmake varibales. It would just required to install the EXPORT target in the CMakeLists and to include the output files into the gazebo-config.cmake
I saw that ignition-math2 has this mechanism.
If it doesn't exist, would it be interesting to do it ?
All the best :D

The bets place to see current non-released developments of Gazebo would be the defualtbranch of the repository. I don't think that we currently have a relocatable cmake module in Gazebo. It would be a fantastic contribution.
