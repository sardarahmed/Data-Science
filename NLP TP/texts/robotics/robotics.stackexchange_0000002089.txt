Q:

Compiling Code for EY-80

I recently purchased at EY-80 from electrodragon: EY-80 All in one 9-Axis Motion Sensor (Gyro + Acceler + Magneto + Baro)
I am having a hard time compiling the example code on my arduino:

This is what is happening.  So far, I am only copy and pasting the code.  Any help? (I am somewhat new to programming, so don't fully understand all of the code)

A:

After talking to a friend, I found out what I did wrong.

I needed to include all of the #include libraries.
I downloaded one of the libraries in html, instead of raw .h format which was messing up the program, so I downloaded the correct version.

The program is now working, and collecting data well!
If you find your readings to be off, change the update delay from 500ms to 20ms and the readings will drastically improve.
