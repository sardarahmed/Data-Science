Q:

what is xmlns tag for xacro?

what is xmlns tag for xacro?
Here is the tutorial of xacro
It is confusing for me to see the below code
<robot xmlns:sensor="http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/gazebo/xmlschema/#sensor"
       xmlns:controller="http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/gazebo/xmlschema/#controller"
       xmlns:interface="http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/gazebo/xmlschema/#interface"
       xmlns:xacro="http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/gazebo/xmlschema/#interface"
       name="pr2" >

Why linking to those paths?
When should I use this?
How should I write this?
I need a detailed explanation to it. I do not know what xmlns value I should assign to.
Thanks

This is basically the answer.
xmlns is short for "XML NameSpace", and is a special XML construct that is expained in the links @VictorLamoine posted. @shawnysh: you can essentially consider them like import statements in the example you posted. But it's really an XML thing, not ROS specific.
