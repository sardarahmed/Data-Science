Q:

Error on stdr_simulator tutorial

Using the stdr_simulator tutorial
Using turtlebot for teleoperation
the command:
viki@c3po:~/catkin_ws/src/stdr_tele/launch$ roslaunch stdr_tele stdr_keyboard.launch 
receives the message:
[stdr_keyboard.launch] is neither a launch file in package [stdr_tele] nor is [stdr_tele] a launch file name

The launch file:
<launch>
  <!-- turtlebot_teleop_key already has its own built in velocity smoother -->
  <node pkg="turtlebot_teleop" type="turtlebot_teleop_key" name="turtlebot_teleop_keyboard"  output="screen">
    <param name="scale_linear" value="0.5" type="double"/>
    <param name="scale_angular" value="1.5" type="double"/>
    <remap from="turtlebot_teleop_keyboard/cmd_vel" to="robot0/dmd_vel"/>
  </node>
</launch>

What am I doing wrong?

do roslaunch in folder  where you have launch file.

That doesn't seem to work.
viki@c3po:~/catkin_ws/src/stdr_tele/launch$ roslaunch stdr_tele stdr_keyboard.launch
[stdr_keyboard.launch] is neither a launch file in package [stdr_tele] nor is [stdr_tele] a launch file name
Also fails when I attempt the roslaunch from the parent folder.

A:

roslaunch stdr_keyboard.launch  is the command
