Q:

pixel coordinates to 3D

Hi, I have a stereo camera mounted in a UR5 and I want to detect the holes of a work piece and move the tcp near the holes.
I detect the centre of the holes with opencv and but I don't know how to extract this info to 3D coordinates. I'm using opencv to solve this problem but I don't know how to solve it.
Thanks.

A:

If you're detecting the center of the hole in both images, you can draw a ray from each camera through the hole based on which pixel the hole corresponds to and the image distortion model. Then you can find where the two rays intersect to determine the 3D position of the hole. The image_geometry library has tools to help out with these types of problems.
