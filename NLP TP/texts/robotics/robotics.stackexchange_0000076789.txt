Q:

image_compressed problem in rqt_image_view

Hi,
i'am logging jpeg compressed image in a bag and i can see these images when using rqt_bag. When i try to do live viewing of the image using rqt_image_view (topic played from the bag), the player fails to load the transport  image_compressed withe the following error :
Unable to load plugin for transport 'image_compressed', error string:
According to the loaded plugin descriptions the class image_transport/image_compressed_sub with base class type image_transport::SubscriberPlugin does not exist. Declared types are  image_transport/compressedDepth_sub image_transport/compressed_sub image_transport/raw_sub image_transport/theora_sub
Any idea on how to fix this ?
Thanks,

I got the same error. For me the fix was to end the topic name with "/compressed", i.e /camera/image_raw/compressed. I had it like: /camera/image_compressed and it was giving me that error.

tanasis, please post a new question. You are not supposed to write "compressed", so there is something wrong in your setup, Also check the documentation

A:

You are missing compressed_image_transport in your ros installation.
Yes, this question is a little old, but is first hit on google for this error...
