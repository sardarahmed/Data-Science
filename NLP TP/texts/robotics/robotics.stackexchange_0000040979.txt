Q:

fuerte or diamondback

My project is currently running on electric, but I'm interested in trying the people library, which was released for diamondback, and just recently fuerte. Which version of it is recommended that I use?

Which component of the people stack are you trying to use?

A:

At this point, it's more likely that the Fuerte package will have better support and maintenance (because it's more recent).
