Q:

Prolbems with stage pioneer and laser/rangers on fuerte

I have problems to use my stage simulation with the default pioneer robot.
I got messages like:
ROS Stage currently supports rangers with 1 sensor only.

or
number of position models and laser models must be equal in the world file.

A:

The current stageros implementation supports only one ranger/laser sensor per robot.
You have to use a stage model without sonar to use the laser sensor.
Attached you will find my cave-pionee.world which includes a working pioneer stage simulation. The background file cave.png must be in the same folder to get it working

Which current stageros are you describing? Electric has stage 3.2.1, with one laser. Fuerte has stage 4.1.1, which replaces the laser interface with ranger.
Comment by Markus Bader on 2012-05-28:
ros fuerte uses stage 4.1.1 as default

@Markus Bader Thanks, great help - chances are that I will 'steal' your code into my git repository ! Also this works just fine in Hydro !
