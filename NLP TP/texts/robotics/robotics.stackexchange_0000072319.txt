Q:

installing ros-indigo-libg2o from source

I've built ros from source. The package i'm using depends on ros-indigo-libg2o as well. Where could I find the source for this?  and how could I build it?

I see following location: https://github.com/ros-gbp/libg2o-release but I don't see any code.

A:

Wiki links to https://github.com/RainerKuemmerle/g2o
The link you write is release repository link. Though you can see the code using branches, like; https://github.com/ros-gbp/libg2o-release/tree/debian/indigo/libg2o
