Q:

Working with ROS and Robot Arms

Hello!
I am  working for my Bachelor Degree with ROS and I have to setup and implement a Robot System.
The final goal is to grab a mug while the robot is driving next to it.
Now my question is, since I am not so good with ros right now and I am at the beginning, what packages there exist to use Robot-Arms and which Robot-Arms are supported?
Is it possible to solve this Problem with ros?
It would be nice if anybody could answer me these questions :) greez

A:

There is a piece of software, MoveIt!, that is for manipulation motion planning and execution.
What are the specs of your arm? MoveIt supports 6DOF arms very well. However, for lower DOF arms one has to tweak the system a little bit, and do things like generate your own inverse kinematics solvers. There is a little bit of a learning curve.
I'm currently working on integrating a simple 2DOF arm with it, not without challenges, but once you have it setup it can be very powerful.
