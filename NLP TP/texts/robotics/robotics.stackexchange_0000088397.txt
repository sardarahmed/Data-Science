Q:

Explicitly constraining which network interfaces are used in ros2

I asked this question on the ros discourses, but wanted to put it here as well.
https://discourse.ros.org/t/explicitly-constraining-which-network-interfaces-are-used/5652/2
In raw dds, specifically for coredx, there is a way to give an interfaces list to the domain participant so that it will only talk on those network interfaces. Is there a way to use that through ros2?

A:

The ROS 2 API doesn't contain a way to constrain the network interfaces at the moment. You might want to check the specific RMW implementation you want to use and use the vendor-specific configuration to do that (if available).

Thanks. Is there a specific way you would recommend for the rmw implementation to expose this type of thing?

In all cases, you'd probably have to use XML files to configure the underlying implementation or else modify our code.
For FastRTPS (our default implementation right now), you might be able to start here: https://eprosima-fast-rtps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pubsub.html#advanced-configuration

For Connext, see: https://community.rti.com/kb/how-do-i-restrict-rti-connext-use-only-subset-interfaces

Has there been a support to this in the recent versions of ROS2? Something like Whitelist interfaces by eProsima? https://eprosima-fast-rtps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced.html#whitelist-interfaces

This is already supported in ROS 2 using Fast DDS interface whitelisting https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/fastdds/transport/whitelist.html. You can also check here how to configure ROS 2 with Fast DDS XML files https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/fastdds/ros2/ros2.html
