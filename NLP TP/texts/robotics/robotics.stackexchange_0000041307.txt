Hello all,
Is it possible to conduct an RGBD-SLAM using Fuerte for the ASUS Xtion Pro Live? If not how is this done?
Thanks in advance!

Thanks I'll try it in Electric.
Is this easy enough in windows?
I'm constrained to windows 7 as the PC I'm using doesn't belong to me so changing the OS is out of the question.

A:

Generally, the Xtion Pro works as a drop in replacement for the Kinect without needing to modify anything. I haven't tried the Xtion pro in Fuerte, but in Electric, it works as expected with the included openni drivers. You should be able to follow the instructions on the RGBDSLAM wiki page as-is.
