Q:

How can I round /scan topic values?

Hello!
I am student and I really want to send /scan topic values to rtabmapviz. I am using ROS kinetic, /scan is topic created by RPLidarNode. Unfortunately I think that I need rounded values, because I really don't need 8 digit numbers. Do I have to create my own node to round those values, or is there another nice and fast way to do that?

A:

You could:

Modify the rp lidar driver to round in the way you'd like
Create a laser filter to round the values
Create a node between the rp lidar node and rtab-map to round the values and publish /scan_rounded
Modify rtab map itself

Many options :-)

Okay, I just rediscovered that I cannot round float, so nothing can be done. Anyway, thank you for response! :)

float can certainly be rounded.
But we seem to be ignoring something important here: why do you have the impression that you need to "round[ed] values"? I've not seen questions about this before on this forum.
