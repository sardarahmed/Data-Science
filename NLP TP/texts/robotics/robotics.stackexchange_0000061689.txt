Q:

Install Hokuyo Node on hydro

Hi, all,
I am trying to run hokuyo urg-04lx-ug01.
But it seems missing from the package hydro.
The command
rosrun hokuyo_node hokuyo_node 

is not run successfully.
return error
Error: stack/package hokuyo_node not found

install the package
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-laser-drivers

puts the additional package under fuerte folder, not able to be called in hydro.
I notice there's another package urg_node, but I can't find the install instruction.
How to install it under hydro?
regards
Ray
