A:

A bit harsh maybe, but could you please use the search (or Google) before posting? We already have quite a few QAs about this exact issue:

RGBDSlam_V2 Error with make (although I wouldn't recommend what the (accepted) answer suggests)
Compiler errors while making rgbdslam on Nvidia Jetson TK1 (mentions TK1, but issue is similar)

to list a few. The answer to that last question seems to suggest this can be worked around.
And the author is apparently aware of this as well: see felixendres/rgbdslam_v2#17 fi.
