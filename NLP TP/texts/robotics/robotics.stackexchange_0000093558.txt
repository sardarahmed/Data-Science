Q:

ROS2/rviz2 cannot load pixmaps

Hello!
New to ROS/RViz so please bear with me :) After installing ROS2 dashing package, I am getting these errors after starting RViz2 (in docker):
[ERROR] [rviz2]: Could not load pixmap package://rviz_common/icons/rotate.svg
[ERROR] [rviz2]: Could not load pixmap package://rviz_common/icons/rotate.svg-- using default cursor instead.
(...)

These files are present in ROS2 installation path:
find /opt/ros/ -name rotate.svg
/opt/ros/dashing/share/rviz_common/icons/rotate.svg

The command I'm running:
ros2 run rviz2 rviz2 -l

Environment variables:
ROS_VERSION_NAME=dashing
ROS_VERSION=2
ROS_PYTHON_VERSION=3
ROS_DISTRO=dashing

OS:
Linux 5.0.0-31-generic #33~18.04.1-Ubuntu x86_64 GNU/Linux

Ogre log:
pastebin.com/BeguEvdX
Could anyone help me with this issue?

A:

In this issue it has been said :
"I had the same problem, due to a corrupted Qt5 installation. You could try setting the following environmental variable: export QT_DEBUG_PLUGINS=1 and then running rviz in the same terminal. In my case the debug prints said: Cannot load library /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/plugins/imageformats/libqsvg.so: (libQt5Svg.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory). So I solved the issue by reinstalling the related Qt plugin (sudo apt-get --reinstall install libqt5svg5)."

Already checked that, no problems from Qt reported in log

I have to take my words back, it seems the issue for me was that svg library for Qt was not even installed (hence no debug print about it). Installing it fixes the problem :)
