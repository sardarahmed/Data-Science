Q:

[tf] Sequence numbers of rostopic tf

I noticed the folliowing weird thing: (don't be perturbed: for analysis I load it into excel.)

Should the sequence numbers in tf topics published be increasing? I saw this and it was quite suspicious...
Thank you!

A:

sequence numbers are deprecated and should be ignored.

Thanks, @tfoote. As I have your briefest attention, let me pick your brain. I am struggling with a bug that I think relates to the tf of odom to base. In rviz, when I set the global frame to be odom, the /laserscan display gives an "unknown error". If I set the global frame to anything else, e.g. base, then it works fine. My current hypothsis is that while the tf tree looks fine, that something about converting the /scan message frame from scan to base to odom fails. Stumped.
Does any of that ring a bell?
