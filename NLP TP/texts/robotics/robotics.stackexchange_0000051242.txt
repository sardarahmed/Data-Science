Q:

MoveIt Tutorial not working

I have been trying to run the beginning MoveIt tutorials.  In Ubuntu 12.04, Groovy, I have tried the setups both for the PR2 Robot example, and the Groovy/Robonaut example.  I have not had luck getting either to work.  For the Robonaut, the robot is not displayed in RViz.  For the PR2, the class pr2_arm_kinematics/PR2ArmKinematicsPlugin is having an issue.

Please provide more detail about your situation: how you have installed moveIt (source, packages, etc.), what steps you've tried running, and exactly what errors you're seeing.  The MoveIt tutorials are working for other users, so providing more detail will help us troubleshoot what's happening.

Eric,
I believe your issue for the PR2 was solved:
https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_pr2/issues/18
I cannot get the Robonaut gazebo simulator to come up either - I have put a ticket for this on their github page. I will update the MoveIt! page for that robot once that ticket is fixed.
