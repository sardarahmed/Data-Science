Q:

Stanford_parser_ros fails to build

Hey guys,
i am trying to build roboframenet but it fails when rosmaking stanfor_parser_ros with the following error message:

[javac] /home/kargm/work/ros/other_stacks/roboframenet/stanford_parser_ros/build.xml:30:

It says,  package org.apache.commons.logging does not exist but the libcommons-logging-java system dependency is installed on my Ubuntu.
It also cannot find other packages which i have installed... is there something wrong with my rosjava installation? Or is it a problem of the ros.properties-file?

A:

roboframenet is experimental software that no longer works with the latest rosjava.  It will need to be ported to the newer APIs in order to get past these compilation issues.
Also, the rosjava build system is being overhauled to be pure Maven (no rosmake) in order to better leverage the existing Ant/Maven infrastructure that Java provides.
