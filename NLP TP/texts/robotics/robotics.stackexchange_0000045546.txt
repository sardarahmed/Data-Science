Q:

Spawning Objects in RVIZ

Is there a simple way to place objects in RVIZ?  I am just trying to use the position of a detected object in a point cloud and spawn an object in that pose.  But so far I haven't found a way to even spawn simple objects... Sphere, Cylinder, Box.  Do I have to create a URDF file/launch file for this?
I have seen this Tutorial.  But I get no such file or directory...

A:

The simplest way to visualize objects in rviz are markers. Have a look at this  and this tutorial. This page will give you an overview of the currently supported marker types.
