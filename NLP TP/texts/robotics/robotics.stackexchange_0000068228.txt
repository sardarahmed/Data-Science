Q:

Dynamically adding a static transformation to tf

I have written an object in C++ which contains position and orientation information in member variables. These variables are not likely to change over the lifetime of the object. I am using these variables to perform my own hard-coded transforms between the world and the frame defined by each object.
I realize now that this is probably not the correct way to do things, and I should be using tf to do this work for me.
My question is how do I setup a static frame for each object when it is constructed?
I know I can create a static_transform_publisher node to do this, but I'm not too excited about creating a bunch of nodes during program operation that don't really do anything. It seems opposed to the ROS design philosophy.
Is there some object I can create that will do this for me?

A:

multistatic_transform_publisher from lscr_tf_tools can help with this. You can run a single transform publisher node, and use messages to tell it to  set transforms.
