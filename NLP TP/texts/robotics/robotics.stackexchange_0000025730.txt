Q:

Using custom materials in gazebo

I am using a Ar marker in my simulation. For this I use a custom material which loads a marker (pattHiro). But the materials are in /opt/ and need "shadow_receiver.program" How can I use a custom file which can be stored with the model in /home/work? (with relative paths)

are you running gazebo standalone, fuerte or groovy?

Gazebo in fuerte

A:

I originally wrote this "Have you tried specifying absolute paths in the SDF  tags?" and it's wrong. Chalk it up to a mental lapse.
Here is some information on : http://gazebosim.org/wiki/Uri
A uri is relative to a Gazebo environment variable. For example if GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=/tmp, then a <uri>model://my_model</uri> tells Gazebo to find this directory /tmp/my_model.

No, But it this documented somewhere? I could not find it in the sdf reference. For portablility relative paths would be even better, is this possible? Also in ROS Gazebo version the GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH does not exist. I would be possible to add it but that would again be a custom solution, limiting portability.

Relative paths are not portable, they are dependent on where gazebo is run. This varies from user to user and machine to machine. More uri documentation is here: http://gazebosim.org/sdf/1.3.html (do a find on uri).
