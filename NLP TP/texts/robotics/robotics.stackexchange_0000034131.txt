Q:

Does clockwise rotation correspond to a positive or to a negative yaw angle?

When I rotate my robot clockwise, should the yaw be increasing or decreasing? I noticed it turns the opposite direction when running slam_mapping in rviz.

A:

See REP 103 for coordinate system conventions. In general, most coordinate frames follow those conventions, unless otherwise specified.
The short answer is that counter-clockwise is positive change in yaw in a frame that follows REP103 conventions.

"By the right hand rule, the yaw component of orientation increases as the child frame rotates counter-clockwise"

Alexis yeah but if im looking at the green Y axis headed toward me counterclockwise is one way and if i stand behind the coordinate frame  and look at the y axis going off in the distance counterclockwise is a nother way.
Put another way if i use the right hand rule, and the middle finger is the Y axis then i can point down
but that doesnt tell me clockwise or counter clockwise because from one side of my hand a yaw pointing down its moving counterclockwise and if i look from behind my palm its moving clockwise
in rviz if i place a unit circle  against the 2D frame of the X and Z where X is headed off to the right.. then positive change in radians should be counterclowise but that is not the case.

From X to Y is positive. Meaning with ENU, looking from the top of earth (aka not from the ground), East to North is positive thus CCW is positive.
(Thus for NED, it is the opposite)
