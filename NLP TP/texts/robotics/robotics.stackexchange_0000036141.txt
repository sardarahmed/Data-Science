Q:

openni_launch doesn't publish any data on the topics!

Hi everyone,
I have installed ROS electric recently. I try to get point cloud from the Kinect sensor by the following command:
$ roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch

It runs a few couple of nodelets and warns about the calibration .yaml files which seems to be OK. I can see a list of topics that it advertises, but neither "rviz" nor "rostopic hz" can capture any data from any topic starting with "/camera"!
However, with the following command:
$ roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.laucnh

I can capture point clouds streaming out from the Kinect sensor. Any idea why openni_launch doesn't publish any data on the topics?
Best,
Rasoul

A:

You might have a look at this answer by Patrick Mihelich. Maybe compiling the latest version from svn helps for you too. Sometimes the openni.launch works if you restart it a lot. I were having similar problems and spent a lot time on continuous restarting until i got output from rostopic hz...
Finally i did a clean reinstall and switched to 64 bit Ubuntu which helped a lot (at least for me).
