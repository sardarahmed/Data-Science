Q:

Package needed: beginner_tutorials_generate_messages_cpp. It's a dependency for the ROS publisher and subscriber tutorials

In publisher and subscriber ROS tutorials this package(beginner_tutorials_generate_messages_cpp) is used as a dependency but I couldn't find it. Please help

A:

The dependency on beginner_tutorials_generate_messages_cpp referred to in the Writing a Simple Publisher and Subscriber (C++) is a cmake target; not a complete package.
That target is created by the generate_messages command in the CMakeLists.txt, and the target name is based on the package name (declared with the package() command at the top of the CMakeLists.txt).
You should check that your package name matches the package name in the tutorial, and that the message generation code is present in your CMakeLists.txt.
If you're still have trouble after that, please edit your question to include your full CMakeLists.txt and the full error message.
