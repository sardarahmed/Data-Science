Q:

How can I communicate wirelessly between a RasPi and servo?

I want to use a Raspberry Pi to pan a camera mounted on a servo wirelessly from ~100 feet away. What are some good servos and transceivers for this?
To clarify, there should be no physical connection between the RasPi and servo.
Do I need an additional RasPi on the servo end?

A:

No matter what, you will have to have a device physically sending a pulse width modulated signal to the servo.  It doesn't necessarily have to be a raspberry pi, and honestly you probably shouldn't use one in this case.  Raspberry Pi's do not have a hardware implementation of PWM.  Software PWM is unreliable because of the precise timing needed for the motor.
I would recommend learning some Arduino as well in this case.  You can still have a RPi talking wirelessly via Radio Packet Communication (i.e. XBee, Bluetooth, 802.11, etc.) to the Arduino.  It will just take a little extra learning if you're not familiar with C coding and setting them up.
If you do want to go the double RPi route.  Look into using these for easy motor control: Adafruit 16-Channel PWM / Servo HAT for Raspberry Pi - Mini Kit
