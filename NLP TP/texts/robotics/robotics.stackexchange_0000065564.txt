Q:

Retrieve filtered point cloud from Moveit Planning Scene

Hello,
I added several sensor plugins into the occupancy_map_monitor of moveit.
I have a generated occupancy map which i can visualize in RViz using  /move_group/monitored_planning_scene topic
Is it possible to retrieve the filtered point cloud of the overall scene which is generated from all the  sensors?
Regards

A:

Is the filtered_topic what you are looking for? From moveit.ros.org/wiki/3D_Sensors:

filtered_cloud_topic: If this parameter is specified, the filtered cloud (without robot parts) is also republished. This makes things a little less efficient but can be useful for debugging.

Edit: hm, this is only the point cloud after self-filtering, so may not be what you are after.

This is the filtered point cloud from one sensor, and not from all sensors.
I would like to have one topic for all filtered point clouds

You might also want to try and send a message to the moveit-users mailing list. But do please report back here if you get an answer there.
