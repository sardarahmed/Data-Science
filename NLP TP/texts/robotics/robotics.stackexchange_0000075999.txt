Q:

kinetic installation fails with 'Failed to detect successful installation of [qt5]' error

We agreed to the Qt opensource license for you.
If this is unacceptable you should uninstall.

This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local.

Qt 5 conflicts Qt 4

Generally there are no consequences of this for you. If you build your
own software and it requires this formula, you'll need to add to your
build variables:

    LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/qt5/lib
    CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/qt5/include

.app bundles were installed.
Run `brew linkapps qt5` to symlink these to /Applications.

Please use the Preformatted text button next time for console copy/pastes. It's the one with the 101010 on it. Thanks.

A:

This happens because of the way homebrew deals with qt5. Notice how it says This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local. Because qt5 conflicts with qt4, anything that needs qt5 has to be explicitly pointed at it, so as to not get confused with qt4. Since you know that your machine has qt5 installed correctly, you can tell rosdep to just skip checking for qt5 with:
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro kinetic -y --skip-keys "libqt5-core libqt5-gui libqt5-opengl libqt5-opengl-dev libqt5-widgets qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev"

FYI I am working on installing ROS Kinetic onto my MBP running El Capitan. I'm going to try and list my progress on this gist.

Hi, I got similar issue... I tried with your line, but I got "given path 'src' does not exist"... which one is it ? I tried indigo_desktop_full_ws/src, but it also led to :
ERROR: the following rosdeps failed to install
  homebrew: Failed to detect successful installation of [qt]
