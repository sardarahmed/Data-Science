Q:

ERROR: cannot launch node of type [rplidar_ros/rplidarNode]: can't locate node [rplidarNode] in package [rplidar_ros]

I keep on receiving this error every time i execute roslaunch rplidar_ros view_rplidar.launch
I have executed source devel/setup.bash as well.
In addition,  rplidar_ros exists on my rospack list.
When i execute, Rviz map/grid shows up, but with no laser scans.
please help with this matter.
I am not sure what is causing the error.

Please give some more information: How is your workspace set up, did you install rplidar from debs or from source, is it in your workspace?
My guess currently is, you installed from source and haven't compiled it.

Okay so it works now. I installed from source, so i needed to install rplidarNode on src.
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
roslaunch rplidar_ros view_rplidar.launch

I tried catkin_make in my catkin_ws many times after cloning it from git and it didn't work. But when I used
catkin_make --only-pkg-with-deps rplidar_ros
it  worked after that

A:

just do the follwoing commands:
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
otherwise remove the files and git clone again and run catkin_make . Works every time.
