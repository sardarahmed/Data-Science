Q:

How to read ros::Publisher pub

Please, help me to correctly read some code to have more understanding of the basics of ROS. I understand that #include<ros.h> is to include the cpp library of ROS
How should I read this ros::Publisher pub?
Is it make an object named pub of the class Publisher defined in the namespace ros or what?
Thank you

This is the wrong place to ask this kind of questions. Your question is related to the basic of C++. I suggest to start with C++ and then go to ROS.

A:

Is it make an object named pub of the class Publisher defined in the namespace ros or what?

Basically, yes (and to be precise, the object is created on the stack), but as @rastaxe wrote: please follow a C++ tutorial or two and then start working with roscpp. This is really a C++ question, and I would not want to be learning C++ and ROS at the same time.
