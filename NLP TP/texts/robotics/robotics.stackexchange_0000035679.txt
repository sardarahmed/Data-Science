Q:

Interactive Marker: Click directly on sphere or box

Hi,
I'm publishing some interactive markers to be able to select different objects from a scene in rviz (see screenshot below. I'm using an InteractiveMarkerControl.MENU type.

I'm now able to select the marker, but only by clicking on the "CLICK" text, which is the description of the InteractiveMarkerControl() associated.
Is it possible to have a marker which react when we click directly on the sphere?
Thanks in advance.
Ugo

A:

Yes, in fact you are very close already.  Simply set interaction_mode = InteractiveMarkerControl.BUTTON in the control which has the sphere shape, then in your feedback message, look for event_type == InteractiveMarkerFeedback::BUTTON_CLICK.
