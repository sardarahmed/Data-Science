Q:

rosnode ping error

Hello to all,
I am trying to follow the tutorials on ROS wiki.
I came across an error concerning the rosnode ping command.
I am getting the following error:
root@ubuntu:~# rosnode ping my_turtle
rosnode: node is [/my_turtle]
pinging /my_turtle with a timeout of 3.0s
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/opt/ros/electric/ros/bin/rosnode", line 35, in 
rosnode.rosnodemain()

Any clues?
Thanks.

Sorry, I have no clue, but it usually helps people if you tell them what version Ubuntu and ROS you are using.

Thanks Kevin,
I had finally worked it out, my localhost was pointing to a static IP I had set in the past, that was different than the one I needed.
I changed the IP settings and it worked.
Regards,
