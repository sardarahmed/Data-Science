Q:

Change default topic name of joint_state_broadcaster?

I am trying to use moveit2 in ROS2. However in my application, I would like to change the default topic name of /joint_states (published by the joint_state_broadcaster) to a custom name without using relay, since another node in my setup is publishing to /joint_states.
Below is the panda_ros_controllers.yaml file that I am using. How would I change the published topic name for joint_state_broadcaster to something else?
controller_manager:
  ros__parameters:
    update_rate: 100  # Hz

    panda_arm_controller:
      type: joint_trajectory_controller/JointTrajectoryController

    panda_hand_controller:
      type: position_controllers/GripperActionController

    joint_state_broadcaster:
      type: joint_state_broadcaster/JointStateBroadcaster

panda_arm_controller:
  ros__parameters:
    command_interfaces:
      - position
    state_interfaces:
      - position
      - velocity
    joints:
      - panda_joint1
      - panda_joint2
      - panda_joint3
      - panda_joint4
      - panda_joint5
      - panda_joint6
      - panda_joint7

panda_hand_controller:
  ros__parameters:
    joint: panda_finger_joint1

A:

Having more than one publisher on /joint_states is totally fine as long as there is only one source of information for a particular joint. It's very common for the /joint_states topic to have one message containing information about joints 1-3 followed by another message containing joints 4-6. So it shouldn't be necessary to do this, unless you have a case where you have more than one node publishing about the same joint (in which case that's a different problem) or you have more than one robot in your setup and so there needs to be some differentiation by topic (in which case you should be using namespacing).
Either way, the easiest way to get namespacing going here will be in your launch files. You can also remap topics in the same file. Take a look at the wiki here for ROS1 or here for ROS 2.
