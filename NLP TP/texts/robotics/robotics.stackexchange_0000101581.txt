Q:

Will ROS Noetic support Ubuntu 22.04?

Now that Ubuntu 22.04 LTS is out and Ros Noetic is the final ROS1 distro, will it be supported on Ubuntu 22? For people with newer hardware (i.e. Alder Lake CPUs) this will definitely be a must.

A:

Pedantic -- so please forgive me @lucasw -- but to make this crystal clear for (future) readers:
no, ROS Noetic will not officially support Ubuntu 22.04.
Refer to REP-3: Target Platforms: Noetic Ninjemys (May 2020 - May 2025), specifically the sections about supported operating systems.
This will not be changed for ROS Noetic.
You can build ROS Noetic from source on Ubuntu 22.04, as @lucasw describes.

Running a ros1 release in a docker container is now viable, so this is an option. Pre-built docker containers for various ros releases are available on hub.docker.com.

Of course. Docker / LXC / some other containerisation technology would (almost) always be an option.
It doesn't change the answer though: Noetic officially only supports 20.04.
