Q:

How to establish subscription/publication communication within C++ code?

To establish communication (simple listen/talk) between two machines, I simply use
export ROS_HOSTNAME=ip1
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://ip2:11311
rosrun ...

However, if I want machine1 to communicate with machine2 without explicitly tell machine1, but rather I use a machine3 to tell machine1 the ip address of machine2 to make the connection. How should I achieve this through c++? Is there any code that's equivalent to the commands above?
Thanks!

A:

If you have a third machine you want to use as a coordinator, why not run the roscore in machine3?
In your other machines you do:
export ROS_HOSTNAME=ip1
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://ip3:11311

The problem is that if I have 100 machines, then I will have to do this for all of them... That's why I am thinking of doing it with C++.

If you are setting up that many machines it is probably worth setting them up with proper hostnames so you don't need to reference their IPs.
