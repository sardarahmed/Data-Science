Q:

Hector_SLAM on BeagleBone error

I have hector_slam running on the BeagleBone. IMU_UM6 and URG-04X both launch and stream data.
I have not had success getting hokuyo_node functional so I am using the newer urg_node and changed the launch file for hector_slam to launch the urg_node rather than the hokuyo_node.
I do not have rviz running on the BeagleBone as there is no display attached to the BeagleBone.
When I launch hector_slam I get the following error:
[ERROR] [1370640753.966993122]: Trajectory Server: Transform from /map to /base_stabilized failed: Frame id /map does not exist! Frames (4):
Frame /laser exists with parent /base_link.
Frame /base_link exists with parent /base_stabilized.
Frame /base_stabilized exists with parent NO_PARENT.

Is this because rviz is not running and loading the map, or do I have a different issue?

A:

That's just a startup artifact due to tf not being fully up and running, as the order of node startup in a launch file is pretty much random. Will look into suppressing this error at a later date :)
