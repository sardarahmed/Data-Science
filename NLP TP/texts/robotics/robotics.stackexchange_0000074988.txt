Q:

Custom message header file not generated

I am trying to send a custom message from a ros publisher to an arduino mega using  rosserial.The package containing the the publisher and custom message builds fine.I  tried to generate headers for the custom message by using the command rosrun rosserial_client make_library.py path_to_libraries message_package given in rosserial_client/tutorials but it failed to generate the required header file for arduino.Can someone help me?
The custom message file contains just two int16 variables.

Did you remember to delete the old roslib folder in the libraries folder before running make_library.py?

Thanks Icehawk101.When i deleted the roslib and ran rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py ~/sketchbook/libraries ,the required header files were generated.

Please accept his answer, so the topic is closed.

A:

Always remember to delete the old roslib folder in the libraries folder before running make_libraries.py, otherwise the header files won't be generated for the Arduino
