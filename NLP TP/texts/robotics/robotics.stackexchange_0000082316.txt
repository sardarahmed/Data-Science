Q:

Ros Scan Topic generation by simulator

I'm trying to follow some examples looking at the data generated by the Lidar on my simulated turtlebot.
From my investigation, I believe what I am looking for is a modification of one of these launch files: https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations/tree/master/turtlebot3_gazebo/launch
The desired outcome is: the space with the hexagon of obstacles, plus a TB3 Robot simulator that subscribes to /cmd_vel topics, and that includes a simulated LIDAR data stream publishing /scan topics
Am I on the right track? And if so, how do I edit the launch file to achieve that?
THANKS!

A:

I will answer my own question. I believe this launch file will do what he (i) want(ed):
roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch
