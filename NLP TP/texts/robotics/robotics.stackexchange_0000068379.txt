Q:

How to get the binary path for any package?

Hi
How do I get the binary path where the executables are stored for a specific package.
Need it for a console script.
Should work anywhere in devel and in install.
Regards,
Christian

Np.
Btw: we don't normally close questions. Ticking the checkmark is enough to indicate that it was answered.

Not I saw a recommendation to close topics recently on ros users mailing. Ok I will remember that.
Do you close it at all?

David Lu suggested to close outdated questions. Answered questions should just be marked as such by ticking the checkmark.
