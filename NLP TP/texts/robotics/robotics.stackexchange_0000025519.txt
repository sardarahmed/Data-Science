Q:

What is a simple way to run Gazebo with no graphics?

I want to run Gazebo without the X11 window it creates.
If I am simulating vision, I still need to run OGRE to generate images.
Thanks,
Chris

A:

We plan on adding a tutorial for this, but in the meantime, here's a quick explanation. When you launch gazebo, there are two programs that are run: gzserver and gzclient. The program gzserver does all the simulation, even rendering for camera simulation. The interactive window is opened by gzclient.
To open a specific world, type gzserver specific.world.

I'm still a couple of versions back, but you'd also need to make sure that you've set the DISPLAY environment appropriately if you're not directly using the console..
