Q:

What is the planning coordinate frame of moveit for PR2 (Python)

Is it base_link or odom_combined? How do I check that and how do I set a specific planning frame?

A:

I have just learned to check it, it is odom_combined by the way.
print("============ Reference frame: ", group.get_planning_frame())
