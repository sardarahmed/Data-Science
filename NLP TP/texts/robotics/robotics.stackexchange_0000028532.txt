Q:

Can't start gazebo (urdf model)

I'm trying to launch gazebo using roslaunch, but somewhy I'm getting the errors.

Segmentation fault (core dumped)
[gazebo_gui-3] process has died [pid
3112, exit code 139, cmd
/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/gazebo_ros/gzclient
__name:=gazebo_gui __log:=/home/ulysses/.ros/log/807b3030-77a1-11e8-bd9d-08002782662e/gazebo_gui-3.log].

^C[spawn_urdf-4] killing on exit

Here is my launch file:

  
    pkg="gazebo_ros" type="spawn_model"
output="screen" args="-file $(find
robotino_description)/urdf/robotino.urdf
-urdf -model robotino" />

and another error:

rosrun gazebo_ros gazebo  [ INFO]
[1529841834.342204778]: Finished
loading Gazebo ROS API Plugin. [ INFO]
[1529841834.343897101]:

/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/gazebo_ros/gazebo:
46: kill: invalid signal number or
name: SIGINT

Last time I have launched this successfully, but because of something I can't do this now. There is no gazebo-2*.log as well, but I can provide any file which can help you to help me
