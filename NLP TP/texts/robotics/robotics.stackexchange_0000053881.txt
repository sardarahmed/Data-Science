Q:

Hydro installs with no "stacks" file?

Just installed the desktop-full version of hydro.  I notice that there is no "stacks" folder in /opt/ros/hydro.  There always used to be, I believe, with a lot of default packages.  Is this correct?

A:

All packages in hydro have transitioned to use catkin instead of rosbuild and catkin packages use FHS style code layouts.
If you want to find out where files inside packages install to use dpkg -L
dpkg -L ros-hydro-roscpp

Will show you where files were installed to for roscpp.
