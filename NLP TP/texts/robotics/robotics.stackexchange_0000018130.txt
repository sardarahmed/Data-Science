Q:

How a quadcopter pitch/roll impacts thrust?

I'm thinking about how a quadcopter flight controller works, and I usually see that each motor speed is determined by a formula like:
speed_motor_1 = throttle + pitch_pid + roll_pid + yaw_pid

This looks fine, but one thing I was considering is throttle -> thrust is not so straightforward.
For instance, a quadcopter in horizontal position have propellers pointing up and the thrust may be X. If you pitch this quadcopter by 30 degrees, now the propellers vector force is inclined and thrust it is X*cos(30 degrees)
Does that make sense? Is that something that must be taking into consideration when calculating "throttle" in the aforementioned formula?
Thanks

A:

The simple answer is yes, to maintain level flight when pitched forward you need more throttle than when not moving forward.
This can be seen from the a simple force diagram.

A corollary to this is that the maximum forward speed is when full trust at the angle of the quad matches the weight.
