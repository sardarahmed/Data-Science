Q:

Gazebo simulation automation

Hi,
I want to run gazebo simulations automatically over night. I am not sure where to start. The idea is, that a robot executes a specific mission. Eventually I would like a report or snapshots of checkpoints or a report.
Is there some support from gazebo or some kind of framework / plugins to help?
Maybe someone has had a similar challange?
BR

Not really frameworks, but the ServerFixture and RenderFixture classes might be useful. They are used in Gazebo for testing.

Thanks for your reply @azeey. Is there maybe a tutorial or demo implementation on how this classes are used best?

I wonder, whether the OP have found a solution for this. I have the exact same use case and don't want to reinvent the wheel.

A:

In the end I wrote a pyhton test script using the actionlib.SimpleActionClient (http://wiki.ros.org/actionlib_tutorials/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20Simple%20Action%20Client%20%28Python%29)  interface. You can then create a json file with all your goals/actions.
