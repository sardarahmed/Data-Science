Q:

How to install roboearth on ubuntu 12.04 ros fuerte 64 bit

Dear All.
Who can tell me how to install How to install roboearth on ubuntu 12.04 ros fuerte  64 bit.
Following website:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/roboearth
I can not finish the installation.
Step 1.
rosinstall ~/ros /opt/ros/fuerte 'http://www.ros.org/wiki/roboearth?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=roboearth.rosinstall'

No problem.
Step 2:
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-ias-common ros-fuerte-perception-pcl-addons ros-fuerte-simulator-gazebo ros-fuerte-vision-opencv ros-fuerte-octomap-mapping ros-fuerte-client-rosjava-jni.

but there is not a package named ros-fuerte-perception-pcl-addons.
So I cannot finish
step 3:
rosmake roboearth

Then I try to download and install from svn.
There are two errors.
One is it need pcl_visualization
While I compile  pcl_visualization
it said it need eigen.
I think there is an easy way for us to install and use roboearth.

A:

We recently upgraded it to be compatible to ROS Fuerte, so you might try it again.

I am running Ubuntu 11.10 with ROS Fuerte and I tried these same steps right now and I am having the same problem.  Could it be that the rosinstall file is pulling from a branch, so that I am not getting the recent upgrade?  Or is it possible that the fuerte updates aren't making it to 11.10?
