The nodelet leaks  207868 - 198449 = 9040
How do I find the memory leak in the kinect2tnl_cam1-1 process?
Any ideas?

A:

Compiling as DEBUG and running the nodelet manager with an additional
launch-prefix="valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=yes --track-origins=yes --log-file=YOUR_LOG_FILE_PATH_AND_NAME_HERE"

where it is launched in a launch file worked well for me before.
