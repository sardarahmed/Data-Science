A:

Edit 2015-04-22: updated as industrial_core has been released into Indigo.

(I'm assuming no prior ROS experience in this answer .. well, some experience)
While there hasn't been any official release of the motoman packages into Indigo, I've had good results building them from source. As far as I know there are no incompatibilities, but you obviously do this at your own risk.
You could do something like this (in your current catkin workspace):
cd /path/to/your/catkin_ws/src

# checkout the desired version of the motoman repository.
# if you'd rather use the development versions, use '-b hydro-devel' OR '-b indigo-devel'.
git clone -b hydro https://github.com/ros-industrial/motoman.git

# we need to make sure you have all dependencies installed.
# this step should install 'industrial_robot_client' for you
cd ..
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro indigo

# now build
catkin_make

This should successfully build the Motoman ROS nodes. You'll still have to set up your controller, but those steps are identical to the Hydro version (see motoman_driver/Tutorials on the ROS wiki).
To make sure things are ok, try running the tests:
catkin_make run_tests

then
catkin_test_results --all build/

The summary should show 0 failures. Especially the tests for simple_message, industrial_robot_client and all of the motoman_X_support packages are important.
Now after a source /path/to/your/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash, you should be able to start the relevant launch files.

Thanks for your help. I did everything you said and it's OK.
Do you know how can I use this tutorial: http://wiki.ros.org/motoman/Tutorials/Path_Planning_with_Arm_Warehouse_Viewer
With the instruction
roslaunch sia10d_mesh_arm_navigation planning_scene_warehouse_viewer_sia10d_mesh.launch
Comment by jcgarciaca on 2014-08-31:
I get
[planning_scene_warehouse_viewer_sia10d_mesh.launch] is neither a launch file in package [sia10d_mesh_arm_navigation] nor is [sia10d_mesh_arm_navigation] a launch file name

The tutorial you linked is for Fuerte / Groovy. arm_navigation is not supported on Hydro / Indigo. So it cannot work. Hydro & Indigo use MoveIt.
