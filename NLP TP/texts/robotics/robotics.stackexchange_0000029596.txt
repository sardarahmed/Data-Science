Is anybody in ROS community using PySide?

If not, what about PyQt?

A:

I don't know of either right now; presumably because everything is wxwidgets and associated wxpython/swig stuff.   Plans are to move to Qt as you may know, but nothing has yet.  Availability on Ubuntu will be important in the long run.  [edited] looks like the commenters below have some good info.

There are Lucid and Maverick binaries here: http://developer.qt.nokia.com/wiki/PySide_Binaries_Linux

There is a python-pyside package in Maverick and Natty, but none for Lucid. We would need a Lucid version to use it in any supported Diamondback packages. That could be handled specially in rosdep, but it's a pain.

PyQt as it has GPL licence + commercial (paying) license. PySide is LGPL, so it's preferred. PySide is approaching 1.0 release (they are now on beta 5).
