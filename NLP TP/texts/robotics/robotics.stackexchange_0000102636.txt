A:

Its the cost value if you don't know what's in a given occupancy cell. If you have a static map, that could be unexplored regions. If its in a local costmap without a static map, it would be area that haven't been covered by any sensor data yet so you don't know anything about it yet. So this is the cost of unknown space. The value of 255 (or -1) is special so that algorithms know that's unknown space and can act accordingly. But you can override this so that unknown space is always treated as free (if set to 0) or occupied (if set to 254) or anything in-between to your heart's desire.
