Q:

Create-based turtlebot simulation problem

When I launch turtlebot simulation with base = create the robot starts to constantly moving.
I changed file turtlebot_empty_world.launch in package turtlebot_gazebo:
<arg name="base"      value="$(optenv TURTLEBOT_BASE create)"/> <!-- create, roomba -->
<arg name="battery"   value="$(optenv TURTLEBOT_BATTERY /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0)"/>  <!-- /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0 --> 
<arg name="stacks"    value="$(optenv TURTLEBOT_STACKS circles)"/>  <!-- circles, hexagons --> 
<arg name="3d_sensor" value="$(optenv TURTLEBOT_3D_SENSOR kinect)"/>  <!-- kinect, asus_xtion_pro --> 

I launch turtlebot now by command
roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_empty_world.launch

It starts without errors, but, it doesn't stop slowly moving around by himself!
When the base was kobuki - the turtlebot stayed still.
I also tried to spawn pure irobot create in gazebo, it has the same problem, but I managed to solve it by adding gazebo plugin "differential drive". However, adding this plugin to turtlebot create base urdf file didn't help.
I'm really stuck with this issue, could you please at least point me to the digging direction?

@Ken_in_JAPAN thanks for your answer! I'll check it out.

A:

Found this in ROS tutorial
http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_simulator/Tutorials/hydro/Make%20a%20map%20and%20navigate%20with%20it

Caution: Gazebo plugins for Create and Roomba bases don't work perfectly on Hydro, so expect strange behaviors when using them.

So the behaviour is undefined.
