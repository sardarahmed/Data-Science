Q:

RGBDSLAM Data Collection

Hi,
I am using RGBDSLAM on Ubuntu 11.10, on ROS Electric, and a Kinect camera. My goal is to basically move around my room with the camera and create a 3-D map of my room. I guess that just means turning up the RGBDSLAM GUI on the terminal, and then hitting space to record data from the video stream generated. I am wondering, after this, I can simply save these data, but do I have to do anything further? Say, for instance, write some code to further process this data? Or that is enough for the sole purpose I am trying to achieve?
Thanks.

Hi periphery, Were you able to get rgbdslam running on ur system using kinect?

A:

Depends on what you want your map to be, but in principle yes.
If it should just be a big point cloud, saving is all you need. Maybe trigger optimization (Key "o") before you do so.
If you want a volumetric map, use the octomap_server and use "send whole model" (and trigger the octomap_saver later).
