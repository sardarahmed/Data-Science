Q:

unable to get point cloud from /camera/depth/points in rviz

I did :
rostopic echo /camera/depth/points 

it seems topic is publishing messages. However, when i launch rviz- setting fixed frame to /camera_link or /camera_depth_frame or /camera_depth_optical_frame ( tried all seprately)
i get the following error when i subscribe to /camera/depth/points:
Transform= For frame [/openni_rgb_optical_frame]: Frame [/openni_rgb_optical_frame] does not exist

Any ideas on what am i doing wrong here ?
Also, point cloud data from /camera/depth_registered/points is currently displayed.

Could you include the roslaunch command you are using to start up the driver?

roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch

@Boris   - i ran the echo frame_id command and got back /openni_rgb_optical_frame . I manually entered it in the Fixed frame under Global Options but it gives me frame does not exist error.

A:

When OpenNI publishes point cloud it sets up frame_id to some prespecified value, but it does not create a real tf frame. The frame_id simply says that points were acquired with respect to that frame.
To check the frame_id of your point cloud use the following command:
$ rostopic echo -n 1 /camera/depth/points/header/frame_id

Then, either manually fill in the value you get to Fixed frame in RViz or define a new tf transformation with static_transform_publisher, for example:
$ rosrun tf static_transform_publisher 0 0 0 0 0 0 /world /openni_rgb_optical_frame 100
