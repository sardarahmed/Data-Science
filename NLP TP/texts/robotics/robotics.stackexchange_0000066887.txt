Q:

How do I create a launch file?

I am doing the tutorial now. I am now here at 1.2.2 - 1.2.5 .
I made a file (in the folder that the tutorial says) named turtlemimic.launch (with the code given). But when I run the code I get this error message :
[turtlemimic.launch] is neither a launch file in package [beginner_tutorials] nor is [beginner_tutorials] a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

How do I make a .launch file??

Can you copy/paste the command that produced that error message?

@Morgan I run the command $ roslaunch beginner_tutorials turtlemimic.launch , just as the tutorial says.

for those who have this problem ([beginner_tutorials] is not a package or launch file name)
please follow this tutorial:

A:

This could be happening for a few reasons (I know some of these are obvious, I'm just going through the list of things I try to verify when debugging such a problem):

Have you sourced the devel/setup.bash from your workspace into your current shell ? Otherwise, roslaunch won't know where to look to find the beginner_tutorials files, including turtlemimic.launch   you can verify that your current shell knows about the beginner_tutorials location by running rospack list | grep beginner_tutorials and verifying that your package directory shows up in the location you expect.
Is the file named exactly turtlemimic.launch, and is it somewhere in the beginner_tutorials directory tree? Note that if it is somewhere in the workspace (e.g., the workspace root) rather than in the src/beginner_tutorials directory tree, roslaunch will not be able to find it.
Make sure the launch file is valid XML that starts with a launch tag.

I did check all of that but maybe I was tired and did some mistake some where (had 7 terminals opened :P ). Now that I did everything from the beginning it worked just fine. Thanks for your help :)

@Morgan I just looked I did again a little better. Do I need to source devel/setup.bash at every new terminal I use?
Comment by Morgan on 2015-04-08:
Yes, every terminal that needs to work with the package(s) you are developing in your workspace needs to source the devel/setup.bash file from the workspace. I will typically set up a bash alias for the most common workspace I'm using, so you can just type "w" or whatever, to make it fast and easy.
