Q:

Why there is no window show after I run the camera_calibration node?

After I run the node "camera_calibration" like this:
rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --size 8x6 --square 0.108 image:=/pgr_camera/image_raw camera:=/pgr_camera 

it shows as below:
Waiting for service /pgr_camera/set_camera_info ... 

OK 

*** Added sample 1, p_x = 0.897, p_y = 0.349, p_size = 0.277, skew = 0.027

Segmentation fault

Is there any one who can tell me why?
I am using electric on Ubuntu 10.04.And when I run the node "camera_calibration",there is no checkerboard in front of the camera.

What device and camera driver are you running?

A:

The resolution ratio is too large.
The node worked after I reduced the resolution ratio.Maybe too much data result in the Segmentation fault.

Just for the sake of completeness, could you add the resolution that used to SEGFAULT and the resolution that doesn't?
Comment by sven_007 on 2013-04-06:
1280960 lead to SEGFAULT ,and 640480 doesn't.
