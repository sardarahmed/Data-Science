Q:

Ultrasonic range sonars mapping in RVIZ

I'm trying to build a map in RVIZ, by using 3 ultarsonic sonars. After some research i found some related work, for example in lego nxt where it was used an ultrasonic range sonar here. And is possible to see in their presentation video doing some mapping in occupancy grid form, but i couldn't found how they do it. Possible using slam_gmapping, but i notice that stack requires laser scans. Any idea how can i do it?

Hi Andre Araujo, for this you need assisted teleoperation to work. The tutorial is here link text (Need extra gyro and accelerometer sensor to get better results)
For slam_gmapping you need 3 inputs, laser scans, tf and clock. I am attempting to use kinect and nxt to do slam_gmapping since I don't have the gyro and accelerometer sensor.
However I am stuck with the need to input the clock.

Thanks for the tip, i found the node i'm looking for in (nxt_apps). I want to use it on a custom robot, not in a nxt. I have to do some code modifications to work with my robot, and them test it, hope to achieve good results.
