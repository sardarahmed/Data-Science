Q:

Shoudl AMCL attempt to respect/get hints from walls?

I'm trying to get localization with AMCL working well. It seems more than happy to allow it's pose estimates to drive right through the walls on my map - shouldn't it take their location as a hint?
Here's a random screenshot of my robot driving around:

It's going down the hallway that has most of the red arrows in it. Notice that the arrows on the bottom have driven through a wall - I'd imagine they would bunch up against it, reducing the error of estimates?

A:

AMCL handles this sort of issue implicitly through weighting and resampling. The particles in seemingly ridiculous locations likely have very low probability, and should disappear through resampling. If this is consistently not happening, I would bet that something is wrong with your sensor or motion model (which can be controlled through a bunch of parameters).

You might take a look at turtlebot_apps stack -- there is an AMCL launch file configured for the create/kinect: https://kforge.ros.org/turtlebot/turtlebot_apps

Honestly, I have no set any of those parameters beyond the initial pose. Could anyone suggest any important things to set for a standard irobot create / kinect setup?
