Q:

Sound capture with multiple microphones?

I am using Ubuntu 12.04 and ROS-Hydro and I have two audio-technica AT2020 USB microphones that I eventually plan on using for sound localization. However, to start off, I'm testing them with audio_capture and audio_play, which I got from following this tutorial.
The mics work fine independently (I just change the default microphone on System Settings > Audio) but is there a way to capture sound from both microphones simultaneously from two independent channels (so that, let's say, I could mute one but not the other)?
Thanks!

audio_capture cannot do this

Do you know of another package that could do this?

I don't do a lot of audio work, so I'm not aware of any other packages that might work. (If I did, I would have suggested them in my first comment)

A:

A set of quick google searches for "ros microphone array" and "ros multiple microphones" turns up:

https://github.com/introlab/introlab-ros-pkg/tree/master/manyears_ros
http://wiki.ros.org/roar
http://www.hark.jp/wiki.cgi?page=MainPage#p2

All of these look like they're doing custom audio capture using ALSA or another OS-level API.
