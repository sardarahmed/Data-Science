Q:

DC motor with encoder

Can anyone help me out here with this DC motor, especially the encoder part? I tried searching around for its datasheet but its as short as 1 page and the only spec I get are:
Encoder:
1 pulse/revolution
It has 2 connection on the bottom, and I guess they are for driving the motor, but they say nothing about the 3 connections wires below.

A:

Besides referring to the previously-mentioned 82860502 pdf file, see pages 30 and 31 of Steven Engineering's 44MICRO-MOTORS.pdf file, where the following diagram appears and shows the usage of the brown, yellow, and blue wires.
 
Attach a V+ voltage (for example, 5VDC) to the brown wire and connect the blue wire to ground.  As the motor rotates, the yellow wire will alternately be pulled up to V+ through a 10K resistor, and to ground via an NPN transistor.
