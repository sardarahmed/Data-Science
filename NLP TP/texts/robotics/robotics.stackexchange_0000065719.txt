Q:

Incorrect cmake opencv lib path leads to failed compilation

I am trying to compile web_video_server on a raspberry pi with all the libopencv-* packages installed.  Every time I try to run catkin_make_isolated, everything works fine up until make complains that the package requires /usr/local/lib/libopencv_videostab.so.3.0.0.  That package is from a local build of OpenCV that has since been removed with make uninstall, and the proper path should be to an older version installed through apt-get at /usr/lib/libopencv*.  How can I prevent cmake from using the old lib path of OpenCV?

A:

Can you check whether /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig contains anything opencv related? Also (just to be sure): you restarted the entire build right? So rm -rf devel_isolated/ build_isolated/, then catkin_make_isolated ..?
