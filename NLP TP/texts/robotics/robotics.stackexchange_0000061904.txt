Q:

Replay rosbags recorded with --split option

Hi,
I have recorded number of rosbags using --split option, say "file_0.bag", "file_1.bag", "file_2.bag" and so on to build a map. My question is: how to play them back one after the other. Using $ rosbag play file_0.bag file_1.bag file_2.bag plays all files at the same time. Whereas, I want to play one after another.
Thanks.

A:

If you load 3 sequential bag files recorded with --split they will playback according to the timestamps that they were received. So although they will actually be playing back simultaneously. At any given timestep data will only come from one of the bags.

Thanks! I was (embarrassingly) oblivious of timestamps when I thought of the problem.
