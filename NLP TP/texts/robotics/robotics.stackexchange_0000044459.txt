Q:

Why can't I give a comment for my question and choose a best answer?

As title!I want to give a comment for my question by typing the "post a comment", but it doesn't work.
Also,I want to choose a best answer for my question by clicking the tick, but it takes no effort.
What should I do?

A:

You should take into account that usually it takes a while (5 to 10 seconds) for your browser to show the effect of "clicking" on "post a comment" or "vote" or "choose a best answer".
Just be patient :)
