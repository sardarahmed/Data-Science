Q:

installing moveIt - on jade ubuntu 15.04

I am trying to install moveIt on jade on ubuntu 15.04. I have been following the method presented in this. At step 2 & 3: ROS JADE (particularly on step 3) when I run the following command
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro jade -y

I receive errors such as
E: Unable to locate package ros-jade-warehouse-ros
ERROR: the following rosdeps failed to install
apt: command [sudo -H apt-get install -y ros-jade-warehouse-ros] failed

This was the folder, which was not being downloaded by the given address. So, to resolve this problem, I manually downloaded zip file from this cite (cite) and copied extracted files in my moveit/src directory. After that, when I run command
catkin_make

I get this error
CMake Error: The following variables are used in this project, but they are set to NOTFOUND.
Please set them or make sure they are set and tested correctly in the CMake files:
MongoDB_INCLUDE_DIR (ADVANCED)
   used as include directory in directory /home/khan/moveit/src/warehouse_ros
   used as include directory in directory /home/khan/moveit/src/warehouse_ros
   used as include directory in directory /home/khan/moveit/src/warehouse_ros
   used as include directory in directory /home/khan/moveit/src/warehouse_ros
   used as include directory in directory /home/khan/moveit/src/warehouse_ros
   used as include directory in directory /home/khan/moveit/src/warehouse_ros
   used as include directory in directory /home/khan/moveit/src/warehouse_ros
   used as include directory in directory /home/khan/moveit/src/warehouse_ros
MongoDB_LIBRARIES (ADVANCED)
    linked by target "warehouse_ros" in directory /home/khan/moveit/src/warehouse_ros

Seeing this, I tried to download the warehouse file from this cite (cite). I did not get above error after running catkin_make but I had another error which is
make[2]: *** [moveit_plugins/moveit_ros_control_interface/CMakeFiles/moveit_ros_control_interface_plugin.dir/src/controller_manager_plugin.cpp.o] Error 1

Please, help me out. How can I remove this error. I shall buy cookies for you. :)

I think it would be a good idea to actually include the errors that you get when running rosdep.

I have edited the question and included the error.

A:

At step 2 & 3: ROS JADE (particularly on step 3) when I run the following command

rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro jade -y

The instructions you link to seem to use indigo for the --rosdistro option:

STEP 3: Make sure MoveIt! dependencies are installed

rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro indigo -y

I haven't used those instructions myself, but apparently that should work for Jade.

In case, an apt-get release is not available for the system, if you install from source, some of the dependencies might also not be available. In that case, use the --deps and --exclude options from rosinstall_generator.

I have tried this method but again stuck with errors. I guess, I need to shift back to indigo, it is better.
