Q:

Manipulator end-effector orientation with quaternions

I have the following problem:
Given 3 points on a surface, I have to adjust a manipulator end-effector (i.e. pen) on a Baxter Robot, normal to that surface.
From the three points I easily get the coordinate frame, as well as the normal vector. My question is now, how can I use those to tell the manipulator its supposed orientation.
The Baxter Inverse Kinematics solver takes a $(x,y,z)$-tuple of Cartesian coordinates for the desired position, as well as a $(x,y,z,w)$-quaternion for the desired orientation. What do I set the orientation to? My feeling would be to just use the normal vector $(n_1,n_2,n_3)$ and a $0$, or do I have to do some calculation?

A:

As Brian indicated in a comment, you simply need to convert your rotation matrix (or Euler angles) into a quaternion.  Maths - Conversion Matrix to Quaternion is my favorite site for geometric conversions.
Quaternions are a great representation and have a number of benefits over other representations, so you should definitely read up on them.
