Q:

New linux user account can't access ROS tooling

Hi there,
I installed ROS on my PC using my normal user account. I can use all ROS tooling such as catkin_make or roslaunch on this account.
I just created a new user using 'adduser, however this user can't access any of the ROS tooling.
I added the /opt/ros/indigo/bin path to the user's PATH, which helps the user locate the executeables but they still fail when running. It feels like I'm doing something fundamentally wrong with adding this new user, am I missing something?

A:

Are you source-ing /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash for the new user?
You might have added it to the .bashrc of your other user and then forgot about it.
