Q:

Can I have a sensor_msgs::Image::ConstPtr as data member?

I have a class that gets an sensor_msgs::Image::ConstPtr and there are a lot of member functions acting to this same image.
void extractData(const sensor_msgs::Image::ConstPtr &image)
I was wondering if it is possible to have a data member instead of sending the pointer from one function to the other.
I've tried adding:
sensor_msgs::Image::ConstPtr &image;
But it says uninitialized reference member.
Tried also removing Const or Ptr in declaration with no success.
Any ideas?

FYI: For some reason the text appears to me as "sensor_msgs::Image::ConstPtr â„‘", when the OP actually entered "sensor_msgs::Image::ConstPtr &image"

Seems fixed now.

A:

Yes, you can.
However, you cannot have it as a reference, i.e. remove the & in the declaration.

I don't want new objects. I want a reference or else it doesn't worth the loss in speed. I will go with passing around the smart pointer. Thanks anyway.

That's exactly what the smart pointer is intended for.
