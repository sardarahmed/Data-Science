Q:

Permission denied: .gvfs

when using roslaunch tab completion on Ubuntu 13.04 and Hydro I receive:
[rospack] Warning: error while crawling /home/dereck: boost::filesystem::status: Permission denied: "/home/dereck/.gvfs"
This system was installed from scratch today, any ideas?
--
ls shows some weird permissions:
d?????????  ? ?      ?         ?            ? .gvfs/
Can't delete the directory even as root.
--
I rebooted and logged in via ssh, I was able to delete it and the permissions were normal. Something is causing ruckus when I log in to the desktop it seems.

A:

I solved it like this (on Ubuntu 14.04):
#umount /home/useraccount/.gvfs
#rm -rf .gvfs/

hope that helped! :)

This worked for me too. Could you explain better what we have done? Thanks.

We have unmounted the Gnome virtual file system and deleted the mounting point.

Is this a good solution in case I'm using a distributed system with multiple machines?
Comment by zcam on 2016-05-23:
Yeah, stackoverflow doesn't really solve this. It only tell you to umount /run/user/1000/gvfs and remove ~/.gvfs. Which doesn't help. But this one is rock!

I tried this solution, the I got the following:
ysu66@mech1331:~$ umount /home/ysu66/.gvfs
umount: /home/ysu66/.gvfs is not in the fstab (and you are not root)
Can anyone help?

Hi all, problem solved by adding sudo in the front. Cheers
