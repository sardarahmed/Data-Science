Q:

how to make two calls parallel?

in my code, i need to call two services. they are independent
client1.call(service1);
client2.call(service2);
do something after both of them get responses

with the above pseudo code, it seems that the two calls are executed sequentially, i.e., client2 will not execute until client1 gives a response. since the two services are provided by two nodes, i hope that there is a kind of non-blocking mode. i.e., after client1 calls the service, it goes directly to the next line to let client2 call service2. how can i fulfill this?
thanks.

I don't know if there is any non-blocking service call in ROS, but in case there is not... how about launching the service calls in separate threads?

thanks man. multi-threads makes me headache :-(  maybe i could give openmp a try

A:

ROS does not have a non blocking mode for services and it should not need one. The reason is that services should never be used for long running processes. In such cases actions are much better. See here for a discussion.

Updated. Sorry. Seems like it was a bug in the answers site.

And what if you are not in control of the implementation, let's say a robot where only service calls are available?
