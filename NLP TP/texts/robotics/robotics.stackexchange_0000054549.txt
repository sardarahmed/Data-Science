Q:

[turtlemimic.launch] is neither a launch file in package [test_launch] nor is [test_launch] a launch file name?

I have done as the tutorials of ROS in the part of 'UsingRqtconsoleRoslaunch'
but the still gets the error '[turtlemimic.launch] is neither a launch file in package [test_launch] nor is [test_launch] a launch file name'

A:

I think you should "overlay your workspace on top of your environment", so
cd catkin_ws
source devel/setup.bash
then launch your file!

Worked perfectly. However I do have a follow up question: When you initialize a catkin workspace, shouldn't that already be taken care of?

You can add the path of your catkin_ws in ~/.bashrc .
sudo gedit ~/.bashrc
add the path of your catkin workspace in bashrc
YourPath/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
and then run in terminal "source ~/.bashrc"
And then you never get this error.

I had the same issue and I have already sourced the setup.bash. It turned out to be a spelling error in the command. I have typed beginner_tutorial"" instead of beginner_tutorial"s". If you get the same issue even after sourcing the setup.bash, double check the command to see if the spelling and names are correct. This might help.
