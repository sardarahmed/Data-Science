Q:

Debian Jessie armhf repo

Hi folks,
would like to ask... is there anywhere repo with ros-minimal packages for debian jessie with armhf architecture?
and if there is not, is there a chance that there will be given that debian jessie is now official distro? :)
I wanted to setup my own jenkins, but realized I don't have machine strong enough ( based on what's recommended on https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/buildfarm_deployment , but maybe I can work with something less powerfull? )
P.S: please, don't answer with things like "use ubuntu" or "compile it on rpi", I know these alterantives and they are not point of the question.

Considering there may not be a near term build of ROS for Debian armhf:
Could you elaborate on the difference(s) between Jessie and Xenial which affect your choice?
Have you considered cross compiling?

A:

Not sure what you mean though, are you asking if binary packages are built for Jessie for armhf? If so then not so far for Kinetic AFAIK.

is there a chance that there will be given that debian jessie is now official distro? :)

I'm not sure if Jessie is officially supported. Starting from Kinetic, Jessie seems to put on some restriction on the specification (see rep-0003) but support for it is "not required".
