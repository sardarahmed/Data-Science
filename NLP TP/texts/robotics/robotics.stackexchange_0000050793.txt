Q:

Does a ROS node have to exist within a package?

I've gone through part of the ROS tutorial, and I'm still a bit confused on a very basic concept: does a ROS node have to exist within a ROS package? If I wanted to write the most basic "hello world" ROS program/node, do I need to build a whole ROS package around it, with a manifest.xml etc., or can I just include the proper ROS headers?

A:

Short answer: yes. Every node should be in a package.
roscreate-pkg makes creating packages easy enough that this isn't be a big hassle.
Longer answer: C++ and python nodes need the package infrastructure to resolve their dependencies, particularly for rosmake packages. With the newer catkin build system in Groovy, it is possible to cheat and make a python node without a package, if it only depends on other catkin packages.
