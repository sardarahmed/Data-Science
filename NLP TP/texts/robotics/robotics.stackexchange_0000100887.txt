The scale member means different
things for these marker types. The
POINTS marker uses the x and y members
for width and height respectively,
while the LINE_STRIP and LINE_LIST
markers only use the x component,
which defines the line width. Scale
values are in meters.

The marker types to POINTS, LINE_STRIP and LINE_LIST.
  68     // POINTS markers use x and y scale for width/height respectively
  69     points.scale.x = 0.2;
  70     points.scale.y = 0.2;
  71 
  72     // LINE_STRIP/LINE_LIST markers use only the x component of scale, for the line width
  73     line_strip.scale.x = 0.1;
  74     line_list.scale.x = 0.1;
