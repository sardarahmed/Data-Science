Q:

Conflict with ROS Python and Conda

Ever since I have installed Conda, ROS does not seem to work. And predictably it is because Conda has changed my Python environment.
I run ROS Indigo on Ubuntu 14.04.
Can someone guide on how can I use both on my machine? I am willing to make changes to my system every time I want to switch from one to another.

A:

The problem is that Conda is now in your path before system python (for which you probably have installed ros libraries).
In their troubleshooting section check the section Issue: Programs fail due to invoking conda Python and not system Python : they suggest few solutions, the simplest of which is to remove conda from the path, and use conda later on with the full path names (such as ~/miniconda3/bin/conda)
