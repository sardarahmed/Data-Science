Q:

Topic publish/subscribe problem after running dist-upgrade on ROS Hydro

After running apt-get dist-upgrade on ROS Hydro, simulated robot is not responding to published messages. The simulator is running perfectly. The code/topics are working fine on Turtle-bot (hardware) i.e. publishing and subscribing.
rosdep --version: 0.10.24
export | grep ROS gives us this:
declare -x ROS_DISTRO="hydro"
declare -x ROS_ETC_DIR="/opt/ros/hydro/etc/ros"

We have started to work on Turtlebot and new to ROS. Any help will be appreciated.
thanks in advance

Hi,
I figured out the solution to my problem.
The thing is, after having an apt-get dist-upgrade my gazebo simulator was upgraded to gazebo 2.1 (previously it was gazebo 1.9 the stable version). It looks like the newer version is having some problems with hydro.
I had to uninstall the new version of gazebo i.e v2.1 by apt-get remove gazebo-current.
After that I installed the earlier version i.e v1.9 http://gazebosim.org/wiki/1.9/install and then had to run these commands:
$ sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-turtlebot-simulator
$ source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash
$ roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_empty_world.launch

And it started publishing and subscribing again.
Cheers!
