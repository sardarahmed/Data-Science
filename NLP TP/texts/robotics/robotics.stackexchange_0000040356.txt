A:

Just in case someone else is also struggling with it. We published a wrapper package for ROS indigo with pymodbus.
There are some python example scripts how to use the modbus and also and interface with standard ROS messages, if you want to communicate from c++.
Modbus Wrapper
As modbus is often used with PLCs, we also made some examples and corresponding projects for a Siemens PLC, as well as a Cognex insight 7200(C), both as modbus servers.
