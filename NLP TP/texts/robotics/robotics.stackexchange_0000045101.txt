Q:

remove gazebo but keeping the rest of ROS

I am using Ubuntu 12.04 and installed the ros-fuerte-desktop-full package. I have never used ros-fuerte-simulator-gazebo, so I would like to remove it.
However, ros-fuerte-desktop-full depends on it, so if I want to remove gazebo, everything ROS related will get removed. Is there a way (besides installing every package manually) to remove gazebo and keeping the rest of ROS?

@Carlito Why remove gazebo ? it doesn't occupy too much of space. If you are very particular then consider installing ROS-Comm: (Bare Bones) installation and add packages as per your requirement - http://www.ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Installation/Ubuntu

A:

You can remove any ROS component & packages that depend on it with apt-get, i.e.
sudo apt-get remove ros-fuerte-simulator-gazebo

should remove just gazebo related and dependent packages.
