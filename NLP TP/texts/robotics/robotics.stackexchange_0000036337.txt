Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: rosbag record

Hi,
I'm trying to record all the topics on ros with rosbag, but there are some topics that I don't want, for exemple /cmd_vel and all the topics releted to the camera /camera/*.
I have tried with rosbag record -a -x "/cmd_vel" -x "/camera(.)" and it doesn't work, but if i try it separatley it does work and it donsen't record /cmd_vel or /camera is there some command to exclude from the record more than one topic or types of topics?
Thanks.

A:

How about this:

rosbag record -a -x "((/cmd_vel)|(/camera(.*)))"

You can logically control the topics to exclude, using & or |, as you would in python

Give or take the fact that getting regular expressions written down correctly (in shell, at that) can be a pain. I'd suggest a few minutes with xargs.
