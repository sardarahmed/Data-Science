Q:

rosdep update error (gentoo.yaml empty)

Hi, I just noticed a strange error when executing rosdep update.
$ rosdep update

If I look at https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/blob/master/rosdep/gentoo.yaml, it looks fine, however for me, the raw version https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/raw/master/rosdep/gentoo.yaml which rosdep downloads seems to be empty (0 bytes). Is this some faulty caching on github's side, or somewhere on my machine? I get the same with browser and from command line (wget), so not sure what kind of cache that would be...
Can anyone confirm the empty file with the "raw" link?

A:

I have an opened a support email with github and they are looking into it, but I too think it is related to the roll out of their new CDN. It is safe to ignore this error for now, the file it is failing to retrieve is empty and vestigial anyways.
In fact you can get rid of it by re-initilaizing rosdep:

Run rosdep init, it will fail because it's already initialized
Follow the instructions it gives you to remove the config files
Run rosdep init again
Run rosdep update (hoepfully without error)

Also, it looks to be resolved now, the Github support team emailed me letting me know it was resolved.

Yeah, it seemed to have started working yesterday. Thanks for the hint with removing the gentoo entry since it has been removed anyways.
