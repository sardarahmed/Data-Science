Q:

suck2blow reference?

i usually use rosawesome aliases to shortcut commands in the terminal. suck2blow is an alias for 'rosbag record', but why? Is it a reference to something?

A:

See #q45463 and #q277428 for a related questions, and as a shortcut, see ROSCon 2012 - Lightning Talks - What does rosawesome do? for probably a rather authoritative source (spoiler: they're Spaceballs references).

Edit:

I asked if suck2blow a reference to something.

Yes. Again, to Spaceballs: Spaceballs "Mega Maid" scene.

What's the meaning of suck2blow and why is it linked with rosbag play?

Mega Maid (from Mega_Maid):

Mega Maid is the transformed version of Spaceball I. It is shaped like a woman with a vacuum cleaner. The vacuum can both suck air out of a planet's atmosphere, and blow it back into an atmosphere. It appears very powerful, since it can clean a mountain of snow, and pull a forest's trees straight out of the ground (and put everything back neatly if set in reverse).

So rosbag first 'sucks' (records) and then 'blows' (plays back).
