Q:

Is it possible to use shared memory as IPC with galactic windows 10?

Hi all,
According to this repository note it seems that Cyclone DDS does not yet support iceoryx shared memory on windows.
Does any of the other implementations support shared memory on windows?
Thanks in advanced!

A:

As I found in ROS Discourse the Fast DDS implementations does.
Now I wonder whether it is possible to use it with python bindings.
