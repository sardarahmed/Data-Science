Q:

How to use URDF for robot visualization in rviz?

Hi everyone!
I've have allays used the robot footprint to view my robot in rviz. My robot does not have any moving parts, however I would like to see its 3D model in rviz instead of its footprint.
I'm using an erratic, and I was going through the urdf files and for most of it across the ROS wiki it strikes me that the urdf files are usually used for Gazebo simulations.
So how can I use a robot urdf file to simply view the real robot in rviz?
Also, instead of using static tf transforms for my tf tree can I use the urdf model containing the sensors to publish that information, even if there are not moving joints? How do I do that?
I apologize if this is a very simple question however I was going through the wiki and I could not figure out and started to get a bit confused!
Thanks in advance!

A:

Definitely can use it outside of Gazebo. Take a look at the tdx_urdf package for an example of a URDF that we only used for visualizing in rviz, never for Gazebo simulation. You can see an example of the model being displaying in rviz here.
There are launch file(s) in that package that should start up the model as well as the tf publishers that will handle all of the static joints in the URDF. To view it in rviz, you'll need a RobotModel display configured properly to read the URDF from the correct parameter. There is a urdf.vcg file in that package that should configure rviz properly if you used the launch files (at least I'm pretty sure it does... if not, we forgot to update it).
