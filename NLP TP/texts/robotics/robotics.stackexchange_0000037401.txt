Q:

View Joint Axes in rviz?

Is there a way to view the axes of the joints in rviz, similar to how I can click a checkbox and view the links of my robot? I've figured out how to move the joints using the gui:=true parameter with roslaunch (following the tutorial), but I haven't been able to figure out how to get a simple visualization of their axes.

The answer in #q270701 shows how to do this

A:

The tf display should show the frames for all your joints.

How do I activate the tf display in rviz?

This doesn't answer his question. He specifically asked for JOINTS and not LINKS. The TF display in RVIZ only displays LINKS, not JOINTS.
