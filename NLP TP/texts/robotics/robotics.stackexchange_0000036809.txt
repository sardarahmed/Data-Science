Q:

Navigation Stack does not use a map from Gmapping?

In navigation stack, the tutorial is based on a static map and amcl for localization. When using with slam, some people suggested just exclude the static map and amcl and run gmapping.
I already did that and it worked. However, when I looked into rxgraph, why the only topic move_base(Navigation stack) use from Gmapping is /tf and it does not use /map from Gmapping at all?
I've looked into the code and guessed it might create map by itself in costmap2D from laser scan in move_base node.
If this is true, would it be better to use the real map from Gmapping?
Only costmap from laser scan and correct position from Gmapping through /tf is enough correct?

A:

Just to clarify. The costmap_2d is capable of taking updates to the static map from a SLAM system such as gmapping. Any time a new map comes in over the /map topic, the static map used by the navigation stack is re-initialized. Are you sure that the global costmap of the navigation stack is configured to subscribe to this map? If so, you should be seeing the move_base node as subscribed to the /map topic.

http://answers.ros.org/question/1583/whats-the-difference-between-global-and-local <-- I read your answer in this topics as well. Thank you for clarification!

Now, I understand. Like what you said it's true. I set the global cost map not to receive static map but use rolling windows. http://answers.ros.org/question/399/navigation-stack-with-gmapping <-- this made me misunderstand.

I see. I think I need to check it whether I set the global costmap of the navigation stack to subscribe to the map or not. Because I did not see the move_base node subscribed any /map topic. Will tell again whether this is the problem or not. Thank you very much for guiding :)

@ParNurZeal hi im having your same problem, when i look in the rxgraph i se a tf topic and not a map going in the move_base.  Is this correct? Any help would be really appreciated @Eric Perko
