Q:

Rviz middle button zooming instead of move x/y

I'm playing around with Rviz plotting a point cloud.  Trying to move the x/y with middle click, but it's zooming instead.  Left button behavior is correct (rotate).  Right button behavior also correct (zooming).  So, center and right buttons both zoom and I can't move the scene.
I'm using a Thinkpad with 3 buttons.  Center button has default Linux paste functionality, and scrolling with the trackpoint.
Thanks for any help.

A:

Just use the alternative: Shift+Left Mouse Click.
This does not exactly solve the behavior, but it's easier than trying to fix the machine.
