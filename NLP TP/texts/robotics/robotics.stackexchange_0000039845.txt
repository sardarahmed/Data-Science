Q:

Anyone who has an idea about this video clip

Dear, ROS-users.
Recently, I could find this cool footage from CCNY-Robotics.

I'm just wondering how they could visualize such rainbow color laser scan data w.r.t height data.
Does Rviz support this function by default?
If I have /height /scan /map /odom topics, is it possible to visualize like the above footage?
Any idea would be appreciate.
Cheers.

A:

Coloring w.r.t height data is available for PointClouds using the PointCloud2 display in rviz. Either the axis or intensity transformers can do this if you select the "z" axis of the points (or whichever other field you'd like to colorize based on). Once selected, play with the settings for the displays until you get the view you want (e.g. turn on "Use full color spectrum" to interpolate in the full RGB space).
I don't believe rviz can do this for LaserScan messages, so you'd have to transform your LaserScans to PointCloud2's first (see laser_pipeline for packages that will help you do this).
Update: rviz can actually colorize LaserScans by fixed frame axis, so you shouldn't need to transform them into PointClouds first.

No, it can color laser scan messages along an axis.
