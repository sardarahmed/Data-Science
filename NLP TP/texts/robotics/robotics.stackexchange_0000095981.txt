Q:

Transform NavSatFix to Tf

This is probably a dumb question.
I am working with the Kitti dataset. I am trying to express the content of the topic /kitti/oxts/gps/fix (NavSatFix - lat, long, alt) in the reference world reference system of Tf (x, y, z).
Do you know a way to do it? Thanks

Hi @Filippo Grazioli,
Have you considered the robot_localization package and its navsat_transform_node?

A:

My personal solution was the following:
a) transform the initial GPS position (lat, long, alt) to an ECEF point - let's name this O;
b) center a ENU reference system in O;
c) express all other GPS positions (lat, long, alt) w.r.t. the ENU reference system centred in O.
