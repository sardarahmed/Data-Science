Q:

How much space is required for a complete install of cturtle-base?

I am installing it on my beagleboard ubuntu distro. I need to know how big of an sdcard I need.

A:

As far as I can recall, together with system dependencies, it would be around 1GB-1,5GB. But I cannot say exactly, maybe someone else still using cturtle (which I'm not) can tell better.
EDIT: Sorry, I missed it somehow you're installing it on a BeagleBoard. In this case I can say exactly how much you need as I'm doing the exact same thing (BB-xM).
Ubuntu 10.04 minimal needs 400MB link. I had problems installing Maverick, so I recommend Lucid. You'll need more or less 1GB-1,5GB for ROS, depending on which stacks you install. It's not ROS, but rather it's system dependencies that need more space. I have 4GB microSD's, they're just fine.
Also, read REP108. You can now install many variants of ROS depending on your needs. You do it by replacing the variant variable with the one of your choice in 1.2:
rosinstall ~/ros "http://packages.ros.org/cgi-bin/gen_rosinstall.py?rosdistro=diamondback&variant=YOURVARIANT, EG mobile&overlay=no"
