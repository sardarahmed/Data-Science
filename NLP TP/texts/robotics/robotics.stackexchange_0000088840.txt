Q:

Respawn entire launch file

Hi all,
I learned that respawn Tag in a launch file lets a single node being restarted if it crashes. Further, the required tag if set true, stops the entire launch if a particular important node closes.
Is it also possible to respawn all nodes in a launch file if a particular important node closes and needs to geht respawned?
Thank you for your Help.

No, not as far as I know.
respawn is a node-level attribute (docs).
