Q:

How do you add re-usable sub-models to a larger model

I'm trying to model a simple quadruped robot, and the legs contain four segments. Since the legs are identical, instead of duplicating the leg SDF inside the main model SDF file, is there some way I can model the leg once in a separate SDF file and "include" it four times in the SDF file for the "complete" robot?

A:

The <include> tag can be used as a child of world
or as a child of model. It currently accepts 4 sub-tags: uri, name, pose, and static (used for specifying models as static). Ideally, there would be more options there, but that's all we have implemented so far.
