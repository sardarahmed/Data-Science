Q:

Is SLAM done only first time in a given environment

I am training Turtlebot 2 to move around the office. I come from robotics hardware background but relatively new to computer vision and robotic mapping.
Here are my two fundamental questions related to localization and mapping. 

The algorithm we are using to mapping is SLAM. This makes sense but my question is in general, if we have performed SLAM, then the map is created and this map can be saved for later. So is it right to say, next time if the bot moves in the same environment, it is not using SLAM but instead only localisation (since the map already exist). Is SLAM in general used only for first time mapping within an environment?
If there is no mapping at all, can bots be trained to move randomly and turn back or around only if there is an obstacle or wall.  This wouldn't require mapping, right? So is it right to say, bots can be moved either by mapping or without mapping, depending on the need.

Yes, SLAM is used only once to build map of the environment before navigation operation. Also, In case of significant change in the environment.

If there is no mapping at all, can bots be trained to move randomly
  and turn back or around only if there is an obstacle or wall. This
  wouldn't require mapping, right? So is it right to say, bots can be
  moved either by mapping or without mapping, depending on the need.

Maps are required for 

Localization (to know the current location of Robot). One cam localize robot without maps using visual tag or some other markers to make robot identify it location. 
Path planning (given destination, returns obstacle free efficient path). 

Without map, it is possible to move the robot randomly and avoid obstacles. If you are using laser, you don't need learning, its easy to avoid obstacles based on sensor data.
