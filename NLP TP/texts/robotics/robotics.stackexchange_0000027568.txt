Q:

URDF from a working ROS package not shown

I'm creating a Gazebo package for a URDF-based, dual-arm robot. Its ROS package has been working for years. Robot model doesn't appear on Gazebo, wireframe or collision either. What should I check?
URDF (it's URDF but in the launch file I use this as a xacro).
The entire Gazebo package can be seen in this pull request.
Saw a similar thread but most of the joints in my model aren't fixed.
Also, this 'invisible' robot keeps falling (so I'm trying to add contact parameters), but this is another problem.
Gazebo 2.2.6, ROS Indigo
Thank you.

Update) Adding environment variables trick to package.xml` in the package that contains models didn't work unfortunately.
Meanwhile, I don't see either the list of links in the model pane. I only see __default__, string of which doesn't exist anywhere in my packages.

This looks similar to the problems I encountered here: http://answers.gazebosim.org/question/7178/mesh-geometries-using-xacro-not-working-with-drcsimgazebo4-working-previously-with-drcsimgazebo2/ and here: https://bitbucket.org/ihmcrobotics/ihmc_ros/issues/52/atlas-controller-fails-to-work-properly.
You could test if it's the same resource loading issue by adding primitive based geometry. That worked in my cases (but didn't help with the meshes obviously).

A:

I figured it out. As noted in "Inertial Element" section in the URDF in Gazebo tutorial (sorry linking didn't work, maybe with brackets in the URL?), mass must be greater than zero for any link to not be ignored. In my case there were a few link in the upstream nodes whose mass was 0.
Good standalone debugging tool gzsdf (for Gazebo2) was also mentioned in this chapter.
