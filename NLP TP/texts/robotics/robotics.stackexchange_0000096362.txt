Q:

rosserial-python on ROS noetic

Hey all,
I'm trying to download rosserial on ROS noetic by doing:
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-rosserial-python
However, I always get the same output:
E: Unable to locate package ros-noetic-rosserial-python
So my question is: How do I download rosserial-python for ROS noetic?
According to the wiki, http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_python , there is already rosserial python for ROS noetic so I don't understand why the command isn't working.
I am using ROS Noetic on a RaspberryPi 3 and I'm following the tutorial: https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/raspberry_pi_3_setup/#raspberry-pi-3-setup to try to setup a turtlebot with noetic.
Thank you all

A:

It looks like the maintainers of rosserial_python have not yet released it into ROS Noetic.

https://github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial/issues/499

In the meantime, you can try building it from source. Clone the repo into your catkin workspace.
cd path/to/your/catin/ws/src
git clone https://github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial.git -b noetic-devel

Then build as usual using whatever tool you prefer: catkin_make or catkin_make_isolated or catkin build, ...

Building from source may not work in this case (or be sufficient). See #q354667 (and a few other Q&As here).
