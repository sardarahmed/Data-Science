Q:

Compile ROS Groovy on Beagleboard?

Dear ROS Community,
Our engineering team is seeking the possibilities of compiling ROS Groovy on a Beagleboard, which will have OpenSuse installed.  We are wondering if there are any known difficulties of this Groovy + OpenSuse + Beagleboard combination?
Also, would you suggest us to directly compile ROS from source on Beagleboard, or cross-compile it?
Thank you!

A:

It is easiest to compile directly on beagle board ... however, that will take a while. I have had success with compiling ROS with distcc for raspberry pi. It really helps speed things up.
