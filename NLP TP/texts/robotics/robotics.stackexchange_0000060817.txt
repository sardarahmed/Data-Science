Q:

tf subscriber information?

Hi,
I'm working with a complicated ROS system involving a number of nodes and therefore a tf tree. I just wanted to know, is there a command to find out which particular transform or tfs are being subscribed to by a given node.
For example, when I see the rqt_graph, it just shows the node subscribe to /tf and not which tf. Along the same lines, it only shows which nodes are publishing to /tf but not which transform particularly.
Thank you very much.

A:

You can run
rosrun tf tf_monitor

to see which nodes publish which frames to tf. Alternatively, you can run
  rosrun tf view_frames

and view the resulting PDF.
There is no generic way to know which frames are used inside a node, however. All nodes with tf TransformListeners receive all messages published on the tf topic, so from a ROS communication layer view there is no way to know.

Thank you, that's what I wanted to know. So I guess the go to option to figure that out is to read the source code then.
