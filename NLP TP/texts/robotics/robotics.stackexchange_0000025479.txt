Q:

DRCSIM: gazebo crashes when model launced as "pinned"

I'm using the drc simulator and I've recently updated to gazebo 1.3, since then I encounter the following problem:
If I try to "pin" the robot model too early (publish "pinned" to /mode either from the launch file or from the command line) gazebo crashes.
If I wait a little before I publish the message everything seems to work fine.
I also noticed that even though I launch my model with no position controllers started it still stays in a stiff position for several seconds before it collapses, perhaps this is the time when a pin command will crash the simulator?
Any idea what might be the problem?

A:

The DRCRobotPlugin unpins the simulation automatically after 10s.
There was one bug fixed already regarding the mode setting:
code fix
Of course you'd have to build from source or wait for the next release to get this fix.
