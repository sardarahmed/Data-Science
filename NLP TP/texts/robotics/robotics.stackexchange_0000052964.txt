A:

Well, the simulator is there, but it is work in progress. We are working on getting it back in shape for the full release of Hydro.
If you don't want to wait until then, you can try out the shadow-fixed debian packages or a source install.
However, since it's work in progress expect only partially implemented features and even broken versions!
We will announce the simulator on ros-users, once it is ready.
