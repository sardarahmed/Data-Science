Q:

common_rosdeps/rosdep.yaml does not working?

I had following problem
$ rosdep install openhrp3
Failed to find rosdep libxml2 for package openhrp3 on OS:ubuntu version:lucid rosdep install ERROR: failed to install libxml2

but it libxml2 is defined in the common_rosdeps/rosdep.yaml as
libxml2:
  ubuntu: libxml2-dev
  debian: libxml2-dev
  arch: libxml2
  opensuse: libxml2-devel
  fedora: libxml2-devel
  macports: libxml2
  gentoo: dev-libs/libxml2
  freebsd: libxml2
  fedora: libxml2

Is there somethig wrong in common_rosdeps stacks?
$ rosdep where_defined libxml2
libxml2 defined in set(['/opt/ros/electric/stacks/common_rosdeps/rosdep.yaml', ">>/opt/ros/electric/stacks/common_rosdeps/rosdep.yaml<<Unused due to package 'common_rosdeps' being in a stack.]]"])

A:

I'm am not familiar with the contents of openhrp3, but, in order to use common_rosdeps, you have to declare a dependency on it.  This can be declared as either a package or a stack dependency -- the package dependency is preferred.
e.g. "rospack depends openhrp3" must contain "common_rosdeps"
