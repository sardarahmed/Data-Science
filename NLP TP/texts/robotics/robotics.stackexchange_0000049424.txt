A:

Mapping objects of interest can be performed using the hector_object_tracker framework, which is independent of the SLAM system that is used to generate an environment map. It keeps track of objects of interest and using plugins for hector_geotiff, these can be added to generated geotiff maps.
We haven't added comprehensive documentation for that yet, but looking at a example setup might be enough. A simulation scenario can be started as described here. Note the hlugv_worldmodel_all.launch that is launched there. This in turn launches the object_tracker.launch launch file, that sets up the object_tracker. A confirmed victim can then be added using a service call like in this example. When a GeoTiff map is saved, this added victim will also be plotted into it as the necessary plugins for doing that have been loaded using hector_geotiff.launch.
/edit: Since this answer has been originally posted, the object_tracker has been renamed to hector_object_tracker, so this change will also have to be reflected in launch files using it.
