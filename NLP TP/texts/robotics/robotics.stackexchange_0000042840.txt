Q:

Openni_node.launch in Fuerte

I have been having the same problem as this post (http://answers.ros.org/question/39814/openni_nodelaunch-not-found/), but when I changed the kinect+rgbdslam.launch file to depend on openni_camera_deprecated, I got this error:
error loading  tag:
file does not exist [/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/openni_camera/info/openni_params.yaml]
XML is 
What is going wrong? I would greatly appreciate an explanation on how to fix this problem, which occurs when running any Fuerte program that depends on openni_node.launch.

A:

There is a bug in the launch script in the openni_camera_deprecated package. See https://kforge.ros.org/openni/trac/ticket/51
I would recommend taking either of these options

Update your code to use the new launch script in the openni_launch stack (or create a subset of this script yourself, as it launches way too many nodelets for my comfort)
Download a local copy of the openni_camera_deprecated package in your workspace, and apply the fix mentioned in the bug report.
