Q:

Can I use the clock from a bag in ROS2?

I don't see an option for ros2 bag play --clock <bag>, is there an equivalent feature in ROS2 yet?

A:

rosbag2 is not yet clock-aware. See the related GitHub ticket here: https://github.com/ros2/rosbag2/issues/99
You can always record and playback the /clock topic, but rosbag2 doesn't support features like jumping to timepoints or changing the rate of playback.
