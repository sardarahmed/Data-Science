Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Loading a map

Hey guys I'm trying to load a map, but I'm getting the following error,
rosrun map_server map_server maps/map.yaml 

[ INFO] [1540147650.086107759]: Loading map from image "maps/map.pgm" Segmentation fault (core dumped)

This is my YAML file
image: /home/pradheep/cat_ws/src/simulation/maps/map.pgm
resolution: 0.050000
origin: [-100.000000, -100.000000, 0.000000]
negate: 0
occupied_thresh: 0.65
free_thresh: 0.196

What should I do?
