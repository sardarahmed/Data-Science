Q:

Compiling from source error

I'm currently reinstalling ROS, exactly the way i did before this install. Basically just following this to the letter. Somehow, this is not working for me at the moment.
When the building process arrives at the part where it compiles (or 'rosmakes') ros_comm it halts, due to an error. Something is going wrong with the paths.
CMake Error at /home/erik/ros/ros/core/rosbuild/private.cmake:110 (message):
[rosbuild] rospack found package "cpp_common" at "", but the current
directory is "/home/erik/ros/ros_comm/test/test_crosspackage".  You 
should double-check your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH to ensure that packages are found in the
correct precedence order. Call Stack (most recent call first): /home/erik/ros/ros/core/rosbuild/public.cmake:180 (_rosbuild_check_package_location) CMakeLists.txt:16 (rosbuild_init). 

So clearly something is going wrong filling out the actual path: rospack found package "cpp_common" at ""
I checked ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, but i wouldn't know what the correct order would be. Here it is (it scrolls a long way right).
robot_model_tutorials:visualization_tutorials:geometry_tutorials:common_tutorials:ros_tutorials:documentation:geometry_experimental:robot_model_visualization:geometry_visualization:diagnostics_monitors:executive_smach_visualization:visualization:slam_gmapping:navigation:vision_opencv:laser_pipeline:image_pipeline:image_transport_plugins:perception_pcl:image_common:rx:visualization_common:physics_ode:stage:simulator_gazebo:simulator_stage:xacro:executive_smach:robot_model:assimp:pluginlib:orocos_kinematics_dynamics:nodelet_core:geometry:bullet:filters:eigen:driver_common:diagnostics:common:common_msgs:bond_core:common_rosdeps:ros_comm:ros

Does anyone have a clue what is going wrong here? I'm using a fresh install of Ubuntu 10.04LTS (32bits).

A:

This was a bug (my fault) in rosinstall 0.6.2
Make sure to update rosinstall by either running
sudo pip install -U rosinstall
or
sudo easy_install -U rosinstall vcstools

Thanks! Unfortunately i can't test it now, http://pypi.python.org/simple/rosinstall/ is offline.
