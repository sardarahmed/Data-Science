Q:

Electric eigen dependency

I successfully installed ros/electric in Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty) using
sudo apt-get install ros-electric-ros-base
However electric now uses eigen3 and it was not installed during electric installation (I earlier had eigen2 installed). Aptitude search shows following:
agadre@riverine:~$ aptitude search eigen
i   libeigen2-dev - lightweight C++ template library for linear algebra
p   libeigen2-doc - eigen2 API docmentation
p   libeigen3-dev - lightweight C++ template library for linear algebra
p   ros-electric-eigen - Eigen Library
p   ros-unstable-eigen - Eigen Library
Why was ros-electric-eigen (and by extension libeigen3-dev) not installed? Currently default eigen in Ubuntu 11.04 is libeigen2-dev.
This same question also extends to opencv-2.3.
Thanks!

A:

ros-electric-base does not come with opencv nor Eigen.  If you want opencv, install ros-electric-vision-opencv as well.
"ros-electric-eigen" is a backwards compatibility package; it mainly just forwards compile flags to the system dependency for eigen. The actual eigen3 library with electric is libeigen3-dev

libopencv2.3-dev is sufficient if you just are using OpenCV, but it does not provide ROS integration.
Comment by Aditya on 2011-09-23:
It seems that ros-electric-vision-opencv depends on geometry and orocos-kinematics-dynamics packages. Can I instead just install libopencv2.3-dev?
