aswin, please update your question instead of replying in answers below.

A:

The best place to start for understanding how to integrate with ROS is to go through the ROS tutorials  They will help you learn how to use ROS and what ROS provides.  Once you have that understanding adding ROS to your existing code should be relatively easy.
