A:

This package is using OpenCV to get the input of the camera (check this link for a more detailed example: https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_gui/py_video_display/py_video_display.html):
https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/modules/videoio/doc/reading_and_writing_video.html
The interesting part for you is:
https://github.com/ros2/demos/blob/71ab3261675c1f44e1e280556d4fb323efee51f2/image_tools/src/cam2image.cpp#L153
Where the example does the init of the video capture stream if the boolean burger_mode is false.
You will need to know the device ID of the camera which should be related to the USB port number the camera is connected to.
