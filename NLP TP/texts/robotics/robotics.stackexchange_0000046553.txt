Q:

rosmake fails for youbot_description

I'm trying to get a simulated youBot running in Gazebo.
When running rosmake on the line
rosmake youbot_description
I get a failure. The failure states
[rosmake-7] Finished <<< youbot_description [FAIL] [ 2.11 seconds ]
[ rosmake ] Halting due to failure in package youbot_description.
[ rosmake ] Waiting for other threads to complete.
[ rosmake ] Results:
[ rosmake ] Built 41 packages with 1 failures.
[ rosmake ] Summary output to directory
[ rosmake ] /home/ros-root/.ros/rosmake/rosmake_output-20121213-115221
I downloaded using the apt-get commands from this page:
http://youbot-store.com/simulation/12/software.aspx
But I did substitute to use ros-fuerte-pr2-controllers and ros-fuerte-pr2-simulator as I am running fuerte.
I can post the log file if needed but here's the portion that seems to be relevant:

Any suggestions would be appreciated.
Thank you.

A:

Switching rosdistros does not necessarily compile.  You need to fix the bullet compile issues.  It's documented in the release notes
