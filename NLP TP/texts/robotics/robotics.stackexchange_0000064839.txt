Q:

rtabmap with depth only sensors

Hey,
I am trying to implement SLAM with depth only camera - Occipitals Structure sensor. I use openni2  launch for getting the camera msgs on ROS. I was wondering if I could use RTABmapping with this sensor or is the RGB camera needed ?
I have used Kinect with RTAB mapping and it worked fine. But Kinect is too big for my application and Structure sensor has internal battery as well, which works great for portability.

Am unable to get output. Can you plz tell the any changes required before running launch file.
I am connecting Kinect and running launch file, Nothing is coming.

A:

A RGB stream registered to the depth stream is required. Iâ€™m pretty sure that the Structure sensor can register the depth image with the RGB image from the camera of the iPad.
You may want to look at the Asus Xtion live Pro for a more compact design of the Kinect. The Asus is powered by USB too!
