Q:

catkin error gazebo-ros-control missing on indigo plus gazebo7

I install gazebo7 and then install gazebo7-ros-pkgs from debian as this  instruction
I download code from github (tutorial code from book, mastering ros for robotics programming), and then catkin, it throws build error as follows:
CMake Warning at /opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:76 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "gazebo_ros_control" with any of the following names:

    gazebo_ros_controlConfig.cmake
    gazebo_ros_control-config.cmake

 Add the installation prefix of "gazebo_ros_control" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "gazebo_ros_control_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "gazebo_ros_control" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.

    -- Could not find the required component 'gazebo_ros_control'. The following CMake error indicates that you either need to install the package with the same name or change your environment so that it can be found.
    CMake Error at /opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:83 (find_package):

It seems like I have not installed gazebo-ros-control package, though I think it is supposed to have been installed already by
previous install procedure:
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-gazebo7-ros-pkgs

I check the packages by:
rospack list | grep gazebo_

whose result is :
gazebo_msgs /opt/ros/indigo/share/gazebo_msgs
gazebo_plugins /opt/ros/indigo/share/gazebo_plugins
gazebo_ros /opt/ros/indigo/share/gazebo_ros
gazebo_tutorials /home/shawn/catkin_ws/src/gazebo_ros_demos/custom_plugin_tutorial

It turns out gazebo-ros-control package haven't been installed! Why?
According to instruction of gazebo official, it is said that except for ros-indigo-gazebo7-ros-pkgs, all other packages related to gazebo MUST be built from source.
Does it mean I have to build gazebo-ros-control from source?
Is it version-specific? Where can I find the right version on github?
Is this the right link?, if so, how can I git clone this package on this page?

A:

Hello, I met the same problem with you. I use ros indigo and gazebo6. I installed the package "ros-indigo-gazebo6-ros-control" by use the command sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-gazebo6-ros-control to solve this problem.
