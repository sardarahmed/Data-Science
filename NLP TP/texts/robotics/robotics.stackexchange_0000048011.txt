Q:

ROSjava subscriber

Hi,
I have problem with subscriber, when I run my android application a see in LogCat that "Unable to resolve host "ROS": No address associated with hostname".
I have set in .bashrc

ROS_IP=10.0.0.139 ,
ROS_HOSTNAME=10.0.0.139 ,
ROS_MASTER_URI=http:// 10.0.0.139:11311

In file /etc/hosts

127.0.0.1 localhost ,
127.0.1.1 ROS

and in file /etc/hostname

ROS

If I create publisher it's all OK, but subscriber is still wrong.
Do you know where is problem ?

A:

Problem solved.
The problem was in file .bashrc, where I had only

ROS_IP=10.0.0.139

when I write full command

export ROS_IP=10.0.0.139

all will be OK. I recognise by this code in shell

python -c "import roslib.network; print roslib.network.get_address_override()"

because return NONE, what was wrong ...
