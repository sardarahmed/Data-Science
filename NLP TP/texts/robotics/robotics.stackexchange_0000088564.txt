Q:

Is it possible that the spawn service rotates the 2D frame of turtlesim?

The blue screen where the turtles appear has of course four angles. Is it true that the origin is in the left bottom angle, right???? because when I use the spawn service it seems to me that the origin changes. It this possible????

Solved! in the spawn command the parameters are not the real positions but the pixel of the screen
