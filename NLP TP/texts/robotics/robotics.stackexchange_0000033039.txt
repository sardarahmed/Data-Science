Q:

costmap_2d requires macros.h header to build

On a fresh checkout of diamondback-full on Lucid, I was unable to get costmap_2d to build. It kept complaining of not finding ROS_DEPRECATED and ROS_INLINE_FORCE. I was able to overcome this problem by including macros.h in every src/*.cpp file.
Is there a better way of getting a build? What am I doing wrong?
Update after Eric's comment: I followed the instructions here:http://www.ros.org/wiki/diamondback/Installation/Ubuntu. Generally I go to my desired packages and do a rosmake && make. My std_msgs failed to build , citing "Header.h" was absent. I resolved the issue by manually copying msg_gen/include../Header.h to std_msgs/include. rosconsole had an unmet dependency of rostime, which I added in the manifest.xml and rebuilt.

What cpp files did you have to add the include to?

Could you include the command you used to checkout diamondback-full and what commands you are using to build everything? Were there any errors building other parts of diamondback-full?
