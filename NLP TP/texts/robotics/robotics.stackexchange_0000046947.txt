Q:

compile turtlebot in groovy on gumstix

Hello world,
I am trying to compile the turtlebot software from source on my gumstix. I do not really have a problem with it, I just want to know if I am doing it the right way, because it is a very slow way. I manually scroll through the dependencies for turtlebot, locate the source and check if I can compile it with catkin. Then I add it to wstool, download the source and catkin_make it. Since compiling on the gumstix is really slow, I am not done yet, but I would like to know if there is a smarter way. Maybe a way to resolve all dependencies and find out which sources are catkinized and which have to be built in the rosbuild workspace?
I also did not get PCL to compile :(
Thanks a lot in advance
Kai

A:

I guess the best way is to use the generator. It looks like it will only generate wet packages. So if you want to add the pcl_ros package, you can go to your src folder and type
wstool merge http://packages.ros.org/web/rosinstall/generate/raw/groovy/pcl_ros
wstool update
