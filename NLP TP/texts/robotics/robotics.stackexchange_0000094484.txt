Q:

Euclidean Cluster Detect - Parameter description

Hi all,
I was wondering where I can find any documentation on lidar_euclidean_cluster_detect package developed in autowre. I can get it work just fine but I would like to read any publications about it as I am dealing with specific parameters now, any papers etc.
Thanks!

A:

Please see the README in the folder for the package (https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.ai/core_perception/tree/master/lidar_euclidean_cluster_detect). Each package should (but does not always) have a README similar to this one.

Thanks, I was looking more for the theory behind it e.g. publications. the ReadMe seems to be informative for parameters only.

@cassini.hyugens - The README also includes a "References" section which describes the PCL functions that are used and their theory of operation.
