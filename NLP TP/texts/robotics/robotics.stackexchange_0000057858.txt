Q:

Kinect "no device connected" error in openni.launch after openni-dev package upgrade

Hi,
I'm using turtlebot on ROS electric on ubuntu 11.04.
The openni-dev package was recently updated from version 1.1.0.41~natty to 1.3.2.1-4~natty2.
After this update, the openni.launch process gives the error "No device connected.. Waiting for devices to be connected". Its not able to initialize.
I tried to downgrade the openni-dev version using the command:
"sudo apt-get install openni-dev=1.1.0.41~natty", but it says that the version was not found. I have also tried replacing the entries in the source.list files for apt to "old-releases.ubuntu.com", but it still didn't work.
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks.

You should be aware that ROS electric is quite old and a lot of the packages deprecated

A:

I resolved the issue by un-installing the openni-dev package, which also removed the dependencies - nite-dev, ps-engine,  ros-electric-turtlebot, ros-electric-turtlebot-desktop, ros-electric-turtlebot-robot, ros-electric-turtlebot-viz, ros-electric-openni-kinect. And then re-installing these packages.
The openni.launch process is working fine now.
