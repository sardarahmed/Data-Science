Q:

error when installing ROS on Ubuntu 12.04

I have Ubuntu 12.04 and trying to install ROS using this tutorial
http://www.ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Installation/Ubuntu
when trying this command
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu precise main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
found error :
sudo: unable to change to sudoers gid: Operation not permitted
sudo: setresuid() [0, 0, 0] -> [116, -1, -1]: Operation not permitted

A:

Is your user account member of the group "admin"? By default ubuntu grants permission to execute sudo to users of that group.
Otherwise, this might help you. Apparently, updating ubuntu and restarting the computer solved a similar issue for another ubuntu user.
Good luck.
