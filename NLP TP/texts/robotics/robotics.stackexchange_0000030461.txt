Q:

Analyzing ROS messages

Is there a command that will allow me to see what is stored in specific messages? I know rxgraph shows where everything is going but is there something similar to what is being sent?

A:

You can use rostopic to print the contents of a message to standard output. For example,
rostopic echo /camera/image_raw

will echo the full contents of the /camera/image_raw topic. If the message contains binary data, such as with Image, this will likely cause problems with your terminal emulator. In those cases it is useful to only echo the fields of interest:
rostopic echo /camera/image_raw/width /camera/image_raw/height

I don't believe that there is a graphical (rx...) analog rostopic.

The graphical version of "rostopic echo" is "rxplot".

Very good point. I never thought of RViz as a method of seeing the contents of a message, but that is its sole purpose.

Perhaps rviz would be the graphical analogy of rostopic?
