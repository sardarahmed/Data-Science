Q:

gazebo plugin with ros electric

I have a problem creating a Gazebo plugin for ros electric. 
On the Wiki I can only find the tutorial for Ros Fuerte, but I should use elctric.
Anyone can help me?

Hi,
ROS Electric comes with an old version of Gazebo, which uses controllers not plugins.

Some reading material: this this.
Although maybe you can install from source a newer version of Gazebo (>1.0) which is better documented and easier to use. I'm not sure though if it will work with electric.
Cheers,
