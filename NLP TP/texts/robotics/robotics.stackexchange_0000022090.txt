Q:

Can I find the end effector position from joint velocities?

I would like to know if I can find the end effector position according to joint velocities. I have found joint velocities of a manipulator. I need to check if it is correct. So I need to know that how can I combine joints veloties and the end effector postion. Thank you in advance.

A:

No, you cannot determine the end effector position by using only joint velocities.  If you use the Jacobian matrix, you can determine the velocity vector of the end effector given a set of joint velocities.  If you have a finite time over which the joint velocities were measured, you can know how much the end effector has moved in that short time.  But unless you have a starting position, the joint velocities are insufficient for determining end effector position.
However, if you do know the forward kinematics as well as the joint velocities, you can use $\dot{x} = \mathrm{J} \dot{\theta}$ to determine incremental end effector motion.
