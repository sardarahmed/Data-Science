Q:

Angular velocities and rotation matrices

Let us assume I have an object O with axis $x_{O}$, $y_{O}$, $z_{O}$, with different orientation from the global frame S with $x_{S}$, $y_{S}$, $z_{S}$ (I don't care about the position).
Now I know the 3 instantaneous angular velocities of the object O with respect to the same O frame, that is $\omega_O^O = [\omega_{Ox}^O \omega_{Oy}^O \omega_{Oz}^O]$.
How can I obtain this angular velocity with respect to the global frame (that is $\omega_O^S$)?
Thank you!

A:

If your object $O$ has a different orientation from your global frame $S$, and you know what that difference in orientation is, you can create a 4x4 transform matrix between the two:
$$
T = \left[ \begin{array}{cc}
 R & s \\
0 & 1 \end{array} \right]
$$
where $R$ is the 3x3 rotation matrix, $s$ is the 3x1 translation vector, $0$ is a 1x3 row of zeros, and $1$ is just 1. You can transform your (points, angular velocities, etc.) from one frame to another with:
$$
\left[ \begin{array}{c}
x' \\
y' \\
z' \\
1 \end{array}
\right] = \left[ \begin{array}{cc}
R & s \\
0 & 1 \end{array} \right] \left[ \begin{array}{c}
x \\
y \\
z \\
1 \end{array} \right]
$$
If you don't care about translation you can just set 
$s = \left[ \begin{array}
00 \\ 
0 \\
0 \\ \end{array} \right]$
