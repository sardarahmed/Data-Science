Q:

Merge multiple maps in kinetic

How do you merge multiple maps (generated by map_server map_saver) to form a single map?
I want to generate a single map of a building with high accuracy. Then I will use the map in AMCL for localization

Place the LIDAR in a known position
Generate the scan map using gmapping with the known position
Move to a new known position by moving the LIDAR manually
Repeat 2 until the entire building is mapped
Merge the maps to a single map

I'm serching for live map merging at the moment. I use multirobot_map_merger at the moment. (Works not well till the moment for me).
But https://github.com/ahhda/Map-Merge-Tool may help you. It's made to merge two map pictures.
