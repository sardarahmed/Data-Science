Q:

Why Make Bipedal Robots?

A friend and colleague of mine who studies robotics says that bipedal robots present much greater challenges for stability and locomotion than those with more legs.
So why is there so much effort to develop bipedal robots?  Are there any practical advantages?
Of course, I see the advantage of having arm-like free appendages, but it seems like 4 legs and 2 arms would generally be a better design.

A:

I would say:

Compactness of the structure: imagine humanoid robots that are required to operate in household environment: two-legged robots might have less difficulties in navigating among tables and chairs standing very close each other.
Energy consumption: of course the power needed increases proportionally with the number of legs.
Human likeness: an aspect that we don't have to neglect if one day we want to have robots among us, both for social reasons and technological reasons. Regarding the latter, generally speaking, copying the human body entails a number of benefits for robots that are designed to act in human context: this applies equivalently to the robot upper-body (e.g. manipulation) and to its lower-body (e.g. locomotion).

A:

In addition to the reasons given by Ugo, studying humanoid robots in general helps in the medical field too.

Trying to understand what sensors/systems robots need helps us understand what sensors/systems we use
If we can make a fully functioning humanoid robot, then individual parts such as an arm or a leg can be converted to a better functioning prosthetic limb for people.

And one more reason I can think of

Why study anything hard? All the subproblems worked on by individual researchers can be easily applied to other types of robots.
