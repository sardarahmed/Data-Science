Q:

pr2 gazebo headless not working

Hello all,
I am having a trouble with launching pr2 gazebo headless version.
I tried to launch launch/pr2.launch in pr2_gazebo package. It stops responding or  publishes broken tf messages. pr2_empty_world.launch works just fine but pr2.launch.
Does anybody know what is going on? It seems like the recent update broke the package.

It doesn't seem that there are any messages published on /tf

view_frame showed me that a broken tf tree. some tf messages are missing and unconnected. BTW, I got the headless working. I had to launch the gazebo empty_world with setting argument "gui" false.

I just did roslaunch pr2_gazebo pr2.launch with newly installed desktop in precise-fuerte.

Thanks, ticketed (https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issue/9/headless-mode-is-not-working)

A:

Yes, I can confirm the ros released code 1.6.12 is indeed broken, but the gazebo trunk has been fixed. I am waiting to resolve some other issues with the trunk before making another patch release.  Thanks.
