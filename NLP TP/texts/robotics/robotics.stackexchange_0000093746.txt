Q:

Boost error: ‘f’ cannot be used as a function

I encountered a really strange error. I am writing a really simple code. Mostly still empty and just learning how to write node in C++. My code consist of 3 files.
RoverMove.cpp
#include "rover_move/rover_move.h"

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
   ros::init(argc, argv, "RoverMove");
   ros::NodeHandle n;
   ros::Subscriber goal_sub;
   ros::Publisher vel_pub;

   goal_sub = n.subscribe<geometry_msgs::Twist>("goal", 1, "goal_call_back");
   vel_pub = n.advertise<geometry_msgs::Twist>("cmd_vel", 1);
   ros::spin();
   return 0;
}

rover_move.h
#include "ros/ros.h"
#include"geometry_msgs/Twist.h"

#ifndef ROVER_MOVE_H
#define ROVER_MOVE_H

void goal_call_back(geometry_msgs::Twist goal);

#endif /* ROVER_MOVE_H */

RoverMoveLib.cpp
#include "rover_move/rover_move.h"

void goal_call_back(geometry_msgs::Twist goal){
// still empty 
}

I have input necessary config in CMake file and I got this error:

Can anyone help me why this happened? I just want to try a simple code. Publishing and subscribng to Twist type message.

It would help if you edit your question and add the contents of your CMakeLists.txt file. Please copy and paste that file and any terminal output into code blocks, that makes it easier to read, search, and copy/paste.

A:

One problem is that when you declare your subscriber you are putting the callback function in double quotes. Try to change from
goal_sub = n.subscribe<geometry_msgs::Twist>("goal", 1, "goal_call_back");

to
goal_sub = n.subscribe<geometry_msgs::Twist>("goal", 1, goal_call_back);

this works! thanks. I made a mistake quoting the function name.
