Q:

I am writing data of turtlebot movement, and I want to write a paper. How can I get the data?

Hello. I am a ROS beginner. I am doing SLAM of turtlebot 2 in the ubuntu 14.04, ros (indigo) personal computer environment.
I need the following data to write a paper.
How can I get the data?
(In navigation, I want data from RViz where I specified the goal point myself)

The global map and the trajectory that the robot actually moved in the global map

Movement distance and travel time from the start point to the goal point

Data for making graphs of speed and distance, speed and time

that's all.
What should I do?rosbag?
Thank you.

A:

You should record a rosbag of all your runs so that you can playback your data whenever you want, even if you can't use your robot. Plus, this has the added benefit of recording your trajectories and setpoints that you send to your robot as well. Then you can focus on visualizing and analyzing your data without any pressure of getting it right while doing an experiment.

thank you!!I want to use rosbag to make robot destinations every time. However, it does not work if you record and play it with this. why?rosbag record /move_base_simple/goal

Try
rosbag record -O subset /move_base_simple/goal

to record only a subset of topics and see the rosbag tutorials

You can certainly record. Looking at rostopic echo /move_base_simple/goal during playback. The topic has been submitted. However, the robot does not move.

Ok, well that problem can't be answered without more information which would be out of scope for this question. You should create a new question for the new problem.
