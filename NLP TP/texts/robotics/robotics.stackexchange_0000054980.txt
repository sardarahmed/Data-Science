A:

You could use geometry_msgs/Vector3Stamped
$ rosmsg show geometry_msgs/Vector3Stamped 
std_msgs/Header header
  uint32 seq
  time stamp
  string frame_id
geometry_msgs/Vector3 vector
  float64 x
  float64 y
  float64 z

You can browse messages with
rosmsg list

Publishing this as a topic is good described in the publisher and subscriber tutorial:

Do you mean an array of Vector3s?
Comment by ctguell on 2013-10-29:
@BennyRe no just a 2x1 array of floats

A quick look at rosmsg list shows you the message std_msgs/Float32MultiArray
