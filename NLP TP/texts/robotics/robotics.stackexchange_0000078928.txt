Q:

How do I feature a book on wiki.ros.org/Books

Can someone help me create a book page like http://wiki.ros.org/Books/ROS_Robotics_By_Example to be posted on http://wiki.ros.org/Books to feature a book

A:

The ROS wiki is just that, a wiki, so anyone (with an account) can create pages like that.
The procedure would be:

register for an account
request editing access (ros-infrastructure/roswiki#139 ros-infrastructure/roswiki#258 now)
create a new page
link to it from the Books page
