Q:

AMCL doesn't need a static map?

Does AMCL work well without a static map?
I applied nav stack to my own robot and it apparently works well.
However, rxgraph shows that AMCL doesn't use static map served by map_server.
The map is used only by move_base.
I think that MCL (not AMCL) requires a static map and
AMCL is designed by improving MCL regarding a computational cost.
AMCL doesn't need it?
Thanks in advance.

A:

The amcl package requires a map either by subscribing to the topic, or calling the service to get the map

Thank you. I didn't know the parameter "use_static_map" and it can switch whether the static map is used or not.
