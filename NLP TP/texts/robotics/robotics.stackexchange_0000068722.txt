Q:

ROSARIA catkin_make error

I am trying to install ROSARIA package in my laptop. I have been using Ubuntu 14.04 and using ROS indigo. I follow the tutorial How to use ROSARIA.  But when I try to use catkin_make to build rosaria package I am getting the following error message.

A:

This looks like the RosAria.cfg file is not exectuable. This is required for dynamic_reconfigure to work.
So do a
chmod a+x /home/fan/catkin_ws/src/rosaria/cfg/RosAria.cfg

and try again.

Oops, my fault.  I've now fixed it in the repository, anyone encountering this can pull from it again, or just manually fix it as in migs answer.   Thanks!
