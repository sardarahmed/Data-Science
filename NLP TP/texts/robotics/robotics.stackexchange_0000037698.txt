Q:

Turtlebot Dashboard Warning : diagnostic_aggregator

I am receiving a warning from my Turtlebot Dashboard:
Node: /diagnostic_aggregator
Time: 1328731882.669506934
Severity: Warn
Location: /tmp/buildd/ros-electric-diagnostics-1.6.1/debian/ros-electric-diagnostics/opt/ros/electric/stacks/diagnostics/diagnostic_aggregator/src/analyzer_group.cpp:AnalyzerGroup::init:109
Published Topics: /rosout

Analyzer specification should now include the package name. You are using a deprecated API. Please switch from GenericAnalyzer to diagnostic_aggregator/GenericAnalyzer in your Analyzer specification.

Does anyone have an idea of what is causing this warning, and how to fix it?  Thank you very much!

A:

In your diagnostic_aggregator parameters, instead of:
type: AnalyzerGroup

change it to:
type: diagnostic_aggregator/AnalyzerGroup
