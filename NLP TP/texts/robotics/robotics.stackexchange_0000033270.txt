Q:

localization in crowd environment

Hi everybody,
I'm trying to figure out how to achieve robust navigation in crowded environment.
I'm using a 2-d laser scanner and amcl algorithm. Is somebody facing the same problem?
Are there any other stacks/tools in ROS that address this situation?
My idea is to filter people and other moving objects from the scan, setting the occluded rays to max range and then to pass this filtered scan to the amcl.
Has anybody already tried this solution? Can anybody give me a hint about it?
Thanks in advance!

A:

There's substantial scientific literature on this; the short answer is that it's tricky, but good techniques exist. There's no up-to-date ROS package for doing this.
