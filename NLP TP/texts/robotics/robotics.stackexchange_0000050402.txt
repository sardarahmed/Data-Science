Q:

Problem installing openni kinect in ROS Fuerte on Ubuntu 12.04

Hello, I'm having problems installing the openni kinect driver for ROS fuerte, when I type this:
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-openni-kinect
It gives me the following message:
"Los siguientes paquetes tienen dependencias incumplidas:
ros-fuerte-openni-kinect : Depende: ros-fuerte-openni-camera (= 1.8.6-s1363175083~precise) pero no va a instalarse
Depende: ros-fuerte-openni-launch (= 1.8.3-s1363200146~precise) pero no va a instalarse
Depende: ros-fuerte-openni-tracker (= 0.1.3-s1363160164~precise) pero no va a instalarse
Depende: libopenni-dev pero no va a instalarse
Depende: libopenni-nite-dev pero no va a instalarse
E: No se pudieron corregir los problemas, usted ha retenido paquetes rotos. "
Well, it is in spanish, but basically it is saying that this application depends on that programs but they are not going to be installed because "you have broken packages". What is wrong? I have installed the Full ROS Fuerte package with its repositories, coculd it be a problem with the repositories? may I need another repositories in order to install Openni kinect libraries? Thanks a lot!

I managed to install openni_camera but no success for openni_launch

A:

you may install the dependencies by hand, i.e sudo apt-get install ...
if you then encountered another dependencies problem, do that again. by tracing down the dependencies which are missing, you may finally resolve the problem. at least i solve such problems in this way. hope it will help
