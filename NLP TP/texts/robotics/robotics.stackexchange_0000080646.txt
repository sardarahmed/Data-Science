Hi @peter_cz
You can find it at the link below.

All details of the OpenCR board that are necessary for the users who want to make it by themselves, including the Schematics, the PCB Gerber, the BOM and the Firmware source are fully opened under the open-source licenses for the user and the ROS community. :)
