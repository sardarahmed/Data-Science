Thank you for help!

A:

I use the ROS package "kinect_aux" to control the motor and the LED.
And also to get the IMU data.

Thanks, how can I install this package? I use ROS electric and only found it for diamondback.

I install the package for ROS diamondback, it works.

FYI - I found the source at git://github.com/ros-pkg-git/kinect.git, and the kinect_aux part still compiled.  I don't know how to install the old package.

What do you mean with "install"?
Comment by Jon Stephan on 2013-02-21:
I meant I don't know how to install it with apt-get.  I suppose I'd have to add the old diamondback repository and I guess I could look that up.  The point of my comment was actually to post the link to the source repository, which wasn't on the wiki.

As far as I know there is no repository with kinect_aux for fuerte or groovy. The old diamondback repository will not work, the package muss be compiled for/with fuerte.

Ah.  Ok.  I added a link to the git repo on the wiki page.
