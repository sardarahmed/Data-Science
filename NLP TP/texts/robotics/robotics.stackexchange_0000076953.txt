Q:

Recommendations for a hardy, IP67 arm

Hi,
I'm looking for an IP67 arm for a mobile robot in a harsh environment. Some other wishes are:

ROS compatability
Small controller (must fit on a ~900mm x 900mm platform)
Reach >500mm
At least 5 DOF

So far, I've just found the Fanuc LR Mate 200iD and possibly an Oceaneering Terabot. But I think the Fanuc's controller is huge. Any other suggestions? Thanks in advance!

Not an answer, but the Fanuc R-30iB Mate controller would actually seem to fit your constraints: regular cabinet is 470x402x400mm (WxDxH) max, OpenAir is even smaller: 370x350x356mm (WxDxH) max. They're 40 and 20 Kg respectively. Which controller have you seen?

Control interfaces offered by the Terabot are way better than those for the Fanuc though. External motion control on Fanucs is not too good. But do ask Fanuc about that.

Thank you for the advice, @gvdhoorn! I got a quote from Fanuc and the price seems good (better than I expected). Unfortunately the smallest controller is not available so it would be the 470x402x400mm one. Can you tell me more about the weaknesses of the ROS-I Fanuc driver?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2016-10-31:
It's not the ros-i driver per se: Fanucs just don't really have options for external motion control, when compared to vendors like KUKA, ABB, Denso, Mitsubishi, etc. All those vendors have 100Hz+ joint position control at least. The closest thing Fanuc has is something called DPM ..
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2016-10-31:
.. Dynamic Path Modification. But that is Cartesian only, and is really limited. With sufficient time & effort, DPM could perhaps be used to create an external interface with sufficient performance, but even then, it would only be position control. Velocity, effort or impedance are not possible ..

.. at least not when you want to exert any influence over it from an external entity. Everything as far as I know of course, but I've spent some time looking into this. If you can prove me wrong, please do so, as it would allow me to improve the ROS-I driver as well. If you have the option, ..

.. and you want to control your robot externally (which I suspect you want to do, as you list "ROS compatibility"), then, if you want to stay with industrial robots, I'd go with any of the other vendors.

An example: the KUKA Agilus (KR 3, 6, 10, etc) are IP67, and when used with RSI, have a proper (250Hz) position control interface. ROS-I pkg: kuka_experimental.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2016-10-31:
Apparently they have a waterproof version of the Agilus: KR AGILUS Waterproof.
I'd really like you to use Fanuc, but depending on your requirements, other mfgs might be more realistic right now.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2016-10-31:
Please ask Fanuc about their external motion control options btw. It'd be nice if I'm completely wrong.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2016-10-31:
O, and I'm assuming you'd want some sort of reactive control here. For simple pick-and-place type work, the current driver is ok (but could still certainly be improved).

A:

I appreciate @gvdhoorn's advice. We were leaning towards a Fanuc LR Mate until finding that UR sells protective suits. And we already know and love UR's ROS interface, so I think we'll go with that.

Thanks for letting us know what you eventually chose.

And we already know and love UR's ROS interface [..]

Just to clarify: you mean the ROS driver(s) that exist(s) for UR hw. UR had no hand in them :).
