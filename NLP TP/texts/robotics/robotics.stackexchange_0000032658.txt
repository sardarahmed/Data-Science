Q:

Find the intersection between my robot model and a line

I have a given line and I know this lines intersects the PR2.
The line always intersects the robot at the same link (forearm).
I want to know WHERE this line intersects the PR2.
What is a good approach to do that?
Is there for a example a method which gives me the triangles for a link?

A:

There is code in the motion_planning_common stack which does this. Have a look at the robot_self_filter package. It contains a "shadow filter" which can detect if a sensor ray is occluded by the links of a robot - afaik it performs raycasting and detects the intersection with the mesh model, which is what you would need.
