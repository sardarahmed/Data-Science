Q:

Problem with teleop

Hi all,
My teleop didnt work properly in my electric installation. I got the command velocity info that I passed to husky A200. But the problem was, husky didnt move a bit. So I tried to replace the below mentioned three packages with another set of same packages in opt/ros/electric/stacks:-

clearpath_common

clearpath_husky

clearpath_kinect

I also rosmaked all of them. It all went error free. But, when I tried to run:-

roslaunch husky_teleop teleop.launch

It gave me this error :-

ERROR: cannot launch node of type [clearpath_teleop/teleop.py]: Cannot locate node of type [teleop.py] in package [clearpath_teleop]

But the node is present, when I checked the location. I also tried to replace the new ones with my old packages. But still the same error persisted.
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks in advance

A:

Are you sure that clearpath_teleop is in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH? Try with roscd clearpath_teleop.
Also, I don't believe this will solve the problem you had according to your previous question. Did you try fixing what I assume to be a networking problem? Otherwise, this node won't work either.
