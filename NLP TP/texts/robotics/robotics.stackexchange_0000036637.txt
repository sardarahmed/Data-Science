Q:

How can I change a map while ROS is running?

Hi,
right now I am navigating through a map.
But I want to change this map while ROS is running due to a floor change.
Is there a way, for example in C++, to change the map in code?
regards
max

A:

If you're using Electric, the navigation stack supports dynamic_reconfigure. That's probably the easiest way to do what you want to do.
If you're using Diamondback, you might have a lot more difficulty. Most of the parameters of move_base in Diamondback are a one-time read, and thus require a restart of the node to re-initialize.

Dynamic reconfigure can be done with C++. costmap_2d is a good example if you're looking to see some code implemented.

If using a C++ node is there a way to use dynamic_reconfigure to change the map? So far I have only been able to do that from Python.
