Q:

Bug when adding a 6th comment?

Does anyone have the same odd behaviour, when adding a 6th comment to a question as in
this example?
Usually after 5 comments, you see a "see more"-like link.

When I post the 6th comment, it does not appear.
Once I post another 7th comment, the 6th and 7th comment appear.
If I delete the 7th comment again, the 6th comment also disappears.
I can readd and delete the 6th comment be readding and deleting a 7th comment multiple times.

I obviously tried reloading the page after posting the comments. It doesn't change anything.
Is it just me or a bug for anyone else, maybe upstream?
Edit: I can see exactly 6 comments by Erik Perko. This question is a bit problematic as commenting properly doesn't allow testing ;)
Edit: Sorry for abusing the other question, but it seems solved.
Can anyone see a 6th comment to the original question by me as:
"Can you put a minimal python script in the same location as the script in question. Just the #! and a printout. If that rosruns (what I'd expect) its some problem in your code. - dornhege (9 hours ago)"
I deleted the 7th comment again and it does not appear for me. Can others see it?

A:

Seems to be working for me... I just added those 6 test comments to this question. After adding the 6th one, I saw it show up (but no show more link). I then refreshed and I saw the first 5 comments and a show more link. Seems to be working for me. Maybe there's something to reproduce it that I missed?
Also, anyone, feel free to delete all of my test comments in order to test for yourselves.
UPDATE: I cannot see the specific comment on the other question. I suppose this is a bug then...

The askbot guys are requesting to retry this bug with 0.7.7.
Comment by tfoote on 2011-07-22:
I'm planning to upgrade soon.  Hopefully this will be fixed.
Comment by tfoote on 2011-07-02:
Now I only see 5 on the page.
Comment by Eric Perko on 2011-07-01:
Same here. Only 5 comments. Still on the linked example question.
Comment by dornhege on 2011-07-01:
OK, that's weird. Is it account specific? For me the linked question still has 5 comments.
Comment by tfoote on 2011-06-30:
I can see your 6th comment and I could add a 7th too.
Comment by Eric Perko on 2011-06-30:
Deleted. Maybe only the poster or people with ROS Answers super-powers can delete them ;)
Comment by dornhege on 2011-06-30:
I think others can't delete them. Maybe they need to be mixed? I can still reproduce it on the other question...
