Q:

problem with plugin in gazebo

Hi
i was trying to spawn again a urdf model that I spawned a lot allready but today it isn't recognizing the plugin
any ideas?
the plugin that is doing it-
<gazebo>
    <controller:gazebo_ros_controller_manager name="gazebo_ros_controller_manager" plugin="libgazebo_ros_controller_manager.so">
      <alwaysOn>true</alwaysOn>
      <updateRate>1000.0</updateRate>
      <interface:audio name="gazebo_ros_controller_manager_dummy_iface" />
   </controller:gazebo_ros_controller_manager>
  </gazebo>

edit5: I made a different urdf file and it wasn't willing to spawn it either.
can i get this plugin to work a different way?
Thanks
yesterday it did work fine
edit4: I reinstalled  all of ros and it still isn't spawning
i am getting this message--
Dbg plugin model name: bob
[ INFO] [1347535810.546163240, 391.723000000]: starting gazebo_ros_controller_manager plugin in ns: /
[ INFO] [1347535810.546328843, 391.723000000]: Callback thread id=0x7f2a0c10f010

How should i get it to work??
the error is
Error [Plugin.hh:101] Failed to load plugin libgazebo_ros_controller_manager.so: libgazebo_ros_controller_manager.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

edit1: i was able to copy that file into the directory, somehow i have two directories of  pr2_gazebo_plugins. now it doesn't say it can't find the plugin, just writes -- loading model xml from file
[INFO] [WallTime: 1347451924.654210] [0.000000] waiting for service /gazebo/spawn_urdf_model

w/o nothing happening.
am I missing files? (gazebo spawns other models like pr2 etc.)
edit2:
If I first did --roslaunch pr2_examples_gazebo single_link.launch-- then exited and then again launched gazebo, it was able to spawn the model but the topic about joint states thought that my joint was the same as the single link model.
edit3: I did these commands--
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo apt-get install --reinstall ros-fuerte-pr2-simulator 

and the same thing happened, the model is not spawned.
Thanks

A:

If libgazebo_ros_controller_manager.so does not exist in
ls `rospack find pr2_gazebo_plugins`/lib

then you need to compile the plugins:
rosmake pr2_gazebo_plugins

Alternatively, if you installed from deb, do
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo apt-get install --reinstall ros-fuerte-pr2-simulator

If the debian installed version runs correctly, you might want to remove your local copy of `pr2_simulator` path from `ROS_PACKAGE_PATH`.
Is there a reason you want to check out pr2_simulator locally and compile from source?

I guess it finds it, I mean nothing happens. if I change a bit the name i get an error [rospack] Error: stack/package pr2_gazebo_plugin not found. i also am able to roscd into pr2_gazebo_plugins

It finds it but can't see what is inside. if i wrote - ls rospack find pr2_gazebo_plugins/src - so it gave me the files inside but with ls rospack find pr2_gazebo_plugins/lib- it didn't show a thing. how can i fix it? Thanks

Try: rosmake pr2_gazebo_plugins
