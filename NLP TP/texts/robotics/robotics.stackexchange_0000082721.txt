Q:

Apply /statistics topic without rqt gui

Hi there,
I want to collect statistics on the ROS system. I noticed the topic '/statistics' which is available when I apply rqt gui.
Someone knows if there is a way to apply /statistics topic without rqt gui (rqt_graphprofiler plugin)?
Thanks in advance

A:

The statistics topic is a topic, the rqt gui just provides a convenient way to visualise the contents.
You should be able to access the same data by subscribing to the topic.
