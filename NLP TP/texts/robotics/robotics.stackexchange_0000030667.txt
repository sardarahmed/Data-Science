Q:

Should rviz have a segmentation fault with other nodes are stopped? e.g. openni_camera launch

Hi,
I'm using diamondback and rviz has segmentation faults often whenever I kill another node.
Should I expect this whenever stopping a node that was publishing a topic that rviz is subscribed to?
E.g.: I run roscore in one terminal, openni_camera openni_node.launch, and rviz from another terminal.  I can view the /camera/rgb/points topic in rviz fine.  However, if I stop the openni_node.launch, rviz segfaults.
Is there anything I can do to change the rosrun / roslaunch settings to prevent this?  It would be helpful to not have to restart rviz everytime I want to stop a node to debug something.
Thanks.

Could you make sure to include which version of Ubuntu you are running on and what video drivers? There is a known bug with certain versions of Nvidia drivers on 10.10 that causes anything linked against OpenGL to crash. See https://code.ros.org/lurker/message/20110204.151901.a4e1d645.en.html .

Thanks, Eric, for pointing out the thread on the drivers issue.
I upgraded drivers from NVIDIA 260.19.06 to NVIDIA 260.19.44, and that solved the issue.

I can confirm that the launchpad approach also works to fix this issue.

I updated by downloading and installing the driver from the Nvidia website: http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us .  Someone also pointed me to https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-x-swat/+archive/x-updates as an alternative to installing from the website, but I haven't tried it myself.

Can you explain how you updated the Nvidia driver to 260.19.44? Did you download it from their site, or update something that made Ubuntu pull in the newest driver?
