Q:

Publish and subscribe Using Joint_state_publisher for real robot

hello guys,
I'd like to ask you some question about using joint_state_publisher for real robot. I'm using arm robot and I want to control it using joint_state_publisher. but I have a question :

how to visualize and control real robot (especially manipulator) movement by RViz (not moveit)?
I still confuse about JointState and can I using it to get Pose (with geometry_msgs)?

thank you!

A:

Which robot/manipulator are you using? Provided that there is a driver available, you need a URDF of your robot to visualize it in RVIZ (http://wiki.ros.org/urdf).
You can use the robot_state_publisher (http://wiki.ros.org/robot_state_publisher) to track the joint positions of your robot.
For coordinate system transformation, you can use tf2 (http://wiki.ros.org/tf2), which is already available by using the previously mentioned packages. You can get the pose of a specific joint or tcp by looking up the Transformation in tf.
To control the robot through a GUI, you can use the joint_state_publisher_gui package (The joint_state_publisher with the argument use_gui worked for me as well, but it seems to be deprecated now).
Maybe  this question is helpful for you.
