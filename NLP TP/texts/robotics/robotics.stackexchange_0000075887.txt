A:

You can use the Kinect v2 with ROS: Take a look at iai_kinect2 from https://github.com/code-iai/iai_kinect2. You need also libfreenect2, a driver for linux for kinect v2 from here https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect2.
Just follow the installation guide on the github pages. First install libfreenect2 and make sure it works correctly. Kinect v2 only works on USB 3.0 interfaces. After that install the ros bridge iai_kinect2.
Once the pipeline is set up, you can display the colored pointcloud in rviz :-)
