If you observed an error or warning message, I would suggest to include it, verbatim, in your question text.
That might help others figure out why it's not working for you.

A:

See this question. Xacro in ROS2 does not seem to support the package tag. Try using <mesh filename="file://$(robot_description)/meshes/base.stl"/> instead.
