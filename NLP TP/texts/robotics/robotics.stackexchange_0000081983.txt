Q:

MoveIt! Attach end-effector and fix UR5 arm to the wall

Hello,
I am looking for a way to attach end-effector to the UR5 arm I have tried setup assistant but I have not succeeded.
My second problem is setting up the environment for the UR5 arm. The arm needs to be fixed on the wall of the cage which is constraining the arm movement.
Any suggestions would be appreciated.
Thanks.

A:

You could have a look at tams_ur5 and tams_ur5_setup for a complete urdf+moveit configuration that includes a ur5 arm.
In case you want to try it out: we use a custom fork of the universal_robot description because they didn't want to merge our change upstream: https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/pull/267
To tackle your problem, you have to write your own urdf(/xacro) to describe a setup. The UR5 is just one piece of it then.
Afterwards you can run the setup assistant to generate a moveit configuration from it.
