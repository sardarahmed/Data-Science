Q:

Which package should I use in CMakeLists.txt?

I want to use the MoveIt! package on ROS indigo, and I am following the tutorial at http://docs.ros.org/hydro/api/pr2_moveit_tutorials/html/planning/src/doc/move_group_interface_tutorial.html.
As an example of how to use MoveIt! in C++, the tutorial provides the following line:
moveit::planning_interface::MoveGroup group("right_arm");

What I am trying to figure out, is how to actually compile this. So, I have built a new ROS package, and in the CMakeLists.txt file for that package, I need to specify where to look for header and library files. But how do I know the name of the package that is required for the above code?
If I look in /opt/ros/indigo/include, there are various directories such as  moveit, moveit_msgs, moveit_planners_ompl, and similarly in /opt/ros/indigo/lib and /opt/ros/indigo/share. Is each of these directories a package, or is each one a node, or something else?
After doing a bit of research, I found that the moveit::planning_interface::MoveGroup class from the above code is defined in /opt/ros/indigo/include/moveit/move_group_interface/move_group.h. This suggests to me that I should be using the moveit or move_group_interface packages, but if I try either of these, then it fails. For example, in my CMakeLists.txt file, if I have:
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS roscpp rospy std_msgs genmsg moveit)

And then I try to build my package, it tells me:
Could not find a package configuration file provided by "moveit"

And similarly for move_group_interface.
So I'm obviously a bit confused as to what ROS packages actually are, where they are stored on my machine, and how to know which one I should be referencing in CMakeLists.txt. Any help? Thanks :)

Isn't this a sort-of duplicate of Writing a simple CMakeLists.txt file for ROS?

That could be true. But I think the title of both questions are really evasive. Then, it could be hard to find is someone already asked this question. And theirs problems look different.

A:

I had same problem here : http://answers.ros.org/question/249354/how-to-install-move_group_interface-from-source/
The solution for move_group_interface is
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
   moveit_ros_planning_interface
   ..... 
)
