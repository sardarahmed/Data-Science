Q:

How to see rosparam on terminal screen?

I have recorded all data in rosbag. When I play it using command rosbag play <bag_name>, I want to see ros_parameters of  amcl. When I type rosparam list, it does not list any amcl related parameters. In fact it  list only following parameters

/rosdistro
/roslaunch/uris/host_ubuntu
3 /rosversion
4  /run_id
I want to get set and see amcl parameters. How to do it?

rosbag unfortunately does not store the parameters when you record a session, so there is no way to retrieve the parameters of amcl from your bag file.
