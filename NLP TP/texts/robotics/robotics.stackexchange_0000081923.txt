A:

Subsciber callbacks are called whenever new message arrives to the topics however you can print the frequency of messages by command: rostopic hz /topic_name
Hope it helps.

Hi Orko,
Thank you for your comment. I am thinking of finding rate at which subscriber call back function is executed. Is  it the same as "rostopic hz /topic_name" ?

Technically, yes (assuming your subscriber doesn't miss any message). You can test this simply printing the ros time inside the callback and then calculating frequency by 1/(consecutive ros time in secs). (I know it's a dummy way but it's simplest) It would give the same value with rostopic hz
