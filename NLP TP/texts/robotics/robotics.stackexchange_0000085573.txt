The launch file has a "publish_tf" argument, try with this argument set to false

I have tried hooking it upto RPI3 , same error .
I am now using a Nvidia Jetson TX1 , still the same error persists .
Any ideas on how to get around this problem ?

When i am trying to run gmapping , i get the following error .
Timed out waiting for transform from base_link to map to become available before running costmap, tf error: Could not find a connection between 'map' and 'base_link' because they are not part of the same tree.Tf has two or more unconnec

Thats a new question, also look at the mentioned log file.

A:

Your TF  tree is not fully connected. You need to publish the transformation between your base_link and camera _link

Had to set the tf on freenect.launch to not publish tf , that was conflicting with my robot tf.
