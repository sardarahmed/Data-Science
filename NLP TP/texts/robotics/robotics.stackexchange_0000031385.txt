Q:

Notification when a parameter in param server is changed

Is there any C++ utility to notice if a parameter in param server has changed instead of storing the value and keep checking it for changes continuously?

I'll have a look at it, but it is marked as unstable so I'm not sure it is resilient enough for what I need.

A colleague of mine used it with python and c++

Yes, but dynamic_reconfigure only works with Python, right?

If you expect changes during runtime, maybe you should use dynamic_reconfigure instead of the parameter server.

A:

You could periodically call getParamCached(). It caches the value locally and subscribes to the parameter server for notification in the event of updates. So, the polling overhead is minimal.
Or, use dynamic_reconfigure. Even though it's marked unstable, the basic interfaces are widely used and will probably be preserved in future distributions.

I don't know if I'm going nuts, but when I looked in the param.cpp code (in diamondback), I couldn't find where the cached params were being updated. Instead it looks for all the world like the normal params are being updated and the cached ones are not.
