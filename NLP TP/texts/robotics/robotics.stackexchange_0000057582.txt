Q:

convenience scripts for switching catkin workspaces

A while back I came across a post or mail of someone using some short bash script to conveniently source different setup.bash files. It was something along the lines of searching the home directory (up to a specified depth) for setup.bash files and then providing completion to switch to one of those workspaces.
I seem to be unable to find it again. I guess reimplementing it would not be too hard, but maybe something like this lying around in their .bashrc?
