Q:

Exchange air and maintain thermal insulation

My application is composting with worms outdoors inside an a styrofoam cooler.  I use a heat lamp and a thermo-electric cooler to maintain the temperature in the bin when the temperature outside is out of bounds for healthy worms.  When the temperature outside is in bounds, I'd like to exchange the air in the bin with fresh air from outside, but I don't want to permanently compromise the insulating properties of my bin with lots of air holes.  So I'm looking for actuator solutions that would allow me to open/close a window of sorts.  I'm considering a solenoid air valve but I don't necessarily need/want an air compressor - a simple fan is sufficient to circulate the air. Any suggestions?

This is no question of robotics... Keep it simple (:

These kinds of ducts open by the air pressure generated from a ventilator.
