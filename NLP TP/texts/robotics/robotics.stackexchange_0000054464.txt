Q:

synchronized problem related to calibration

Hello All.
I Am a rookie in Ros, I am using ros fuerte and a monocular camera. My
lapto's camera.
I want to know how many things I need to setup to make a retification image with image_proc package.
I already setup a launch file, I attached
But when I ran the image_view to display the image rectify, I got nothing.
And when I ran the image_view to display the image mono, it works.
So I want to know what things I have to setup to do a rectification image.
And what thing I did wrong.
I attached the rxgraph output, my launch file and my camera parameters
Besides I have a warning:
[image_transport] Topics '/Dava/image_mono' and '/Dava/gscam/camera_info' do not appear to be synchronized. In the last 10s:
Image messages received:      80
CameraInfo messages received: 80
Synchronized pairs:           0
I will appreciate any respond . Thank you

What is the output of rosconsole when you start your launch file?

I just uploaded

Apparently the camera information is not correctly synchronized, this may be a bug of gscam. Also, camera information may be incorrect and rejected, hence the lack of data. Can you copy and paste in your original question two or three outputs of this topic?

@Thomas this is a bug from the old (svn) version of gscam, and has been fixed for months in the released version.

A:

The code you are using is out of date. The sync bug has been fixed in the current released versions of gscam (0.1.1), the source versions of which can be found here: https://github.com/ros-drivers/gscam

Thank you. I will download it.
Final question,  one of these version works in ROS FUERTE, right?
Comment by jbohren on 2013-10-07:
Yes, gscam 0.1.1 can be built in a rosbuild-based workspace.

@Jbohren, thanks it work, I could see the rectify image. But I just have another problem, when I tried to Subscribed that topic (Image_rect) to another node (Viso2). It show again the sync msg (warning message). I don't know if I'm doing something wrong with the configuration with viso2 or is gscam
