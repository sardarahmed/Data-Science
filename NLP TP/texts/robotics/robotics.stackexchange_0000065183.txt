Q:

cannot launch node of type [A/B]: can't locate node B in package A

Hello,
I have this strange problem, where ROS seems not to be able to find my executables.
I have a catkin workspace with several packages. Using catkin_make, all of them are being built.
I source the devel/setup.bash file in my ~/.bashrc
I am using ROS indigo on Ubuntu 14.04
Upon launching a .launch file, most of the nodes start just fine, but for all nodes of one explicit package I get the error:

ERROR: cannot launch node of type
[packageA/nodeB]: can't locate node
[nodeB] in package [packageA]

Now, I have sourced the devel/setup.bash file, I can roscd packageA  and find . -executable shows me the subdirectories.
Using rosrun packageA nodeB gives me

[rosrun] Couldn't find executable
named preprocessing below
/home/user/catkin_ws/src/packageA

[rosrun] Found the following, but
they're either not files,

[rosrun] or
not executable:

[rosrun]    /home/user/catkin_ws/src/packageA/src/nodeB

Thoughts:

My setup is:
catkin_ws/src/packageA/src/nodeB/nodeB.cpp
<- could the subdirectory be a
problem? But I am pointing catkin to
the right directory in the
CMakeListis.cpp
I am sourcing 2
workspaces. The second one with the
--extend Flag. <- is this possibly
a source for trouble?

Also I don't seem to be the only one with this problem. See:

http://answers.ros.org/question/200891/cant-locate-node-naoqi_joint_states_cpp/
http://answers.ros.org/question/194708/cannot-launch-node-of-type/

Does anyone have any hints to what could be going wrong here?
Also, tell me if you need more Information. Thanks
UPDATE
Running the command catkin_find --without-underlays --libexec --share perception returns:

/opt/ros/indigo/share/perception

My package is called "perception" might this be a problem? Does it collide with a ros package? But if so, why did it never bring up an error until recently?
Running the same command on a different package returns:

/home/user/catkin_ws/devel/lib/navigation

/home/user/catkin_ws/devel/share/navigation

/home/user/catkin_ws/src/navigation

UPDATE2
Ohh... so now I was just playing around a little and commented out the other workspace in my .bashrc (the one with the extend flag). After that, I did a clean build and sourced. Now it's working again.
PS: I am using the --extend flag, because I am adding an extra Visualization/Debugging workspace that won't run on the robot but is only used on my machine.
I am trying to reproduce the error now, but uncommenting the other workspace again won't bring up the error anymore. Well anyway, I guess it's resolved for now.
Thanks @William for the help.

Hello, did you: source the bashrc file after editing it? Try running on the console: source .bashrc
Comment by cbandera on 2015-01-15:
Yes I did. And as stated above, it finds the other packages, but just not this one. I also tried a clean build...
Comment by William on 2015-01-15:
The other thing to add to your question is the output of catkin_find --without-underlays --libexec --share packageA.

You should create an answer and accept it or accept my answer. (I converted the relevant comment to an answer).

A:

Why are you doing the second source with --extend? I think this should work but it might be the source of your problem. Is the package you need in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH? Can rosrun locate other executables in this package?
