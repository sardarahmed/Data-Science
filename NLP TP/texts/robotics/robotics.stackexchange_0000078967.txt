Q:

moveit cant find GLEW -Solved. sources.list problem

Original Rosdep was done on the wrong directory by me.....sorry. This made it seem like it was a install issue, when it was not. Many thanks to gvdhoorn  who continues to attempt to sove these issues that are mostly due to my own inexperience.
Still working through the process.
SOLVED.
Attempting a build from source on a debian jessie installation, have rosdep all issues, yet it fails to build with an .....
CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake-3.0/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:343 {_FPHSA_FAILURE_MESSAGE}
Could not find GLEW (missing: GLEW_INCLUDE_DIR GLEW_LIBRARY)

Is this an env variable that should be set? ANY pointers would be helpful , thank you.
As the ever present and helpful (gvdhoorn) requested Here is the additional data :)  :
Below is where I Rosdep'd the src dir:
user1@hpdeb:~/ros_catkin_ws/src$ rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src --rosdistro indigo
executing command [sudo -H apt-get install freeglut3-dev]
[sudo] password for user1:

E: Unable to locate package freeglut3-dev
ERROR: the following rosdeps failed to install
  apt: command [sudo -H apt-get install freeglut3-dev] failed
user1@hpdeb:~/ros_catkin_ws/src$ 

Here is the command I used to build the source:
user1@hpdeb:~/ros_catkin_ws$ catkin_make install --extend /opt/ros/indigo --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

Here is where it seems to fail:

Can you try and see whether installing libglew-dev helps? If it does, then perhaps the build_depends of one of more packages need to be updated.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-02-16:
Could you also please include the complete error message? What you show is just a little bit of it.
Also: which specific package is complaining (that should also be shown in the full error message)?
And: is this on x86/amd64 or ARM?

Updated question with the requested error code.
Attempted to install libglew-dev... Here is the result:

Note, selecting 'libglu1-mesa-dev' instead of 'libglu-dev'
libglu1-mesa-dev is already the newest version.

A:

user1@hpdeb:~/ros_catkin_ws/src$ rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src --rosdistro indigo

executing command [sudo -H apt-get install freeglut3-dev]
...
E: Unable to locate package freeglut3-dev
ERROR: the following rosdeps failed to install
  apt: command [sudo -H apt-get install freeglut3-dev] failed

You haven't told us whether this is an ARM platform, but in any case: according to jessie/freeglut3-dev that pkg should be available for Debian Jessie.
I'm not entirely sure whether it will solve your problem, but perhaps you can try to find out why it won't install on your platform.
Continuing with building your workspace after rosdep has failed doesn't make sense to me: the dependency is required, so I'm not surprised that it won't successfully build.

freeglut3 is already the newest version.

freeglut3 set to manually installed.

The -dev package provides the files required, so having the regular freeglut3 package installed is not enough.

This is an xeon hp proliant server older gen. Originally I rosdeb'd the wrong directory and it came up successful. Having trouble installing freeglut3-dev. Should I be modifying the apt sources file to pull it from somewhere else?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-02-16:
Afaict from the page I linked to it should just be available from the regular Debian repositories. A manual invocation of apt-get install freeglut3-dev also fails?
Comment by w on 2017-02-16:
my sources.list had some issues, and I was able to apt-get freeglut3-dev.  now rosdep is looking for libfcl-0.5-dev
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-02-16:
Are you sure you are building indigo-devel?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-02-16:
So for my own understanding: what was the problem exactly? And how did you solve it?
