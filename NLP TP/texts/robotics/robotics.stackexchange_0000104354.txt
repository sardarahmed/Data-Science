Q:

franka_ros message meaning

Has anyone ever tried to understand the meaning of each parameter in FrankaState.msg? After reading the official documentation, I only understand some of them, such as O_T_EE and F_T_EE. What do the rest of these parameters mean and how do I find out?
Thanks!

A:

The explanation has been found in there.
EDIT:
O_T_EE: Measured end-effector pose in base frame.
O_T_EE_d: Last desired end-effector pose of motion generation in the base frame.
F_T_EE: End-effector frame pose in flange frame.
F_T_NE: Nominal end-effector frame pose in flange frame.
NE_T_EE: End-effector frame pose in nominal end-effector frame.
EE_T_K: Stiffness frame pose in end-effector frame.
m_ee: Configured mass of the end effector.
I_ee: Configured rotational inertia matrix of the end effector load with respect to center of mass.
F_x_Cee: Configured center of mass of the end effector load with respect to flange frame.
m_load: Configured mass of the external load.
I_load: Configured rotational inertia matrix of the external load with respect to center of mass.
F_x_Cload: Configured center of mass of the external load with respect to flange frame.
m_total: Sum of the mass of the end effector and the external load.
I_total: Combined rotational inertia matrix of the end effector load and the external load with respect to the center of mass.
F_x_Ctotal: Combined center of mass of the end effector load and the external load with respect to flange frame.
elbow: Elbow configuration.
elbow_d: Desired elbow configuration.
elbow_c: Commanded elbow configuration.
delbow_c: Commanded elbow velocity.
ddelbow_c: Commanded elbow acceleration.
tau_J: Measured link-side joint torque sensor signals.
tau_J_d: Desired link-side joint torque sensor signals without gravity.
dtau_J: Derivative of measured link-side joint torque sensor signals.
q: Measured joint position.
q_d: Desired joint position.
dq: Measured joint velocity.
dq_d: Desired joint velocity.
ddq_d: Desired joint acceleration.
