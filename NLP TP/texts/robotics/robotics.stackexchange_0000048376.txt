Q:

Most stable ROS version for running PR2?

I started using ROS few months back and have been switching between Fuerte and Groovy lately. I use ROS mainly for interacting with PR2 in simulation.
Many tutorials inside ROS related to PR2 seems to be based on Diamonback or Electric.
Such as .
http://www.ros.org/wiki/arm_navigation/Tutorials

And most of tutorials in there doesn't work in Fuerte or Groovy.
Which version does people mostly use?
Please share any opinions. Thanks!

A:

PR2 simulation in Groovy is still not the most stable.  Would recommend sticking to Fuerte for now.  I use Groovy on the real PR2, which is fine, but switch between Fuerte and Groovy still for simulation.

The problem I have is that with Fuerte, I find most tutorials not working. Do you face similar probelms?

which tutorials?
Comment by jys on 2013-02-17:
Among many these really don't work on Fuerte and Groovy: www.ros.org/wiki/pr2_pick_and_place_demos/Tutorials
Do you know of any working pick and place demo?

Hm.  Those are pretty out of date, aren't they?  I just updated the pick and place autonomous demo tutorial:  http://www.ros.org/wiki/pr2_pick_and_place_demos/Tutorials/The%20Pick%20and%20Place%20Autonomous%20Demo/  for Fuerte.  Let me know if something still doesn't work.

You run Groovy on real PR2? That means you guys run Ubuntu 12.04 on your PR2s?

Yup, Groovy/Precise.
