Q:

building android_apps errors on Android Studio

Hi all,
I tried use Android Studio to import the latest android_apps, but I got build errors.
$ git clone -b indigo https://github.com/rosjava/android_apps.git

And I got following build errors:
Error:(161, 16) error: cannot find symbol method addLayer(ViewControlLayer)
Error:(162, 16) error: cannot find symbol method addLayer(OccupancyGridLayer)
Error:(163, 16) error: cannot find symbol method addLayer(LaserScanLayer)
Error:(164, 16) error: cannot find symbol method addLayer(PathLayer)
Error:(165, 16) error: cannot find symbol method addLayer(MapPosePublisherLayer)
Error:(166, 16) error: cannot find symbol method addLayer(InitialPoseSubscriberLayer)

It looks like the VisualizationView class in maven central repo did NOT have addLayer method.
Any suggestion will be appreciated.

I think maybe the APi got changed. I saw a commit which removes the addLayer method in VisualizationView class. But the official android_apps  still call it.

change the above code to this ..
mapView.onCreate(Lists.newArrayList(
viewControlLayer,
occupancyGridLayer,
laserScanLayer,
pathLayer,
mapPosePublisherLayer,
initialPoseSubscriberLayer
));
