Q:

Move_base is stuck while status is ACTIVE

Hello,
I am driving around my robot and testing the move_base node. It moves around fairly well as long as I order goal positions that the robot can reach. The problem is:
when I order a goal position that the robot can not reach (due to a small door for example) the status of that goal remains ACTIVE forever but the robot does not move. If I order a new goal, the status of the new goal is PENDING but it never becomes ACTIVE because the first order is still ACTIVE (and will be like that forever). If I keep sending new goal positions, the old ones which are PENDING are discarded, and the new ones are introduced as PENDING as well.
How should I proceed in order to regain control over my robot?
Thanks for your tips and comments!

EDIT-1 (answer to 1st comment): the way I communicate with the move_base node is by pusblishing and subscribing to its topics:
/move_base/status provides me with the status of every goal
/move_base_simple/goal  accepts goal positions
In order to learn how the navigation stack works I followed this tutorial (it was months ago, now parameters are tunned to fit my needs):
http://www.ist.tugraz.at/robotics/bin/view/Main/Poineer_pathplanning

EDIT-2: I checked the log of move_base node and this is what happens:
( WAR] (1358262472.775372377, 81184.500000000]: Clearing costmap to unstuck robot.
( WARN] (1358262472.879543309, 81184.600000000]: Rotate recovery behavior started.
(but not recovery behaviour is started)

Moreover, If I request to cencel all the current goals of move_base (publishing a cancel with all goal_ids), then the status of the stuck goal changes from ACTIVE to PREEMPTING and eventually to PREEMPTED. Any ideas?

Which tutorial did you use to set things up? And how are you sending the goals?

I have edited my question to include that information, thanks for your time!

Did some solve the issue?

A:

I have found the 'solution':
First, I read about the move_base having problems when it runs for long (?), or when restarting it without restarting roscore (?), or something similar I can't remember...,
Therefore, the solution is to just restart everything. The navigation stack now works ok!

Maybe post details to your problem that are different from this one ?
