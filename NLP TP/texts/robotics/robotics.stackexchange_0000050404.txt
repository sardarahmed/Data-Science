Q:

motion planning without orientation constrains?

Hello!
I was wondering if you could ask for motion planning without specifying orientation constraints for the end effector.
Thanks a lot!

A:

I don't know which version you are using (arm navigation or moveit).
But you could just add some orientation constraints and set the tolerance really high. In that way it doesn't matter also.
