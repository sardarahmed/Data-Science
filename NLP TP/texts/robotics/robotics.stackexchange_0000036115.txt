Q:

Checking collisions for a given robot state tutorial

Guys,
I have a problem with the following tutorial:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/motion_planning_environment/Tutorials/Tutorial%20A
when I call
roslaunch pr2_arm_navigation_tutorials laser-perception.launch
the collision map does not show on rviz.
Instead I get the following message:
[ WARN] [1322669029.655800639]: You've passed in true for auto_start for the C++ action server you should always pass in false to avoid race conditions.
[laser_clear_objects-5] process has died [pid 16360, exit code -6].
What is the problem?
Thanks

A:

That tutorial only works for Diamondback - I added a note to that effect at the top of the tutorial.  For a roughly equivalent Electric tutorial use this one:  Checking State Validity
