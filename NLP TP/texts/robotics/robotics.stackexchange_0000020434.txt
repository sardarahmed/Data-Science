Q:

ROS sensor implementation

From this page, there are lots of sensors to be used in ros robots.
http://wiki.ros.org/Sensors
But, I could not install any of them to the robots in my simulations.
For example, I want to install the camera:
$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-usb-cam

I get the error:
Reading package lists... Done Building dependency tree Reading state information... Done E: Unable to locate package ros-kinetic-usb-cam

What is the most straightforward way to install any sensor or camera to a robot? What can be the reason of the error I am getting?
Thanks!

A:

This isn't a problem with sensor packages specifically, the error message says that a package by that name wasn't found, which is more of an issue with the package manager.
You can use the following command to list all ROS Kinetic packages available in your package manager:
$ apt-cache search ros-kinetic

To check whether a specific package is available, enter the full package name, for example:
$ apt-cache search ros-kinetic-usb-cam

If the package is not available, nothing will be printed.
In your case, since you're using a cloud environment that is exclusively geared towards simulation, probably no sensor packages will be available. That is not a problem, as you don't need them â€” the Gazebo simulator used in ROS includes plugins to simulate sensors and other hardware components. See here for details.
