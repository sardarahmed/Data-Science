Q:

Read sensors from different roscores

I have a bunch of robots with a separate roscore running on each of them. Now I would like to connect from a C++ application to every robot and read its sensor values. I saw the rosmultimaster package which seems to provide a python API to do exactly what I want. But is there also a way to connect to more than one core at once with the C++ API?

A:

You could relay some topics from one master to another master. A tool for doing that is somewhere in the WG repostiory:
https://code.ros.org/svn/ros/stacks/multimaster_experimental/trunk/foreign_relay
For instance, if you have one robot with master uri A and another one with master uri B, you can set up the relay by running the following command on A:
rosrun foreign_relay foreign_relay adv http://B:11311 /a/laser /laser

It will basically advertise the topic /a/laser on B.

It is not really what I had in mind, but I will give it a try. Thank you very much.
