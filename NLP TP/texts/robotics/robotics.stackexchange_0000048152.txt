Q:

(Groovy | 12.04 | armv7l) Can't run 'roscore' nor 'roslaunch'

Am installing ROS Groovy (from source) on a Tablet, whose Kernel is armv7l, and am having no luck when running the following command:
root@localhost:~# roscore
â€¦ logging to /home/ubuntu/.ros/log/---bunch-of-numbers----/roslaunch-localhost-22058.log
Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.
Press Ctrl-C to interrupt
Done checking log file disk usage. Usage is <1GB.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/groovy/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/roslaunch/__init__.py", line 265, in main
    p.start()

    addr += "%02x:" % si.sll_addr[i]
IndexError: invalid index

My Environment is:
root@localhost:~# export | grep ROS
declare -x ROS_DISTRO="groovy"
declare -x ROS_ETC_DIR="/opt/ros/groovy/etc/ros"
declare -x ROS_MASTER_URI="h t t p://localhost:11311" <-- ROS ANSWERS DOES NOT LET ME PUBLISH LINKS
declare -x ROS_PACKAGE_PATH="/home/ubuntu/ros_ws:/opt/ros/groovy/share:/opt/ros/groovy/stacks"
declare -x ROS_ROOT="/opt/ros/groovy/share/ros"

I am connected through VNC and my interface configuration is:
root@localhost:~# ifconfig

only lo and eth0 appear.
Any suggestions to get roscore and roslaunch to work?

Instead of [SOLVED]'ing you might post the resolution as an answer and mark it as accepted, that's how it works here.

A:

Thanks to a comment from @adamantivm on github
I did the following and solved the issue:
sudo gedit /opt/ros/groovy/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rosgraph/ifaddrs.py

go to line 112 and comment all the if ifa.ifa_addr: segment and add the following:
if ifa.ifa_addr is None:
     continue

This is for VNC connected products.

Hi, I am having the same problem and added that if statement to every 'ifaddrs.py' I could find, but this did not resolve my issue. Do you have another suggestion? Did you do anything else? ps. I am compiling on an Odroid (arm).

For now, I commented out the AF_PACKET part in the python script. I don't think I need it ;)

@amrivera can you clarify?
