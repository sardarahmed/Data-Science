Q:

OctoMap installation

Hello,
I am quite new to ROS and Ubuntu, so this may be a silly question, but I could not solve it. I am running Ubuntu 14.04 and ROS Indigo, and I would like to install all the OctoMap packages in a separate workspace, in order to source it when I want to use it. I cloned all the folders from GitHub (https://github.com/OctoMap), but when I try to build the workspace with catkin_make, I have an error saying that the octomap main package (https://github.com/OctoMap/octomap) contains 'non-catkin packages in it, and catkin cannot build a non-homogeneous workspace without isolation'.
How can I solve this problem? Should I download a different version of that package?

A:

The OctoMap library is not a catkin package, so you have to cmake/make install it manually and then build the ros-related packages using catkin_make. I think there is also a binary package liboctomap-dev which you could just install instead (but which might be outdated though).

Uhm, I see. So I should copy it in the workspace/src and then install it manually, and then catkin_make at the root of the workspace? Sorry but I am not sure about all these processes, they are new to me.

The point is that I already have some OctoMap packages under opt/ros/indigo/share (that I installed along with other things I previously installed, the robot and MoveIt!, I guess), so I don't want to overwrite them. That's why I want to do this in a separate workspace, for experimenting with it.

Don't put it in your workspace at all (the octomap-lib, because it is not a catkin package). Only catkin-packages should go into your workspace. It will then be installed to /usr/local. However catkin package will likely use your octomap from the ros-binaries, so you might have to unistall these.

Btw. I agree with mig's comment, why don't you use the deb-installed octomap that comes with ros (and is already installed on your system?)

Ok, I finally installed it from debs (sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-octomap ros-indigo-octovis). Thank you.
But there is nothing that is contained here (https://github.com/OctoMap/octomap), no .cpp, no files, no nothing. Just an empty shell. How do I use it now? For opening octovis, for example.

I asked a different question for being more specific on my problem: http://answers.ros.org/question/256065/octomap-and-octovis/
If you know the answer, please answer there. It would be extremely helpful.
