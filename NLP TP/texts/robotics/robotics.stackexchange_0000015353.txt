Q:

Calculating covariance of parameter estimation from Hessian

I need a covariance of parameter estimation for reliability estimation. According to the this post, I know the approximation of the Hessian can be calculated as
$$ \sigma^2 H^{-1} = C $$
where H is Hessian, C is the covariance and sigma is the variance of residual. I am trying to understand where it came from and how it is derived but I could not find a related material anywhere. Anyone knows a good reading material regarding this?

A:

The following two materials explain the problem clearly.
Why Hessian is same as covariance matrix.
