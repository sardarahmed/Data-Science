Q:

Indoor Mapping and Localization for Drones

Hi,
I am assembling a drone using the Intel® Aero Compute Board, Intel® Aero Vision Accessory Kit (Intel® RealSense™ R200 stereo camera) and other sensors. I don't know where to start and which packages to use. My goal is to build a map, and let the drone navigate and localize in the environment.  I would like to know the existence of any package for Mapping and Localization. Thank you.

A:

For SLAM: rtabmap
To use your realsense with ros you need the corresponding node

However I highly recommend that you do all the ros tutorials first.

How about an AMCL algorithm? I'll sometimes upload a map and try to perform localization. I'm good with concepts, but not practice. Thanks!

You could usedepthimage_to_laserscan to convert your 3d image to 2d lidar data for amcl. But thats not very useful for flying objects where the xy plane changes with the height. Assuming with Drone you refer to an UAV.

It's a quadrotor, yes! My intention is navigation in a fixed Z altitude. I'll model possible obstacles with 3D point cloud and avoid during the navigation.

Besides RTABmap and GMapping, would you recommend other package for building 2D maps? Thanks again, you're being very helpful!

hector_mapping might be more useful for you then gmapping because of missing wheel odometry.
