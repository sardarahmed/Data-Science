Q:

Check if service advertised successfully

Hi,
is there  a way to check (ex. get a bool returned) if a service has been successfully advertised?
My node advertises multiple services, and it would be usefull to be able to check, if every service is advertised properly and signal to the user in case sth. went wrong.
Is it possible to get some information from ros::ServiceServer? Does it make sense to maybe use C++ try/catch mechanism? Or maybe am I completely wrong and should assume, that nothing can go wrong when advertising a service? (My node basically advertises services for functions of a third parity lib and it is pretty important, that all functions of that lib are accessible)
thanks for Your input :-)

A:

There is ros::service::exists for that: http://docs.ros.org/api/roscpp/html/namespaceros_1_1service.html#a561507ffbd6ce6536bac5c963658038f
