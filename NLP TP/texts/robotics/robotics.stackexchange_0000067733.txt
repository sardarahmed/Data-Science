Q:

rospack cannot find package after installing through apt-get

Hello,
I want to use ROS MoveIt! libraries to control a robot arm. So, I installed MoveIt! with the following command:
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-moveit-full

Then ran:
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash

Inspecting /opt/ros/indigo/include, there are now various folders with the prefix "moveit". However, if I run the command:
rospack find moveit

It prints out:
package 'moveit' not found

The same happens if I try to find ros-indigo-moveit-full.
So, why can ROS not find this package?
