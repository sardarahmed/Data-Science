Q:

Mirroring while using Skeleton_tracker with Asus xtion Sensor

Hi everybody, I'm using the Skeleton_tracker package @Chaos uploaded on Github, and it works pretty nice. However, I notice  when I load the depth image on Rviz, this image appears mirrored.
I have been reviewing the code, and I found this functions:
  depthStream_.setMirroringEnabled(true);

  vsColorStream_.setMirroringEnabled(true);

however, when I change this parameters the image works good but the tracking appears reflected. I set both parameters on true, in this way rgb image and tracking work good. Then I want to know if there is a way for getting all not reflected.
I thank you so much.

Hi @Fredylucas! Sorry for the late in my answer. I'm very busy lately...

Thank you!

Hi @Chaos, I'm using your package in a project, then, I want to ask you how must I cite it? I know this is no the way for asking it, but, I didn't found a mail or something like that for do it.
