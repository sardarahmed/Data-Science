Q:

Kill other roscore/master processes on bourn shell

I keep getting this error message when trying to run roscore:
roscore cannot run as another roscore/master is already running. 
Please kill other roscore/master processes before relaunching.

However, I only have one terminal window open. How could there already be a roscore running? I've tried quitting Terminal and restarting it and I've tried restarting my computer. It doesn't matter what I do - my computer thinks there is a roscore running even though there are no terminal windows open with roscore running in them. Is there a way to kill this invisible roscore so that I can run one in a window?

I met the same problem. There is no roscore or rosmaster running. But I met this error whenever I run roscore.

A:

On the terminal you can do:
killall -9 roscore

and also:
killall -9 rosmaster

that will completely stop them

Without OP specifying the OS/platform, I think this can be marked as answer. @dornhege's answer explains well the reason roscore could be running headless.

The killall -9 rosmaster works effectively!

thanks - did the trick

I realised that even after killing 'rosmaster' there is one more ROS related process running.
killall -9 rosmaster && killall -9 rosout worked for me.
