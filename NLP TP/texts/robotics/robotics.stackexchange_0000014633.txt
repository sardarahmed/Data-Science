Q:

Hacker friendly vacuum robots

I'm considering buying a vacuum robot.  At first I got excited at finding out that Roomba has an Open Interface.  Apparently this was taken out around model 800+ (?)   The newest models do not have an Open Interface.   What robot vacuums are open / hackable?   

A:

iRobot actually offers a robot geared toward developers/hackers, and is fairly affordable at $199: http://store.irobot.com/default/create-programmable-programmable-robot-irobot-create-2/RC65099.html?cgid=us&_ga=2.47072295.1402319966.1513450326-1687721061.1509919043
