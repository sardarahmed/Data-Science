Q:

Moveit! Wiki gone without trace

The MoveIt! wiki seems to have disappeared without a trace -  Google is still returning results for it at the top of its listings.
Unfortunately much of the documentation has not been replaced in any other location.
For an example, here is a link to a search: Google search for "ROS Planning Scene".
In my mind this is a really serious problem - what is the successor for the old MoveIt! wiki at http://moveit.ros.org/wiki/? There doesn't seem to be a clear one.

A:

A redirect has been added to http://moveit.ros.org/wiki. If there are other links that need to be redirected, please send an email on moveit-users.
Thanks!

The problem with the new site (which I had found before posting the question) is that it lacks several features from the old wiki, most notably a search function. This is what I meant by "no clear successor".

Would you like to elaborate on what other features apart from a search function you are looking for. Also the website is based on github pages so it's easy for the community to add features using a pull request :-)
