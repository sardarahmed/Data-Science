Q:

How to use catkin to cross compile and ignore python

I'm working on cross compiling to an ARM platform that doesn't have python.
Is there a way to specify catkin to ignore all catkin_python_setup() calls?
As well it can't find the PythonInterp and I guess I can set that through the environment variable for my host machine, but the target won't have python.
I'm hoping to be able to compile ros packages that contain python nodes and dependencies on rospy but functionally ignore them through the process, even if they tag along and are present in the installed files for now.

A:

Not that I am aware of.
You could override the catkin_python_setup macro with an empty version in your CMake toolchain file. But that might not work depending on the order of of evaluation in CMake, which I'm not sure about. In which case you would just need to fork catkin and disable that macro.
If you want a CMake option to do that then I would open a pull request against catkin.
