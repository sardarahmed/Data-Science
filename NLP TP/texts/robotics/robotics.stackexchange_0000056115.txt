I have the same problem! Is this issue solved yet?

It seems os, as the answer by tfoote is marked as accepted. Maybe you want to open a new question giving some more information about your specific issue (in particular tell us what you did before calling rosdep, i.e. how did you populate your workspace with packages).

I have created a new question. Kindly look through it :
http://answers.ros.org/question/153156/rosdep-error-while-i-try-to-install-ros-on-os-x-108/

A:

It sounds like you are missing packages from your workspace. If you are missing dependencies rosdep will try to install them as system dependencies. However if there are not rules for the packages as system dependencies they will fail to resolve.
In particular I would make sure you have roslaunch in your workspace.
