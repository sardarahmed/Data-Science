Q:

Problem running erratic_robot

Hello,
I have downloaded the possible tools to run the erractic_robot in gazebo but when I try to roslaunch (roslaunch erratic_description erratic_empty_world.launch) it, it gives me an error:
[erratic_description] is not a package or launch file name
I have the erractic_description and I can look into the folder that the roslaunch is trying to access but it keeps denying me.
Any help is MUCH appreciated!
Thanks in advance!

A:

It won't find the package unless the package is on your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
