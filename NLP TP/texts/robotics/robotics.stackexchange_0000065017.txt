Q:

static layer on local costmap

Hi,
I would like to use a static layer (in /map i.e. global frame) in the local costmap. So when the robot moves, I want the lethal obstacles in this static layer that are also in the local costmap, to be inflated. How do I do this?
I know static layers are usually added in the global costmap, but for a special case I want the local planner to access this information.

A:

There are currently issues with the static_layer and rolling costmaps. A (unmerged) pull request that may fix this can be found here: https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/pull/246.

Doesnt seem to work, or maybe its trying to solve something else. For now, I havegot this to work in two ways:

Create a custom layer and mark all intersection points between a static layer and master layer

Publish the static map as a sensor(pointcloud) in /map frame for use by ObstacleLayer
