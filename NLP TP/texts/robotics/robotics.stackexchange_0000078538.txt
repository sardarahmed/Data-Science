Q:

error launching moveitsetup assistant

On launching move it setup assistant, I get an error message saying that the process has died. I have used
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-moveit

source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash

to install and setup the environment. I have also used sudo apt-get update, unfortunately the error persists

can you please tell us how you installed ROS: I'm assuming from debs (ie: apt-get install ..)? And MoveIt? Also only using apt-get?
Comment by motoman on 2017-01-24:
yes ! I installed ROS using apt-get and also the moveit setup assistant using apt-get

A:

Turns out the OP had an inconsistent MoveIt installation (ie: different versions of the binary packages).
After installing all MoveIt packages with the same versions, things started working as they should.
