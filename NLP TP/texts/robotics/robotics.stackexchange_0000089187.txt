Q:

Converting a XYZ Point cloud to a depth image

Is there anyway to do the inverse of depth_image_proc/point_cloud_xyz. I need to do some conversions and calculation with pcl and convert information back to a depth image. I have the camera information as well

Hi Stefan,
Thanks did something like that. went reverse on whats being done in depth_image_proc/point_cloud_xyz algorithm.
if (cam_info_taken == true){
  sensor_msgs::CameraInfo info = cam_info;
  float centre_x = cam_info.K[2];
  float centre_y = cam_info.K[5];
  float focal_x = cam_info.K[0];
  float focal_y = cam_info.K[4];

  cv::Mat cv_image = cv::Mat(cam_info.height, cam_info.width, CV_32FC1,cv::Scalar(std::numeric_limits<float>::max()));

  for (int i=0; i<msg->points.size();i++){
    if (msg->points[i].z == msg->points[i].z){
        float z = msg->points[i].z*1000.0;
        float u = (msg->points[i].x*1000.0*focal_x) / z;
        float v = (msg->points[i].y*1000.0*focal_y) / z;
        int pixel_pos_x = (int)(u + centre_x);
        int pixel_pos_y = (int)(v + centre_y);

    if (pixel_pos_x > (cam_info.width-1)){
      pixel_pos_x = cam_info.width -1;
    }
    if (pixel_pos_y > (cam_info.height-1)){
      pixel_pos_y = cam_info.height-1;
    }
    cv_image.at<float>(pixel_pos_y,pixel_pos_x) = z;
    }       
  }
  
  cv_image.convertTo(cv_image,CV_16UC1);

  sensor_msgs::ImagePtr output_image = cv_bridge::CvImage(std_msgs::Header(), "16UC1", cv_image).toImageMsg();
  output_image->header = info.header;
  output_image->header.stamp = info.header.stamp = t;
  publish_result.publish(output_image);
  publish_cam_info.publish(info);
}

if (msg->points[i].z == msg->points[i].z) always returns true. Could you explain it?

... he checks the depth for nan value
According to the IEEE standard, NaN values have the odd property that comparisons involving them are always false.

Hi, did you implemented this as a standalone node or is bundled inside another component?
I'm also looking for the same functionality. it would be nice if you released this as a open source ros node.

Had this in a separate node
