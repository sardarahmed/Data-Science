Q:

Rosserial Arduino custom message not being generated

I have made a custom message called gas_msg.msg. It is located in a package named gas_sensor_msg. The custom message has been created with catkin_make. I am now trying to make the custom message files in the Arduino libaries using the command "rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py ~/Arduino/libraries/ gas_sensor_msg". I first delete the old ros_lib before running the command, but it is not creating header files for the new custom message. It is only replacing the old default messages.
Any help is appreciated. Thanks!

A:

You probably need to run source devel/setup.bash and then you need to rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py ~/Arduino/libraries/ gas_sensor_msg.
The messages generated by catkin_make are in the devel directory if you do not install it, and will not be included in the ros_lib creation unless you can reference them.
