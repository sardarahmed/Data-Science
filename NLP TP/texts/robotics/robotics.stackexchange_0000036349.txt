Q:

Expanded args ['xv_11_laser_driver'] to: [] when following http://www.ros.org/wiki/xv_11_laser_driver/Tutorials/Running%20the%20XV-11%20Node

Hi All,
As a beginner, followed the instructions on
http://www.ros.org/wiki/xv_11_laser_driver/Tutorials/Running%20the%20XV-11%20Node
to install xv_11 drivers for Neato laser (for beginners, as is marked).
When arriving at step 4, getting into trouble :
~/cwru-ros-pkg$ rosmake --rosdep-install xv_11_laser_driver
[ rosmake ] Packages requested are: ['xv_11_laser_driver']
[ rosmake ] Logging to directory/home/user/.ros/rosmake/rosmake_output-20111208-221941
[ rosmake ] Expanded args ['xv_11_laser_driver'] to:
[]
[ rosmake ] WARNING: The following args could not be parsed as stacks or packages: ['xv_11_laser_driver']
[ rosmake ] ERROR: No arguments could be parsed into valid package or stack names.
is this cwru-ros-pkg broken? Or am I doing something else wrong ?
(note using cturtle : echo $ROS_ROOT gives /opt/ros/cturtle/ros
$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH gives /home/user/cwru-ros-pkg/cwru-ros-pkg:/opt/ros/cturtle/stacks:/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks
Thx for any help !
Grtz,
Mvp,

A:

The xv_11_laser_driver was accidentally removed from the cwru-ros-pkg repository. It has since been restored, so the directions should work again.
