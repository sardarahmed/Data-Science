Q:

Testing with rosmake -a -t fails because a test failure failed to launch. What's wrong?

Running 'rosmake -a -t' I get some test failures attributed to 'Test Fixture Nodes ['xxx'] failed to launch. How can I determine what's wrong and fix it?
An abbreviated example:

ERRORS/FAILURES:
[robot_pose_ekf.rostest__test_test_robot_pose_ekf_zero_covariance/testtest_robot_pose_ekf][FAILURE]
Test Fixture Nodes ['rosbag'] failed
to launch   PACKAGES:    *
robot_pose_ekf

A:

robot_pose_ekf requires rosbag to run it's tests, however it's likely that you either do not have rosbag installed or it's not compiled prior to the tests attempting to run.
