Q:

rostest - Executable not rebuilding

I am trying to write rostests for the clear_costmap_recovery package. [relevant code]
Is there a way to build the tests for only one package?
Running catkin_make or catkin_make clear_costmap_recovery do not rebuild the test executable.
Running catkin_make run_tests does rebuild the test executable, but also runs ALL the tests in the navigation package.
Running catkin_make run_tests_clear_costmap_recovery runs only the relevant tests, but does NOT rebuild the test executable.

A:

I think you can do it like this:
catkin_make tests
catkin_make run_tests_clear_costmap_recovery

Those targets can probably share the same command line.

Good call. And yes, they can share the same line. Thanks joq.

Although, wouldn't you think that run_tests_clear_costmap_recovery would build the tests if run_tests does?
Comment by joq on 2014-07-10:
run_tests depends on tests, but the package-specific ones don't. That may have been a conscious choice. It can sometimes be useful, once you understand how it works.
