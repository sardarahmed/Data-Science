Q:

Make Gazebo (ODE) deterministic or reset random number generator?

Hello,
I am running a lot(~1000s) of quick simulations one at a time and doing a World::Reset() between each one. Is there some way to ensure that the random numbers generated by Gazebo are the same after each World::Reset()? Can I reset the RNG? If I just set the seed again, will that restart the RNG?
Right now, I have a small (~1 in 1000) chance of the RNG causing the result of my simulation to change - I'd like to fix the random numbers generated so that I can observe the behavior causing my simulation to fail. Thanks.

Thanks Nate! I've set the seed already. Unfortunately when I reset the world using World::Reset(), the RNG doesn't seem to reset and as a result I can run the same simulation over again and get different results. I would like to be able to reproduce my results and still automate the process of running multiple trials. How do you recommend that I do this?

I've made an issue out of this. Please track updates there.
