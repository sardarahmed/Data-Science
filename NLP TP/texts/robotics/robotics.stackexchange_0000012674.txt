Q:

Control a robotic gripper

I have created a robotic gripper. However, I need help in the control circuit:

There are two buttons, the upper and lower one (connected to the timer):

the upper one is two states timer either up or down (will be replaced with an active low pin in PCB design).
the lower one is a push button that must be pushed and  let back to its initial position to give a pulse to the monostable timer to make the servo rotate long enough to just close the gripper (calculate with the RC circuit). 

My problem: I want to replace the down button with some component so as to give a quick pulse when the upper button change state.
For example, the button was 0 and went 1 -> Component -> a small pulse to drive the timer (not a pulse that will last until the state changes):

Where,

Green: is button state
Red: trigger pulse needed.

A:

This can be easily done with a 555 timer, or even a flip flop and a counter.   Are you looking for design concepts or a detailed design?
EDIT
Check out this site for a simple edge-triggered one-shot that uses two nor gates and an R-C (scroll down to the NOR Gate Monostable section).   I can't draw the circuit on here using my phone so I apologize about just providing a link.
