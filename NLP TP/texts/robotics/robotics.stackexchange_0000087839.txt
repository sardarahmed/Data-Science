Q:

No launch-prefix for includes?

Hello, I am trying to compact some .launch files into one via include. However, it would seem that the usual command of launch-prefix="gnome-terminal --command" is incompatible with include. I absolutely need these launch files to run in their own windows or tabs, as they all must be able to run continuously. Help?

well, they all run continuously. You can shutdown any node with rosnode kill MYNODE and the others won't be affected. Or do you need their output on the console? Then you can use rqt_console to filter the messages.
Or why exactly do you need that? Please elaborate to avoid http://xyproblem.info

The  tag enables you to
import another roslaunch XML file into
the current file. It will be imported
within the current scope of your
document, including  and
 tags. All content in the
include file will be imported except
for the  tag: the  tag
is only obeyed in the top-level file.
