Hello. I would like to know in which format should I export a 3D work created in ArhiCAD in order to import it into Gazebo. Thank you.

Here is a question about going from Solidworks files to URDF and STL files, it may be a good reference as you approach the problem http://answers.ros.org/question/794/converting-solidworks-stuff-to-urdf-stl-and

No it doesnt have this feature, neither .dae, .stl.

Can ArchiCAD export models in COLLADA (.dae) or STL format?

A:

As far as I know, the only three formats supported by URDF/Gazebo/RViz are:

.dae  (Collada)
.mesh (Ogre)
.stl

(also see this answer). Perhaps ArchiCAD can export to a format that can be imported by another program which can export into one of those formats. Perhaps this list of CAD programs and formats is of help (sorry, German link; the English Wikipedia page doesn't have ArchiCAD).

I have obtained my file in .3ds, which i could load into MeshLab successfully, the further transformations failed because the loaded .stl and .dae files into RViz were proven to be with lacks. Just a few objects were visible from the created 3D environemnt. Although loading the .stl, .dae files works correctly in MeshLab. Anyone could help me by transforming my file using other 3D converter?

I have found that you can use MeshLab (http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/) to transfer between other intermediate formats, as well.  It may take a bit more work to clean up, but it generally does a pretty good job.
