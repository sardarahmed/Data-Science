Q:

Min and max value with ROS2 Parameter

Hi Everyone,
The dynamic reconfigure is not available in ROS2, and its replacement Parameter feature is used.
With ROS, .cfg files are used, where parameter's value, min , max and other details can be given.
With ROS2, I tried to set parameter with value and its working fine, but is there a way to set min and max value for that parameter?
e.g. of .cfg
gen.add ("min_x", double_t, 0, "X coordinate of the minimum point of the box.", -1, -1000, 1000)

Thanks.

A:

There is currently (as of Crystal) no comparable feature to declare parameter boundaries.
Once the change to IDL has landed I imagine that it will be possible to create an .idl which declares the parameters of a node including their valid range (like .cfg files in ROS 1 but language agnostic).

@gvdhoorn This is a change to add support for IDL messages in addition to msg format.

@tfoote: I was/am aware of the IDL work :) Just thought it would be nice if @Dirk Thomas could link to a PR / issue as that would make his answer better.
