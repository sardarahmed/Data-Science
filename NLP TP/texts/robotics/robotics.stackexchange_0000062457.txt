Q:

Base Local Planner Configuration

Hi,
In my deferentially steered drive system based robot my values for acceleration and deceleration are different (that was the best option, based on experimentation).
How does this affect:
acc_lim_x:
acc_lim_y:

in terms of performance?
How can I include the separation between acceleration and deceleration?
Is it recommended to always have the same value for both acceleration and deceleration? If so, why?
Thanks

A:

In base local planner, there is a file called latched_stop_rotate_controller.cpp. In that function, the stop command is implemented using LatchedStopRotateController::stopWithAccLimits() [line 108] which uses acc_lim as an argument. I think you can define your own, say, decel_lim and use that instead in this function. I am not entirely sure as to whether they should be kept the same from the code's perspective though.
