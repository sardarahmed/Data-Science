Q:

ROS service with bool as request and bool as response

I don't want to use std_srvs::SetBoolRequest or any stuff from mavros. I just want to use bare boolean. My callback function would be :
bool Command::arming_service(bool request, bool response) {
   // whatever 
   return false;
}

How can I do that ?

A:

You can't if you intend to use a ROS service. This is how services are designed.
You can create your own service type, if you want, only containing booleans.
my_pkg/MyBoolSrv:
bool input
---
bool output

But you'll still have the respective function signature as
bool Command::arming_service(my_pkg::MyBoolSrv::Request request, my_pkg::MyBoolSrv::Response response) {
   // whatever with request.input and response.output
   return false;
}

If this doesn't answer your question, please provide more details on your use case and what you actually want to do.
