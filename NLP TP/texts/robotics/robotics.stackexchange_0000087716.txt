Q:

Naming log folder

Hi everyone;
Is there any way to specify in my python program the name of the folder to which logs for respective nodes are saved?
As in, when I launch my experiment via roslaunch, I'll see something like the following text:
... logging to /home/user/catkin_ws/src/project/logs/51342e8a-7f6c-11e8-a056-5404a63cee0d/roslaunch-user-desktop-22693.log

My question is whether I can programatically set the name of the folder 51342e8a-7f6c-11e8-a056-5404a63cee0d each time I run the experiment?
Ideally the folder name would be the exact date/time the experiment was launched..

A:

The 51342e8a-7f6c-11e8-a056-5404a63cee0d string is actually a parameter called run_id (you get check it by calling rosparam get /run_id) that is generated uniquely while starting roscore. This parameter should not be changed. What you can change is the path before that (/home/user/catkin_ws/src/project/logs/ in your example) by setting the $ROS_LOG_DIR environment variable.
One solution that could work for you is to set this environment variable to the current time programmatically using a script before every launch. Then while collecting these logs you can write a simple script that goes inside each log folder and moves the content one directory level up.

That sounds like it will work. Seems a shame that there isn't a more elegant (in-built) solution as it's quite an obvious feature.. Anyway, thanks for your help!
