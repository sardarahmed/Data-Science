Q:

Validation of dh parameters

I am working on a concept of robotic arm for which I have fixed DH frames and parameters. Is there any way to validate the correctness of DH parameters and frames ?

A:

The easiest way to validate a set of DH parameters is to plug them directly into a simulator which can build a robot model from a DH table. Once you've got the DH-generated robot model, you can verify that the robotic structure that is generated is what you would expect based on your DH table.
The most common DH-table based robot simulation package that I've worked with is the Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB written by Peter Corke: http://petercorke.com/wordpress/toolboxes/robotics-toolbox.
