Q:

Cannot Find COLLADA Headers

I'm trying to install ROS Groovy on a Lenovo X200 Tablet with openSUSE 12.3. I've installed COLLADA-DOM 2.4, and it installed its headers to /usr/local/include/collada-dom2.4/. I have double and triple-checked, and dae.h is in that folder. However, when I try to run the full desktop install with:
sudo ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install-space /opt/ros/groovy --install -DSETUPTOOLS_DEB_LAYOUT=OFF

I get the following error:
    [100%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/collada_parser.dir/src/collada_parser.cpp.o
/home/abouchard/ros_catkin_ws/src/collada_parser/src/collada_parser.cpp:45:17: fatal error: dae.h: No such file or directory

<== Failed to process package 'collada_parser': 
  Command '/opt/ros/groovy/env.sh make -j2 -l2' returned non-zero exit status 2

Reproduce this error by running:
==> /opt/ros/groovy/env.sh make -j2 -l2

Command failed, exiting.

I was thinking that perhaps this was related to the cmake command, and indeed there is no FindCOLLADA_DOM.cmake file on the computer, but I found one online and put it in /usr/share/cmake/Modules to no avail. I'm still digging into the cmake documentation to see if I can find any error either in the CMakeLists for collada_parser in ROS or the FindCOLLADA_DOM.cmake script, but I don't seem to be making any headway.
Has anyone else run into this that could perhaps give me some pointers?

A:

Chalk this one up to a mystery - I uninstalled everything collada from my system, tried again, and it seems to have worked. Go figure.
