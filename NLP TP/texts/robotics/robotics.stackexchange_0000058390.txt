Q:

A problem on rviz

Hi guys, I am using ROS hydro and learning the basis of rviz, following the tutorial in http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/Tutorials/Markers%3A%20Basic%20Shapes. But nothing displays on rviz. In Global Options -> Fixed Frame there is only the default option "map", but no "/my_frame" as shown in the link above. I source the setup.bash and set the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH in every termial. Could you please give me some suggestions? Many thanks.
The cpp file is exactly same as shown in the link. The CMakeList is shown below.
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)
project(using_markers)
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
roscpp
visualization_msgs
)
catkin_package()
include_directories(${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS})
add_executable(basic_shapes src/basic_shapes.cpp)
target_link_libraries(basic_shapes ${catkin_LIBRARIES})
I also add add_dependencies(basic_shapes using_markers_generate_messages_cpp), but no result either.

i think you have to type the frame name
Comment by ahendrix on 2014-04-01:
Just to confirm, have you run catkin_make, and is the basic_shapes node is running?

Hi guys, thanks for your help.
@Sai I type the"/my_frame", but it does not work either.
@ahendrix I run catkin_make, but what is the node of basic_shapes?

You are trying a command rosrun rviz rviz, aren't you. If you can't look at /my_frame in Fixed Frame in Rviz, /my_frame isn't registered. I think so.

@ken_in_JAPAN thank you. I think you are right. But could you please tell me how to register the frame? I am nooby to ros. so.. Many thanks.

At first, you should try a command rosrun tf view_frames. More detail are described on a web site.
http://wiki.ros.org/tf.
If you look at frames.pdf, you have to decide where you put /my_frame. After that, it is better for you to refer static_transform_publisher on same web. I think so.

did someone get exact solution for this, i followed the instruction in the ans below also but didnt worked. what is exact solution?
Comment by ahendrix on 2016-07-06:
This is an exact solution; it lists the exact commands to run, the order to run them in, and shows how to configure rviz. If you're having trouble following these instructions please read how to ask smart questions and then ask a new question.

ok i got the answer, what i was doing wrong was after not seeing the /my_frame title inside the fixed_frame topic, i was not getting the output, i should write the topic /my_frame inside that fixed_frame my self manually, i was confused cas i was not seeing /my_frame in that box when i clicked it
di

A:

I could do that!
At first, I typed next command to install basic_shapes on my computer.

$ catkin_make install
</pre>
After that, I tried following on terminal.
<pre>
$ roscore

On another terminal

$ rosrun using_markers basic_shapes
</pre>
On third terminal
<pre>
$ rosrun tf static_transform_publisher 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 map my_frame 100 

On last terminal

$ rosrun rviz rviz
