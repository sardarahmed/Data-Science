Q:

ROS1 dependency in nav2 tutorial?

I'm trying to discover Nav2 stack.
I'd like to do a mission/follow-waypoint thing in my own simulation.
I started with the "Getting Started" -> "Running the Example" after installation of nav2 Ubuntu package for ros2-humble.
I got the error : "package 'gazebo_ros' not found ..."
But if I'm not mistaken, this is a ROS1 package. It is used to spawn entity. I did not find a package with the executable, (in my simulation I use ros_gz_sim to spawn element).
I probably miss something, could you tell me what it is ?

A:

gazebo_ros is still used in ROS2. The source code is available here : gazebo_ros ros2 branch
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-gazebo-ros should do the job
