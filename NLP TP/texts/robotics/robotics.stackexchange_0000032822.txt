Q:

How to get the point clouds in a region of kinect frame?

Hi all,
In my work, I need to crop point clouds in a rectangle fixed region (x0, y0, width, height) from the whole frame clouds collected by Kinect. How can I do that? I appreciate any help.
Regards,
Phuoc Nguyen

A:

See the passthrough filter in PCL. (If you're in ROS, pcl_ros will be handy).
