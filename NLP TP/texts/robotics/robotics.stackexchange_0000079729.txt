Q:

ros python creating strange side effects

Ubuntu 16.04
ROS Kinetic

I have been working on a program in python. Created my package just like I always do. This time I thought I would give dynamic reconfigure a try. I did the tutorial and ran the code. I wind up with my mouse turning into a cross, the libraries I import become files in the directory I launched from and the path name in my bash prompt changes.  Has anyone ever seen this before?
I can't get a screenshot of what happens to the pointer as it is not saved in screenshots.

A:

Could you post the top part of the script you ran? I bet you forgot to add a #! /usr/bin/python or similar to the top of your file.
If you have an executable file asd.py like
import numpy
a = 1
...

and do an './asd.py', Ubuntu will assume a bash-script (as there is no shebang) Now the first command is 'import' which can be used to make partial screenshots: import (bash). This is also the reason why your mouse pointer changes. (just type 'import asd.png' and mark a region) This also explains the new files (it's just the images (most probably postscript files)).

This is why you don't make a template generator, if your template is wrong alllll the auto created files will be wrong.
That was it, I did not add it on my ROS templates.

which file did you run? Could you add it to your question?
