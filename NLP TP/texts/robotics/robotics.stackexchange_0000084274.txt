Q:

Get map dimensions for map saved from map server

After implementing SLAM using gmapping, the map was saved using map_server package, as a pgm file and a yaml file, I need to know the dimensions of the objects in the map and the map itself, how do I achieve this?

A:

Get the dimensions of the pgm (x pixels by y pixels) then examine your yaml file. In the yaml file the resolution of the map is given in meters/pixel. This will allow you to determine the size of your map in meters. You would figure out the size of objects in the map in a similar fashion (i.e., multiply the number of pixels your object takes by the resolution of your map and you'll have the physical size of the object).

What are some ways I could get the x and y pixels for the map and not the pgm file? My pgm file has larger dimensions than the actual map.

You can just manually edit the pgm so that it is the size of your map. I've used GIMP to edit maps before.
