Q:

cannot find octovis for viewing the built map

I am using ros-fuerte. I used rgbdslam package to built a map. I saved the map as 'name.bt'.
When I am trying to view it using
rosrun octovis octovis <filename.bt>
I got the error octovis stack/package not found.
But I checked the installed location using '$ dpkg -L ros-fuerte-octovis'
I got output as:

Is there any possible solutions?

A:

You no longer start octovis as a ROS package in fuerte (i.e. with "rosrun"). It is now installed as a regular system-wide library, so you start it just like any other program:
octovis <filename.bt>

Initially, I tried that too and also now. But, I got the same error,
ERROR: Filestream to 1stmap.bt not open, nothing read.

Sorry. In the mapping process instead of using openni_node.launch, I used openni.launch from other package. So, I guess the map was not built. But, I cannot find the file openni_node.launch in openni_camera package.

That is a completely different problem, I guess. What happens if you open octovis (without filename), then go the File / Open and pick your file?

I solved the problem. I cannot find openni_node.launch because its located in the package openni_camera_deprecated. But, in older versions its located in openni_camera. So, try for
$ roslaunch openni_camera_deprecated openni_node.launch
