Q:

Why doesn't move_base depend on move_base_msgs

Looking at the CMakeLists.txt for move_base (link), why is there no mention of move_base_msgs ? I would expect to see something like:
`add_dependencies(move_base move_base_msgs_gencpp)` 

and/or see move_base_msgs listed under find_package COMPONENTS
Without that, how is it able to include the following (automatically generated) header in move_base.h:
#include <move_base_msgs/MoveBaseAction.h>

And how does catkin know to generate the MoveBase.action msgs and headers before building move_base ?
Update: A colleague figured out that it's related to whether the packages are built in isolation or not.

Looks like a bug. Are you seeing errors related to this?

+1, how about opening a github issue? https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/issues ?

I do if I don't build in isolation (i.e. when not using catkin_make_isolated or catkin build). Specifically, it cannot find the header file mentioned above. I'll open an issue. Thanks guys!

A:

I opened an issue (ros-planning/navigation/#483) where I also included my hypothesis as to why this only becomes a problem when building with catkin_make but not with catkin_make_isolated or catkin build
