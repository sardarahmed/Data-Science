Q:

Network connection stopping ros subscription

Whilst running the tutorial:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/stage/Tutorials/SimulatingOneRobot
I am trying to write a rosjava program that will subscribe to the robots laser data and then publish messages. When I run the program whilst not being connected to a network it runs as expected and prints out a message to show that it is working.
However when I run it whilst connected to a wireless network the program doesn't appear to be receiving any messages and throws the following exceptions:
INFO: Subscriber registered: Subscriber<Topic<TopicIdentifier</base_scan>, TopicDescription<sensor_msgs/LaserScan, 90c7ef2dc6895d81024acba2ac42f369>>>

25-Nov-2012 14:04:37 org.ros.internal.transport.ConnectionTrackingHandler exceptionCaught
SEVERE: Channel exception: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused

Does anyone know how or why this is happening relating to my network connection and if I can fix it.
I am running Fuerte on Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx).
Thanks

A:

I also see a similar behavior. I think that ROS cannot find where the nodes are if there are multiple Domain Name Servers (DNS). In my set-up, I have one on the ROS network, and one from my company, which "appears" only when I connect to the WLAN.
One solution could be to hard-code your computer names and IPs in the /etc/hosts file, which can be annoying to maintain. But give it a try in your setup, who knows!

That's possible. Please file a bug: http://code.google.com/p/rosjava/issues/list
