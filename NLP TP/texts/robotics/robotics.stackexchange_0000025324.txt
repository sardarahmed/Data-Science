Q:

DRC head does not move

Neither DRC tutorial seems to move the sensor head on the DRC robot
(control or animation). The other joints seem to move. The joint
that does not is neck_ay. Anyone else have the same problem?
Thanks,
Chris

A:

This problem seems to be due to the following line in the model.sdf file:
<limit effort="5" lower="0.785398" upper="0.785398" velocity="12"/>

which is due to this entry in drc_skeleton.cfg:
struct neck
    struct ay
        offset  = 0.011 0 0.49
        axis    = 0.000000 1.000000 0.000000
        type    = revolute
        kin_min         = 0.785398163   # rad
        kin_max         = 0.785398163   # rad
        vel_min         = -12
        vel_max         = 12
        f_min           = -5
        f_max           = 5

setting a negative lower limit
  <limit effort="5" lower="-0.785398" upper="0.785398" velocity="12"/>

allows animation to work. control doesn't work, presumably because the gains or the torque
limit are bad.
