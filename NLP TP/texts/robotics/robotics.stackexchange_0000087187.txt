Q:

rosbridge for melodic distro?

I'm currently trying to get rosbridge to run on an Ubuntu-VM. I installed ROS with no problems, but when I try to install rosbridge (which should be "sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-rosbridge-suite") it tells me, that he is unable to locate the package.
I haven't found any source online for what distros of ROS Rosbridge is available, so can someone help me out here?

In addition to the pages that @130s linked to, you can always go to the wiki page of a package and check the version selectors at the top of the page.

Thank you very much :)

A:

Any rosbridge packages don't seem to be released yet at the moment (see repositories.ros.org). Some of its dependent package isn't released yet either (see another page on repositories.ros.org), which means it'll become release-able once dependent packages are released.
Looks like there's already a request. Voicing up there is the best way to communicate with the maintenance team of the package in question.
