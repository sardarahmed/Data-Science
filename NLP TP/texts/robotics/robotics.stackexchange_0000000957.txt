Q:

Adhesion for a heavy wall-climbing robot

I have come across a number of methods for developing wall-climbing robots.

Suction
Chemical Adhesion
Gecko like hair adhesion
Electroadhesion

Which method would be the best for heavy robots (5kg+)? Are there any other methods that I have missed?

A:

Depends on what you want to climb on, if it is glass, probably your best bet will be suction, but I have no idea what you will need for normal house walls. Don't forget that many walls will not be able to survive 5kgs of weight that tears down the paint. Also if you want to climb on normal walls, you probably shouldn't use chemical adhesives, as they will leave some form of residue.
