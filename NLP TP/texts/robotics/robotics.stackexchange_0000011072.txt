Q:

CNC: Linear motion without timing belt or lead screw

Is it possible to build a CNC whose Linear motion system does not contain any timing belt(pulley) or lead screw(threaded rod).
I was wondering whether I could directly control the Linear motion by securing wheels of a slider onto aluminum rails & directly connecting the wheels to a stepper motor.
The main objective of this question is to find the cheapest method for controlled Linear motion.

A:

I would say the answer to the first question is "Yes and No".  
Yes, you could hook a stepper motor directly to drive wheels on some sort of shuttle.  CNC controllers normally have a setting for inches/step or some equivalent.  If you set that correctly, the machine should drive the motors "correctly".
But No, this not likely to give you the output you want.  Stepper-based CNC machines work on the idea that the machine never "loses steps": that for every electrical pulse, the motor moves a fixed amount; and that N forward steps followed by N backwards steps brings you back to exactly where you started.  If you are driving wheels which rely on friction for motion, those two assumptions are almost certain to fail, and your output path will be stretched or compressed in strange ways.
