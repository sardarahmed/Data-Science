Q:

How to launch two turtlebots on one ROS master

Hi Everybody,
For my project I have to navigate two Turtlebot3's parallel to each other. To do this, I want to send way-points to both turtlebot's simultaneously, using one ROSmaster (my laptop). Sending way-points to one turtlebot works fine, but I can't figure out how to connect both turtlebots to the ROSmaster at the same time. Does anybody know how to connect two turtlebots3 to one ROSmaster or where I have to start searching?
I'm using ROS1 Melodic and turtlebot3.
Thanks in advance!

A:

You need to set for each turtlebot a seperate namespace and tf_prefix.

Do I need to do this before launching connecting the robots with ssh ubuntu@...? or when the first robot is connected?

This needs to be done in the launchfiles of each robot
