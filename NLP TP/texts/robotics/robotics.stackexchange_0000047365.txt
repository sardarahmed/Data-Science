Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: groovy rospack

I am a starter on ROS. I got Ubuntu and groovy installed on my Linux Laptop. I am going through tutorials and got till rospack. When I tried "rospack depends1 beginner_tutorials", I got segmentation fault (core dump).
Till this point the software behaved per tutorials
Any suggestions?
Thanks

A:

There's one ticket already reported and fixed that Debian-build might not be available yet.
ps. However I can't be sure enough that the issue is exactly the same with this limited amount of info. @goman1 can you see this similar thread first and give us the backtrace of the debugger?
