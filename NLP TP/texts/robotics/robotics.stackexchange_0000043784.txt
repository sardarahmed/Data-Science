Q:

Transform3d’ in namespace ‘Eigen’ does not name a type

Hello everyone!
I'm a beginner in ROS and I was working around this tutorial: Coding a real time Cartesian controller with Eigen
However, the following declaration:
" typedef Eigen::Transform3d                CartPose;"
leads to the error:
"Transform3d’ in namespace ‘Eigen’ does not name a type".
Any suggestion is very much welcome!

Could you post some more context? Which version of ROS? Surrounding lines of the error? These types of errors mostly occur if you are missing '#include' statements, or don't have the (proper versions of) headers installed.

Yes, I'm using ubuntu 11.10 and ROS-electric. I guess probably it's a problem about eigen2 or eigen3. I'll try. Thanks!

It's probably easier to edit your original question, instead of trying to use comments for it.

A:

I just solved this problem. As indicated in this page, Transform3f should be replace with Affine3f. Likewise, I should use Affine3d rather than Transform3d.

Thank you for all the replies!
