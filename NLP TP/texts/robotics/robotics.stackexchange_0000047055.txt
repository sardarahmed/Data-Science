Q:

Turtlebot Simulator SLAM tutorial Problem of Gazebo

Following the Turtlebot Simulator SLAM tutorial, I copied and pasted the words from the tutorial using Gedit and created the boxes.world, robot.launch, and build_map.launch files. After that, I type roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo_tutorial build_map.launch but the Gazebo window does not show up.
When I type roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_empty_world.launch I can see the virtual turtlebot in the gazebo window, but when I run the build_map.launch the gazebo window does not show up, although from the terminal it seems that the program has been launched successfully. So, what is wrong?
By the way I am using VirtualBox ROS Fuerte by Nootrix. I am not sure if it means a crash of Gazebo in VirtualBox or just I need to source something to bring up the gazebo.
Thank you very much.

A:

I had similar problem in VirtualBox. I think, that cause of problem is that VirtualBox is not support correctly 3D graphics.
