Q:

[Turtlebot] Autonomous map building

Hi everyone,
I'm looking to have my turtlebot autonomously build a map of an area, without needing to be manually teleoperated or working on an existing map.
I have used frontier_exploration package (wiki.ros.org/frontier_exploration). But it looks like my turtlebot isn't working well with frontier_exploration's default settings. And I haven't seen any good examples of how to config frontier_exploration package with turtlebot. So it would be great to see some examples about turtlebot builds map using frontier_exploration package, or some alternative packages to solve my problem.
Thanks,
DuongBH

A:

The sample configuration is relatively robot-agnostic, however there are several different usecases outlined on the wiki. Also, the sensor setup should mirror your navigation stack configuration, so that would the first place I'd look for issues.
