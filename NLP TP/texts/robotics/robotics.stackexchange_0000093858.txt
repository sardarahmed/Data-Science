Q:

Is teleop_twist_keyboard launchable in ROS2?

Hi,
fairly new to ROS2 I am currently trying to work with launch files.
I was trying to simply launch the teleop_twist_keyboard but it would't work.

    launch_ros.actions.Node(
        package="teleop_twist_keyboard",
        node_executable="teleop_twist_keyboard",
        output='screen',
        node_name='teleop')

I don't get an error message, and the topic node connections in rqt look right too. Although I don't the usual console output (telling me which keys I should use). Is this package launchable yet? What can I do?
I am working with dashing.
Thanks!

have you tried running the launch command with the -d option for more debug output?

A:

Update: After adding the  prefix  'xterm -e' to launch in a new terminal everything worked as it should.
launch_ros.actions.Node(
    package='teleop_twist_keyboard',
    node_executable="teleop_twist_keyboard",
    output='screen',
    prefix = 'xterm -e',
    node_name='teleop')

I feel this has a work around ! Does anyone have an idea on how to do it without xterm -e?

I'd also like to know, how to run this teleop node without using 'xterm'?

As is stated here, then I do not believe it is possible to do it without using 'xterm': ros2/teleop_twist_keyboard/issues
