Q:

robot camera calibration

Hi,
Is there any ROS package to calibration extrinsic parameters of a camera with respect to its mounting frame?  I looked at camera_pose_calibration and camera_pose_toolkit, it seems to me that both packages do it through a second camera whose pose with respect its mounting frame or a robot (referred to as URDF cam frame) has been calibrated (i.e. a URDF cam frame is available).  My question is that how to do it without any known URDF cam frame.
Thanks in advance.
