Q:

slam_gmapping installation

Hello all,
I am doing the tutorial How to Build a Map Using Logged Data which  requires the use of gmapping. Well, I do not know how to install it. I found an installation option via apt-get but I would like to install from the git repository. The gmapping ROS package is called slam_gmapping and from its web page the git repository address available is https://github.com/ros-perception/slam_gmapping.git.
Someone can give me instructions on how to install slam_gmapping package via clonning the its repository?
Thanks

A:

First of all: do you mean "install" that the end result should be the same as as with apt-get? I.e. slam_gmapping is installed in /opt/ros? Then I would go for the apt-get version, even though it is possible with catkin directly.
If you "just" want to have it in you workspace, I'd suggest you go through the catkin Tutorials so that you understand what actually happens.
In short, the required steps are:

create a catkin workspace:
 mkdir -p catkin_ws/src
 cd catkin_ws/src
 source /opt/ros/<DISTRO>/setup.bash
 catkin_init_workspace

clone the repository:
 git clone https://github.com/ros-perception/slam_gmapping.git

compile the workspace
 cd ..
 catkin_make

source the workspace
 source devel/setup.bash

Could not find a package configuration file provided by "openslam_gmapping"
with any of the following names:
openslam_gmappingConfig.cmake
openslam_gmapping-config.cmake
I got this error after doing catkin_make following your commands. How can I fix this problem
thanks a lot

You also Need to satisfy all dependencies. You can do that by either also cloning all relevant repositories (openslam_gmapping can be found here) or by installing the provided binaries (sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-openslam-gmapping). ...

I'd highly recommend to use the apt-get Approach here, because openslam_gmapping does not fit easily into the ROS Workspace layout (afair), and would really overcomplicate things.
