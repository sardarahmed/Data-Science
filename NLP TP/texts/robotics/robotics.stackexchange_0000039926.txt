Q:

error installing rosjava using rosws

Hi all
I tried to follow the instruction here (http://docs.rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/rosjava_core/html/installing.html)
to install rosjava using rosws and got an error during the last step : rosws update
Error shows:
ERROR: Error processing 'rosjava_core' : checkout() got an unexpected keyword argument 'verbose'
Any idea of this problem? Thanks a lot.

What version of ROS? What host operating system?

A:

This probably means the rosinstall version is newer than the vcstools version or vice versa.
On Ubuntu, do
sudo pip install -U rosinstall

or
sudo easy_install rosinstall vcstools
