Q:

catkin_make not working

I am having the same problem as described here https://answers.ros.org/question/258444/sudo-apt-install-catkin-not-working/ when trying to compile the Groot Graphical Editor for Ros as instructed here https://github.com/BehaviorTree/Groot
I am sourcing the ros environment with source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash although in the mentioned question it was the answer. I do have catkin installed as when I write catkin in the shell I get a clue on how to use it but when performing the sudo apt install catkin as the shell suggests after executing catkin_make fails I get the following:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 catkin : Depends: python-catkin-pkg (>= 0.4.14-2) but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

Does anyone know how to solve this?
Pd: I am using Ros2 foxy along with Ubuntu 20.04

A:

ROS 2 Foxy is using colcon, not catkin - you have to check this PR in the Groot repository:

https://github.com/BehaviorTree/Groot/pull/119/files

There you have instructions how to build Groot in ROS 2 - you can also see my answer to this question with clear instructions how to install and use Groot to modify a BT:

Modification of the Behavior Tree -
you can use the
Groot.
For the ROS2 Galactic use:
   cd ~/dev_ws/src
   git clone https://github.com/BehaviorTree/Groot.git
   cd ..
   rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src
   colcon build --symlink-install --packages-select groot

I have sudo apt install ros-galactic-behaviortree-cpp-v3
before too.
You have to source install/setup.bash and
./build/groot/Groot.
