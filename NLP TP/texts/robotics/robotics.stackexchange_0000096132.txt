Q:

ROS2 topic list only working once (or any other command)

Hi,
I am currently using a Turtlebot3, completely set up following this guide: https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/ros2_setup/
Running: ubuntu-18.04.3-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi3.img.xz
With ROS2 Dashing installed.
On my REMOTE PC (desktop), I am running Ubuntu 18.04, also with ROS2 Dashing installed.
Also installed following the online guide: https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Dashing/
The question:
When I ssh into the Turtlebot3 and run the following command:

ros2 launch turtlebot3_bringup robot.launch.py

and then run on the REMOTE PC (desktop):

ros2 topic list

I get a correct result, showing the available topics that are being published.
However, when I run this command a second time, it only shows the default topics:

/parameter_events

/rosout

Any consecutive command after the first one will give this default result. This is also the case if the first time I try the command:

ros2 node list

or any other ROS2 command. However, when I kill the '_ros2_daemon', and then run the ros2 topic list (or node list) command again, it works again, but only for that one time again. Leaving me to kill the daemon constantly.
Can someone help me figure this out?

same problem with ros2 foxy, did you find a solution?

A:

I had same problem before.
When this problem occur, you should restart ros2 daemon with following commands.
$ ros2 daemon stop
$ ros2 daemon start
After that you can get a correct result on "ros2 topic list command".
