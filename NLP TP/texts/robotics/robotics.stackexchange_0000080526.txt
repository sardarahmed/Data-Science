Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: import _Twist

the code on the book and the tutorials are something like this:from geometry_msgs.msg import Twist,but when I type from geometry_msgs.msg import T,the sublime auto-completes it to this:from geometry_msgs.msg import _Twist.An underscore appears.Is it OK?And I find there is only _Twist.py in /opt/ros/hydro/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/geometry_msgs/msg
