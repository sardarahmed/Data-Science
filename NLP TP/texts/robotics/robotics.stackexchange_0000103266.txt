Q:

std_msgs/Float32.h not found

Hi,
I am relatively new to trying to do anything with c++ in ros, so I'm sorry if this is a stupid question.
I am trying to get AMCL to publish max weight. The plan is to publish it to a float 32 message for now when it's publishing amcl_pose, as amcl_pose checks for the particle with the maximum weight anyway. To do that, I need a float 32 message working, which is where I'm stuck.
Error message:
Starting >>> nav2_amcl_1
--- stderr: nav2_amcl_1

Summary: 0 packages finished [0.62s]
  1 package failed: nav2_amcl_1
  1 package had stderr output: nav2_amcl_1

I have added std_msgs as a dependancy to CMakeLists.txt, and I have added it to amcl_node.hpp as well, but nothing seems to solve the problem.
Thank you in advance.

A:

Solved it. The include should be
#include "std_msgs/msg/float32.hpp"
