Q:

ros package for Kuka LWR IV FRI

Hi everyone,
I would like to know how we can use our Kuka LWR IV as a ROS node. I know that this robot is not in the list of robots that ROS supports, but you can do it through Orocos RTT. Is there any other way to do it? any documentation, tutorial or advice is appreciated.

A:

The best way to use KUKA LWR with ros is to use OROCOS which is integrated with ROS. You should look at code in our repos https://github.com/organizations/RCPRG-ros-pkg . An other important thing is that you need to use xenomai if you need command rate below 5ms.

do I need xenomai or I can use other real time patches for the Linux Kernel? Is orocos somehow bounded to Xenomai?
