Q:

Navigation Experimental and Pose Follower

Hi,
Is there any documentation for navigation_experimental, specially the pose_follower local planner?
I was wondering if it is compatible with the ROS navigation stack? Can this pose_follower local planner be used as a plugin in ROS navigation stack?
Thanks
UPDATE 1
According to this old post, seems pose_follower is not compatible with navfn, because the waypoints need to have orientation too, and navfn does.not provide this info

A:

Yes, IIRC the pose_follower worked as a base_local_planner plugin before (with some previous ROS version I canÂ´t remember :) ). It should be pretty straightforward to just try it out yourself.

Do you remember which global planner did you use with pose_follower. According to this old post, seems it is not compatible with navfn, because the waypoints need to have orientation too, and navfn does.not provide this info

The spbl_lattice_planner probably would be a good choice, as it takes the vehicle's kinematic capabilities into account.
