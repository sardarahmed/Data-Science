Q:

Filtering transform over time

I am using ar_kinect and I'm getting some noise in the orientation. Since my camera motion is relatively slow I wanted to filter the transforms over time. I have designed an FIR filter. I was wondering what is the best way of filtering the transformations.
I was not sure if filtering quaternions would make any sense. Should I convert to RPY and apply the filter?

A:

You should filter on the quaternions.  Their main value is that they don't have singularities and can be cleanly interpolated, which are important if you want to filter.
