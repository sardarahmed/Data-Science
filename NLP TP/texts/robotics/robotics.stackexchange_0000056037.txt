Q:

move_base crashes

Hey all,
I am running: Ubuntu 12.10 64 Bit with ROS Hydra installed using apt.
I was following the navigation tutorial to get move_base running. But after publishing the first topics to it it crashes. I checked all topics in rviz and everything looks ok.
My map is really small: Resizing costmap to 544 X 608 at 0.050000 m/pix
But I also tried higher and lower resolution maps.
GDB gives me the following error:
[ WARN] [1386781814.297755287]: Trajectory Rollout planner initialized with param meter_scoring not set. Set it to true to make your settins robust against changes of costmap resolution.

Program received signal SIGILL, Illegal instruction.
0x00007ffff2ad3d3f in std::vector<double, std::allocator<double> >::_M_insert_aux(__gnu_cxx::__normal_iterator<double*, std::vector<double, std::allocator<double> > >, double const&) () from /usr/lib/libpcl_common.so.1.7

I played around alot with the settings but nothing helped. Also I tried different maps sizes.
Thanks alot!

What operating system, architecture, ROS distribution? Package from apt repo?

Thank you for you feedback! Updated the post: I am running: Ubuntu 12.10 64 Bit with ROS Hydra installed using apt.

A:

I installed Ubuntu 13.05 on a new notebook and did exactly the same installation as stated above. I copied all my code over and now the crashes are gone.
So either there is a problem with my notebook, my installation or with the packages in Ubuntu 12.10.
