Q:

[rospack] Error: stack/package rqt_gui not found

Hello,
I am working on part 6 "Understanding ROS Topics" of the tutorial and I am having a problem with section 1.2.1.  I am running Ubuntu 12.04 with Fuerte and when I try to run
rosrun rqt_gui rqt_gui
It gives me an error saying rqt_gui was not found.  I am not sure why I am missing this package or how to fix it.  I tried reinstalling python-catkin-pkg, but that did not fix the issue.
Does anyone have any ideas how to fix this so I can continue with the tutorial?
Thank you

It seems like I am in fact missing rqt_gui, but when I attempt to update apt-get and then install ros_fuerte_rqt I get the error unable to locate package ros_fuerte_rqt

Nevermind I figured it out.  Dashes instead of underscores.

A:

You need to have rqt_gui installed. You can mke sure it is installed by running:
$ sudo apt-get install ros_fuerte_rqt

In ROS Groovy, replace
$ rosrun rqt_gui rqt_gui

with
$ rqt
