Q:

Inverse kinematics on ROS

Hello,
I'm using ROS to control a hexapod 18dof Robot. I was able to create the urdf model of the robot. But now, to make the robot actually move, I know that I need to generate inverse kinematics of each leg and use it to generate gaits to make the robot move.  My question is: what library or ros package  is best to use for the kinematics ? I study a litle of ros MoveIt but I was not  sure how to start to use it.
Thank you all

Have you looked at this MoveIt! tutorial?
