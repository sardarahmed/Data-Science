Please copy and paste both outputs. Could it be that you use const char* in Arduino and String in ROS?

A:

rosserial encodes the messages. It does not just send the raw data as when you use serial directly.
That is why you see different things.

I thought if it send message data then only it encodes it , like in case when we advertise a topic....So does it encode the normal message also before sending it through serial?
