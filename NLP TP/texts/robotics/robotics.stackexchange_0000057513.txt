Q:

cannot compile footstep_planner

Hi,
I am a new user of ROS and I have tried to run the footstep_planner node and receive this message bellow:

    ERROR: cannot launch node of type [footstep_planner/footstep_planner_node]: can't locate node [footstep_planner_node] in package [footstep_planner]

This message occurred because the compilation was not successfully accomplished (can be seen in the end of the post).
To solve my problem, I have downloaded each octomap package from github and put the directories inside the stack but did not work.
I have tried to rosmake each octomap package, as well as the footstep_planner before, and then rosmake humanoid_navigation, but still did not work.
I don't know why, using ' sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-octomap*'  returns no package for me. Maybe solving this apt-get issue the problem can be solved? Any ideas?

This code block was moved to the following github gist:

A:

After fixing the apt-get repository setup, you can fix the newest errors (humanoid_nav_msgs and sbpl missing) by installing the required packages (via apt-get) ros-groovy-humanoid-nav-msgs and ros-groovy-sbpl.
Alternatively, you can download the source version and compile them in your workspace (but make sure that they are the correct versions for ROS groovy).
