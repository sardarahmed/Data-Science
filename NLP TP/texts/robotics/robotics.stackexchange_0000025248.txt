Q:

run gazebo in virtualbox

I have a project that I'm working on which I will use Gazebo to model
robots. I have installed VirtualBox on my Macbook (Mac os x) and
installed two different ubuntu distributions, and installed Gazebo on
each of them, on both installations, I have faced with problems and
was not able to install in one step although I followed every step in
the instructions for ubuntu.
I would appreciate if you can let me know of the version(and the bit,
32 or 64) of Ubuntu which works best with the Gazebo so I can install
that version and install Gazebo on that. I have tried the last version
of Ubuntu which is 12.04 and 11.10. ( I think both of them were 64 bit
distributions)

A:

The biggest problem is running Gazebo in a virtual machine. I've never had any luck with this kind of setup.
The best solution is to setup a dual boot where your second OS is the latest Ubuntu. Then you'll be able to run Gazebo just fine.
