Q:

Tf frames of a mobile robot

I am working on mobile robot which has kinect mounted on it with an IMU unit.
I am confused about the frames of various types..Considering the above example please tell me what are the following frames.

Map frame
Odom frame
Base frame.

i know that the transformation between the kinect and base frame would be equal to the vector which should be added to base frame to get kinect frame...
Now i dont understand is what is Odom frame and what is the /tf between kinect and odom frame and how is it generated.. is it IMU readings or the Slam output pose for instance as in Gmapping.

A:

You should read this tutorial and then this proposal (REP 105). The proposal lists the differences and meanings of the most important frames (/map, /odom, /base_link).
In your setup the IMU would be responsible for the generation of the /odom -> /base_link transform.
Edit: Damn, too slow again. :D
