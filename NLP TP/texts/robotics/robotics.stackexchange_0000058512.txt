Q:

How to get markers pose in a file?

Hi,
I am using different AR tags and need to know how I can save their poses into a text file so I can use their poses in a MATLAB code. When I use "echo", it gives me a long list with different markers_id and the poses are not fixed. Any suggestion?
Thanks

A:

@ggregory8 is absolutely right with using rosbag.
I also want to mention the solution with plain rosbag.
Record your data with
rosbag record /topic

And then process it in Matlab with the matlab_rosbag package.
