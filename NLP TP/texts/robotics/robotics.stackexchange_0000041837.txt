Q:

How to solve 'undefined reference to symbol 'vtable for boost::detail::thread_data_base'?

follow:Moving the gripper
 Linking CXX executable ../bin/simple_gripper
/usr/bin/ld: CMakeFiles/simple_gripper.dir/src/lian_gripper.o: undefined reference to symbol 'vtable for boost::detail::thread_data_base'
/usr/bin/ld: note: 'vtable for boost::detail::thread_data_base' is defined in DSO /usr/lib/libboost_thread.so.1.46.1 so try adding it to the linker command line
/usr/lib/libboost_thread.so.1.46.1: could not read symbols: Invalid operation
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make[3]: *** [../bin/simple_gripper] Error 1

How to solve it ?
Thank you !!

A:

This typically indicates that you haven't set up you CMakeLists.txt correctly.
You are missing the Boost-related directives, try adding rosbuild_add_boost_directories() and rosbuild_link_boost() to your CMakeLists.txt
It should look something like this:
cmake_minimum_version(VERSION 2.4.6)
include($ENV{ROS_ROOT}/core/rosbuild/rosbuild.cmake

rosbuild_init()
rosbuild_add_boost_directories()
set(EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/bin)
set(LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/lib) 

rosbuild_add_executable(simple_gripper src/simple_gripper.cpp)
rosbuild_link_boost(simple_gripper thread)

For more information on using the CMakeLists.txt file, check out the rosbuild wiki page.
There are also some good examples on the examples page.

Several of my classmates and I all had problems with the tutorial and were able to solve them by adding the boost-related directories.  This should be added to the tutorial documentation.
