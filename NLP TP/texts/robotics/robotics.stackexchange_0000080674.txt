Q:

gmapping with multiple lidars

we have used a single lidar with slam-gmapping but now we want to extend this with multiple lidars (around 4 sick lidars).
is there anyway to maybe merge the data together and continue using slam-gmapping (as ive read AMCL can subscribe to two LaserScan topics and combine it into one topic but would this be feasible).
otherwise is it advisable to have a gmapping node for each lidar and then combine the costmap created
Or alternatively use octomap to input all the data to one map and create a cost map
what would be the best approach?
