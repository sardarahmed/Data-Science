Q:

body acceleration in contact between two bodies

Hey,
I am trying to simulate a wheel(cylinder) on a surface (ground_plane). I launch the gazebo with sdf file which contains both models and give it a 3 seconds to get rest with parameters Kp =380 and Kd=10. I can see the spring rest when I look at the output of position and velocities commands of z axis (GetWorldCoGPose() and GetWorldCoGLinearVel() gazebo API commands), but when I use GetWorldLinearAccel() command I get acceleration z value as zero although the wheel is moving.
Sombody knows why? maybe the GetWorldLinearAccel() is not the right command?
Thanks in advance

A:

Link::GetWorldLinearAccel was broken for quite a while, though it has recently been fixed if you build from source. It will be fixed in a new release of gazebo in the next month or so.
