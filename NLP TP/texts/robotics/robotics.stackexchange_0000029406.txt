Q:

Gazebo fortress won't load once I add Contact plugin

I have this sdf file:
<world name="rl_world">
    <include>
        <uri>path/to/plane.sdf</uri>
    </include>
    <include>
        <uri>/path/to/robot.urdf</uri>
    </include>
    <plugin filename="libignition-gazebo6-contact-system" name="ignition::gazebo::systems::Contact"> </plugin>
</world>

When I try to load in in gazebo with ign gazebo world.sdf it shows a blank grey screen with no entities. It doesn't give an error to the console. If I remove the plugin line it loads fine. Is there something wrong with it?
plane.sdf has a contact sensor on its only link and the TouchPlugin.

A:

This is a known issue (https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-sim/issues/796) where having any plugin in your world prevents default plugins from being loaded, so you'll have to add the Physics and ~SystemBroadcaster~ SceneBroadcaster plugins and any other plugins you might need to your world

Thanks! Working now.
Though for anyone in the future it's SceneBroadcaster. I think 'SystemBroadcaster' was a typo.
