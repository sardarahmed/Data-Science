Q:

The right way to clear out the obstacle on costmap?

Hi all
I confronted a problem. In my application, I need to reset the pose of the robot now and then (by publish to the /initialpose for amcl), however, after I have reset the robot pose, the previous obstacles around the robot are still there on the costmap (global costmap and/or local?) which always resulted in no valid path found by the navfn global planner. I am asking what is the right way to clear out the obstacles on the costmap after I reset the pose of the robot? I am now using fuete.
Thank you everyone!

will clear_costmaps service clears both static and dynamic obstacles or only dynamic obstacles (which are not there in the map) ?

@Dharmateja Kadem, you must configure the layers you want to clean, so it depends what layers you have  and how you populated them. if you want more details, please ask a new question.
