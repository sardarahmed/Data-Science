Q:

Developing with rosjava in Android Studio (Windows)

I need to develop a simple Android which is supposed to show some stats of a robot on the smartphone. I'd like to to this on a windows computer, and if I'm not mistaken that should be possible. However, I know little to nothing about ROS and just have basic knowledge of Android Studio. Furthermore, I found no decent tutorial on what I need to do (either not working and/or outdated). Does someone know some good tutorial or can help me getting started? Thank you!

A:

Hi @Kubi, it may work if you don't need to create any new message or service.
You will need to update your Gradle script to add the Maven repository for rosjava rosjava_mvn_repo. Then, you should be able to add the core depencies for rosjava and ros Android.
Check http://wiki.ros.org/android/Tutorials/kinetic/Installation%20-%20Android%20Studio%20Development%20Environment and http://wiki.ros.org/rosjava/Tutorials/kinetic/No%20Ros%20Installation for reference. I've never tried using that on Windows myself, but in general terms using ROSJava and ROSAndroid should be possible after adding the core dependencies to your buildscripts.

Thanks for the answer! I eventually ended up working on Ubuntu, but the tutorials you linked apply anyways, right? I just dont understand how to upgrade rosjava_mvn_rep...?

Yes; in fact I wouldn't recommend using Windows. I'd suggest you to install rosjava from source; it doesn't take that long. The tutorials already set your buildscripts to point to rosjava_mvn_repo, where the core artifacts are.
If you want to add your own artifacts, that's another story.
