Q:

Build failed in Jenkins debian branches

Few days ago i have started the indexing process of our repository in ROS, as well as releasing some packages. Meanwhile i start receiving build erros from jenkins, it seems to be some version issues or a missing debian branches.
When i ran the bloom release, the only complain during the process are some dependencies in the packages. For example, the iai_kinect2, but i had ignored this errors and continuing with the release. Can this cause the missing debian branches in the realese repo and the consequently cause the erros when the jenkins build it?

<== Failed Could not resolve rosdep

A:

Yes, failing to resolve the necessary dependencies might result in not being able to generate the Debian specific branches. Please try to add the missing dependencies to rosdep and redo the bloom release.
