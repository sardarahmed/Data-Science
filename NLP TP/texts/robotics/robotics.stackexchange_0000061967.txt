Q:

ROS Hydro Amazon EC2

I'm using ubuntu 12.04, ros hydro, and my  computer seems to be too slow sometimes, making ros crashes.
So I'm wondering if I should use a cloud services.
Did somebody already use the Amazone EC2? If yes, did it work fine?
Thank you

A:

Ubuntu 12.04 on EC2 works fine for ROS for us, except that we haven't tried graphical tools (e.g. RViz, rqt).
Just notice that in order to keep the satisfying performance you have to pay certain amount of charge.
