Q:

Can we install ROS-Indigo from cd or usb?

We have a system without an option to connect to the internet. Is there any way to install ROS from a CD or pendrive?

A:

Use this command to download the .deb package:

sudo apt-get -d install "package"

And then, you should found this package in:
"/var/cache/apt/archives/"
Now you can install the package with:

sudo dpkg -i /path/to/file.deb

Thanks for the answer. I have installed the ROS hydro using the command sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-desktop-full and  i have a lot of ros related .deb files in :"/var/cache/apt/archives/". Does the -d option in sudo apt-get -d install "package" makes it as a single .deb file?
