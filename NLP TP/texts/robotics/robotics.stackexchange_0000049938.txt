Q:

publish to android node

Hi,
I have installed the android_tutorial_pubsub on android device and able to connect to roscore on my computer (I see the chatter topic in the topic lists). I run a Talker node on my computer and see the data publish to the chatter topic correctly. However, the rosTextView node on my android device doesnt show anything.
Do you know how to publish data to a node on android device?
Thanks in advance.

can you run rxgraph and see that both your rosTextView  and talker node both appear?
Comment by Gosu on 2013-04-04:
Yes, both the node appear, but my talker node only publish to /rostopic.

A:

In android_tutorial_pubsub, the NodeConfiguration is private. Nodes on your PC will not be able to communicate with those on your Android device.
Try changing the NodeConfiguration to a public one. See the NodeConfiguration.newPublic documentation.

Check your ROS_IP and ROS_MASTER_URI settings. Also check the host string you're using in your NodeConfiguration.
