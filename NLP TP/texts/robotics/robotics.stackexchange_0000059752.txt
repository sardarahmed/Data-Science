Q:

Only QwtPlot working. No graph in PyQtGraph and MatPlot

Hi
I am trying to plot my data and are having some trouble.
The problem is that only QwtPlot is able to plot my data. I like PyQtGraph the best so i would like to use this. At first glance it looks like it doesn't receive any data, but when i look at the Y-axis it autoscrolls according to the data on the topic. The X-axis is not moving thou.
I am able to plot other topics with both PyQtGraph and MatPlot, so this is an event only occuring when plotting this topic.
This is the message I am sending:
Header header
string[] name
float64[] position
float64[] velocity
float64[] effort
I am trying to get the position on the plot.
Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong here?

A:

Do the messages you're sending have the timestamp in the header set properly?
The matplotlib and pyqtgraph plots use the timestamps for the X axis, and the qwtplot plots only use the received message order.

Probably not. How do I do that?

Before you publish your message, just do msg.header.stamp = ros::Time::now(); in C++ or msg.header.stamp = rospy.Time.now() in python.
