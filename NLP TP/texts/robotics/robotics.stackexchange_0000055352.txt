Q:

ROS for x86 Galileo board using Yocto

Hi community,
I'd like to create a Linux for my brand new x86 Intel Galileo board. The installed Linux is based on a Yocto-build, which is source-code available.
Has anyone got experience on how to package ROS with Yocto? I found only a year old thread on this topic, where it has been discussed for ARM devices. State back then was more or less, no further info available (yet)...
Best regards
Christoph

A:

Since beginning of this year there is a project that provides a build-layer for Yocto:

Stumbled over it by pure luck, but initial installation worked ok, so I can recommend it as a good starting Point :-)

Meanwhile I switched to Intel Edison (as Galileo turned out to be quite on the lowest possible edge of what is still doable for ROS). I have good experiences with meta-ros.
Good luck everyone! :-)
