Q:

Red [ERROR] output in python in ROS

In ROS, I cannot get [ERROR] logs to print in red when I use python. How can I make them appear in red instead of black?

For example, the following Python:
rospy.logerr("No analog input received.")

produces this output in black:

[ERROR] [WallTime: 135601422.876123] No analog input received.

whereas the following C++:
ROS_ERROR("No analog input received.");

produces the following output in red.

[ERROR] [135601551.192412]: No analog input received.
