Q:

Clock - How to change it?

Hi,
I've been trying to work in simulation from massages that I have already recorded in a bag file, but I allways get warn messages saying that it is not possible to use the data because it is too old.
I've been reading about simulating a clock, but I can not figure it out how to use it. Could you help me please?
Thanks.

Hi!
What I normally do is I set the use_sim_time parameter to true:
$ rosparam set use_sim_time true
and then play the bag as following:
$ rosbag play bag.bag --clock
That shall get over the old messages hump.

Done, i can simulate now!

Then, you should change the parameter value of the use_sim_time as true in the launch file.

I saw that at the very beginning of the launch file the parameter has been setting as false....

I'm doing exactly this: 1- run the roscore 2- run the nodes 3- rosbag play bag.bag --clock but I keep getting the same error and the time printed in the messages as roswarn or rosinfo is not the one in the massages i'm simulating.
