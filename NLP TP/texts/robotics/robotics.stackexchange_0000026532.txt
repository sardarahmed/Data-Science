Q:

[quick question] what is color descption and  in SDF?

hi
I have quesiton about the  tap.
The  tap is under:
<sensor> 
     <image>
            <format>
            

According to Gazebo Sdf documentation
 Description of <format> :

(L8|R8G8B8|B8G8R8|BAYER_RGGB8|BAYER_BGGR8|BAYER_GBRG8|BAYER_GRBG8)
Required: 0    Type: string    Default: R8G8B8 

If I want the color to be only black or white, which format should I choose?
Thank you all
