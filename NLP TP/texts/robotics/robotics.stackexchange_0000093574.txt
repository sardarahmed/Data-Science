Q:

ROS Graph Messages Build

Hi,
I'm ROS1 beginner, and I've been trying to get moveit installed and running. When running catkin_make, cmake fails with:
-- +++ processing catkin package: 'moveit_commander'
-- ==> add_subdirectory(moveit/moveit_commander)
-- +++ processing catkin package: 'rviz_visual_tools'
-- ==> add_subdirectory(rviz_visual_tools)
-- Could NOT find graph_msgs (missing: graph_msgs_DIR)
-- Could not find the required component 'graph_msgs'. The following CMake error indicates that you either need to install 
   the package with the same name or change your environment so that it can be found.
  CMake Error at /opt/ros/melodic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:83 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "graph_msgs" with
  any of the following names:

   graph_msgsConfig.cmake

I've tried installing it with rosdep install rosgraph_msgs, which says the installation was successful. However, when I run roswtf, I get the following error:
ERROR: The core ROS message libraries (std_msgs and rosgraph_msgs) have not been built.

I then tried cloning the source for the rosgraph_msgs repo from https://github.com/ros/ros_comm_msgs, but it doesn't provide a rosinstall file or a CMakeLists.txt file.
For further info here is the output of env | grep -i ros:

A:

I've tried installing it with rosdep install rosgraph_msgs, which says the installation was successful.

The package you're looking for is not rosgraph_msgs, but graph_msgs. Those are two different packages.
You should be able to install the latter with:
sudo apt install ros-melodic-graph-msgs

Please also note that rosdep install deals with package dependencies. Not packages themselves directly.
Use apt to install packages, or build them in your workspace (but don't do the latter, unless absolutely necessary). See also #q320046.

Ah ok, I noticed the repository here but I figured it couldn't be it as it seemed to have very little activity ha. Thanks so much for the help!

I'm also wondering why you're building MoveIt from sources, but that is a different question.

I was following the tutorial here. It seems to have me clone several repos into my catkin workspace /src/ folder, then run catkin_make.

Have you seen the notice at the top of the page:

This is the latest version, which is actively developed. For beginners, we recommmend the stable Melodic tutorials. If you are still running a Kinetic release, please use the Kinetic tutorials.
