Q:

How to submit a bug/patch for joint_state_publisher

I believe I have a found a bug within the joint_state_publisher.  I would like to submit a bug/patch but I cannot find the proper bug trac.
The package wiki doesn't have a link: http://www.ros.org/wiki/joint_state_publisher
The stack wiki has a link, but it is broken: http://www.ros.org/wiki/robot_model_visualization
Any help would be appreciated.
