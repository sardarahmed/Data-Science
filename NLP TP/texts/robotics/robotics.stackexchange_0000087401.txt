Q:

what to choose between IMU and GYRO

hi ,
i have some troubles with the navigation stack ,i'm working with the wheel encoder and  it seems that the odometry is drifting ( when rotating )  so i'm looking to add another sensor like an IMU or GYRO  compatible with ros  but i'm new in ros and i don't know what to choose  so i'm wondering if  you have any advices ?
thanks ,

Gyro is part of IMU that read robot angle velocity. So choosing IMU or gyro is even not right question.

thanks for answering  i saw somewhere gyro sensor that's why i'm confused  , so which IMU sensor is working fine with ros ?

A:

If you're working in a solely planar environment and only looking for yaw, a gyro would be nice, that is all the turtlebot has.
This listing gives you a non-exhaustive list of drivers available as a jump off point. http://wiki.ros.org/Sensors
If you find a hobby IMU from adafruit / similar vendors, chances are there's a simple minimum example for reading values somewhere you can wrap in ROS in 30 minutes, many themselves will have unsupported ROS drivers from other users.
