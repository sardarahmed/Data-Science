Q:

Turtlebot navigation on Hydro, OSX

I see that there are clear instructions given to install turtlebot navigation, such as the one here http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot/Tutorials/hydro/Installation
I would like to use my machine with OS X 10.8 and ROS Hydro(Installed already) to communicate to the turtlebot through the turtlebot navigation stack.
Can someone give instructions on how I can install the turtlebot stack on my current setup?
Right now this is the procedure I am trying to follow.
$ mkdir ~/turtlebot_ws
$ cd ~/turtlebot_ws
$ source /path/to/hydro/install/setup.bash
$ rosinstall_generator turtlebot_launch --deps --exclude RPP --tar > turtlebot-hydro.rosinstall
$ wstool init src -j8 openni-hydro.rosinstall
$ rosdep install --from-paths ./src --ignore-src -y --skip-keys "libopenni-dev libopenni-sensor-primesense-dev ftdi-eeprom avahi-daemon avahi-utils libftdi-dev libavahi-core-dev redis-server libusb-dev libavahi-client-dev"

If you see the last command, there are too many keys that need to be skipped because there occurs an error like this for each of the package specified above.
zeroconf_avahi: No definition of [libavahi-client-dev] for OS [osx]
after this I did
$ catkin_make install

Expectedly, I got the following errors, since I had skipped all the packages while I was installing the dependencies through rosdep.
Users/Siva/turtlebot_ws/src/kobuki_core/kobuki_ftdi/src/ftdi_kobuki.cpp:60:10: fatal error: 'ftdi.h' file not found

Kindly help.

I don't know what software is involved to get this level of Turtlebot support working. The general process for installing any ROS package on OS X is similar to my answer to your other question: http://answers.ros.org/question/158546/openni-and-kinect-on-hydro-osx-108/?answer=158751#post-id-158751

Upvote the question. I fail to build one of turtlebot_simulator dependecies: create_gazebo_plugins

Hi, Can you post the error that you are encountering. Please add another question for that.

This way you can get turtlebot_simulator compiled on 10.9: http://answers.ros.org/question/169971/fail-to-build-create_gazebo_plugins-package-on-mac-os-x-109/?answer=170726#post-id-170726

Hi, I need the actual turtlebot packages to run my turtlebot and teleop it with my keyboard. Kindly guide me on that.

Have you tried to follow the instructions that @William suggested in the comments above (replacing openni_camera with whatever packages you need)?
Comment by karthik_ms on 2014-05-28:
@demmeln Edited the question with my results.

A:

Like in my answer for the other question, make sure that you call rosdep update regularly, in particular if you notice keys are not being resolved (OS X is far less covered than e.g. Ubuntu). If you ignore keys, you often have to still install libraries yourself. brew search ftdi and brew search usb helps. In this case you need brew install libftdi0 libusb.
Once you find out the correct resolution of a missing key, you can always edit this file to contribute to the rosdep rules for OS X: https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/blob/master/rosdep/osx-homebrew.yaml
I have recently added libftdi and libusb has been there also for some time.
