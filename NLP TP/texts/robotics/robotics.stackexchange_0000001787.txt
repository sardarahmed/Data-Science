Q:

How do I send text to a Torobot USB device?

I'm trying to get the "Torobot" USB servo controller to work with Angstrom Linux on a Beagle Board XM.
The servo controller registers as a USB device. The device just takes simple text commands, but there is no TTY associated with it. So I'm not sure how to send commands to it.
Can I just send data like this (assuming that 002/005 is the device):
$ cat file.txt >> /dev/bus/usb/002/005

Or do I need to associate it with the generic USB device? If so, how do I do that?

A:

Finally Success:
I found that the Torobot USB board could be communicated with an Arduino serial driver.  Conveniently this is available through opkg:
opkg install kernel-module-cdc-acm

When the board is plugged in, it comes up as
/dev/ttyACM0 

From here you can  simply echo commands to the device.  
echo "#8P1500T100" > /dev/ttyACM0

This basically says "set servo 8 to position 1500 with speed 100"
