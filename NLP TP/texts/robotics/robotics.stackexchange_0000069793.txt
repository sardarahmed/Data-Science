Q:

Not all topics publishing data

Hi
A few topics macros topics won't publish. But most do. I am interested in getting the topic /mavros/rc/out. However, whenever I
`$rostopic echo /mavros/rc/out'
There is no data.
I have a Pixhawk with the px4 flight stack and I am connecting it to a raspberry pi 2 running ubuntu with ROS indigo. Does anyone know of a solution to this?

A:

That depends on how you setup connection. If using SYS_COMPANION parameter then you should request servo topics.
Place extras.txt on your SD card to etc folder (full path: /fs/microsd/etc/extras.txt):
#!nsh
# additional streams for SYS_COMPANION
mavlink stream -d /dev/ttyS2 -s SERVO_OUTPUT_RAW_0 -r 20
