Q:

Why PCL's download version is 1.5.1 but its doc is 1.6.0?

Here is PCL download page.
Here is PCL doc page.
Where is PCL 1.6.0 to download?
What's happened that PCL's download version is 1.5.1 but its doc is 1.6.0?
Thank you~

A:

This isn't really an answers.ros.org question, but that's because those are the in-development documents, which apply to the next version of PCL, which is going to be 1.6.
