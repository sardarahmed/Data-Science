Q:

cloudsim doesn't accept .pem file arguments

Either there is a cloudsim-1.0.0 bug, or a problem with .pem files

./create_cloudsim.py my.name@gmail.com pk-XYZ.pem sa-XYZ.pem
results in the error message:
inside/cgi-bin
cloudsimd/launchers
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./create_cloudsim.py", line 40, in 
    import common
ImportError: No module named commoncode

A:

When you make an AWS key pair and save it on your machine, it is saved as a .pem file pair. It would be convenient to be able to just use these files.

CloudSim uses Access Keys (not key pairs, sorry) to connect to AWS. AWS provides them on the Access Keys tab on the AWS Security Credentials page.
