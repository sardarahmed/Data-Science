Q:

Eloquent subscribers with SystemDefaultsQoS missing messages

I started building and testing (and blooming) one of my packages for eloquent. Compared to the same code in dashing, one of the subscribers seems to miss messages now (which I can see being communicated, using ros2 topic echo).
Did the SystemDefaultsQoS change between dashing and eloquent in a way that would justify this behaviour?
I am building the system_modes package in a Lubuntu 1804 development setup (ROS 2 from sources). The subscriber in question is this one: https://github.com/micro-ROS/system_modes/blob/master/system_modes/src/mode-monitor-node.cpp#L253-L255 which is missing single parameter events from events that come in bursts.

A:

I upgraded my setup to latest Eloquent and configured the ParameterEvent subscriber in question with rclcpp::ParameterEventsQoS(), which solved the issue.
