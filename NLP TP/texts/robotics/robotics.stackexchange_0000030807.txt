Q:

Projector calibration?

Are there standard tools for projector calibration in ROS or OpenCV?  I've seen some scattered projects on the web but it would be great to have more built-in functionality for the instance of a projector mounted on a robot.
I think the standard approach is to have a in-scene chessboard to determine the position of the surface that the projector then projects a chessboard onto which determines the intrinsic/extrinsic projector parameters- it seems like cv::calibrateCamera could almost accomplish this but some steps are missing.

A:

I don't believe this exists.  I suggest you file a feature request on the opencv trac
