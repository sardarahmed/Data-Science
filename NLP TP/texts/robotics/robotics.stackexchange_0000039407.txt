Q:

building android_core failed

I am trying to build rosjava_core and android_core from source with Android SDK (r17) and ROS (electric). Here are the steps I've tried:
hg clone https://code.google.com/p/rosjava rosjava_core
hg clone https://code.google.com/p/rosjava.android android_core

From http://docs.rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/rosjava_core/html/building.html
roscd rosjava_core
./gradlew install

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception:
Exception occurred:
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pygments/lexers/__init__.py", line 80, in get_lexer_by_name
    raise ClassNotFound('no lexer for alias %r found' % _alias)
ClassNotFound: no lexer for alias u'groovy' found
The full traceback has been saved in /tmp/sphinx-err-xdEEl7.log, if you want to report the issue to the developers.
Please also report this if it was a user error, so that a better error message can be provided next time.
Either send bugs to the mailing list at <http://groups.google.com/group/sphinx-dev/>,
or report them in the tracker at <http://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx/issues/>. Thanks!

As suggested, please post the output from running with --info/--debug/--stacktrace since the cause of the build failure is not in the output you shared.

A:

You're missing the compressed_visualization_transport_msgs package. If you install the google stack (http://ros.org/wiki/google, ./gradlew install) this error should go away. You may need to try ./gradlew clean debug.
