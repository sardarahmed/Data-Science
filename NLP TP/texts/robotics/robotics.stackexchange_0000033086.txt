Q:

Could not initialise Stage with Segmentation fault error

Hi,
I am new to ROS so please help me with this.
I follow the tutorial to set up Stage and everything was fine until I am trying to use stageros to load an existing world file (also part of the tutorial)
Input:
tuan@tuan-laptop:/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/simulator_stage/stage$ ./bin/stageros world/willow-erratic.world
Output:
Segmentation fault.
The error message is too simple and do not provide much information for me to debug. Please help.
Thanks very much.
Tuan.

Thanks very much. I was using Ubuntu 10.04 and the problem is solved when I upgrade to Ubuntu 10.10. I really appreciate your help. Tuan.

Can you try it in a debugger (gdb --args ./bin/stageros world/willow-erratic.world) and post a backtrace (bt) from the segfault?

Can you load any other world file? Do you get any output besides "Segmentation Fault"?

A:

As @Tuan said, upgrading to 10.10 worked, more like cannot reproduce.
