Q:

Reading bumper state from PR2

System: Ubuntu 10.10, kernel 2.6.35-27, 64 bit.
ROS: Latest diamondback from the repositories.
I'm following the PR2 tutorial here:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/pr2_simulator/Tutorials/BasicPR2Controls
Everything works fine, I'm mostly interested in the gripper and I can open and close it using rostopic.
What I can't do is read the state of the bumper:
when I execute rostopic echo l_gripper_l_finger_bumper/state
I get the following error message:
WARNING: no messages received and simulated time is active.
Is /clock being published?

Executing rostopic echo /clock indicates that the clock is indeed being published.
Has anyone else gotten the bumper plugin to work? Any hints/tips?

I thought that since it is defined in the relevant .urdf.xarco and since the topic appears, it would be. But I see that I'm wrong. How can I enable the topic?

I can't find any reference to "bumper" on that page what makes you think that topic is being publshed?

A:

Hi, The plugin was not publishing if no contacts exists for the referenced body.  I patched the plugin so bumper publishes regardless it is in contact or not, please see ticket #4872 and patch.
sorry for the confusion.
