Q:

Are there macros which define the ROS version?

I'd like to add some preprocessor conditions to allow some code to build in both Cturtle and Diamondback (and others in the future). Are there defines that indicate which version code is being compiled in?

It is exactly the answer. You should copy that as an answer so the question can be closed.
