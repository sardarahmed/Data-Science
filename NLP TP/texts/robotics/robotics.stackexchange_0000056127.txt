Q:

class_loader poco error

I'm trying to onstall hydro to my macbook air and i got the following error when i'm building the catkin workspace:
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:6 (find_package):
Found package configuration file:
/Users/.../ros_catkin_ws/src/class_loader/cmake/PocoConfig.cmake

but it set Poco_FOUND to FALSE so package "Poco" is considered to be NOT
FOUND.
I didn't find any solutions, maybe you have one..

I'm having the same problem after both installing poco from the repositories (libpoco-dev) and by downloading and compiling the source.  No matter what I do with poco and the cmakelists file I can't get it to find poco.

A:

I've managed to fix that particular error by just installing poco via homebrew
brew install poco

But now i'm stuck with another error a little bit further down the way
