Q:

Hector_slam and robot_localization

Hi,
I am trying to fuse my hokuyo urg laser scan with my IMU data and use in hector_slam.
Currently hector_slam takes in the hokuyo laser scan data and outputs it to /poseupdate then I combine
that with my IMU data using robot_localization where I get a odometry/filtered that is the combination of both. But I don't know how to get it back into hector_slam to be able to get a more precesise positon.
How would I go about puting it back to hector_slam?
Am I doing this wrong?
Ros noob,
Thank you

A:

I'm not sure what you mean by getting the combination back into hector_slam. What exactly would you expect the result to be?
As far as I know the only way to give prior information into hector slam is via TF, and even then, it only serves as a starting point for the scan-to-map matching, meaning that there is no probabilistic fusion between the prior and the information of the laser scan matching.
