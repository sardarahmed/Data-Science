Q:

Print the Camera parameters from the file created after Camera Calibration

I have calibrated my monocular camera using the ROS Tutorial.
After calibrating the camera, a .yaml file got created which contains the various parameters of the camera.
Task: I want to print the coordinated of the center which are stored in .yml file. I think that i can do so by subscribing the camera parameter info but i don't know how can i do so?

A:

rostopic echo /camera/camera_info

Change  'camera' to your camera name. This is really basic tutorial level stuff btw.

See the publish / subscriber tutorial for creating a subscriber to a topic. Change the topic to the camera info topic.
