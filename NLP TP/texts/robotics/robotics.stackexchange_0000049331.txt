Q:

Rosserial and Arduino DUE

Hi,
I tried to compile a .ino for my Arduino DUE with rosserial package and Arduino IDE-1.5.2, but this warning happens :
ArduinoHardware.h:68: warning: undefined reference to `HardwareSerial::begin(unsigned long)'

And that is surely why I can't communicate with serial port when I use ROS :
Lost sync with device

However, the code compiles and works with an Arduino MEGA.
Does anyone had this problem before ?

Have you found a resolution to your problem?

A:

It is necessary to use UARTClass or USARTClass (which are subclasses of HardwareSerial). See http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=142753.0. I haven't gotten Rosserial communicating yet, but my progress notes are here: http://wiki.jigren.org/index.php?title=Rosserial_On_Arduino_Due
