Q:

gazebo standalne version cannot be started as usual after installing gazebo ros packages

Hello
I have installed gazebo 1.9 and gazebo_ros_pkgs successfully following the instructions in the tutorials both installed from source and I am running ros groovy. And I tested gazebo using this command :
rosrun gazebo_ros gazebo , and it run successfully as well.
But the problem is when I want  to run gazebo standalone with my world file  as usual without ros integration as following  “gazebo file.world “
Even though there is no other gazebo running I get this error :Exception [Master.cc:50] Unable to start server[Address already in use]. There is probably another Gazebo process running.
Any solutions for this error!
Thanks in advance!
