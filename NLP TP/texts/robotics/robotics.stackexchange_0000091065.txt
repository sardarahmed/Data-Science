Q:

How to use custom base.yaml and python.yaml for rosdep

How can I point rosdep to custom files rosdep/base.yaml and rosdep/python.yaml?
I would like to test changes to the rosdep files before submitting a PR to the upstream repo or use my custom rosdep fork in a CI environment and not have to wait for my PR to be merged.

A:

You can add a rule to the rosdep sources list with your custom rules: https://docs.ros.org/independent/api/rosdep/html/sources_list.html
You can use a file:// url for local files for quick testing.

Do you mean to change all links in the file /etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d/20-default.list? E.g. from yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/rosdep/python.yaml to yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<your_user>/rosdistro/<your_branch>/rosdep/python.yaml.

You can insert instead of replacing. The first match is used. That will be easier to revert. And if you have a fork on GitHub that's the right sort of url.
