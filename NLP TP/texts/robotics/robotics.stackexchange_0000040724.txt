Q:

How do I make a debian binary out of my stacks and get it listed as a ros package?

I have a stack that's fairly well-behaved with the standard ros tools and such (rosmake cleanly, etc) and listed on ROS.org so it's known by the ROS indexer.  How do I get it from this stage to where someone else can do an 'apt-get install PACKAGE-NAME' at the command-line?
Package in question: http://www.ros.org/wiki/rcommander_core
Repository: https://code.google.com/p/gt-ros-pkg.rcommander-core/

A:

Seems that you already have it listed on ros.org as you posted the link.
For a release see here: http://www.ros.org/wiki/release given that this is still valid.

Does listing it on ros.org impact how it'll be released?

Listing it on ros.org is independent but should usually come first.

I created a guide to listing packages on ros.org at: http://ros.org/wiki/Repositories/IndexSubmission
