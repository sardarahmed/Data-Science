Q:

Aluminum vs Carbon Fiber

So building a quadrocopter from scratch HAS a lot of decision making, and I need some input on the material choice. 
I have short listed Aluminum and Carbon Fiber for the Arms and support of the Quadrocopter. 
I am a little short on cash to experiment with both of them. 
So considering that I have enough money to buy either of those, and assuming that I have access to general tools like a Table Saw, Horizontal Band Saw, CNC Router and a Water jet. 
What would be a better material to work with
EDIT:
I will be deciding the specs around the frame so as to allow me some design liberty. So right now, my goal is to assemble a very durable, as-light-as possible frame, which can withstand a lot of experimentation on the electrical side.

A:

If your goal is to experiment, then use the cheapest option possible -- it will give you the freedom to make more mistakes.  Carbon fiber would be great if your design is in a fairly final state, but are you 100% assured that you correctly determined all the thicknesses, mounting holes, wiring guides, etc?  Are you good enough working with carbon fiber to successfully build what you designed?  These are serious things to consider if you are on a budget.
Balsa wood is a fairly cheap way to get started, and there are plenty of others (for example, if it's light enough then you may be able to use a sheet of foam).
Will it look pretty?  No.  But that's a prototype for you; if you're too heavily invested in the appearance/workmanship of the first draft, you'll fail to make newer & better drafts.
