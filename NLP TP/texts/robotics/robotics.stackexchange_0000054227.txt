Q:

Concatenating pointclouds gets very slow

Hi guys, I have implemented an algorithm that uses ransac to align pointclouds obtained by consecutive scenes and add them to a pointcloud representing the map called total_cloud using the pcl concatenate function. So total_cloud starts empty and then gradually grows as more pointclouds are aligned and added.
My question is why does it get slower and slower as the map gets bigger? I am not using total_cloud in any other computation so it is not part of my computation, only adding the new aligned pointcloud to it. Is this normal or am I doing something wrong? From my understanding, total_cloud is a just a chunk of memory that is growing dynamically, and is not part of any computation.
Any help or advice would be much appreciated.
Best regards,
Khalid

A:

Dynamically growing memory is very expensive as it will require reallocating and copying data. It's usually more expensive than operating on the data.
