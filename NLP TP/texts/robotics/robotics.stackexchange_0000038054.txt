Q:

Use 3-Axis Accelerometer to calculate theta?

Hi,
is it possible to use a 3-Axis Accelerometer to estimate theta for the odometry (on a car-like robot, without a gyroscope)?

A:

You mean the yaw angle? No, you can't do that with accelerometers, as they measure linear acceleration, not angular rates like gyroscopes do (The angular rate has to be integrated to get an angle estimate in that case).
Using multiple highly accurate accelerometers placed on different parts of the vehicle one could in theory estimate the angular rate, but that's irrelevant here I guess.
