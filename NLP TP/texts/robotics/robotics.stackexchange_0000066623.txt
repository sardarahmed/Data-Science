Q:

Missing turtle_tf_message_filter on Ubuntu 12.04

Hi,
I was working through the tf tutorials, and in the part about message filters, I had an error when I launched the turtle_tf_sensor.lauch.
roslaunch turtle_tf turtle_tf_sensor.launch 

Error message:
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [turtle_tf/turtle_tf_message_filter]: can't locate node [turtle_tf_message_filter] in package [turtle_tf]

Indeed, there is no turtle_tf_message_filter file in /opt/ros/hydro/lib/turtle_tf on my Ubuntu 12.04 32-bit PC. The package was install via the apt ros-hydro-turtle-tf package.
But the file is in the Github repo on the hydro-devel branch so I think there is an issue with the packaging for Ubuntu 12.04 but I do not know where to report that issue.
Thanks

A:

Looking at the CMakeLists.txt of turtle_tf (here), it would indeed seem to be the case that the turtle_tf_message_filter node is not installed ( the other C++ nodes are installed on these lines).
As for reporting this: I'd just post an issue on the geometry_tutorials/issues tracker.
