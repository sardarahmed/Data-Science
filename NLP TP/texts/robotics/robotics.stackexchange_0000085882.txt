Q:

Is it possible to send a costum message via simple message instead of a trajectory message?

I'm working on a connection between the abb yumi robot. I know that the simple message connection needs a client on the robot controller and a ros server, that sends the data. Therefore I want to edit the rapid modules. Anyways refering to the title, I just noticed that the Robot Client is used to send trajectories. Is there any way to send a modified message to the rapid server?

This requires a nuanced answer.
Yes, it is possible, if you're willing to edit the sources of abb_driver and extend it to be able to deal with your new messages.
No, this is not possible with the current abb_driver binaries.

Thanks. I worked on that topic today and I know what I have to modify. I'm currently deciding, whether I use the Robot Client nodes and create a costumized message handler or create my own message downloader.

If I'm not mistaken both options would be about the same work, with the custom downloader needing both an additional socket as well as a bit more work.
