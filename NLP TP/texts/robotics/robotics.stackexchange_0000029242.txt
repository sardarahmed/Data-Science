Q:

Is is possible to change frame_id of a sensor?

Hi, I would like to change frame_id of a laser sensor in ignition gazebo simulation plugin:
<plugin
  filename="libignition-gazebo-sensors-system.so"
  name="ignition::gazebo::systems::Sensors">

But I couldn't find any support on how to do it: https://ignitionrobotics.org/api/gazebo/5.1/classignition_1_1gazebo_1_1systems_1_1Sensors.html
It seems like the frame_id for a sensor is always ${name_of_model}/${name_of_link}/${name_of_scan}.
It was possible to change odom frame_id and child_frame_id for the diff_drive plugin: https://ignitionrobotics.org/api/gazebo/5.1/classignition_1_1gazebo_1_1systems_1_1DiffDrive.html. So I would guess it might be possible also for sensors.
Any clue how to do it?
Thank you very much in advance.

A:

It doesn't look like you can change the frame_id for the internal ignition laser scan message but you can add the element below to the sdf under the sensor to get a custom frame_id when using the ros_ign bridge.
<ignition_frame_id>custom_name_here</ignition_frame_id>

Thank you! Here is the related code parsing the frame_id string: https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-sensors/blob/bbdb620d0ab9c3cc4331e8006f1ce1fa79f9bb2d/src/Sensor.cc#L148-L151
