Q:

Command for creating new file / document

Hi!
I couldn't create a new file in a folder using ros command line in terminal. Is there any /roscommand for that?

I can easily create in explorer  for new document
I can easily create in cpp or python ide.
I just want to see if I can create without leaving the terminal

Does touch <filename> do what you want?
This doesn't seem like a ROS question though.

Thank you, As I mentioned in my question I tried to find if there was a ros command for that. It seems there is not. gedit new_file just works well. Also vi works somehow

A:

Afaik, there is no "ROS command" to create a new file.
I also believe that would not be very useful:

it would increase maintenance for ROS (core) maintainers
managing files is a task for the OS, which has plenty of tools/utilities to do that
using existing tools instead of introducing something new allows users to reuse their experience and doesn't invalidate their expectations around such tools

A quick way to create a new file in an arbitrary package (in your workspace of course) could be something like:
rospd <package_name>
touch my_new_file
rospd

To then edit that file:
rosed <package_name> my_new_file

See also the rosbash documentation.
