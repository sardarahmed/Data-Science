Q:

nao teleop and camera feed

Hi, I can't seem to get the Brown University Nao driver to work, nor the alufr (Freiburg) teleop package to work.  I'm using the new Nao h25 model, with NaoQi library included in the linux Choregraphe download (I believe it is version 1.10)
[alufr] What I am able to get is odometry and joint information, via running nao_ctrl/nao_sensors.py remotely.  When I run nao_ctrl/nao_walker.py, the robot will respond to "stand up" and "joystick control enabled" buttons, but won't actually walk.  I'm using a PS3 joystick, and I checked /joy topic and indeed the walk axes (specified in ps3joystick.yaml) are getting published.
[brown] When I run (locally on the robot) ./eyes, I am told "Could not get shared memory" (same issue as on [http://code.google.com/p/brown-ros-pkg/issues/detail?id=7]).  When I run control.py, I get SOAP errors of the form "setVolume not a member of tts" and "setStiffness not a member of motion" ...
Thanks for any assistance!

A:

OK, got alufr joystick walking to work! I may not have been hitting the right button sequence; it seems the requirement is:

EnableControl button (robot speaks aloud "joystick control enabled")
InitPose button (robot stands up)
Walk around with joystick axes

I also may have been pointing to the wrong version of naoqi-sdk.
I am still having issues cross-compiling ROS for the nao... but I'll open a distinct ticket for that.
Thanks!
