A:

I suggest reading about the Hector SLAM from this page and how to set up for your robot or do laser sensor only mapping. Of course do the basic ROS tutorial first. Learning by doing is the best practice. Try first and if you fail ask the community for help. ROS tutorials and Hector SLAM has well written wiki page and tutorials for any beginner level ROS user to understand clearly and concisely.

HI, I think those links are very basic. Can you give link to some better tutorials?
