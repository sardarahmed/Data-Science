Q:

ros2 run rviz on remote machine

Hi everyone, I'm quite new approaching ROS2, I'm wondering if it is possible to run Rviz on a machine and run a set of nodes on another having them connected by a network, I remember that on ROS1 it was possible thanks by setting ROS_MASTER_URI and ROS_IP.
I didn't found anything on ROS2. Do you know if it is possible?
Thank you

A:

Yes, this is possible. In fact it's easier then w/ ros1. Just make sure both machines are on the same network and are using the same ROS_DOMAIN_ID (default is 0, so should work fine by default unless you changed something)

To add more information to this answer, when running ROS2 on a container, just launch it with the
-e ROS_DOMAIN_ID=<number>

argument and it will launch ROS2 and setup everything.
Otherwise in the shell just do:
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=<number>
source /opt/ros/<version>/setup.bash
