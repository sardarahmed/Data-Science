Q:

overlay class_loader, cannot catkin_make

I am trying to overlay http://wiki.ros.org/class_loader in my environment. As far as I can tell, it's a catkin package, so I've cloned the git repo into the src directory of my catkin workspace.
First it was complaining about the cmake_modules package. It didn't look like I had that ros package, so I just checked out its source too. Now it's not complaining about that anymore.
I am on Groovy and Ubuntu 12.04. I have the ubuntu package libpoco-dev already  installed.
Here are the current complaints:

-- +++ processing catkin package: 'cmake_modules'
-- ==> add_subdirectory(cmake_modules)
-- +++ processing catkin package: 'class_loader'
-- ==> add_subdirectory(class_loader)
CMake Error at class_loader/CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package):
  Could not find module FindPoco.cmake or a configuration file for package
  Poco.

  Adjust CMAKE_MODULE_PATH to find FindPoco.cmake or set Poco_DIR to the
  directory containing a CMake configuration file for Poco.  The file will
  have one of the following names:

    PocoConfig.cmake
    poco-config.cmake

CMake Error at /opt/ros/groovy/share/catkin/cmake/catkin_package.cmake:159 (message):
  catkin_package() DEPENDS on 'Poco' which must be find_package()-ed before.
  If it is a catkin package it can be declared as CATKIN_DEPENDS instead
  without find_package()-ing it.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /opt/ros/groovy/share/catkin/cmake/catkin_package.cmake:98 (_catkin_package)
  class_loader/CMakeLists.txt:11 (catkin_package)

-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
make: *** [cmake_check_build_system] Error 1
Invoking "make cmake_check_build_system" failed

EDIT:
I hadn't checked out the groovy-devel branch. Now when try to build, it gets further and eventually produces the following errors:

Presumably I have to also pull the latest ros/package.h?

Can we see your CMakeLists.txt?

@2ROS0, sorry about the delay. given the new edits, should I still post the CMakeLists.txt? I am guessing you mean the class_loader one, not the top-level workspace one.

A:

I am on Groovy and Ubuntu 12.04

and

First it was complaining about the cmake_modules package. It didn't look like I had that ros package, so I just checked out its source too. Now it's not complaining about that anymore.

While cmake_modules has been released into Groovy (as ros-groovy-cmake-modules), the groovy-devel version of class_loader doesn't seem to use it (CMakeLists.txt here).
Are you trying to build the indigo-devel branch on Groovy, or do you want to use the groovy-devel version?

Edit: just tested this on a clean Groovy workspace (with the groovy-devel branch of class_loader) and it builds without error.

Sorry about the delay. I think I suspected that I was running into a bug in the release of class_loader on my system, so I probably wanted to try building the groovy-devel version, but I mistakenly(probably) buidling from the indigo release. I've updated my question.
