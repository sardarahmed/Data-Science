Q:

Turtlebot Create2 base_link location

According to REP 105, base_link should be in the center of rotation of the base, in this case a iRobot Create 2. What I can't figure out is where it is vertically. Is base_link at floor level or at the bottom of the robot or at the top or some other place?
Thanks,

A:

A good place for the center of rotation would be the center of the wheels axle. In the case of the Create platform this should be about where the main power button is horizontally and center of the wheel vertically. The bottom (or floor) of the robot should be where you'd find a base_footprint frame.
