Q:

how to add message generator in ros buildform

Hi, I have updated our ros client message generation package (geneus :  https://github.com/k-okada/jsk_roseus/tree/new_geneus/geneu)s, which depends on only python and genmsg.
I'd like to ask add this message generation on ros buildfirm and could you instruct me how to proceed

should I create a repository that only contains geneus ?
should I post somthing to somewhere ?

Thanks in advance

What is your expectation? To be applied for your message packages depending on it or to be used as a standard generator beside gencpp, genpy and genlisp?

yes, exactory

A:

The default message generators are defined in the message_generation package: https://github.com/ros/message_generation/blob/groovy-devel/package.xml
But adding additional generators will require some discussion. Especially since there already is a lisp generator. Please open a ticket similar to https://github.com/ros/message_generation/issues/1 to discuss it there.
