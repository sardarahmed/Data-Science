Q:

How do I get rosjava development environment setup?

I am running through the rosjava Getting Started, but I am having trouble with the environment setup. When I try a gradle build.gradle on the example file, I get:
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

Where:
Build file '/home/pjmartin/my_workspace/ycpjava/build.gradle' line: 16

What went wrong:
A problem occurred evaluating root project 'ycpjava'.
Cause: Could not find method maven() for arguments [build_7srnsdir7dj4a7drkst1r6jo3l$_run_closure1_closure3@4f980c26] on root project 'ycpjava'.

Why would there be a Maven error? I am new to both the Gradle process and rosjava. Any guidance would be helpful!

Please post the contents of your build.gradle script.

You can ignore this post. I have figured out gradle a bit more and moved beyond this problem. However, I am having issues getting a fresh project running. I am posting a new question soon.
