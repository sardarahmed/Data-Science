Q:

Creating msg and srv tutorial

I'm doing this tutorial

There's one more step, though. We need
to make sure that the msg files are
turned into source code for C++,
Python, and other languages:
Open package.xml, and make sure these three lines are in it and uncommented:

<build_depend>message_generation</build_depend>
  <run_depend>message_generation</run_depend>
  <run_depend>message_runtime</run_depend>

Note that at build time, we need
"message_generation", while at
runtime, we only need
"message_runtime".

My question is:
It says that while at runtime, we only need "message_runtime". , then why it put the message generation in run_depend (look at the three lines)?
In addition, can you please explain what are message_generation, message_runtime , and all these things we put in the middle of build_depend ,run_depend, and other tags are?
noob questions
Lastly....
I noticed that in the tutorial:
while in creating msg, it mentions to call generate_message function and to make sure we export message_runtime dependecy. In creating srv, it doesn't mention to do so.
Is it not required for creating a srv? Why?

A:

1 I think you can remove the message_generation in run_depend. Please have a look at here (http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingMsgAndSrv) It is just :
<build_depend>message_generation</build_depend>
<run_depend>message_runtime</run_depend>
2 (Despite its name, message_generation works for both msg and srv.) I think its the same for message_runtime.

Yah I know message_generation works for both msg and srv. What I means is that : If I create a srv (assuming I haven't created anything before), do I need call generate_message function and make sure exporet message_runtime dependecy as well?

Yes, You need them while catkin_make otherwise you will get a compilation error for the source file where you linked the respective service since it doesn't what that service is......
