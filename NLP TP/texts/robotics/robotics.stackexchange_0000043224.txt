Q:

Is the disparity from /camera/depth/disparity 11bit raw data?

Hi,guys,
I need to do some advanced kinect calibration so I need raw data instead of processed depth data.
Any one know if /camera/depth/disparity is raw or not?
Thank you!

I have the same question. Do you know the answer now? Thanks.

A:

Are you referring to the disparity image or the depth image published by the driver?
The depth image contains the distance from the camera to the scene along the z-axis (optical axis) of the camera. The ROS openni_camera driver publishes the depth image as a:

16-bit unsigned integer, in millimeters, on camera/depth/image_raw,
float, in meters, on camera/depth/image.

(see depth_image_proc)
The ROS driver does not publish the nonlinear, 11-bit raw output of the Kinect.

I was a little confused and I actually wanted to know if the disparity data published by ROS (/camera/depth/disparity) was the same raw data of libfreenect driver. Apparently are not the same.
Thanks for your answer.
