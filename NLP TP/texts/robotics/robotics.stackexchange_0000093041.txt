Q:

How can you install a package using catkin build?

I'm trying to use a script from the package bag_tools (http://wiki.ros.org/bag_tools?distro=hydro#make_video.py)
First instruction is to :
catkin_make install --pkg bag_tools

However I had made my workspace using catkin build.  (I'm not aware of the details of the difference between catkin_make and catkin build).
How do I install bag_tools using catkin build?
TL;DR: What's the catkin build equivalent of "catkin_make install --pkg bag_tools"

A:

Any time I need to find out the equivalent catkin_tools command for a catkin_make command (or vice versa), I consult this really handy table.
In this case, it tells me the command you want is catkin config --install followed by catkin build.
You can check if installation has been set by just running catkin config and viewing the output.
