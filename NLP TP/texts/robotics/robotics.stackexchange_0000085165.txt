Q:

Fixing TF between base_link and odom

Hey , i am in the process of porting my robot from simulation to real world .

Finished URDF (robot_description) , which publishes the tf
Finished with the most essential stack such as robot_nav , robot_viz , robot_movebase

My Real Robot can now listen to cmd_vel and will responds correctly to it . I have written a script which accepts cmd_vel and publishes odom .

As you can see above the tf between odom and base_link is not yet published , what could be the reason for the same ?

"header:
seq: 40
stamp:
secs: 1517994494
nsecs: 929254055
frame_id: odom
child_frame_id: base_link
...."

As you can see the child_frame_id of the odom topic is base_link .

A:

It is not sufficient, to publish this as an odometry Topic.
You Need to use a tf broadcaster to send the actual transformation via the tf tree.

https://answers.ros.org/question/281781/ros-python-script-for-kangaroo-x2-sabertooth-2x32-configuration-accepts-cmd_vel-and-publishes-odom/  The python script which publishes odom is listed here  , please check it out . I believe i am using the tf_broadcaster ,let me know if i missed anything.

Looks okay on a first glance. Do you see this transform in the tf message?
