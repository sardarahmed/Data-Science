Q:

How do I avoid rosbag's messages and disk space checks?

Currently when running rosbag record I periodically get this warning message:

Less than 5GB of space free on disk
with
/tmp/_2011-07-18-14-36-18_12.bag.active.

Every 20 seconds. Despite being annoying, what bothers me is that browsing the code I've seen that when there's less than 1GB the recording is stopped. http://www.ros.org/doc/diamondback/api/rosrecord/html/c++/recorder_8cpp_source.html
I understand the risks but I want to keep recording even below 1GB and disable those annoying logs every 20seconds.
Is there any way to do so?

A:

Decrease the number of bytes to what you want or just make them 0 , in these two line:
from:
00109         if (free_space < 1073741824ull)
to:
00109         if (free_space < 0000000000ull)
from:
00115         else if (free_space < 5368709120ull)
to:
00115         else if (free_space < 0000000000ull)
and then do :
rosmake rosrecord

@rajat, none of the other options to rosbag record are implemented as ROS parameters; they are all command line options. Why would this be any different? Also I have to take back what I said about Electric; it's already in feature freeze.

Thanks I'll try to do it.
Comment by rajat on 2011-07-19:
You should make it as a ros parameter and then submit the patch, The parameters by default should have the values which are present in the source code . but we can change the value by changing the parameter .

Unless there's a way (outside ROS) to spoof the disk space on a drive then it seems that there's no other way but to change the source. If I were you I'd file an enhancement ticket. If you attach a working patch then maybe you could get it squeaked into Electric (next ROS release in August).
Comment by Victor Lopez on 2011-07-19:
Yeah, I could do that, as well as remove the call to this method or make it return without checking anything. But the thing is if there's a solution that doesn't involve modifying the source code, otherwise each time we (as a company) upgrade ROS version, we have to change it and recompile.

Did this ever get implemented as a parameter or command line option?  I want to record locally onboard my robot, even though my robot has less than 1 Gig of free disk space.  Thanks.

I second Kurt. It would really make sense if this were configurable so I could also record locally on my small robot that doesn't have a lot of space.
