Q:

Make error on Twist.msg

After editing my CMakeList and running a make on my package and I received an error I'm not sure how to fix.  The error is:
roslib.msgs.MsgSpecException: Twist.msg: Duplicate field names in message: ['linear', 'x', 'y', 'z', 'angular', 'x', 'y', 'z']
make[3]: *** [../msg_gen/cpp/include/movbotGPS/Twist.h] Error 1
I'v checked my Twist.msg file and I believe it's setup correctly:
Vector3 linear
float64 x
float64 y
float64 z
Vector3 angular
float64 x
float64 y
float64 z
So I don't understand why I'm getting an error in "Duplicate field names in message".  Can anyone explain?

A:

Why are you creating your own copy of the Twist message?
You should declare a dependency on geometry_msgs and use the Twist message there.
EDIT:
You can add a dependency on geometry_msgs by adding a line like this to your manifest.xml:
<depend package="geometry_msgs"/>
