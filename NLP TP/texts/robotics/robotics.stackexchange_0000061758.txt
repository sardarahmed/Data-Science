Q:

Why can't I 'get' my rosrun parameters?

I have a node that should be able to run other nodes. It has a basic method of doing so using
system("rosrun myproject Robot robotname:='Botty'");

This should set the parameter robotname to 'Botty'. In my Robot node file, I have this code that should retrieve that parameter:
std::string robotname;
n.getParam("robotname", robotname);
ROS_INFO(robotname.c_str());

However, nothing is printed. When I execute rosparam list, the corresponding parameter is /RobotNode1/robotname. What am I doing wrong? I think that rosparam list output might be a good hint - is there a way to set that parameter when executing rosrun without referencing RobotNode1?
[edit] n is a NodeHandle.

Note that robotname:='Botty' does not set /RobotNode1/robotname, but just /robotname. Use _robotname:=Botty for parameters in the node's namespace.

A:

/RobotNode1/robotname means that this parameter has been set in the private namespace of the node.
So, you have to create a private node handle to retrieve this parameter. Do this:
ros::NodeHandle private_node_handle("~");

Thank you!

I just spent several hours trying to get the parameter fetching to work, because someone thought it was a good idea to use this private and public parameter setting thing.
