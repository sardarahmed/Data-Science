Q:

no ros workspace

I am a beginner with ROS.  I am trying the tutorials, and I do not find ros workspace in the ros directory.  Do I have to create it?
Thanks,

A:

Yes, you have to create the directory ros_workspace. Go to your /home/user directory and type
mkdir ros_workspace
Look at the link below for more details.
