Q:

planning_environment_msgs in electric

The planning_environment page, regarding electric, states, "A number of changes have been made to the planning_environment. Details to follow, but much of the information on diamondback no longer holds."
Where are planning_environment_msgs now kept? Particularly, what replaced the message and service, get_joints_in_group (planning_environment_msgs/GetJointsInGroup)?

A:

This service was removed for performance reasons - you can this information (and a whole bunch of other useful functions) from the C++ planning_environment interface using this code:
#include <planning_environment/models/collision_models.h>

      planning_environment::CollisionModels collision_models("robot_description");
      std::vector<std::string> joint_names = collision_models->getKinematicModel()->getModelGroup(GROUP_NAME)->getJointModelNames();
