Q:

how to configure move_base to run with less memory

Hi,
i am simulating serveral robots simultaneously,  i want to do that with around 5-10 robots. But every instance of move_base need at least 1Gb of RAM ,some times they need up to 1.8GB (per instance of move_base).
Why does move_base need so much memory ? Can i reduce the amount of memory if i use a smaller map, or are there any other ways to work with move_base more memory efficently.
regards peter
edit:
answer: if you reduce the map size, the memory size is reduced nerly by the smae percentage, map size reduzed by 75% reduces memory by 80% for me.

is it enough if i configure the slam to build a smaller map or do i need to search/build a smaller map for stage?

SLAM is enough. move_base won't know about anything else.

A:

How large are your maps? It's probably the internal costmaps being built. So a smaller map will use less memory.

map was -100 to 100 (standard slam_gmapping values) changed it to -35 to 35 and now it works with less memory , changig the map size solved the problem
