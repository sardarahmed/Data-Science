Q:

moveit_tutorials kinetic error

Hello,
I am using moveit_tutorials in ros kinetic, ubuntu 16.04. I am using this since many months. but suddenly today I get error while catkin_make,
    -- Could not find the required component 'pcl_ros'. The following CMake error indicates that you either need to install the package with the same name or change your environment so that it can be found.
CMake Error at /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:83 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "pcl_ros" with any
  of the following names:

    pcl_rosConfig.cmake
    pcl_ros-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "pcl_ros" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "pcl_ros_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "pcl_ros" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.

but why should this happen, because I have not change anything? before that it was working.

also, sudo apt install ros-kinetic-pcl-ros is giving me error,

re: still having problems with apt update: other repositories appear to have changed keys or have other problems. packages.ros.org appears to be fine.
Comment by nd on 2019-06-27:
what should I do as moveit_tutorials package is not working? I have posted this on moveit_tutorials github.

A:

As indicated by @gvdhoorn, the ROS package repository was found after updating the keys:
Hit:19 http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu xenial InRelease

Next you should do a sudo apt upgrade to upgrade/install packages and maybe try again to install ros-kinetic-pcl-ros, which obviously is broken on your system.
