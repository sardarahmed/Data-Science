Q:

node_manager_fkie rosrun node_manager package not found

After pulling from git and doing an apparently successful catkin_make (and catkin_make install) I can't seem to run node_manager!  When I do
rosrun node_manager_fkie node_manager
on Indigo, I get error: package 'node_manager_fkie' not found.
Any ideas about what the problem might be?   Any other ROS parameter server GUIs you would recommend?
Thanks!
Steve

A:

Have you looked at your environment variables? (That was my issue)
