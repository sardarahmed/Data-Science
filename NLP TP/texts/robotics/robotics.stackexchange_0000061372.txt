Q:

Does anyone have a catkinized version of the hector_navigation package?

Hello,
I was trying to catkinize the hector_navigation package myself but it is quite time consuming. If anyone has even catkinized a couple of packages, particularly the hector_exploration_planner, please do post the link here, it would help immensely.
Thank You.

A:

ThereÂ´s this pull request that we have not tried yet (but should) and this fork that both provide catkinized versions. If you try them, let me know if things worked :)

Thanks for the answer, Stefan!
I managed to get the forked link to work after solving a few compilation errors, it appears to be running perfectly now!
