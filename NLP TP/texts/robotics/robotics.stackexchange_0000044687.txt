Q:

IronPython and ROS

Breaking up several questions I asked in
[http://answers.ros.org/question/45234/multiplatform-dotnet-ros-workflow-redistribution-issues/]
So issue #1: I have failed to load roslib into IronPython. Does anyone know if this can be solved? Here is my execution. I first run it with python, so you see it works, things are set up correctly. However, with ipy it doesn't find roslib.
Tiago-Ribeiros-MacBook-Pro:~ tiagoribeiro$ roscd SimplePerception/
Tiago-Ribeiros-MacBook-Pro:SimplePerception tiagoribeiro$ python nodes/SimplePerceptionEffector.py
/opt/ros/fuerte/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ros_comm-1.8.12-py2.7.egg/rospy/topics.py:758: UserWarning: '\Perception\SimplePerception' is not a legal ROS graph resource name. This may cause problems with other ROS tools

Does ipy respect the PYTHONPATH environment variable?

A:

You can probably do something similar to:
import sys
sys.path.append(r"c:\path\to\ros")

But you could also use the roscs (ROS C#) library directly. We use the rosjava library, by turning it into DLLs through IKVM. We use rosjava because it doesn't have any other dependencies, whereas roscs depends on Ubuntu.
