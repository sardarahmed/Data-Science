Q:

compile Ogre without NVidia card

Hello,
I am trying to compile and install ROS Fuerte in a Debian box.
I have problems compiling Ogre, as my PC has an Intel Integrated graphics card, and Ogre seems to depend on nVidia.
Is it mandatory to have a nVidia graphics card? And if not, how can I take out this dependency?
Thank you!

I deleted the nvidia dependencies from the manifest.xml file , and add an "exit 0" to the ensure-nvidia-cg-toolkit-is-installed.sh script to avoid nvidia toolkit detection (I know it is not the solution). And now I am getting the following compilation error: BUILD FAILED: Plugin_CgProgramManager.so

A:

For just compiling Ogre, I don't think having an NVidia card is really mandatory. Can't you just install nvidia-cg-toolkit for building it?
