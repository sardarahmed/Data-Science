Q:

laserscan to 3D point cloud

I am working with the Hokuyo laser scanner. The scanner is fixed in the robot. There is no option for application of tilt to the scanner. Now I would like to generate the 3D point cloud from the scan data. In the laser assembler node I found that it must receive set of scan data due to the tilt of the sensor. I donot need so much detailed map. All I want to extrude the line in Rviz along z axis ,I get from the laser scan data (single set). Is it possible?? If yes how?? I really stuck in here. thanks in advance.....

I think you're gonna have to do that yourself.

I found one package for orthogonal projection. but I need continous extrusion of the line upto the gorund.

@Robot did you implement that function? I have the same need. So it would be helpful to know what is the best way to do that. Regards

The answers here provide a pretty decent example, just edit the variables to fit your needs. The high-fidelity function requires a tf broadcaster whilst the low-fidelity doesn't.
Refer to link to laser_geometry.

A:

That's a bit of an esoteric need, so you'll probably have to write your own node to make the conversion.
The simplest approach would be to use the tools in laser_geometry to initially convert the laserscan into a pointcloud. Then iterate through each point in the cloud and 'extrude' it by adding additional points with different z values, with whatever your required density is.
