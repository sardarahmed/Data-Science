Q:

are there standard battery level messages in ROS

for developping low level interfaces for a new robot, are there existing standard messages for battery level (in %) or voltage, or thresholds (low) / flags (charging / dis-charging) ?

Dear can you give some hardware connection example to read battery status from Arduino.

This is very different than the topic of this question. Please don't ask questions in the comments on this site. If you have a question please ask it as a full question.
Related, this looks like a good question for an Arduino forum and not a ROS forum as your question doesn't appear to be ROS related, it would likely be closed as off topic.
