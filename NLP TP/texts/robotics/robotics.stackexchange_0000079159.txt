A:

You're running into the MoveIt Trajectory Execution Manager stepping in and aborting the trajectory execution because of a violation of the timing constraints.
See #q196586 for a related question and answer.

I did changes as mentioned in #q196586 but that didn't work for me. Then i increased the value of "allowed_goal_duration_margin" from 0.5 to 3  in "trajectory_execution.launch.xml" : after that it works fine for me
