A:

Yes, ROS can be used to build flight controllers. There are many people using ROS on quadcopters. A common pattern is to use ROS for higher level functionality and dedicated microcontrollers at the autopilot level. With ROS 2.0 we will be working toward supporting ROS down onto microcontrollers.
