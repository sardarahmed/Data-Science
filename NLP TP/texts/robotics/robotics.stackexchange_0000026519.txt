Q:

sdf version problems cause drcsim2.6 and gazebo1.8 to crash

I've recently updated to drcsim 2.6 and gazebo 1.8, however when I attempt the command: roslaunch atlasutils atlasdrcvehiclefire_hose.launch
I receive the following warnings before it crashes:
Warning [parser.cc:361] Converting a deprecated SDF source[/usr/share/drcsim-2.6/gazebomodels/environments/vrcfirehoselong/model.sdf]. Warning [Converter.cc:58] Version[1.3] to Version[1.4] Please use the gzsdf tool to update your SDF files. $ gzsdf convert [sdffile] Warning [parser.cc:361] Converting a deprecated SDF source[/usr/share/drcsim-2.6/gazebomodels/environments/vrcstandpipe/model.sdf].

I have attempted to use the command gzsdf convert /usr/share/drcsim-2.6/gazebomodels/environments/vrcfirehose_long/model.sdf etc.
and then rerunning the roslaunch command, but it gives the same warnings. I have checked other topics, but they cannot seem to solve it.
I have also attempted to amend it by redownloading the environment models by moving them to a temporary file.
sudo mv   /usr/share/drcsim-2.6/gazebo_models/environments /home/david/backup-drc/
with the resulting problem when I try roslaunch

What else should I do to get gazbeo simulations working again?

The sdf warnings are ok, I dont think they are causing the crash. Can you post the backtrace from the coredump? Set: ulimit -c unlimited in terminal, then roslaunch drcsim and wait for it to crash. A core file should be generated in ~/.ros. Get backtrace by running gdb gzserver on the core file.

What command do I use to backtrace the core file? Is it gdb gzserver ~/.ros?

Problem has been resolved. Because of my graphics driver, I needed to convert the Sandia_hands model of the worlds files to a _cpu_lidar version to prevent it from crashing
