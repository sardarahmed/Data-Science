Q:

Subscribe from service example

Hi,
lets say that I have a service that needs some additional resources which is available via topic. Is there some example how this can be implemented?
Thanks

A:

The recommended way to do this is to have a subscription to the topic which stores the latest value in a persistent location. Then you can use that value in your service callback.

I use this approach for saving images from camera, but the topic is output from some point cloud processing, that is computationally expensive. That is why I want to subscribe when the service is called.

You can connect and disconnect at the beginning and end of the sevice.  But you will trade off latency for lower cpuusage.
