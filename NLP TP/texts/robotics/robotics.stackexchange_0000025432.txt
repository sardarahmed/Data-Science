Q:

How to implement a Force Sensor

Hi All,
I am wondering how you would implement a simulated force sensor to measure joint torques if the method physics::joint::GetForce(int) is not implemented. If anyone has done this with Gazebo any help would be appreciated.
cheers
Peter

A:

John just committed a new (?) force torque sensor to the issue_16 branch: https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/commits/172726f2e6f1cb47e2fc0fbbc60ca61c70ab4b51
So there should be an official working solution in trunk soon.

It looks like that's a re-implementation of a feature that used to exist. It's necessary to create a force-torque sensor plugin as pointed to in my answer, but is not a force-torque sensor itself.

There is a ticket on bitbucket for creating an actual sensor: https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issue/379/create-a-force-torque-sensor
