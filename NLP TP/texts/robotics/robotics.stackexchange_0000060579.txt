Q:

rgbdslam provides transform from /map to /camera_link... what happens in localization?

I am looking at the frames that tf is providing. In rgbdslam, it is shown that /camera_link -> /map, which is ambiguous.  I understand that /map is what octomap_server is listening on. However, I have another node up and running that contains the transform /map -> /odom -> /base_link -> /camera_link , which is the suggested transform given by REP105. How do I reconcile the differences? or are these are conflicting transforms that I should run separately (I.e. obtain octomap via rgbdslam first)?
Sidenote: I see that rgbdslam's fixed frame is /map. Is there a switcheroo that I can change to so that the differences are reconciled?
Thanks!

A:

The estimates of the different transformation from /map to /camera_link belong to different systems (RGBDSLAM and something else). Therefore I suggest using a different name for RGBDSLAM's /map frame. You can change the name by setting the parameter "config/fixed_frame_name" in RGBDSLAM's launch file.
There are ways to combine the two estimates, but to make it sound, you would need the uncertainty (covariance) for the respective transformations, which are not provided (at least RGBDSLAM doesn't do that). Otherwise you could just interpolate them with manually tuned weights.
