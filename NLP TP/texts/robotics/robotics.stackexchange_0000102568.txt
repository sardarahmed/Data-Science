Q:

Navigation stack error while launching

In my costmap_common_param.yaml file i've placed these two lines :
observation_sources: laser_scan_sensor
laser_scan_sensor: {sensor_frame:base_scan, data_type: LaserScan, topic: scan, marking: true, clearing: true}

When i am launching my nav_pkg i get this error :
load_parameters: unable to set parameters (last param was [/move_base/TrajectoryPlannerROS/holonomic_robot=False]): cannot marshal None unless allow_none is enabled

I've been searching for a while and i found a comment which says that this error means one of the parameters is null (undefined or an empty string).  It also says to add the following line when  roslaunching the nav_pkg :
--dump-params 

Indeed when i did it i found this :
/move_base/global_costmap/laser_scan_sensor/sensor_frame:base_scan: null

But i have no ideas why is this happening and also i don't know how to fix it. Any suggestions ?

A:

Can you please try again after adding a space between sensor_frame: and base_scan as shown below:
laser_scan_sensor: {sensor_frame: base_scan, data_type: LaserScan, topic: scan, marking: true, clearing: true}

Please report if the problem persists.

Yeah that worked i guess it is white space sensitive

Well, it is a YAML file, so you must use space. Anyway, I am glad that it worked. You may upvote the answer by clicking on the ^ icon located on the left side of the answer.
