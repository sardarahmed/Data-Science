A:

If you are looking for an urdf for a wam arm, then take a look at the arm simulator project
http://thearmrobot.com/aboutSimulator.html
Then you can use
$ rosrun gazebo gazebo__model -h
To guide you through converting a urdf to gazebo XML format.
Or your can write a launch script to run gazebo with your urdf. Look in gazebo_worlds package for examples.

I don't have enough karma to edit this answer.  But I've recently made an SDF and some easy-to-use sample plugins for controlling a WAM. The SDF is made from the Institute De Robotica's URDF. Find it here: https://github.com/BenBlumer/Gazebo_WAM
