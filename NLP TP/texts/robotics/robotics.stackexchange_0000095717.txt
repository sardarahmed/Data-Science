Q:

How to setup ROS environment variable on Ubuntu 20.04?

I tried following this guide to install ROS, but even after adding ROS source.list and its key
sudo apt install ros-melodic-desktop-full

gave error.
E: Unable to locate package ros-melodic-desktop-full

Then I ran this command
sudo apt search ros

to see if any such package exists. I couldn't find ros-melodic-desktop-full but I found another similar package ros-desktop-full.
So I installed it instead. The installation went smooth without giving any errors.
Next step in the guide is to set-up ROS environment variable, but I have no such directory
/opt/ros

So how do I setup the environment variable?
P.S.
I also installed some tools and dependencies with this command
sudo apt install python3-rosdep python3-rosinstall python3-rosinstall-generator python3-wstool build-essential

and initialized rosdep
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update

A:

I tried following [this][1] guide to install ROS, but even after adding ROS source.list and its key
sudo apt install ros-melodic-desktop-full

gave error.
E: Unable to locate package ros-melodic-desktop-full

For this, see #q350668 (which is a duplicate of your initial question), and refer to the linked #q350055 as well.
Summarising: ROS Melodic is not supported on Ubuntu 20.04.

Then I ran this command
sudo apt search ros

to see if any such package exists. I couldn't find ros-melodic-desktop-full but I found another similar package ros-desktop-full.
So I installed it instead. The installation went smooth without giving any errors.

This will not get you ROS Melodic, nor any other specific ROS version.
Refer to wiki/UpstreamPackages for information on what you installed with that command.
