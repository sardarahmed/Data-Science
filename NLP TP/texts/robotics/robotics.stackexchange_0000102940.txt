Q:

Failed to create behavior assisted_teleop of type nav2_behaviors/AssistedTeleop

I am going through the Getting Started in Nav2 Docs. I have installed navigation2, nav2-bringup and turtlebot3 packages using the following commands:
sudo apt install ros-humble-navigation2
sudo apt install ros-humble-nav2-bringup
sudo apt install ros-humble-turtlebot3*

As per the tutorial I source and exported the required environment variables by:
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH:/opt/ros/humble/share/turtlebot3_gazebo/models

But when I launch the nav2_bringup using the following launch command I get the below listed error:

This code block was moved to the following github gist:
https://gist.github.com/answers-se-migration-openrobotics/77fe00b8702ce7e729c5d1af7e017e68

I get a Rviz and Gazebo windows opened without any TurtleBot. How do I resolve the nav2_behaviors/AssistedTeleop with base class type nav2_core::Behavior does not exist exception and the spawn service failure?
Thank you in advance.

Apparently, I had some missing packages. I solved this issue by running:
sudo apt install ros-humble-nav*
