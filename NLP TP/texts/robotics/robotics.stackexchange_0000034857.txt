Q:

logging result with rosunit in stdout

Hi people!! I have some unitary tests in python made with rosunit. They work well but I'd like to log to stdout some test messages when I run:

rosrun rosunit rosunit --text mytestfile.py

You can see below some tried alternatives but none of them worked. Any Idea? Thanks in advance :-):

print "hi"

or

rospy.loginfo("hi")

and even:
def setUp(self):
         logging.basicConfig( stream=sys.stdout )
         self.log=logging.getLogger( "TestDTW.output" )
         self.log.setLevel( logging.DEBUG )

def testXX(self):
         self.log.debug("hi")

A:

There was a bug in rosunit where the --text option was not propagating properly.  I'm testing a fix in r15181.
You can get a patch from here:

Thanks for noting this issue.
