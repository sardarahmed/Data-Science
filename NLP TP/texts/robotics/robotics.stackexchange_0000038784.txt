Q:

Why can't ogre_tools find wxWidgets for rviz on OS X?

Hi!
I'm trying to compile rviz on Mac OS X Lion 10.7.3 but I'm having some problems with ogre_tools and wxWidgets. Apparently ogre_tools is not finding wxWidgets. Here's the output:
{-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have already done rosdep install rviz with the following output: "All required rosdeps installed successfully".
On the tutorial it is said that wxWidgets should be installed by rosdep, "This installer is downloaded and run automatically for you by rosdep..." from http://www.ros.org/wiki/electric/Installation/OSX/Homebrew
Thanks in advance!

Some developments, I was thinking that maybe rosdep didn't install the wx stuff so I tested the wxPython install with the python shell using: `import wx' and it cannot find the pkg. So I'm guessing wxPython is not install and probably neither is wxWidgets.

Problem solved!
Apparently rosdep didn't install wxPython/wxWidgets the first time, however it did create the file that led rosmake to think so.
The solution was to remove the file:
$ cd /usr/local/share/ros/
$ rm wxpython-version.installed
And then rerun rosdep:
$ rosdep install rviz
After which I was able to successfully rosmake rviz!
I found the solution while going through similar questions:
