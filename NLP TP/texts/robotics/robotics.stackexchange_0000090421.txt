Q:

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'error'

Hi, I am a beginner in Python, Ros and Ubuntu and am having difficulties in running the first program on ROS, i.e. listener.py
I am running Ros melodic in Ubuntu 18.04
The following error report comes up on running "rosrun hello_world listener.py"
joseph@joseph-Inspiron-5558:~$ rosrun hello_world talker.py 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/joseph/catkin_ws/src/hello_world/scripts/talker.py", line 39, in <module>

    from error import *
**ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'error'**
Error in sys.excepthook:

  File "/usr/lib/python3.6/re.py", line 142, in <module>
    class RegexFlag(enum.IntFlag):
**AttributeError: module 'enum' has no attribute 'IntFlag'**

Original exception was:

    from error import *
**ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'error'**

The text in bold are the error messages and they seem to be something related to the version conflict in the multiple installations of python.
Any help in resolving this matter would be appreciated
Thanks.

A:

The issue has been resolved. I checked the script and it had "#!/usr/bin/env python3" in it, changing it to "#!/usr/bin/env python" resolved the issue.
Though i would still like to know what is the cause of this,  and what this change means !
