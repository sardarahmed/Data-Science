Q:

How to extract video from bag file?

Hello
I followed the tutorial [http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosbag/Tutorials/Exporting%20image%20and%20video%20data] about extracting video from bag file. I create a launch file like this
<launch>
  <node pkg="rosbag" type="rosbag" name="rosbag" args="play -d 2 $(find image_view)/Data/test1.bag"/>
  <node name="extract" pkg="image_view" type="extract_images" respawn="false" output="screen" cwd="node">
    <remap from="image" to="/camera/image_raw"/>
  </node>
</launch>

But than got the following error
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [rosbag/rosbag]: can't locate node [rosbag] in package [rosbag]
Im using ROS Fuerte and Ubuntu 10.4. Any help??
This is my bag file info

How best to extract video depends on what you want to do with it. Please edit your question to provide that information. (Your time-stamp question was asked and answered separately).

A:

Regarding your first question:

I would like to know how to extract video from the bagfile?

I would recommend reading this tutorial from from ROS image_view wiki page.
Update:
I summarized the steps needed to create the video in this tutorial: How to extract images from a rosbag file and convert them to video

There seems to be a mistake on the wiki page (I just fixed it).  The correct string in the rosbag tag entry is type="play"

Still not working. I go this error. [FATAL] [1349151684.419671013]: Error opening file: play

I updated my answer with a link to steps that I usually use.

Sorry. Where did you updated the answer?? On the wiki page??Sorry I saw. But Im using ROS Fuerte and Ubuntu 10.4 and I got the following error.  Couldn't find package mjpeg-tools
Comment by Mani on 2012-10-01:
I think the name for 10.04 used to be mjpegtools: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/lucid/+package/mjpegtools
Comment by Astronaut on 2012-10-01:
Ok. But have problems with rosrun image_view extract_images _sec_per_frame:=0.01 . So First I execute osrun image_view extract_images sec_per_frame:=0.01. Yes?? Than image:=. What means IMAGETOPICINBAGFILE???When I put the image path I got an error
Comment by Astronaut on 2012-10-01:
And after rosrun image_view extract_images _sec_per_frame:=0.01  I got [ WARN] [1349156876.990156648]: extract_images: image has not been remapped! Typical command-line usage:
$ ./extract_images image:= [transport]
