Q:

Irobot create commands

Hi!
I created a file called irobot.sh. I would like to open 3 different consoles to run 3 different commands.
#!/bin/bash
konsole --hold -e "roscore"
konsole --hold -e "rosrun irobot_create_2_1 driver.py"
konsole --hold -e "rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py"
Roscore is working fine, but the other 2 commands are not working.
It opens the 3 consoles. But the two rosrun commands are no working, it shows this message:
Usage: rosrun PACKAGE EXECUTABLE [ARGS]
rosrun will locate PACKAGE and try to find
an executable named EXECUTABLE in the PACKAGE tree.
If it finds it, it will run it with ARGS.
If I open 3 consoles by myself, and run one command in every console, everything works well, but I want to use the script.

A:

roslaunch probably does what you want. It is the preferred way for managing multiple nodes.
