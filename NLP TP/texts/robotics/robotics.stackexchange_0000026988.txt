Q:

How to update graphic in the gui when pausing it

Hi,
In my application I want to use Gazebo as as assembly tool, so I can dynamically insert robots and change their orientations and joint angles without the interference of the simulation dynamics. After several days testing, I found there is no problem of inserting new models when the simulation paused. But when I set the joint angle or set the relative link position by the following piece of code in the world plugin, I have to hit the play button or open gzclient after I set the joint angle, those changes can be updated on the real robot in the gui graphics.
currentWorld->GetModel(msg->stringmessage())->GetJoint("Front_wheel_hinge")->SetAngle(0,joint_angles[0]);

or
currentWorld->GetModel(msg->stringmessage())->GetLink("CircuitHolder")->SetRelativePose (linkpose);

So I want to ask whether there is way to trigger gui graphics refresh when pausing the whole simulation?
Thanks.

A:

I figured it out later, the only way to do that is by adding a system plugin, and force it to happen in the event "rendering".
