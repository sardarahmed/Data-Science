Q:

How can I know whether RTABmap successfully localized?

I am running my robot in a localization mode and sometimes I need to know whether the localization was succesfull so I do not need to use PoseEstimate on RViz manually. Is there some specific bool?

A:

You can add rtabmap_ros/Info display to RVIZ and look at Loop closures and Proximity detections values. They should increment when a localization occurs.
Another way from terminal, check values of (not null if localization occurs):
$ rostopic echo /rtabmap/info/loopClosureId
$ rostopic echo /rtabmap/info/proximityDetectionId

cheers,
Mathieu
