A:

I am also testing the toolkit in few hours ago. At the moment, I have successfully connected the toolkit to the Rosbridge in ROS by looking at no error status in Labview but have not transfer any data yet. Have you installed the Rosbridge package in ROS? What IP did you put in the string? What is the explanation of error 56?

yes i have installed rosbridge package.......i have given the ip on which ros is running.......plz tell me how can i solve it.....right now i am getting error 62....... error 62 is that the VI that opened the connection has finished executing and has closed, when a VI finishes executing in LabVIEW the resources are automatically closed to ensure any open resources arn't left dangling.
