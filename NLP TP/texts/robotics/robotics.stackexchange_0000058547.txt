Q:

Does anyone have Stage 4.1.1 working in Fuerte and HectorSlam

I am trying to run Stage 4.1.1 and produce a map as I did with gmapping.  With gmapping, while running stage and navigating the robot via teleoperting, I could run( rosrun gmapping slam_gmapping scan:base_scan) and then (rosrun map_server map_saver -f map_name ) and create map. How do I produce the map with hector_slam

The instructions for use in place of gmapping should work.
