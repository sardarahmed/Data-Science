Q:

Rosdep dependency error

I'm trying to add the arbotix stack to my raspberry pi jessie/indigo setup and rosdep is failing to resolve the following
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
warehouse_ros: No definition of [mongodb] for OS [debian]
diagnostic_common_diagnostics: No definition of [libsensors4-dev] for OS [debian]

Both of these are installed via apt-get but that does not seem to satisfy rosdep. I'm at a loss as to how I can resolve these.  Do I have to get the source directly and build them?
I'm using the following to resolve the dependencies
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro indigo -y --os=debian:jessie

A:

Here are the relevant rosdep rules for libsensors4-dev (from rosdep/base.yaml):
libsensors4-dev:
  arch: [lm_sensors]
  fedora: [lm_sensors-devel]
  ubuntu: [libsensors4-dev]

and for mongodb (again from rosdep/base.yaml):
mongodb:
  fedora: [mongodb]
  ubuntu: [mongodb]

As you can see, there are no stanzas for debian, which is why rosdep is failing. The fact that you installed them via apt-get is irrelevant, as rosdep does not know what the package name is on your OS, and thus cannot find it in the list of installed packages.
The proper course of action here would be to contribute those rosdep rules. For that, see Contributing rosdep rules.
