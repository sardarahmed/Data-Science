Q:

Error Downloading rosemacs

Hi Guys,
I was trying to install rosemacs an I get this error just when I'm trying to downoload the git stack.
$ git clone https://kforge.ros.org/rosemacs/git rosemacs
Cloning into rosemacs...
error: gnutls_handshake() failed: A TLS packet with unexpected length was received. while accessing https://kforge.ros.org/rosemacs/git/info/refs

fatal: HTTP request failed

I have checked the web page https://kforge.ros.org/rosemacs/git and it exist but I can't do the clone
Any suggestion ?
The problem is from my computer or from the rosemacs repository ?
Thanks in advance,
Arnau

Maybe your git version is too old? What's the output of git --version?
Comment by Catotaku on 2012-03-28:
my git version is:
git version 1.7.5.4
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-03-28:
Ok. Mine is 1.7.0.4. So maybe yours is too new? :) If nothing works, check out rosemacs from https://github.com/moesenle/rosemacs-debs.git

A:

It looks to be a problem with your computer.  Look for firewalls and proxies.
