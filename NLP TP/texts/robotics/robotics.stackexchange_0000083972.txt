Q:

Set log level for each node in ROS CPP

I want to set the log level for each node in ROS CPP. The node is defined as follows:
ros::init(argc, argv, "my_ros_node");

What I am looking for is the CPP version of following command:
rospy.init_node('my_ros_node', log_level=rospy.DEBUG)

I am using ROS Indigo on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. As always thank you very much.

You can set it per package. See: http://wiki.ros.org/rosconsole#Configuration

@clyde: Thank you very much. I am assuming that there must be a way to do it in CPP. It is possible to do in Python, as I posted above. However I am looking for CPP version. Thanks again.
