Q:

How to draw a frustum in rviz

Hi,
I would like to draw a frustrum in rviz that represents the pose of the kinect and its pointcloud. Is this function already available. If not can someone point me towards the tutorials that gives an idea about drawing this.
Thanks,
Karthik

A:

A Visualization Marker can probably do what you want, though it may be a bit complicated. Triangle List is probably a good place to start.
If you simply want to visualize the pose of the kinect, just add a TF display to rivz

Is it possible to use Visualization Marker with Triangle List in a python ROS node?
