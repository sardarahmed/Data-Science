Q:

create a map for navigation from points?

Hi everyone, I would like to create a map (pgm image and related yaml file) for robot navigation.
I need to create the map inside a python code where I have all the points of interest available such as room size, position and orientation of obstacles (fixed), etc...
basically i need to create a function that create a map (pgm image) from some points, for example if i have the vertices of an obstacle i need to create a shape with black outline and grey inside and so on....
Can anyone give me some guidance?
(ps: i use python with ros noetic)

A:

This netpbmfile library could help you generate your PGM map file with *.yaml file too (documentation of YAML format for ROS)- then you can go with steps from this YT tutorial to load this map inside ROS1 Navigation stack.

Example usage:

Thank you for your reply, I will study the library you have indicated.
I have only a small problem: I installed the library with "pip install netpbmfile" as indicated in the page but the import does not work in python.... I don't understand if the import is netpbm or netpbmfile, but neither works (Import "netpbm" could not be resolved, same for netpbmfile).

I keep getting a warning about the import, but it works. Thanks for your help.
