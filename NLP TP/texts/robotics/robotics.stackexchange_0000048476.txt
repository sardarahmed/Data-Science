Q:

Error in starting rviz

Hello! When I try to start rviz by "roslaunch rviz rviz", I see this message:
... logging to /home/ros/.ros/log/8b43025e-7aa4-11e2-89df-080027387536/roslaunch-ros-VirtualBox-3363.log
Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.
Press Ctrl-C to interrupt
Done checking log file disk usage. Usage is <1GB.

Invalid roslaunch XML syntax: not well-formed (invalid token): line 1, column 0

Can you help me?

A:

Rviz is a program, not a launch file. Try it this way:
$ rosrun rviz rviz
