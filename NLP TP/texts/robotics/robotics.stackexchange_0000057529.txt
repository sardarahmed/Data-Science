Q:

bash no such file

good afternoon
request your assistance already in my ROS installation, I get the following error
bash: / opt / ros / hydro / setup.bash: No such file or directory
after the following command: echo "source / opt / ros / hydro / setup.bash" >> ~ / bashrc.
source ~ /. bashrc, thanks for your help and your time

A:

It looks like you have a number of extra spaces in your command. It should be:
echo "source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash" >> ~ /.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

Note the lack of spaces between the slashes ( / ).
You will probably have to edit your ~/.bashrc to remove the line you've added that does contain spaces; otherwise it will continue to generate errors.
