Q:

TCP/IP Socket Server ROS Node

Hi,
I’ve multiple devices communicating via TCP/IP Socket. My intention is to integrate them into my ROS. Now I’m wondering whether it makes sense to have basis TCP/IP Socket Server node in ros, instead of integrating a TCP/IP Socket Connection in every ROS Node for my devices.
This service node should have services like sendByte sendASCII, etc. and publish topic for received data. I know that this is probably not fulfilling the High Level Conept of ROS but I thought it might make sense for my device nodes, since I wouldn’t have to integrate the tcp/socket every time.
Any Ideas on that?

A:

This could make sense if you make it a nodelet instead of a node.

It's probably the easiest to just propose it and look for some input/suggestions.

Thanks for that advice. Do you think it would make sense to propose this idea in the mailing lists to have such a nodelet as a common functionality in ros?
