Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created

A:

This looks like more a Linux/Ubuntu problem to me. One or more dependencies of one or more of the packages you are going to install are causing troubles. You need to locate those dependencies to find out more about the problem you are actually having.
synaptic and aptitude may help here.
Other options are: You recently made changes in the depositories/depository list you are getting the packages from. E.g. package depends on version X.Y, but available is only X.(Y-1). I get that sometimes, when switching my Ubuntu repos to non-default, but faster ones.
Btw, are you running 32bit or 64bit?
