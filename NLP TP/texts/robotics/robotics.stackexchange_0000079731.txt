Q:

ERROR with Map_Server. Not able to open .yaml file. Using prebuilt Map with AMCL launch file- how to execute with RVIZ

I currently have made my map using Hector Slam and saved the map as .yaml file and .pgm .
I have downloaded the Navigation stack as well using git source: https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation.git . Also ran catkin_make afterwards.
Now, I am trying to implement AMCL by placing my robot( irobot create 2) onto the map and do autonomous mapping.
I am getting an error when i run am amcl file... which says " MapServer could not open <.yaml> file."
Please see attached for my code.

Update:
I was able to upload map onto RVIZ, and executed amcl with proper tf/ messages.
However, when I move the robot towards a location, the PoseArray points do not move.
Please recommend a suggestion.
Here is the screen pic. Screenshot from 2017-03-23 14-55-11.png

I ran the following commands simultaneously..
roslaunch hector_slam_launch tutorial.launch
rosrun map_server map_server .yaml
roslaunch amcl amcl_diff.launch
but received message "No laser scan rece

A:

rosrun map_server map_server <file_name>.yaml
rosrun rviz rviz --> Add Map->topic /map
Issue resolved.
Added tf code messages in AMCL launch file to configure  with my robot.
