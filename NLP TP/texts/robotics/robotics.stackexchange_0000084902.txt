Q:

Unable to catkin_make due to missing yocs_msgs/JoystickConfig.h

Needed to use Yujin's Velocity Smoother, but unable to catkin_make due to missing file. No one else seemed to have this issue hence I'm opening a new question. I git cloned the devel branch.
Here is the error I got:
/home/bla/catkin_ws/src/yujin_ocs/yocs_joyop/src/joyop.cpp:15:38: fatal error: yocs_msgs/JoystickConfig.h: No such file or directory

compilation terminated.

A:

This is the file that will generate yocs_msgs/JoystickConfig.h. In your workspace have you cloned the yocs_msgs repository in addition to the yujin_ocs repository?
Update
Based on a comment from @gvdhoorn I was able to see that the packages you want are available from the ROS apt repositories. I recommend installing the packages rather than building from source, unless there is a specific reason you need a feature from the source version that is not available in the apt version.
Running the command @gvdhoorn indicated will get you everything you need, including dependencies:
sudo apt-get install ros-$distro-yocs-velocity-smoother

@Alsing: @Thomas D is probably right: you're missing dependencies.
See #q252478 for a generic recipe for installing packages from source.
And note that the pkg has been released for both Indigo and Kinetic, so a simple:
sudo apt-get install ros-$distro-yocs-velocity-smoother

should work.

@Thomas D didn't realise I needed o compile yocs_msgs seperately. Thanks for the help!

@gvdhoon I compiled instead :)

Hello, I had met the similar issue, I already follow the above suggestion to :
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-yocs-velocity-smoother
The installation works fine, and the build already passed, but looks I have the link issue and compilation terminated:
/home/{usersname}/catkin_ws/src/yujin_ocs/yocs_joyop/src/joyop.cpp:15:38: fatal error: yocs_msgs/JoystickConfig.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.

Anyone can help? I am newbie for the ROS actually,

Do I need git clone the yocs_msgs and compile it? I think I already install it:
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-yocs-msgs
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
ros-kinetic-yocs-msgs is already the newest version (0.6.3-0xenial-20181107-005535-0800).

@macleonsh: please post a new question. Don't post a follow-up question under the answer of an already resolved one.

Thanks, I git clone https://github.com/yujinrobot/yocs_msgs.git and rebuild, now issue solved. Thanks anyway!
