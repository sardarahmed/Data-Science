Q:

care-o-bot spins in place with move command

Does anyone know why the care-o-bot will sit in place and rotate about the z axis with some move commands.  For example:
self.sss.move("base","order");
From a startup state, the above command in a python script will cause the bot to spin in place.  I'm running ubuntu 10.4 with electric.

A:

What kind of navigation are you using? I assume you are using "roslaunch cob_2dnav 2dnav.launch", which is the ROS navigation. Sounds like the robot in not properly localized. Please check the localization in rviz.

Oh - and yes, I'm using "roslaunch cob2dnav 2dnav.launch"

Thanks fmw.  Pardon the newbie question... but is it required that I run care-o-bot in rviz?  In working through the tutorials, I was under the impression that I could apply navigation goals (by python script) in gazebo.  What exactly does rviz add that I cannot do in gazebo?  I'd appreciate any comments you have - I'm new at this.
