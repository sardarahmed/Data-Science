Q:

Fix sourcing each package separately with catkin_make_isolated

I have been using catkin_make_isolated to build my workspace. Whenever I create a new catkin package, I have to add source ~/catkin_ws/devel_isolated/package_name/setup.bash to my ~/.bashrc otherwise I cannot run any nodes from that package. I get errors such as [mobility_bringup_all.launch] is neither a launch file in package [mobility_bringup] nor is [mobility_bringup] a launch file name.
Only using source ~/catkin_ws/install_isolated/setup.bash and source ~/catkin_ws/devel_isolated/setup.bash doesn't work.
EDIT: If I source multiple ~/catkin_ws/devel_isolated/package_name/setup.bash in my ~/.bashrc, I cannot run any nodes from any of the packages. If I only source one package's setup.bash, I can run that package's nodes. The problem is the same as in this post. It seems the source commands are being overwritten? Is there a way to fix this?
Thanks!

Not an answer, but is there any reason you're not using catkin_tools?

I'm using catkin_make_isolated because I installed Google Cartographer and that's what they said to use.

A:

When you use catkin_make_isolated --install, you need to source ~/catkin_ws/install_isolated/setup.bash.
