Q:

Moving wiki pages

I would like to move multiple wiki pages under http://www.ros.org/wiki/swri-ros-pkg to http://ros.org/wiki/Industrial.  I cannot find an easy way to do this.  I could copy and past the content from the old pages to the new page, but it would required moving several attachment.  In this case, I would also have to delete the old pages, again something I am not sure how to do.

Does "More Actions>Rename Page" not work for you?
