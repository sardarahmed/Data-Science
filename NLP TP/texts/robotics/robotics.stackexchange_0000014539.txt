Q:

Generate a coverage path given a polygon region

I'm making an app which controls a drone (DJI) and takes photos.
In one particular feature, the user can draw a polygon (let's keep it a convex quadrilateral for now) and the app should generate a serpentine path for the drone to fly over the entire region.

Input: 4 vertices of the polygon
Output: Array of coordinates of the path.
Any heads up on which algorithm to use? 
I've looked in to Boustrophedon Cell Decomposition, but there's not much documentation on it. 

A:

This thing is generally called coverage path planning.
If you are particularly interested in Boustrophedon Cell Decomposition, you may have a look at the paper introducing it: Choset and Pignon (1998).
