Q:

Prototyping with IRobot roomba

For a project I am building a Tele-Op Robot using the IRobot's Roomba as my drivetrain. In order for my robot to work, I need an extra castor. IRobot provides .stl and .stp files for me to use and I used them and printed the files. (The file I printed was from this link: CreateÂ® 2 Bin Modification.
This file is a new part to the drivetrain to allow another caster.
And I downloaded the first link called "Full bin bottom with caster mount"
The piece was great but it made the castor a different height then the wheels. I was wondering if anyone had this file but saved as something different so I can edit it in preferably Solidworks. I was on the phone with IRobot for over 2 hours today and they told me to post here. So please help!!!! :)

The caster shaft can potentially not seat right causing canting of the robot.
Can you share pictures of your print? I have had good luck with printing the files posted on the iRobot thingiverse page.
