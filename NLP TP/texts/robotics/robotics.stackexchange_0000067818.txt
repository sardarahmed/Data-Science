Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: ButtonEvent

Hi
I am using ROS Hydro
I wanted to subscribe to kobuki_msgs::ButtonEvent using roscpp client.
However, the compiler does not recognize this event and throws an error message
 error: ‘ButtonEvent’ in namespace ‘kobuki_msgs’ does not name a type
I already successfully subscribed to all others events like kobuki_msgs::BumperEvent, kobuki_msgs::CliffEvent, but I am not able to use kobuki_msgs::ButtonEvent
I would appreciate any help on this matter.
Thanks
Anis

A:

Have you included the header file "kobuki_msgs/ButtonEvent.h"? It's a different header file than for BumperEvent and CliffEvent.

Thank you for the answer. It was actually missing. Now, everything works after I included the header file. In fact, I was including the other events header files in a superclass, and I did not figure out in the sub-class that the header file of Button is missing.
Thank you
