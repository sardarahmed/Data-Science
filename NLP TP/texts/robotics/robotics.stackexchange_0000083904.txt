That looks like a local IP address and port number; not the public address for github. Do you have a proxy or something else installed that might be interfering with your network connectivity?

I can successfully view https://github.com/pirobot/rbx1.git in the browser,and I can successfully ping 127.0.0.1

127.0.0.1 is address of your own computer.

Make sure you can ping github.com. If you can't, there are lots of networking help sites. This might help: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/109404/why-cant-i-ping-google

I can ping github.com. The result is shown below:
PING github.com (192.30.255.112) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from lb-192-30-255-112-sea.github.com (192.30.255.112): icmp_seq=1 ttl=128 time=348 ms
64 bytes from lb-192-30-255-112-sea.github.com (192.30.255.112): icmp_seq=2 ttl=128 time=316 ms
64

A:

I have a very dirty fix for you, it should work.
git config --global http.sslVerify false

And then
git clone http://192.30.253.113/pirobot/rbx1.git

It works for me (though I don't have the local IP problem), hope it works for you too. If it does not work, you might want to set the sslVerify back to true

Thank you for your answer! I follow your methodï¼Œbut get the following error!
gzh@gzh-virtual-machine:/etc$ git config --global http.sslVerify false
gzh@gzh-virtual-machine:/etc$ git clone http://192.30.253.113/pirobot/rbx1.git
fatal: could not create work tree dir 'rbx1'.: Permission denied

@1059682127@qq.com Sounds good. Now you just have to get user permissions to write in the folder where you are trying to clone. Right now you are cloning into /etc which is not a good idea. Try the command:
cd ~
Before calling the git clone

It may not be the main problem! I change it still get the mistake!
gzh@gzh-virtual-machine:~$ git clone http://192.30.255.112/pirobot/rbx1.git
Cloning into 'rbx1'...
fatal: unable to access 'http://192.30.255.112/pirobot/rbx1.git/': Couldn't connect to server

Yes, it is probably not the main problem, my solution tries to fix symptoms instead of the source. As mentioned by others, review your networking connection. I see you are on a Virtual Machine, so there are a lot of things that might go wrong.

Thanks! I have tried many ways but can't solve the problem!
I can ping github.com but I can't ping https://github.com
Comment by 1059682127@qq.com on 2017-11-16:
I have solve the question by unset http.proxy and https.proxy!
And check it as below:
env|grep -i proxy
