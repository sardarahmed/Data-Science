Q:

looking for a miniature joystick, but in reverse

Does anyone know if small mechanical actuators exist which can be controlled electrically, sort of like a miniature joystick, but in reverse.  Instead of it picking up mechanical movement and outputting electrical signals, I want it to generate mechanical movement controlled via my electrical input signals.  I’ve searched for : electromechanical actuators, not finding what I need. Think of a pencil attached to a surface which can pivot to point anywhere in its half dome.  I’m thinking small, on the order of an inch.  It will not be load bearing. 
My goal is to programmatically control the normal pointed to by a small flat surface attached to the end of each joystick rod.  Accuracy is more important than speed.  From across a small room, say 10' by 10', I'd like the surface normal to accurately point to arbitrary objects in the room, say a person walking across the room.  If I can cheaply buy/build such mechanisms to control the movement of these small flat surfaces, I would like dozens places across the walls of the room.
Its for an electromechanical sound project I’m planning. 

A:

The device you are looking for is a "pan-tilt" unit.  They are typically used for pointing security cameras.  If you find a "PTZ", i.e. pan-tilt-zoom security camera used, you could butcher it an just use the Pan/Tilt part.
