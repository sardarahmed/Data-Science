Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: rviz in Qt

Hi,
I spent about an hour to find a similar question (and an answer), but could not succeed.
I have a Qt-based GUI application to send messages to my robot from a remote cockpit PC. To see the effect of these messages, I am running rviz as a separate application on the cockpit PC. Now I wish to embed rviz into my GUI, so that I have a single application that does both.
Is it possible to embed rviz into Qt without rewriting a major part of rviz? If yes, then where is this explained? Is there an example/tutorial?
I'm using qt 4.7.0 32-bit and ROS DiamondBack, on Ubuntu 10.04.1 LTS.
Thanks in advance.

A:

My guess is that it is not easily possible. As far as I know it is based on wxWidgets and OGRE.
Maybe the other way around is easier for you: Embedding your application into rviz.
