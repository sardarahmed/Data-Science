Q:

Unknown CMake command "add_action_files"

Ubuntu 14.04, ROS Indigo.
I've been following along with the tutorial at:
http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingMsgAndSrv and when I get to the portion where it instructs me to run catkin_make install I get:
Base path: /home/umdearborn/catkin_ws

I'm fairly new to ROS and CMake so I'm completely stumped.  I've made sure to source both /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash and ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash.
Any ideas what could be causing this?

A:

It looks like you have add_action_files on line 61 of your CMakeLists.txt, and cmake doesn't understand that command.
I don't see any mention of it in the tutorial, so you should probably comment out that command.
(for background, the add_action_files command is part of actionlib and is used for generating action interfaces, which are a more advanced topic)

You were correct, I mistakenly placed the AddTwoInts.srv line under the add_action_files directive instead of the add_service_files directive.  Thank you!
