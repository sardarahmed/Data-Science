Q:

Does anyone use a standard inertia message type?

I'm passing around dynamical properties (masses, inertias, etc) and there's no standard ROS message for a rigid body inertia with a coordinate frame and timestamp. Something like the following would be good (and simple):
Inertia.msg
# Mass [kg]
Float64 m
# First mass moment [kg-m]
geometry_msgs/Vector3 h
# Inertia Tensor [kg-m^2]
#     | ixx ixy ixz |
# I = | ixy iyy iyz |
#     | ixz iyz izz |
Float64 ixx
Float64 ixy
Float64 ixz
Float64 iyy
Float64 iyz
Float64 izz

InertiaStamped.msg
Header header
Inertia inertia

Anyone already using something like this? Maybe we could standardize it?
Update: Changed representation to use first mass moment instead of center of mass.

Seems like a good idea.  Maybe propose it to https://github.com/ros/common_msgs ?
