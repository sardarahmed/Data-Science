Hopefully it works with the standard ROS drivers.

So far, I tested the new driver changes for the "Kinect for Windows" from Drew Fisher
(k4w-drivers).

And it does work fine with the "Kinect
for Windows" included the modified
libfreenect device drivers!

The old drivers are the same, the only changes are the driver parameters which have to be added for the K4W in into the source code.
So far, I done this steps to change the openni drivers:

First, I change the Product and Vendor IDs in XnDeviceSensorIO.cpp. Furthermore, I'm setting the USB alternative interface to enable the two isochronous endpoints. More informations to libusb (function: libusb_set_interface_alt_setting).

Second, I modified the access permissions rules for the primesense sensor usb (55-primesense-usb.rules).

I recompiled the modified openni drivers.

Basicly now the driver is adjusted only for the K4W. The Kinect for Xbox can actually no longer be identified. But this is okey for my purpose until now.

I need to have the k4W with ROS, but im not really experiment with it. im having problems changing the XnDeviceSensorIO.cpp. could anybody explain a bit more all necessary changes needed to have the K4W working?

Is there any progress in getting K4W work out of the box?
If not, can someone tell me where XnDeviceSensorIO.cpp is located? I checked out openni drivers, but I can't find neither that file nor 55-primesense-usb.rules.
Thanks!
