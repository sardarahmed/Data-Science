Q:

Model breaks at high velocities

Hello Guys,
i am rebuilding the azcar car model from here: http://cps-vo.org/node/25319/browser
But for some reason with my own controllers and added steering joints for the rear. My model breaks at high speeds!

Meaning that the rear steering joints waver around the z axis, but are not fixed on it anymore.

I have implemented the "rear axle motor" as a velocitycontroller. Has sb. experienced sth. similar.
I am currently thinking, that my mass distribution is wrong. But i couldnt find anything regarding that topic.
Thanks for your help

Fixed by adjusting the different inertias and mass ratio.
