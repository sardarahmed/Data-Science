Hi , I followed the steps on ROS wiki about mavros to install .

A:

I did not find installation instructions in the wiki. I found them in git. There is a debian package available. So, you can run the following command to get it installed:
sudo apt-get install ros-jade-mavros ros-jade-mavros-extras 

Replace jade with the name of whatever ros distribution you are using. . The git also says how to install from the source, if you are particular about getting it installed that way.

If this answer resolves your issue, please mark it as accepted (with a green check mark).
If you still need to build it from source, is the git documentation enough?

Ok, thanks for your remind. I tried the git documentation but it was not the resource.
