Q:

'effort_controllers/JointTrajectoryController not found

Dear Ros-users,
I'm using the simulator for youbot in ros-hydro (package youbot_gazebo_robot)
Launching the youbot.launch I got this problem on the controller of the arm
[ERROR] [1402654097.573003559, 0.963000000]: Could not load controller 'arm_1/arm_controller' because controller type 'effort_controllers/JointTrajectoryController' does not exist.
The package effort_controllers is correctly installed
Thank you for your help!

A:

The effort_controllers/JointTrajectoryController does not live in the effort_controllers package, although I see how you might have thought it does.
You need to install the ros-hydro-joint-trajectory-controller package.
