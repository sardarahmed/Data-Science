Q:

Change rospy node log level while running

Is there any way to change a rospy node's log level while it is running?  http://www.ros.org/wiki/rospy/Overview/Logging says that you must pass in a parameter to rospy.init_node(), which means you need to kill and restart the node...
Also, I am curious why rxloggerlevel doesn't work for python nodes.

A:

Not much hacking is required to accomplish this:
import rospy
import logging

def set_rospy_log_lvl(log_level):
    logger = logging.getLogger('rosout')
    logger.setLevel(rospy.impl.rosout._rospy_to_logging_levels[log_level])

You can use this function wherever you want (after rospy.init()) to change the log level.  Works in Melodic.
Example usage:
rospy.init("my_node", anonymous=True)
set_rospy_log_lvl(rospy.DEBUG)
