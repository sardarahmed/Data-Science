Q:

Unable to install fetch (sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-fetch*)

Guys,
I am trying to install the Fetch model on my machine but failed to do so due to following error:
roy@RoysMacUbuntu:~/ws/src/stockroom_bot$ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-fetch*
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-indigo-fetch*
E: Couldn't find any package by glob 'ros-indigo-fetch*'

I also tried ros-kinetic-fetch* (because I am using ROS kinetic). Didn't work either:
roy@RoysMacUbuntu:~/ws/src/stockroom_bot$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-fetch*
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-kinetic-fetch*
E: Couldn't find any package by glob 'ros-kinetic-fetch*'
E: Couldn't find any package by regex 'ros-kinetic-fetch*'

I ran apt-get update already.
Any idea where the problem might be?
Many thanks for your time.

A:

tl;dr: as of 2017-09-10 there is no (official) binary release of the Fetch Robotics packages for Ubuntu Xenial-ROS Kinetic, so the commands you show are expected to fail

I am using ROS kinetic

and

This will never work as Indigo binaries (.debs) are not available on OS where you can install Kinetic. I guess you are running Ubuntu Xenial, for which only ROS Kinetic has been released.

And this can't work as the Fetch packages have not been released into Kinetic. See status_page/ros_kinetic_default.html?q=fetch (indigo status for comparison) and the wiki/fetch_maps page (fi, this is just an example).
According to fetchrobotics/fetch_ros#56, it should be possible to build the various packages from sources in a Catkin workspace on a Xenial-Kinetic install, but as always, you might encounter some issues.
Note that just git clone-ing the repositories into a Catkin workspace is not enough. See #q252478 for the general steps needed to build packages from source.
