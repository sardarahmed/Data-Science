Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: ROS over QNX

Has anyone tried to use ROS over QNX?
I would like to use ROS topics to export data (i.e. joints) from an existing system that runs over QNX.

A:

As far as found online, there have been some people who tried, but no success has been reported. Some references:

An email thread in 2009.
realtime ROS discussion in May 2013

I'm about to look into porting catkin into QNX, since I have received a kind of strong interest toward enabling ROS, or at least build system, on QNX.

Good. I am interested in your progress...

As in this thread, catkin is ported on QNX, and there's also a progress in getting ROS run there too. It seems, however, to have stopped progressing at rosdep at the moment.
