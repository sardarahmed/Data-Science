Q:

Maximum Distance using Ultrasonic sensor Arduino

What is the maximum distance (of say , a car ) you could measure using an ultrasonic sensor that would be compatible with arduino? Is there any sensor(ultrasonic or not) that could measure the distance of a car , say upto 50 meters that can be used with arduino?

A:

Your question is multiple questions inside of one. As answered in comments, your question should probably be limited to the sensor and/or technology for longer range detection of large (moving?) objects. The use of an arduino is mostly irrelevant.
As per comment by @Ian, ultrasonic sensors will probably not be useful at 50 meters, I think due to physics of sound. See the article below on choosing an ultrasonic sensor.
One option might be to use a laser rangefinder (such as you can find in hardware stores).  Another option might be to use radar, such as in old police radar guns. However, both of these options are limited in capability and highly dependent on environmental factors.
Perhaps the best option would be a LIDAR system. They tend to be expensive, but there is an upcoming product called "LIDAR-Lite" by PulseLight that is lower cost and might be of interest. They are advertising a 40 meter range capability.
