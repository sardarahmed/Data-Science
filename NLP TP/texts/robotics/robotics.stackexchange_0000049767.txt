Q:

Can we merge $PATH and $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH?

Hi,
I want to know if it is possible to add stuff in the $PATH variable to $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH? Actually i want to do this because i have already installed some debian packages on Ubuntu (11.1) which were required by the OpenHaptics toolkit (ver 3.0) but ROS can't find them. If i run the OpenHaptics example directly, it works. But when i try to run some OpenHaptics code through ROS, it doesn't.
Any help will be appreciated greatly.
Thanks.
Following are some additional details:
$ echo $PATH
/opt/ros/electric/ros/bin:/usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games
and
$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
/home/tufail/electric_workspace/sandbox/phantom:/opt/ros/electric/stacks
The following Debian packages have already been installed but ROS can't find them:
freeglut3-dev
libdrm-dev
libexpat1-dev
libglw1-mesa
libmotif-dev
libncurses5-dev
libx11-dev
libxt-dev    
tcsh
x11proto-dri2-dev
x11proto-gl-dev
x11proto-print-dev

Hello, can you update your question to address the following? How are you running the code "through ROS"? What error messages are you getting?
Comment by ahendrix on 2013-03-26:
Can you clarify how ROS can't find the installed packages? Is there a specific compile error you're seeing, or does it only have trouble at runtime?

A:

I have resolved it.
As the packages (dependencies) were already installed using Ubuntu Software Centre, so ROS didn't need to re-install them. I just removed those rosdep entries from the manifest file in package and built it again. It worked.
Thanks for your replies anyway. I appreciate it.
