Q:

target link libraries for C++

I am using a very simple C++ program and in the CMakelists.txt, my program works for both target_link_libraries(myprogram ${roscpp_LIBRARIES}) and target_link_libraries(myprogram ${catkin_LIBRARIES}). Hence my question, for a C++ program which one is more suitable ?

A:

That depends on what your program needs.
Since roscpp is a catkin package, the latter does make sense. It will provide libraries from all the catkin packages you depend on.

@joq What all does the catkin package include ? Is there a list ?

Everything you found using find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS roscpp ... )
