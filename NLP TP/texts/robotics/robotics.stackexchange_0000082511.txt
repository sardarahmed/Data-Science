Q:

Husky simulator for ROS-Lunar?

I am using Ubuntu 17.04.
I have ROS-Lunar and I wish to use Husky simulation in my Gazebo.
I tried installing it with
$ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-husky-simulator
but it says "Unable to locate package"
"ros-lunar-husky-simulator" doesnt work either.
Isnt Husky supported by Lunar? Do I need to use ROS-Indigo to get this to work? What to do?

A:

The Husky is currently only supported on Indigo. Kinetic is planned whereas, lunar is not but should work if installed from source.  I believe that the husky repo has a kinetic-devel branch that should work if installed from source.

Can you please guide me as to how I can get the Husky simulator or any other simulator for that matter, in my Gazebo that came with ROS-Lunar.
You have mentioned something about installing from source,
how does that work and can it get me to using Husky with the ros lunar specs?
