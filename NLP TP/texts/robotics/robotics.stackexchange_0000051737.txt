Q:

Pioneer3-AT Rviz/urdf model

Hi everyone!
I am running a SLAM simulation using a Pioneer3-AT and it would be usefull if I had the pioneer's model on Rviz. That is, is there a way or a place where I can get a model of the P3-AT running on Rviz (urdf?) ? My objective is to have the real pioneer working on real world and a "picture" of him running on Rviz (in the same position as my "\base_link").
I know there is p2os_urdf, but the model it gives is not exactly the one I want. Is there an easy way to edit this model into the one I want?
Thanks in advance!

A:

Check here for p2os_urdf. It has recently been updated to include the Pioneer3-AT URDF.
roslaunch p2os_urdf pioneer3at_urdf.launch

Also, when you say "not exactly the model you want," what do you mean?
