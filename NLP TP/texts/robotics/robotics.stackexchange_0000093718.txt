sudo ip link set can0 type can bitrate 500000
Try this maybe before you give your command
Let me know, if it had worked, we can update it as an answer!

No, it's not working.  Above I have said,it's just right this conmand "set ip link set can0 type can bitrate 500000" causes the error occurrence---"cannot find device can0".

A:

Have been solved. when building Peak Can usb driver,use this :
make â€“C driver NET=NETDEV_SUPPORT
referenced from PCAN-Driver-Linux_UserMan_eng.pdf  in driver/documentation folder.
