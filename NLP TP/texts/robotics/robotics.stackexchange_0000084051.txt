Q:

Invalid roslaunch XML syntax: junk after document element line 3, column 4

dynamixel_controllersTutorialsCreatingmetacontroller
I want to connect the dynamixel AX-64 motor with the PC, however, when I follow the tutorials and create a meta controller, I come across the following question.
I start the controller using the following command.
roslaunch my_dynamixel_tutorial start_meta_controller.launch

the start_meta_controller.launch file is
<!-- Start tilt joint controller -->
<rosparam file="$(find my_dynamixel_tutorial)/tilt.yaml" command="load"/>
    <node name="controller_spawner" pkg="dynamixel_controllers" type="controller_spawner.py"
          args="--manager=dxl_manager
                --port dxl_USB0
                joint1_controller                       
                joint2_controller

                "
          output="screen"/>

 <!-- Start joints trajectory controller controller -->
    <rosparam file="$(find my_dynamixel_tutorial)/joints_trajectory_controller.yaml" command="load"/>
    <node name="controller_spawner_meta" pkg="dynamixel_controllers" type="controller_spawner.py"
          args="--manager=dxl_manager
                --type=meta
                f_arm_controller
                joint1_controller
                joint2_controller
                                                
                "           
                          output="screen"/>

And the error is:
â€¦ logging to /home/acer/.ros/log/63b699b2-a98e-11e7-b094-28e34739f5b2/roslaunch-acer-ubuntu-5609.log
Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.
Press Ctrl-C to interrupt
Done checking log file disk usage. Usage is <1GB.

Invalid roslaunch XML syntax: junk after document element: line 3, column 4
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

How to solve the problem? Thanks in advance.

A:

If that is indeed your full launch file, it is missing the (opening) <launch> and (closing) </launch> tags around all launch XML code.
