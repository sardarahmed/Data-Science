Q:

qemu failure while making chroot for raspbian

Hi folks,
I tried to create a chroot environmnent in accordance with ROS dox "groovy / installation / Raspbian" in ORacle VBox.
Host OS is debian-6.0.7-amd64 squeeze, 2 virtual CPU. Image file I dd'ed from SD card which has 2013-02-09 Raspbian wheezy (it's running OK on Raspberry).
Image mounted OK, I can see it under mounting point /mnt/sdb1/raspb, but when I run
sudo chroot /mnt/sdb1/raspb
qemu fails  with
qemu: fatal: cp15 insn ee070fba
and then register dump...
any ideas how this can be fixed?
Thanks

No ideas I guess

A:

Qemu chroot will not work on the latest raspbian release. It does work on the release from december. You can still download it from here.
I will also add this information to the wiki since I had to find it out the hard way as well.

thanks for giving a clue - I've spent quite lot of time. Any ideas when fresh kernel will be supported? I appreciate you could be wrong person to ask, just wondering...
