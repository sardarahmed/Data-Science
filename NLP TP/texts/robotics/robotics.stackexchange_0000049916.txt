Q:

Installing viso2 for getting odometry for Kinect SLAM

I'm implementing basic version of 2D SLAM using Xbox Kinect and the following packages

pointcloud_to_laserscan
viso2
gmapping

Fortunately, I was able to install pointcloud_to_laserscan by installing turtlebot, even gmapping is already present, but I found that there is no Wiki for downloading this package viso2. I search many places to install using .rosinstall way but roslocate is always showing 404 error. I tried to even update roslocate but everything seems to be the same. I followed thisanswer.
My ROS version is fuerte and it is running in Ubuntu 12.04 Precise.

A:

To install a ROS package for which there is no debian package available, just download the sources somewhere inside your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH and compile it.
As you can see on the wiki page of viso2, the sources for this package are on github: https://github.com/srv/viso2.git
To install the package, just cd into a directory that is in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, clone the repo and rosmake:
cd <my_ros_workspace>
git clone https://github.com/srv/viso2.git
rosmake viso2_ros

If you want to use a Kinect for visual odometry I would strongly recommend to use fovis_ros instead of viso2 as it supports RGBD input. The installation is equivalent:
cd <my_ros_workspace>
git clone https://github.com/srv/fovis.git
rosmake viso2_ros

The roslocate calls fail for these packages as they are (not yet) released for groovy. roslocate uses URLs without a tag for the distribution which currently forward to groovy URLs (that don't exist for these packages).
