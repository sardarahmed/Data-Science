Q:

How can I list the dependency tree of a catkin package?

I am installing ROS from source on a raspberry pi, which has worked well so far.
I have ros_comm built and can launch roscore, which is wonderful. I want to build joystick_drivers next and here lies the problem: Is there a way to automatically download the source for the unmet ROS package dependency tree for the package I'm trying to install. Is this even possible? Or do I need to keep hitting catkin_make and fix build errors one at a time?

A:

Dereck,
You can have the dependency generated online
cd catkin_ws/src
wstool merge http://packages.ros.org/web/rosinstall/generate/raw/groovy/joystick_drivers

You can replace joystick_drivers with any ROS package. It will resolve the full tree but will only merge the missing packages into your source folder. Do no forget to
wstool update

once you merged all packages

Perhaps I'm not setting up my workspace correctly, because that command pulled in every dependency including things I already built. I built and installed ros_comm and it's dependencies in '/opt/ros/groovy' and then created a new workspace with 'wstool init ~/ws/src /opt/ros/groovy'

there is no need to create a new workspace. Go to the src folder where all the ros core packages are in and wstool merge the new ones. That should only pull the new packages

Thanks for updating the wiki, I'm giving it a rundown on an rpi right now.  BTW, is it possible to use overlays with your method? I would like to avoid rebuilding everything each time I add a package to my system.

If you want to use overlays, you do not need to merge the new sources, just initialize wstool with the link:
wstool init src http://packages.ros.org/web/rosinstall/generate/raw/groovy/joystick_drivers
