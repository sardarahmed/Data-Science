A:

Stage is a 2D simulator and Gazebo is a 3D simulator. You can read about each here:

Stage: http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/index.php?src=stage
Gazebo: http://gazebosim.org/

Gazebo is more mature and has been/is under active development. The trade off is most simply put as: Gazebo will take more work and learning to setup, but is higher fidelity and has more features. Stage is simpler to setup, but is older, lower fidelity, and lacks many of the features and integrations of Gazebo.
