Q:

rviz can not send goal to move_base from another computer

Hi,
I am running a car-like robot. I have an move_base node with global/local planner, and I can send goal from rviz to move the car. Now, I want to run the rviz from another computer. Everything works fine, I can see the tf, laser scan etc in rviz. But when I sent the goal with "2D Nav Goal" in rviz from another computer, the car did not move. The car did not get the goal message either when I run "rostopic echo".
Why?

This is most likely a ROS network setup issue. Please try to lookup some earlier questions about topics showing up / being visible, but not being able to receive/send any messages (#q298655 being a very recent one).
