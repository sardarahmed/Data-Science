Q:

Do turtlebot_bringup and turtlebot_dashboard need the same ROS version?

I'm trying to have my Retina MBP (which won't support Ubuntu 13.04 due to hardware incompatibilities, so I'm stuck with 14.04) communicate with my custom turtlebot, running XUbuntu 13.04 on an Odroid U3 (through UbuntuARM). Essentially, my laptop can only run ROS Indigo and my turtlebot can only run ROS Hydro.
When I try to use the Turtlebot Dashboard, I get a slew of errors about incorrect message types. Has anyone had success running the Turtlebot software across two different versions of ROS?

A:

While many things are compatible between indigo and hydro, it seems in particular anything with dashboards is problematic.
