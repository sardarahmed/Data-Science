Q:

Odometry in erratic simulation

Hi people. I am actually running a simulation of erratic robot on gazebo when this particular question strike me. The launch file I used is "erratic_navigation_apps demo_2dnav_slam.launch ".
For my project's purpose, I am trying to change the sources of odometry. When I do a rostopic check and tf_viewframe , I realised that the gazebo is producing the odometry information( the transformation from odom to base_footprint).
But when I run through all the launch files, I can't find which section is responsible for generating the transformation. Or is it that, in a Gazebo simulation, the odometry of the robot will be generated automatically?
In short, may I know which node in "erratic_navigation_apps demo_2dnav_slam.launch" is producing the odometry information? Thank you for your time.

A:

It apears that the transofrm from /base_footprint to /odom is being published by the diffdrive gazebo plugin from the erratic_gazebo_plugins package.  You can find the code in the function publish_odometry() in this file.
The plugin is being launched as part of the robot description .xacro file.
