Q:

ROS Installation, Unable to locate package ros indigo

Hello,
I followed this ROS installation tutorial (wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu)
unfortunately at Desktop full install following error appeared.
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-desktop-full

Reading package lists... Done

Building dependency tree

Reading state information... Done

E: Unable to locate package ros-indigo-desktop-full 

How can I solve this problem ?

Did you remember to do a "sudo apt-get update" after setting the source list and keys?

What version of Ubuntu are you running?
Comment by Jackie_16 on 2016-05-08:
ubuntu 16.04 LTS on x86_64

A:

Indigo is not available for 16.04 (I tried myself last week too :D). Notice the following line in the installation tutorial:

Setup your computer to accept software
from packages.ros.org. ROS Indigo ONLY
supports Saucy (13.10) and Trusty
(14.04) for debian packages.

That means indigo can not be found in the package source that we previously added to our list. Note the "$(lsb_release -sc)" when we add it to the source list. This allows it to only look for ros versions compatible with the linux release info.
There may be a way to install Indigo on 16.04 but I am not aware of it and it is not officially supported so you may run into issues down the line.
If you absolutely need Indigo, I would suggest installing 14.04. Or, if you absolutely need 16.04, there is supposed to be a new ROS release this month. Actually, maybe it's already available, check here for installation.
