Q:

python sending goals to the navigation stack

Is there any good examples on how to send goals to the navigation stack in python? I been looking around and yet to find the equivalent of the example shown in the navigation tutorial.

A:

It's just a matter of making a action call. There is an actionlib tutorial showing how to make an action call with python. For navigation, all you have to do is substitute the appropriate goal type.
