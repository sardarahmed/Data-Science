Q:

Unable to launch turtlebot_playground on indigo

Launching turtlebot_playground on indigo (Ubuntu Trusty) throws up the errors:
[ERROR] [1400811137.391203936]: Failed to load nodelet [/cmd_vel_mux] of type [yocs_cmd_vel_mux/CmdVelMuxNodelet]: Could not find library corresponding to plugin yocs_cmd_vel_mux/CmdVelMuxNodelet. Make sure the plugin description XML file has the correct name of the library and that the library actually exists.
[FATAL] [1400811137.391468550]: Service call failed!
[ERROR] [1400811137.540924502]: Failed to load nodelet [/depthimage_to_laserscan] of type [depthimage_to_laserscan/DepthImageToLaserScanNodelet]: Could not find library corresponding to plugin depthimage_to_laserscan/DepthImageToLaserScanNodelet. Make sure the plugin description XML file has the correct name of the library and that the library actually exists.
[FATAL] [1400811137.541236510]: Service call failed!

despite building both yocs_cmd_vel and depthimage_to_laserscan libraries.

What more  should I do to prevent the above errors? Or do you recommend me to downgrade to hydro (if that's possible on Trusty)?

Hi, I am having exactly the same problem. Did sourcing the bash file solve the problem for you? Thank you!

A:

"despite building" sounds like you are doing a source checkout of these repositories -- have you sourced the correct setup.bash to get these packages on your ros package path?
