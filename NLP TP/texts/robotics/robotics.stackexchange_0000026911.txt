Q:

Attach reference frames to models

I am currently setting up a simulation in Gazebo 2.0. In this scene, there will be a number of objects that the robot will need to interact with.
Is there a way to define coordinate frames relative to the models in the scene, and make them available through TF? If so, how would I go about implementing them?

A:

You can use a robot_state_publisher to send the robots state to tf...
robot_state_publisher
for that you will need a gazebo plugin that publishes the joint states
This can be easily done by a ros_controll plugin as described here:
ROS_Control_with_Gazebo
(the important thing is the joint_state_controller...)
I hope this help
