I am using the Structure Sensor (Depth sensor) on the Parrot AR.Drone using gmapping slam
How do I run the navigation stack and how will the maps be generated

A:

Gmapping is for creating a 2-D occupancy grid map.  You need 3d representation of environment. check this page on mapping using quadrocopter.

Hi
The sensor that I am using gives depth output (not color unlike MS Kinect) only and so I am using gmapping
Also I am using the PX4 autopilot on the Parrot Drone
