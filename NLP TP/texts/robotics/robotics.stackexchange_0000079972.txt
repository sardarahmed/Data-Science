Q:

Display messages std::cout from remote machines

Hi everybody,
I wonder that there are some commands to open a new terminal from master machine ( pc) and to display some messages of std:: out in remote machines using roslaunch ?
Thanks

A:

ROS provides the /rosout topic, logging functions in both C++ (ROS_INFO()) and Python (rospy.loginfo()), and rqt_console, to facilitate viewing log messages from remote machines. (and much, much more!)
There's a rospy Tutorial on Logging and describes how all of these tools fit together.

Hi  ahendrix, thank you for ur reply. Currently, I used ROS_INFO in remote machines and RQT_console to read messages in master machines using ROS launch file. The problem is that the amout of message for two nodes must be displayed constantly and I do not know how to separate them.

The filters in the bottom portion of rqt_console allow you to selectively hide, highlight, or show messages from only some nodes (or based on other criteria).
