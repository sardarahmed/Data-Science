Q:

Unable to follow path using demo data

I am following the demo and using the sample rosbag as per: https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.ai/autoware/-/wikis/ROSBAG-Demo
Instead of using the path generated from the rosbag, i plotted my own path on the vector map and saved the waypoints. Next, I loaded the waypoints and activated the 'Mission_PLanning' module..
But when this happens, the vehicle localization is going haywire and I am getting error of 'Cannot get closest waypoints. All closest waypoints are changed to -1...'
The vehicle also overshoots the goal points and continues to follow the rosbag path.
Is there any way I can solve this issue? so that it follows the path I created.

A:

@titanum456 please be aware that the rosbag demo instructions are not using any kind of simulator. They are just replaying what was recorded in the rosbag.
