Q:

using a library

Hello,
I am a newbie to ROS (and to C++ as well). I need to use some fuctions and classes from a library "itpp-4.2" .Now i have successfully installed the library locally (as i dont have sudo rights) in a folder /home/abc/itpp-4.2 . I want to use these function in a ros node in a ros package. so how can i do that. what files do i need to modify.

A:

On your CMakeList.txt in your ros pkg you need to add something like this:
rosbuild_add_executable(your_node src/your_node.cpp)
target_link_libraries(your_node itpp-4.2)

Hope this helps!

Since that library isn't going to be in the standard folders to look in when linking, you'll also need to add that to the linker search path as well as the headers to the include paths. Look at the CMake docs, specifically the link_directories and include_directories commands .
