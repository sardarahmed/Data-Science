A:

Do you want to launch a roslaunch file from a C++ application?
I don't think there for C++ there is a roslaunch API such as for Python, but I guess you can run roslaunch as a second process from within your C++ application.

There are many ways to do it.  That's pure c++ please look on c++ forums for how to do that.
