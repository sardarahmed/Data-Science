Q:

Is a gazebo world unmodifiable after you hit save?

I created a world in gazebo with 2 levels and realized that I wouldn't see my robot moving in it. So I tried to delete the 2nd level but couldn't find a means to do so. Is the GUI not capable of doing this? Do I have to go through the thousand-line sdf file to remove the level? 

A:

You can call gazebo passing the world file as argument, modify it and use File -> Save As... overwriting the original file.
But a more robust approach is bypassing the GUI editor entirely and creating world and model files directly in your text editor of choice.
The reason GUI editing features don't seem very robust is probably because advanced users seldom use them: instead we use e.g. xacro to enable the creation of part libraries that can be reused in much more flexible ways than any GUI would ever allow.
