Q:

How to talk to two ROS devices over serial?

Heya, I am quite new to ROS.
I have two independent raspberry pi running on ROS. Is it possible to communicate with each other over serial?
for eg:
pi_1 will have a node to control a servo, LED and a counter. I would like the pi_2 to able to publish and subscribe to the nodes on pi_1 over serial.
Could someone give me leads to how I can implement this?
Is it rosserial that I am supposed to use? If so how can I communicate through two different ROS devices?
Do you have any other suggestion on implementing this?
Thanks in advance,
UPDATE(after the response):
In the current situation, I am not able to use ethernet as one pi is a drone and I would need more distance than wifi. I basically want to establish a connection with each other over wireless serial. like a base station and a drone.
So any other option than rosserial?

Heya, Thanks everyone for the support.
I did some research on @gvdhoorn advice. And I have successfully got the two Pi s speaking through serial ethernet. Now I think I can go forward the 'the typical ROS setup for multiple computers' route.
Follow the instructions if anyone would like to try:
