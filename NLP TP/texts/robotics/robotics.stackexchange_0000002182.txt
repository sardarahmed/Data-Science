Q:

What should I use for speech recognition?

I was wondering, my team and me are working on a robot communication-oriented and we wanted to add speech recognition on it.
What technology should I use ?

A:

I don't think there is any "must" for you task. In turn, it depends on what your robot platform is. In the context of embedded systems, MATLAB could be cumbersome.
I don't know what your robot system is like, but maybe this article based on ROS and Sphinx is a good starting point?
Also, for the purpose of understanding speech recognition technologies, the HTK toolkit and the HTK book are a good reference.
