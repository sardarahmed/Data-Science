Q:

ros nao publish bottom camera images

Hello everyone
I am wanting to watch the image projected by NAO from its bottom camera. with Rqt I am changing the camera manually from TOP to Bottom (Since currently I don't know how to do that in ROS), however when I run my code I, the window showing the image tries to be open and then it closes again without showing anything. After that I just receive this message.
[ INFO] [1431005812.789945492]: Waiting for action server to start.
[ INFO] [1431005814.826991562]: Action finished: SUCCEEDED
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
Now, when I keep the TOP camera and I run my program, the image is shown.
I am publishing camera images using
rosrun naoqi_sensors cameras
Could you please tell me what's the thing I am doing wrong? What's the thing I should change? Is there needed a new camera publisher I need to try?
If you want me to send the code I can also load it here, but I don't think it's because of that

A:

I already solved it. It was just that I left the camera working in choreographe and because of this it could not access well. Thanks anyway.
