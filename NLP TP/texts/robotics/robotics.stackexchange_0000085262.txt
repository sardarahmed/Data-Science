Q:

How to visualize trajectory_msgs?

Hello!
I write a package for a robot, that has servo-motors.
How node (from my package) pulbishes JointState msgs, and i can see the visualization of my robot in rviz.
I want to use a ssc32 servo-controller, with which you can set not only the state, but also the speed of single displacement.
I find a ros ssc32 driver, and this driver takes JointTrajectory like input messages.
Is there a way to display moving model of my robot (real robot not exist yet) in rviz with using JointTrajectory?
Maybe I should use gazebo simulator?
Of course, I can write a converter JointTrajectory -> JointState, but there can be a cleaner way?
I use ros-kinetic and ubuntu 16.04.
