Q:

Using a map on RVIZ

Hi,I follow the book Ros By Example.I use  the method mentioned in this book to generating a map with the XV_11 laser scanner.And it seems that the my_map.pgm is 4.1MByte, and when I load this map,RVIZ becomes lagging.And warnnings show upon the terminal:
1、Control loop missed its desired rate:3.0 HZ,it actually takkes 1.3193s
2、Map update missed its desired rate:3.0 HZ,it actually takes 25.098s
Why? I just changed the test_map.pgm with my_map.pgm.Using test_map.pgm is OK and works really well.Maybe it is because my_map.pgm is too big?(test_map.pgm is only 300KB)
So are there any ways to cut the .pgm file to a small size or just filter the white areas?(the scanned mapmy_map.pgmis 2048x2048,I think it is too large)
PS:I tried set the update_frequency in local_costmap_params.yaml to 1HZ,reduce theheight width to 3.0*3.0,reduce the controller_frequency in base_local_planner_params.yaml to 1HZ,but these didn't work.
paste my distro:I run ros Hydro on a Vmware machine(Mem:3G,Cpucores:2),the host is I5-3230M RAM:8G 64bits Lenovo Y400

OK,guys.I actually solved this problem by this way: I open this my_map.pgm with PhotoShop.Then I aborted the none-blank areas,reduce it to 574x544pixels(300kb).And then,everything works fine after this.So,the reason is the map is too large for the Vmware machine to afford it.Should I close this question to show it solved?
