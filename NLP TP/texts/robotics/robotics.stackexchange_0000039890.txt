Q:

roslaunch  tag - custom ssh port

Hey,
is there currently any way to specify a custom ssh port on a remote  target? I tried to specify an alias (from .ssh/config) and address="fqdn:port" but none works (cannot resolve host address for machine:port (or ALIAS)).
Thanks!

...out of curiosity, why do you need a custom ssh port? I can't (off the top of my head) think of why you'd need one.

well I would like to use 22, but the external partner only provides access at a custom port... :(

A:

roslaunch should take into account your ssh configuration file.
If this is not the case, please comment on this ticket.
