I want to run some complicated scenarios on simulations,such as pr2 grasp a cup or similar scenarios.

A:

In electric, you can use pr2_interactive_manipulation: http://www.ros.org/wiki/pr2_interactive_manipulation .
Use 'roslaunch pr2_interactive_manipulation pr2_manipulation_gazebo.launch' to start a sim of a robot with a can on a table in front of it.
Then run 'roslaunch pr2_interactive_manipulation pr2_interactive_manipulation_robot.launch stereo:=true' to start up all the manipulation stacks and such, and 'roslaunch pr2_interactive_manipulation pr2_interactive_manipulation_desktop.launch stereo:=true' to start rviz with relevant topics and such.
The documentation on how to use it is a bit out of date; look at this wiki page for a more up-to-date description: http://www.ros.org/wiki/robhum/grasping
For coding your own autonomous stuff, look at
http://www.ros.org/wiki/pr2_tabletop_manipulation_apps/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20Simple%20Pick%20and%20Place%20Application
for C++
and http://www.ros.org/wiki/pr2_pick_and_place_demos/Tutorials/A%20Simple%20Pick%20And%20Place%20Example%20Using%20The%20Pick%20And%20Place%20Manager
for python.

Did the pr2_manipulation_gazebo.launch file move? It doesn't appear to be in pr2_interactive_manipulation anymore. I'm running electric. https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/stacks/pr2_object_manipulation/branches/0.5-branch/applications/pr2_interactive_manipulation/launch/

Nevermind. Found it in trunk. https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/stacks/pr2_object_manipulation/trunk/applications/pr2_interactive_manipulation/launch/
