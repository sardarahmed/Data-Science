Q:

.bag file error by Hokuyo laser scanner

I am new to ROS. I tried to use " rosbag record -O mylaserdata /base_scan /tf " to record the distance data. But after I finish the recording, there is no message recorded to the ".bag" file. Does anyone know the solution? Thanks in advance.
Is it necessary to set "base_scan" for my laser sensor first? If yes, how?

A:

Someone needs to send messages on the topics you record. If rostopic echo /base_scan gives you something that should also be in the bag.
