Q:

How to get the publisher name from a received message in rospy?

Hey everybody,
I can't find anywhere how to get the publisher name from a received message using python. In C++ I just have to do the following:
void
callback( const ros::MessageEvent< cola2_common::BhResponse const >& event )
{
    const std::string& publisher_name = event.getPublisherName() ;
}

What's the equivalent in python? Thank you!

A:

See here:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/rospy/Overview/Publishers%20and%20Subscribers#Connection_Information

Edit (by @jayess ):
Just so you don't have to go clicking around for the answer (from @bhaskara's link):

A subscriber can get access to a
"connection header", which includes
debugging information such as who sent
the message, as well information like
whether or not a message was latched.
This data is stored as the
_connection_header field of a received message.
e.g.

print m._connection_header

{'callerid': '/talker_38321_1284999593611',
 'latching': '0',
 'md5sum': '992ce8a1687cec8c8bd883ec73ca41d1',
 'message_definition': 'string data\n\n',
 'topic': '/chatter',
 'type': 'std_msgs/String'}

We do not recommend using callerid
information beyond debugging purposes,
as it can lead to brittle code in an
anonymous publish/subscribe
architecture.
