Q:

I am using 2 cameras, astra and kinect for mapping. Could someone tell how to run rtabmap for both the cameras simultaneously?

I need maps of both the cameras simultaneously. As soon as I run rtabmap in another terminal, the first process dies.

You may need to set map_frame_id (default map) and vo_frame_id (default odom) if you don't want the two rtabmap nodes and the two visual odometry nodes to publish on the same TF frames. frame_id should be also set differently between the cameras.
