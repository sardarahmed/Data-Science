Q:

sensor_msgs/Image encoding conversion

Hi,
I'm trying to publish the ros image message encoded as "rgba8" from the original image, which has encoding "bgr8".
What would be a proper way to do that?
I'm thinking of doing it in the following steps:

convert ros image to cvImage
split the channels
merge the image according to "rgba" encoding (assuming a = 255)
convert new cvImage to ros image

This seems a bit tedious... any suggestions??
Thanks!!
