Q:

Unable to install rosserial on Fuerte

Hello,
I am currently trying to install rosserial for ROS Fuerte, and I keep getting server time out message after the command hg clone htp://kforge.ros.org/rosserial/hg rosserial.
I've followed the instruction from htp://wiki.ros.org/ rosserial_arduino/ Tutorials/Arduino%20IDE%20Setup. I'm currently using Raspberry-Pi with Fuerte installed.
I'm a bit new in using Linux and ROS, what should I do ?

A:

The kforge.ros.org server was shut down a while back when Willow Garage downsized. The rosserial package is now hosted on github; you can download the fuerte version using:
git clone -b fuerte-devel https://github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial.git

It should be noted that the fuerte-devel branch is a bit of a best-effort reconstruction and may not actually represent what the last fuerte release actually was...

thanks, that worked ! but later i got this error ''The following args could not be parsed as stacks or packages: ['rosserial_arduino']'' for ''rosmake rosserial_arduino'', any ideas why ?
