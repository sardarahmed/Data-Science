Q:

catkin commands not working

I have installed ros and catkin but when I echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
Inspiron-5559:~/catkin_ws$ echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
/opt/ros/kinetic/share

i don't get the src folder of catkin workspace along with it.Also catkin config command gives the following error.
Inspiron-5559:~/catkin_ws$ catkin config
catkin: command not found

How do I resolve the issue?

A:

The catkin command line tool is part of the python-catkin-tools Ubuntu/Debian package, which must be installed separately from the normal installation instructions of ROS. You can install it like this:
sudo apt-get install python-catkin-tools

After that it will work even if you don't source the /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash file first.
