Q:

Nodes with same name in different packages

Hello,
I am new to ROS and I have a question regarding ROS nodes. Is it possible to create two nodes with same name in different packages?

A:

You can create multiple nodes with the same name in different packages, but there are two things to watch out for if you really want to do this:

ROS requires each node to have a unique name at runtime, so you'll need to give each node a different name="" in your launch files, use anonymous names, or use the __name:= parameter to change the node name when starting it from the command line
Since a catkin workspace is a single cmake project, each target name needs to be unique across the entire workspace. To get around this, you'll need to use a unique name for each target, and then set the executable name afterwards with set_target_properties:

Package A cmakelists.txt:
add_executable(packageA-node node.cpp)
set_target_properties(packageA-node OUTPUT_NAME node)

Package B cmakelists.txt
add_executable(packageB-node node.cpp)
set_target_properties(packageB-node OUTPUT_NAME node)

Thanks for answering

It should be set_target_properties(packageB-node PROPERTIES OUTPUT_NAME node) instead of set_target_properties(getpose_grade OUTPUT_NAME getpose)
