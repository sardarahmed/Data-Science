Q:

What is telemetry used for?

I'm pretty new to the world of UAS after a ten year holiday from RC flying.
I'm looking at Ardupilot and am wondering what purpose telemetry serves? Is it just to get in flight data back to a ground station or can it also be used to program the system in flight? Are there other capabilities that I am missing?

A:

Telemetry is used to get in-flight data back to a ground station. For example, attitude (roll, pitch, yaw), altitude, GPS position, speed, battery voltages. It just gives you more feedback.
It can also be used to alert you when battery levels are too low or when a fault occurs.
