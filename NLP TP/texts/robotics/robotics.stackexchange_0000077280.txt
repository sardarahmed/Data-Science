Q:

Remaping topics doesn't work

Hi I'm using Ros and I have some Camera-Data on topic
    /kinect2/sd/points

now I want to remap them to
      /camera/depth/points

Here the code I use:
<include file="$(find kinect2_bridge)/launch/kinect2_bridge.launch">
    <param name = "_depth_method"   value="cuda" />
    <param name = "_reg_method"     value="cpu" />
    <remap from="/camera/depth/points"  to="/kinect2/sd/points"/> 
</include>

Now if I listen with "rotopic echo" to the topic of "kinect2/sd/points" I got many output. But if I listen to the topic "/camera/depth/points" I get no Data.
Can anybody help me is the order of the remap right=?

You want to map from /kinect2/sd/points to /camera/depth/points and you have
you need
They're the wrong way around

A:

You won't get output. The topic, as you mentioned, has been remapped. The node doesn't duplicate the data
If you want to duplicate the topic then use relay:
