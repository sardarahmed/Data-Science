Q:

Parameters for cmd_vel_mux

I wish to adjust the priority of cmd_vel_mux
For this purpose I've located some .YAML files for understanding the syntax.

name:        "Safe reactive controller"
topic:       "safety_controller"
timeout:     0.2
priority:    10
name:        "Keyboard operation"
topic:       "keyboard_teleop"
timeout:     0.2
priority:    7

I can't figure out what is the exact meaning of these fields - name/topic/timeout/priority.
Of course "name" is a name... But in which namespace? Where do I set this namespace?
"timeout" is a measure of time, guessing - idle time while dealing with the callback, but what units? (second/milliseconds/minutes)
Priority - which is high, which is low? What is the maximum number of priorities available?
Topic - same as name. I do not know any of these topics, they are not available when listing the current topics (rostopic list), so I guess it is also another namespace (?)

Hi @meirela !
The field topic should be filled with the full name of the input topic with also the namespace (i.e.: "/ns1/cmd_vel").
Timeout means for how much time the mux will latch the last command received if no incoming topics with different priorities are received. It should be in seconds.
Priority: this is easy; the higher the number filling the field, the higher the priority. I tried the node with five incoming topics, but I think you can set an arbitrary number of them.
Name: this field indicates whose incoming topic is being published by the multiplexer. This can be checked by subscribing to the output topic "/name/active".
Remember that the namespace of the output topic is the same of the  node's name.
