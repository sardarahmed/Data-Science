A:

I will answer this one as it seems the only one "legit", I mean try to post your question in a new question rather than copy-paste it in every single uwsim tagged question please this just causes confusion.
As Miquel answered in other post do you have 3d support in your computer?, and have you tried starting it with --disableShaders option?. Segmentation fault at loading usually means a problem with graphic card/drivers so check if 3d is working.
