Q:

ROS Tracked Robot Gazebo Simulation

Hello, I am quite new to ROS and currently making a track robot model for gazebo & rviz simulation.
I have finished making the meshes of my robot with wheels and managed to make a basic URDF file.
First Question. Now I am wondering how do I add the track model to the URDF file. Do I just make another mesh of the whole chain and add it just as I did with the wheels? (what will be the joint type and where do I position the joint?)
Second Question. If I did add the chain and simply fixed its position. How will the chain move such that it moves in relation to the wheels?
I have checked the following links but I am learning them step by step.

A:

Now there is official support for tracked robots in Gazebo 9 and 11 using ODE. Check out https://github.com/osrf/gazebo/blob/gazebo11/worlds/tracked_vehicle_simple.world for usage example.
