Q:

How to deal with deleted message types in bag migration?

I have a bag with a topic that is no longer used, which uses a type which is no longer used. rosbag check will interpret this as a moved message type, and prompt me to enter the new location of the message type.
If instead of moving this message type, I just want to ignore this message type, is there a way to do this? I realize I could use rosbag filter if necessary to remove this topic beforehand, but if there's another solution that doesn't involve creating an extra bag in the middle, I'd prefer that solution.

A:

One semantically-correct way to do this would be to migrate the message into a std_msgs/Empty, but this (annoyingly) results in a syntax error in some generated python code. I've found that migrating the message to a std_msgs/Bool seems to work okay.
