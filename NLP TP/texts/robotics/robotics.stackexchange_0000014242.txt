Q:

Confusion in fixing DH frames

I am analyzing a concept of a surgical robot with 4 revolute joints and one sliding joint. I am not able to fix the coordinate frame for last prismatic joint.
Following are the schematics of robot and DH frames I have fixed

As X4 axis and X5 axis are intersecting each other, I am not able to capture joint distance variable(di) for the slider. How can I fix this?
Following are the parameters for rest of the frames

Updated Frames:

A:

The updated image solves the problem. You did not consider the end-effector coordinate frame earlier.
Also, the crosses (going into) in the diagrams should be replaced by dots(coming out), because the crosses don't hold the right hand rule in case you are using a right hand coordinate system.

A:

Add a coordinate system that matches the previous coordinate system exactly.   The last rotary joint will be the parameter for the next-to-last coordinate system, and the link length will be the parameter for the prismatic joint.  
Note:  a simpler approach is possible, but this gets the job done easily.
