Q:

Updating OpenNI and NITE version

I'm using the Kinect for person tracking, and I have encountered a bug where OpenNI causes a segmentation fault when many objects move in/out of the frame.  I did some research and it looks like the bug (below) was fixed in a newer version of OpenNI/NITE.
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00007fffe23b374d in Segmentation::checkOcclusion(int, int, int, int) () from /usr/lib/libXnVFeatures.so
(gdb)

My question is, how can I safely update OpenNI to the latest version to work within the ROS framework?
Thanks for the help!

A:

Well I'm not sure that I fixed the problem, but I haven't seen the segfault since updating to the latest stable OpenNI binaries here
