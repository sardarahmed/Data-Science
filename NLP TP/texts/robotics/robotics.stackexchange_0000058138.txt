Q:

How can I put my urdf file in filesystem/opt/ros/hydro/share?

In Ros wiki tutorials, There are a lot of packages that any one can install in his PC using commands .
For example the urdf_tutorial package. I used the command  rosdep install urdf_tutorial to install it on my PC.
It has been installed in filesystem/opt/ros/hydro/share with its URDF and launch files  & when I used commands in terminal to view the R2D2 robot, it worked successfully.But,when I created my own urdf file, I couldn't put it in filesystem/opt/ros/hydro/share in the same concept as  urdf_tutorial package to be able to view it in Rviz. I also couldn't modify its urdf files to be suitable for my own robot.
So, my question is: How can I put my urdf file in filesystem/opt/ros/hydro/share ??
or how can I modify a urdf file that is found in filesystem/opt/ros/hydro/share ??

Is there any commands that should I
use in terminal to do that ??

Are there any prerequisites that
should I install on my pc ??

my distribution is Hydro.
I use ubuntu 12.10.

Please,help.

A:

There is a command to transfer any file from place to another. This command is sudo cp.

The command should be like that:

sudo cp /path of the file where your file exists   /path of file where you want to transfer your file

For example:

sudo cp
/home/eman/Downloads/my_robot.urdf
/opt/ros/hydro/share/urdf_tutorial

where /home/eman/Downloads/my_robot.urdf is the path where the urdf_file ( my_robot.urdf ) exists and /opt/ros/hydro/share/urdf_tutorial is the path where I want to transfer this file.
When I used this command,it had worked successfully & my urdf_file has been transferred to the urdf_tutorial package.
