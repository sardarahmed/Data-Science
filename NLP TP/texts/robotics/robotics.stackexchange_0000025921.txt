Q:

how to use the 'gazebo::physics::JointFeedback Class' in the model plugin or sensor plugin?

if I add a model plugin or a sensor plugin, I want to use the gazebo::physics::JointFeedback Class to obtain the force and torque of the link,
or use the gazebo::physics::Joint Class to obtain the force and torque and 'SetForce' to a joint?
what .h file need to include?
and how can I use the class's member function?
thank you.

A:

I think the minimum includes you'll need are:
#include <gazebo/physics/Joint.hh>
#include <gazebo/physics/JointWrench.hh>

and use the function this way:
physics::JointPtr joint = this->model->GetJoint("my_joint_name");
physics::JointWrench wrench = joint->GetForceTorque(0);

It's not a good example as it's convoluted, but the AtlasPlugin makes use of the GetForceTorque calls to get forces and torques at wrist and ankle.
