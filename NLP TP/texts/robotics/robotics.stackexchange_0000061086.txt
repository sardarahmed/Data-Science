Q:

Error in dependencies voxel_grid

When I make rosdep check costmap_2d
i get this error :
 System dependencies have not been satisified:
apt ros-groovy-map-msgs
ERROR[costmap_2d]: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [voxel_grid]
    rosdep key : voxel_grid
    OS name    : ubuntu
    OS version : precise
    Data: <no data>

Howerver, i already have created a package voxel_grid, which had any error.
I really don't know what to do
I'm using groovy (Ubuntu 12.04)

Hi, did you put voxel grid in pacake.xml and cmakelists ?
Comment by Moda on 2014-07-23:
Yes I have

Is it same build as you are trying in other question, I mean same package or different. If different please post package.xml and cmakelist

It is the same package but I'm trying to solve two issues : one is that the pcl/conversions.h is not found the second is that the voxel_grid dependencies is not satisfied, that why I posted two question

A:

What do you mean you "created a package voxel_grid"?
Are you executing the rosdep check command in a shell where you have sourced the setup file for groovy (source /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash)?
Is rosdep cache up to date? (rosdep update)
EDIT: You cannot depend on voxel_grid from a catkin package in groovy, since it is a dry (= rosbuild) package and catkin packages cannot depend on rosbuild packages. In hydro, voxel_grid is a catkin package and this error should not occur.
If you must use groovy and you must depend on voxel_grid, then you should build your package with rosbuild, not catkin. Maybe it is possible to install a catkinized navigation stack (of which voxel_grid is a part) from source ontop of your groovy installtion, but it might not even work at all without major tweaks.

I'm executing rosdep in my workspace /catkin_ws
I created a package with catkin_create_pkg
Yes I already launched rosdep update
Comment by demmeln on 2014-07-23:
So voxel_grid is part of the navigation stack, which on groovy is a dry package (i.e. rosbuild, not catkin). That means you cannot build a catkin package that does depend on it. @William: Is this actually the cause of the error, or is something funky going on with the release status of the navig
Comment by demmeln on 2014-07-23:
ation stack on groovy? Should rosinstall_generator voxel_grid --rosdistro groovy work or does that only work for stacks with dry packages, @Dirk Thomas? (I noticed rosinstall_generator navigation --rosdistro groovy still works).
Comment by William on 2014-07-23:
He said he created a package called voxel_grid, could the problem be that there is already a package called voxel_grid? http://wiki.ros.org/voxel_grid?distro=groovy
Comment by demmeln on 2014-07-23:
Unless he has built and sourced the workspace, the package is not going to be picked up. I tested depending on voxel_grid from a catkin package and get the same error with rosdep and rosdistro groovy. voxel_grid is dry, so maybe that is expected (although the msg is hardly useful in that case).
