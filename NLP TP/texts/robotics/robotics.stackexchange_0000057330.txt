Q:

Unable to install ROS Groovy on Raspberry Pi

Hello all,
I'm currently trying to install ROS on my Raspberry Pi, I just followed the instruction on http://wiki.ros.org/groovy/Installation/Raspbian and got some errors, error 404 server not found, when I do some researching, I found out that the instruction is outdated.
for information, I've install Raspbian from NOOBs for my Raspberry Pi an running on Raspberry Pi Type B
anyone could help ?

A quick glance suggests that the repository still exists, and should probably still work. Can you add the exact command and error you're seeing to your question?

when I reload apt sources, I got this error:
Err http://ros.raspbian.org wheezy/main armhf Packages
404  Not Found
W: Failed to fetch http://ros.raspbian.org/repo/ros/dists/wheezy/main/binary-armhf/Packages  404  Not Found
any ideas ?

A:

It looks like the repository at ros.raspbian.org is no more. Try removing that line from your sources and using the builds for raspbian that are located in http://64.91.227.57/repos/rospbian instead.

how to remove that line because the line reloads itself when I execute the "sudo apt-get update" command
