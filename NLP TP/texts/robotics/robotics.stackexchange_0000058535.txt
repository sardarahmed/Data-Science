Q:

Can you use ROS to save images to PCD?

All of the search results I find for interaction for ROS and PCL are a few years old.  I'm curious if there is a way to save PCD files from Kinect streams directly by a ROS input.  Let's assume that the Kinects are launched through the standard openni.launch approach with names kinect_1 and Kinect_2. Would I be able to take "snapshots" of the stream and then use that data for a PCD file and PCL applications?

A:

IÂ´m not aware of any official implementation, but writing a small node(let) that does this should be pretty easy. In this Q/A something very close to what you want to do is discussed (along with code).
