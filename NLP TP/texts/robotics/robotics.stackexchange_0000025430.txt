Q:

What is the proper drcsim-1.1 setup for the moving joints by animation tutorial

In going through the tutorials again, I've noticed that the wiki is not up to date for the controller changes to drcsim-1.1.  Specifically, the drc_robot_position_controller.launch must be used in place of drc_robot.launch for earlier tutorials.  (I made note of this on the first tutorial wiki.)
I tried the http://gazebosim.org/wiki/Tutorials/drcsim/ros\_animated\_robot tutorial, but it does not appear to work either.
I haven't been able to back out the changes to world that would have changed the plugin behavior yet; has anyone gotten this to work with the drcsim-1.1 release?
