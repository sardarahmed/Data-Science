Q:

CRAM-based control system - what to start from

Hello, everyone!
I participate in one robotics project at my University. it is development of high-level control system for full-sized humanoid robot. It will be used to manipulate objects and to navigate in office-like environment (e.g. his task could be "find a blue ball on a table and bring it to me"). I want to use CRAM for this. I've studied some papers about CRAM and KnowRob, walked through tutorials, I understand main principles and architecture of CRAM. but what now? What should I start from? my colleagues are currently writing initial ros package to abstract low-level mechanisms.
Can anyone provide an example of CRAM-based control system?
Should I first fill in the knowledge base with needed data (furniture, room description etc.) or should I write some simple plans?
any help is appreciated..

A:

Probably you already know the tutorials at http://www.ros.org/wiki/cram_core/Tutorials.
There are some more advanced examples by the authors of CRAM in their GitHub repository, see e.g. https://github.com/cram-code/cram_pr2.git.
I would start out by writing some simple CRAM plans without KnowRob at first to get used to the system. Later you can extend these to make use of KnowRob queries.
