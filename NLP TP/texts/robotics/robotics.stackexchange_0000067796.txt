Q:

path planning without using an already made map

I need to control (path planning) a robot without sensing environment by any sensor. I mean without using a prepared map.
To do this, I need to set a starting coordination, an end point and coordination of obstacles, then to find the shortest collision-free path by the use of a simple algorithm under ROS environment (A ROS node that calculates the shortest path and command the robot to traverse).
Dose anybody have any idea how to:
1-  Create a so-called hand-made map under ROS package application.
2-  make understand the robot that it has a path ahead without a map?
What else do I need to consider for this simple test? Do I need a special already made ROS package?
I am open to any suggestion, link and information.
Thanks,

A:

This can't be done. You need some kind of sensor on your robot for determining the position of the robot. I also strongly recommend sensors for detecting obstacles.
If you do have a way of determining your location (odometry, gps, indoor radio beacons, etc), you could use that in conjunction with a static map to navigate. This approach makes two very dangerous assumptions:

the map is perfect, and that nothing has moved since the map was made
the robot knows its location very accurately
