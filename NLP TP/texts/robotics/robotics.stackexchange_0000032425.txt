A:

Use the openni_kinect package to set up your Kinect. You should be able to view the published point cloud topic in RViz.
Then, you can go through the pcl tutorials and pcl_ros tutorials. Tutorial 6 from the pcl_ros tutorials (SACSegmentationFromNormals planar segmentation) should do exactly what you need.
