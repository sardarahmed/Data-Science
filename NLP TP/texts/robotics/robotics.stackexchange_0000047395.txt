Q:

laptop recommendation

Dear community,
I am evaluating the purchase of a laptop to run ROS (fuerte or groovy) under Ubuntu 12.04. The most important requirement is that it should be able to handle data from at least 2 RGB-D sensors (Kinect and alike, I should be careful with USB 3.0 issues and all that).
Any recommendation?
Thank you very much in advance.

Openni driver seems work not fine with ubuntu 12.04. I met several problem with that. Especially USB 3.0 couldn't work. I can't find any way work with USB3.0 in my laptop. I only share my experience not the fact that every computer have the same error.

Hi sam! Thanks for sharing!! Yeah, I am also having trouble on the desktop PC with multiple openni devices with USB 3.0. Everything works fine if I plug them to USB 2.0. Apparently you need to patch kernels lower than 3.4.1.

I use a SYSTEM 76 serval laptop with 2 RGB-D sensors. It works quite well.

Hi Akin! Thanks for your quick reply! Did you had any issue with the RGB-D sensors and the USB 3.0 ports? As far as I know, you need to patch the kernel if your version is lower than 3.4.1. Thanks!

The laptop that I mentioned has only USB 2.0 ports. But I had had unsuccessful attempts to make kinect work with USB 3.0. I would strongly recommend a laptop where you can select to use USB3's in USB2 mode in BIOS. I know that Lenovos has that option. I think Dell laptops too.

Uhhh I didn't know you could set USB2 mode, that is great news! I'll research about it! Thanks Akin :)
