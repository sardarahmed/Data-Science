Q:

I have built laser_geometry with catkin, no error. as discription in ros wiki about gtest. It will generate a runable test. But there is nothing.
How do I test the package? Someone has used this package? Help me please. Thanks a lot!

Is there a test_depend for gtest in your package.xml?

A:

Thank you joq. I have found answer in your blog space  and run test successful.
I have to execute "make tests" in ~/catkin_ws/build, not ~/catkin_ws, if not, it will prompt :
(make: *** 没有规则可以创建目标“tests”。 停止。)
by the way. "test_depend" is not needed. Thanks again for your reply!
