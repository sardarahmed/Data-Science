Q:

Hello,
I'm just begin to use ROS for about 3 months to do a project in my university. I am having a problem with move_base server since it seem not able to come up. When i run rostopic list there a few topic appear (https://imgur.com/LlIR150). I also try send a simple goal with the code finding in https://bit.ly/36MHiFC  (ROS tutorial sending a navigation goal) but nothing happen (https://imgur.com/WHLMcah). Since there are no error show up i dont know what i have done wrong
Can anyone help me with this

A:

At least, odom, map, and sensor_topic are missing.
Also read the move_base documentation.
