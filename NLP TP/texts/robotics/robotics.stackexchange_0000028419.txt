Q:

no GetAngles() member in JointState Class in Gazeo Api 9?

error:
 /home/robot/rtt_gazebo/rtt_gazebo_examples/src/default_gazebo_component.cpp:107:41: error: ‘__gnu_cxx::__alloc_traits<std::allocator<gazebo::physics::JointState> >::value_type {aka class gazebo::physics::JointState}’ has no member named ‘GetAngles’
         state_pos_[j] = joint_states[j].GetAngles();

code:
 joint_states[j](JointPtr gazebo_joints_[j]);
        state_pos_[j] = joint_states[j].GetAngles();
  std::vector<gazebo::physics::JointPtr> gazebo_joints_;
  std::vector<gazebo::physics::JointState> joint_states; 

i'm using gazebo9 version. as i studied this gazebo 9 api jointstate class, their is presence of getangle member in class jointstate, than why is this error coming.

A:

The documentation you linked to is for Gazebo 7.1.0, you should look here for the Gazebo 9.0.0 documentation (note the version on the URL).
If you check the Migration guide, you'll see that the GetAngles changed to Positions:
Deprecation: const std::vector<math::Angle> GetAngles() const
Replacement: const std::vector<double> &Positions() const

The link is broken. Found this one instead: https://github.com/osrf/gazebo/blob/gazebo11/Migration.md
