Q:

openni ros-fuerte ubuntu 12.04 anyone?

Hi all.
I have posted a couple of questions already considering execution of
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch

in ubuntu 12.04 under ros fuerte. It produces plenty of errors, that you may find in threads: this and this
Though, now I'm not asking to dig into anything.
I would really like to know if there actually are any people who are able to use the command provided above in ros fuerte under ubuntu 12.04 or alike?
Thanks. Waiting for your responses.

Em, as far as I know this bug was fixed. I am able to get the ASUS Kinect to work on my laptop with Ubuntu 12.04 and fuerte on it.
