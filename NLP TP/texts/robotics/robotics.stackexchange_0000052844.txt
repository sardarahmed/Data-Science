Q:

odom frame changes hight

Hi,
i have a short question about the odom frame.
How is the wanted behaviour of it ?
My Problem is my odom frames changes it hight all time
it is: 0.31 -> 0.12 -> 0.25 -> 0.31 -> 0.12 .....
Is that the behaviour it should it keep it hight?
The UAV is not moving, it just stand on the ground.
The x and y coordinate are stable
Can someone please explain me how the odom frame should act ?

Your odom frame is defined w.r.t to which frame?? Check that because any change in parent frame can effect the child frame..

the TF tree ist map -> odom -> base_footprint -> ...
The map frame is stable. And the base footprint follows the jumps of the odom frame

Hey, I would take a look on the encoder values. Maybe the base_footprint is coupled to the encoders. At kobuki-base I had some problems first, because I did not know that then jump after reaching ~6500 or so. But code would be even more useful - please post some :)

A:

Look at the odom values and see what is causing those jumps and also look at corresponding velocities in odom values.
