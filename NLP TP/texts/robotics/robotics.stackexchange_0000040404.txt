Q:

pcl down sampling and filtering - retaining width and height (organized cloud)

Is it possible to retain width and height (organized cloud) after doing some operations with PCL library?
I am doing down sampling with VoxelGrid and then PassThrough filtering. In every step I loose width and height data and get unorganized Point Cloud eventhough I start with organized cloud from Kinect.
Thank you for help.

A:

In many cases retaining the original 2D structure is not possible.
In detail, the answer depends on exactly what operations are performed.
