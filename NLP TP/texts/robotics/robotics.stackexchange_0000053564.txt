Q:

How to represent a 'char' in rosmsg files

I have to represent character(unsigned char) in ros msg files. As mentioned in the wiki, they have primitive types for string, integer, floats but not for the character.
However the wiki does say that char: deprecated alias for uint8 . I do not know what does that mean.
How can I represent something like unsigned char code[N]; from C++ where N=2; into msg format. Would it be uint8[] code. Where do I put in the '2' or I dont have to put it and msg fomat finds out the length of array itself.
Here is the link to wiki for ros msg

A:

Just use a uint8 to store a char in your message type.

You can put the 2 or not. If you put it, it's fixed length array. If you don't put it, the data will be dynamic length.
