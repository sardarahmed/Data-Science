Q:

global_plan goes through the wall

Hello,
I'm using navigation stack with following parameters:
(costmap_common_params.yaml)

global_frame: /map
robot_base_frame: base_footprint
update_frequency: 0.5
publish_frequency: 0.5
obstacle_range: 2.5
raytrace_range: 3.0
min_obstacle_height: 0.6
inflation_radius: 1.5
observation_sources: scan
scan: {sensor_frame: laser_scan_link,
data_type: LaserScan, topic:
stereo/laser_scan, marking: true,
clearing: true}

(eband_planner_params.yaml)

EBandPlannerROS:

TRAJECTORY CONTROL

differential_drive: true

velocity limits

max_vel_lin: 0.4

max_vel_th: 0.2

min_vel_lin: 0.08

min_in_place_vel_th: 0.05

goal tolerance

xy_goal_tolerance: 0.2

yaw_goal_tolerance: 0.2

(global_costmap_params.yaml)

global_costmap:

robot_base_frame: base_footprint

update_frequency: 0.5

publish_frequency: 0.5

static_map: true

transform_tolerance: 0.5

footprint_padding: 0.05

(local_costmap_params.yaml)

local_costmap:

global_frame: /map

robot_base_frame: base_footprint

update_frequency: 0.5

publish_frequency: 0.5

static_map: true

rolling_window: true

width: 5.0

height: 5.0

resolution: 0.05

transform_tolerance: 0.5

footprint_padding: 0.0

(move_base_params.yaml)

footprint: [[0.375, 0.375], [0.375, 0.0], [0.4125, 0.0], [0.4125, -0.0375], [0.375, -0.0375], [0.375, -0.375], [-0.075, -0.375], [-0.075, -0.4875], [-0.375, -0.4875], [-0.375, 0.4875], [-0.075, 0.4875], [-0.075, 0.375]]

The controller_frequency is set to 1.0.
The problem is that the global plan computed goes through the wall. The plan of NavfnROS is fine. The bad one in the image is the global plan of EBandPlannerROS (robot tries to follow this one).
As seen by the below image, Laser scan is well defined. I don't understand why this path is computed. Can anyone help me on this issue please?

A:

I just left eband planner. I am using the standard one, base_local_planner, and everything is ok! Thank you
