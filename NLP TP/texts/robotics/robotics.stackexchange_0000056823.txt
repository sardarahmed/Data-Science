Q:

Compilation errors after ROS update (ros/datatypes.h missing?)

Since today I am receiving the following error when trying to compile my packages. No changes were made to my packages and they compiled just fine last week. I did update Ubuntu and ROS over the weekend.
/opt/ros/hydro/include/ros/serialization.h:40:27: fatal error: ros/datatypes.h: No such file or directory
  compilation terminated.

I am using Ubuntu 13.04 and ROS Hydro.
Any help is appreciated!

A:

I think I had the same problem a week ago.
Try these commands:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

Let me know if this works.
Another problem (if you plan to use kinect) I had with Ubuntu 13.04 was with the openni libraries. I needed to go back to the 12.04. Regards

Thanks! These commands gave me some useful error messages which I could resolve! :)
Apparently some dependencies on my machine were messed up. I ended up reinstalling most of ros-hydro which worked.
