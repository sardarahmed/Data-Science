Q:

Initial Condition for Joints

Hi, I would like to know is there is a way to start a simulation with initial angles in a model.
I have tried in a plugin:
Link_A->SetAngle(0,InitialAngle);

But, when the simulation starts, the model move it's joint dynamically to the InitialAngle. I need a model with an initial condition in the joint's angles.
Thank you!

A:

Use SetJointPosition, this may be what you want.  But if there are active controllers, be sure to set new targets at the same time.
