Q:

Triggering pip requirements.txt from catkin build

Is it possible to get catkin build to run pip install -r requirements.txt?
Some of the python package dependencies for my package are in version control systems, and because of this I think I need to use pip to install them instead of putting them in setup.py.

A:

Conceptually this is not quite right. rosdep is the tool which should be used to install dependencies. You can add rosdep rules which resolve to pip installations (including directly from version control). You can have these rules locally or propose them for the rosdep database (https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/tree/master/rosdep).
You should run rosdep once to satisfy dependencies and then the build (catkin_make, catkin_make_isolated, or catkin build) should be called many times and therefore it shouldn't do any dependency resolution as part of the build.
