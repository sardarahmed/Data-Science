Q:

XBox Joystick - detecting signal loss

I ran into a weird behavior (i.e. crashing my robot uncontrollable into a wall) because while operating the robot, the battery shutdown. Due to the autorepeat function inside the joy_node, the last command was infinitely repeated until crash.
The question here is, if there is any option for the xbox controller to find out if signal is lost or still available.

A:

I had a similar problem with the xbox controller publishing garbage messages on startup and messing things up. I switched to the xboxdrv driver and have no more problems. It looks like it also publishes a no-buttons-pushed joy message when I take the battery out.
Here's how to set it up.
NOTE: It switches the pad buttons to be axes, so you'll have to change up your nodes using the joy message. EDIT: I hadn't read far enough in the man page, but it's highly configurable.
