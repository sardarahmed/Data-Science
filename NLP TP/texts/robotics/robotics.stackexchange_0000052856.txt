Q:

remote launch $find resolves to local machine

I'm launching some nodes in a remote machine, everything works fine except the parameters passed using the $find macro are being resolved locally and not to the remote machine path. The parameters are loaded to the parameter server based on the local files, and filenames parameters became with the wrong path.
thanks!

What is your question?

A:

As documented in the [$find macro](http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML) all invocations of $find are resolved locally.
