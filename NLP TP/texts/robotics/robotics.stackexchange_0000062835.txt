Q:

Installation of Explore package in Hydro

Hello,
I am trying to install the Explore package (http://wiki.ros.org/exploration) in Hydro. It seems that a lot of the functions used in explore refer to external packages which have since been updated, leading to error in the installation process.
Has anyone successfully gotten explore working in Hydro who is willing to share their installation process?
Thank you.
