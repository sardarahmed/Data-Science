I've tried updating to the latest arduino 1.0.2 and the latest rosserial under electric with the same error.

A:

This looks like you upgraded the computer to rosserial 0.3.0, but did not update your Arduino libraries and/or re-upload the code to the Arduino. We recently added the md5 checksum to each topic negotiation so that users are alerted about changes in messages (which causes difficult to debug errors).
