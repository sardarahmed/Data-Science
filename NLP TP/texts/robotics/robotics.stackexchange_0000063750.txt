Q:

OSX Homebrew : catkin_make_isolated

When invoking the command

$ ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install-space /opt/ros/indigo -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

I get the following output

==> Processing plain cmake package: 'stage'
CMake Error at /usr/local/Cellar/cmake/3.0.2/share/cmake/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:136 (message):

Please help.

A:

Did you install dependencies via rosdep? It appears you are missing FLTK, which is not a ROS package and should be coming in from the rosdep step of the install.
