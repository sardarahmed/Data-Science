Q:

Using Rosjava Time

I am trying to use the ClockTopicTimeProvider to get time information, but it's constructor takes a defaultNode. Most of my nodes were launched via nodeMainExecutor,
nodeMainExecutor.execute(sensorView, nodeConfiguration);

The result of this has a connectedNode, I tried casting this to a defaultNode but that didn't work.  The actual constructor for a defaultNode looks like its definably not something I should be using.
Has anyone had any success getting ClockTopicTimeProvider working? Or knows how one obtains the "defaultNode" For reference I have multiple other subscribers and publishers working, and this is an android application using rosjava.

A:

You should ask the Node for the current time instead of using a TimeProvider directly. You can specify the TimeProvider to use in the NodeConfiguration then use Node.getCurrentTime().
A ClockTopicTimeProvider will be used automatically if the /use_sim_time parameter is true when the Node starts.
