Q:

Best desktop computer option for ROS

I am planning to buy a new desktop specifically to use ROS and Turtlebot application. Is there a best option to go after. It would be nice to have a machine with Ubuntue and perhaps ROS pre-installed and a graphic card that is going to be the best option for Gazebo and rviz.

Gazebo requires more power than rviz, for this reason I would ask this question to http://answers.gazebosim.org too If I were you. One has to be quite careful with graphic cards since not all of them work in ubuntu easily

A:

I use a System 76 Leopard Extreme as my desktop, and have been very happy with it.  Enough power to run Gazebo and some control code, and zero problems with nVidia video card.  Preinstalled with Ubuntu 12.04.  I also have a Gazelle Professional laptop, which I'm similarly happy with, although it weighs a ton.  The seem to have moved to an Intel graphics card for this, though, rather than the nVidia that I have in mine.

Thanks for your reply. I was wondering how much graphic card is needed, the default is 1GB nVidia, is it enough.

I've got whatever the default option is, and it's fine.  A faster/better card will let you render more polygons, but the critical thing, IMO, is the closed-source nVidia drivers.

I'm quite happy with my System 76 Serval laptop. ZaReazon also makes a good platform as long as they have the discrete graphics cards.
