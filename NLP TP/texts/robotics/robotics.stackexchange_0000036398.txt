Q:

Problem with Tutorial link

Hello,
I've been documenting the following package on ROS.org: patrolling_sim.
My next step would be to write a tutorial. I looked into How to Write a Tutorial page. There, it says "In the sidebar of the page there will be a link for tutorials". However, i did not find such link.
Therefore, I made some navigation bar magic and went to the imaginary page:
[http://www.ros.org/wiki/patrolling_sim/Tutorials/Run patrolling_sim](http://www.ros.org/wiki/patrolling_sim/Tutorials/Run patrolling_sim) and created my tutorial with the name "Run patrolling_sim".
After I finished the tutorial, I noticed that it wasn't related to my package. Instead, it has gone to the following link:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/%40PAGE%40/Run%20patrolling_sim
Obviously, I made a mistake in the process. Can someone help me move the tutorial in order to be linked with my package? Beyond not being able to move the tutorial, I was not also able to delete it (to later create a new one related to the package).

OK, so I basically created the tutorial again, now in the correct place.
I just need someone with privileges at ROS.org to delete the initial tutorial:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/%40PAGE%40/Run%20patrolling_sim
Thanks.

You're right to just create the Tutorial page in the location.  We changed the sidebar to not show the dead link if the page doesn't exist.  If you just create PACKAGE_NAME/Tutorials page the link should become active.  I've cleaned up the extra wiki page you created.
