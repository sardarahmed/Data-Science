Q:

how to localize robot with lidar in ros melodic

I was using laser_scan_matcher and AMCL nodes together to locate my robot in ROS Kinetic. Unfortunately, laser_scan_matcher is not working with ROS Melodic and AMCL is not enough. Are there any other packages to localize a robot by using lidars and odometry?

What do you mean that laser scan matcher doesn't work with ROS melodic? There's no reason that it shouldn't

I mean it only has indigo and kinetic versions.

Kinetic is essentially the same as Melodic. It will work fine.

It is problematic to install laser-scan-matcher from source. I think somebody who use ros melodic, has to use laser odometry too. So, there must be a package to generate laser odometry. Are there any packages to localize a robot with lidar?

Why is it problematic to build from source? That sound be straight forward.
Have you asked the maintainers to release it for Melodic?

Well, I installed the laser_scan_matcher on ros-melodic and as you said it was straight forward. It was a bit scary to build a package from source but it works well. I am still confused if someone wants to use only sudo apt-get install command to install packages on ros-melodic how they can use navigation stack without laser odometry.

A:

I followed the guidance of the @stevemacenski and installed laser_scan_matcher with catkin_make_isolated. This package works very well in ROS Melodic. So to answer my own question, there aren't any packages like laser_scan_matcher in the ROS Melodic.

I am trying to install it on ROS Melodic as well.
