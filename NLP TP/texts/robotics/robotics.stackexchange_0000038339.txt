Q:

Quaternion has length close to zero... discarding as navigation goal, why?

Hello.
I am trying to follow a moving target with my robot through simulation, using stage and rviz. I already managed to send a goal, using actionlib, based on the target position plus an offset. It works most of the time, but I keep getting this error message:

Quaternion has length close to zero... discarding as navigation goal

Why?? What does that mean?
thanks

A:

What are the quaternions you are actually sending? Any quaternion sent should be a properly normalized one (length = 1). The default constructed quaternion geometry_msgs/Quaternion is not a valid quaternion, since it is all 0's.

thanks. I was actually sending an empty message alternated with a proper one. That is why I could get the robot to move and still get the error messages.
