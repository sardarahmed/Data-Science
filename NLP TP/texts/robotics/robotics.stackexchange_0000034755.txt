A:

Our docs are ahead of our release in debs (this will be fixed very shortly). In 0.1.0, this message was in the rosserial_arduino_demo package.
You can certainly do a:
rosrun rosserial_arduino make_library.py <sketchbook> rosserial_arduino_demo

But I would really recommend you upgrade to the latest (soon to be 0.2.0) code by doing a source checkout:
cd <some directory on your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH>
hg clone https://kforge.ros.org/rosserial/hg
rosmake rosserial
