Q:

Rosparam dump from launch file

Hi,
I'm trying to record all the parameters I'm using each time I execute a launch file. I've added the following line at the end of my launch file:
<rosparam command="dump" file="parameters_dump.yaml"/>

However, the only thing this file contains is:
roslaunch:
  uris: {host_my_name_mbp__45687: 'http://my_name-mbp:45687/'}
  run_id: 9a82c640-b958-11e1-a381-3c0754675d16

It seems like if the dump command is done before all the parameters are loaded in the param server. Any idea?
Thank you!
P.S.
If I do a:
$ rosparam dump parameters_dump.yam

from the command line once the vehicle has started, it works.

A:

If you run roslaunch with --dump-params, it will dump all of the parameters to stdout, which you can then redirect wherever you want. This won't actually start any nodes, but it will tell you what parameters they would have been started with.
