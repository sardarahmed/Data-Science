Q:

Is it possible to find the parent frame of a joint knowing the joint name?

Hi. I am using the ros control JointStateController to publish the JointStates from gazebo. I get the messages and it is working well. Now that I have the joint state I would also like to find the transform from map frame to the joint location (parent frame of the joint). If I know the name of the parent frame of this joint I can always do it with tf. But since the we are using this code with different robot models, the parent frame of the joint is not always the same. But I do have the joint name from the JointState message and this joint will always have a parent in the robot description.
Is it possible to somehow lookup the parent frame of a joint using the joint name?

A:

Ended up reading it from the urdf robot model (usually /robot_description in parameter server). You can use model::getJoint with the joint name and get the parent_link_name attribute from the return value.
