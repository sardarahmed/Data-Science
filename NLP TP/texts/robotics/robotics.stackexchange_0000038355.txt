Q:

rxbag human readable timestamp: local or UTC time?

It seems that the human readable timestamp shown in rxbag status bar, at the right of the raw sec.nsec representation, is in local time.
Indeed, in $(rospack find rxbag)/src/rxbag/bag_helper.py the stamp_to_str function, which performs the conversion to string, uses the Python time.localtime method, instead of time.gmtime that converts to UTC time.
Shouldn't it be shown in UTC? Or at least put some UTC+N suffix?
With the current implementation, should I expect that time string to change when daylight or timezone in my pc changes?
Maybe this is quite pedantic ---I admit---, or I'm just missing something. Thanks any way in advance for clarifying.
