Q:

can't rosmake package "3d_navigation"

I was told electric doesn't fully support 3d_navigation yet, so I installed ros-diamondback-desktop-full on my Ubuntu 10.04.
However, when I tried to rosmake 3d_navigation, error occurred.
  bcddivad@bcddivad-laptop:~$ roscd 3d_navigation/

  bcddivad@bcddivad-laptop:~/code/ros/bcddivad_3d_navigation/3d_navigation$ cat /home/bcddivad/.bashrc | tail -n 3
  
  source /opt/ros/diamondback/setup.bash
  export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/bcddivad/code/ros:/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks;

How can I solve this?

A:

Look at this error message ( which I assume is truncated):
No package or stack arguments and the current directory is not the correct path for stack '3d_navigation'. Stack directory is: /home/bcddivad/code/ros/openr[...]
What is the content of /home/bcddivad/code/ros/... ? Are there more ROS packages there which are named 3d_navigation? There seems to be something wrong with your path setup. I suggest following the instructions on the 3d_navigation wiki page: create a rosinstall file, install that on top of diamondback, and source the setup.bash in that directory. This will ensure that the right packages (only) will be in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.
