Q:

learning_tf turtlesim tutorial: second turtle twirling

Hi guys,
I have followed the tf tutorials and implemented all the instructions to get the second turtle to follow the first turtle which in turn is controlled via the keyboard, however, when I launch the start_demo.launch, the second turtle starts twirling continuously even without moving the first turtle.
When I move the first turtle, I can see that the second turtle changes its movement slightly while still rotating. I am not sure what the problem is. I have attached an image showing the pdf file created by rosrun tf view_frames and the turtlesim. Heres what I get:
$ rosrun tf view_frames
Listening to /tf for 5.000000 seconds
Done Listening
Exception AttributeError: AttributeError("'_DummyThread' object has no attribute '_Thread__block'",) in <module 'threading' from '/usr/lib/python2.7/threading.pyc'> ignored

Exception AttributeError: AttributeError("'_DummyThread' object has no attribute '_Thread__block'",) in <module 'threading' from '/usr/lib/python2.7/threading.pyc'> ignored

Any help would be much appreciated.

Khalid

A:

This is the same issue as in this question and this question.
The dummy thread stuff is just a python bug that does no harm.  Here's the ticket. Supposedly, ubuntu will distribute the fix in the future.  There's a patch for it out there if you really want to fix it, though.

Thanks alot. the problem is fixed now by replacing transform.setRotation(  tf::Quaternion(msg->theta,0, 0) ); with transform.setRotation(  tf::Quaternion(0, 0, msg->theta) ); in the turtle_tf_broadcaster.cpp
