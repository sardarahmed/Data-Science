Q:

Does the OpenNI drivers expose Roll Pitch Yaw

I have a few RGBD camera's, the Asus Xtrion and the Kinect. I want to know if the ROS OpenNI drivers expose Pose.

How exactly do I do that? What I need is the Pitching and Rolling angles of the camera, where the frame of reference is flat ground
Comment by TomSon on 2015-09-16:
if I understand well what you mean, you want the frame of the sensor ? I dont think that this kind of sensor have an IMU integrated. You have to calculate it when you track an user (considering that the user is standing still and do some tf maths)
