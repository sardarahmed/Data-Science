Q:

turtlebot_marker error in RViz

Hello,
I have followed every bit of instruction on:

http://ros.org/wiki/turtlebot_interactive_markers/Tutorials/UsingTurtlebotInteractiveMarkers

When the RViz GUI pops up everything looks fine and dandy until I go to turtlebot_marker where it states this:

turtlebot_marker
Error getting time of latest transform between /base_link
and /odom: (error code: 1)

What does that mean and how can I fix it?
