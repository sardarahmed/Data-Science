Q:

How can I change real time update rate and/or max step size of ros-gazebo physic from command line once ros-gazebo has started?

Hi,
I am launching Gazebo through ROS.  I want to change the max step size and/or real-time update rate after launching Gazebo, preferably from the command line. I know that usually they are set as fixed in the .world file but how do I change that during run-time from the command line?
Thanks.

Hi Rahul !
I never have tried using the command line to set the physics simulation properties of the world, always I had used the definition inside the ".world" to set the properties.
I know that using Gazebo with ROS (gazebo_ros package) you can find a service to set some properties (time_step, max_update_rate, gravity, etc). Then you can use "rosservice call /gazebo/set_physics_properties ..." and to check if finally, you can modify the simulation parameters that you wish.
I hope my answer can help you, let me know if you have a good result.
