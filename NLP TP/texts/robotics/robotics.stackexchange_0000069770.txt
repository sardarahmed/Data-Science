Q:

camera for micro robots

Hi Ros community,
My group are planning to build a micro size robots with max weight of 500g. We want to buy a camera or cameras that can be use to find object and latter on to have it operate autonomously. Also, hopefully we can use SLAM with it.
Any suggestions?
Update: Also, is there a small camera that can be use to identify a target?
Thank you
