Q:

move_base.launch deprecated?

Is move_base deprecated? If yes, what is the replacement?
when I do
$ roslaunch move_base move_base.launch
I get a lot of warnings like this:
[WARN] [WallTime: 1380536892.711000] You are launching the move_base_0.3_to_0.2.launch file which allows for a deprecated interface to move_base to be used. Please update your code and remove this launch file as soon as possible

A:

That launch file is deprecated (as of 4 years ago! the navigation stack is now version 1.11, and that file was introduced when transitioning from 0.2 to 0.3)
Most people create a configuration for their specific robot, since there are a lot of parameters that can be tuned and tweaked for a specific robot. For a number of examples see: http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/RobotsUsingNavStack

Thank you. However I see that there are still many examples on the wiki that suggest the use of move_base, for example here: http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup
Maybe - I guess - I can ask more useful questions... :P

Yes, they are using move_base, but not that launch file. move_base is fully supported, that launch file is not really what you want, because it just remaps the old topic names/types to what is currently in move_base.

Hi @fergs I have used a move_base.launch file given here http://www.hessmer.org/blog/2011/04/24/using-the-ros-navigation-stack/. Is it looks ok to you?
