Q:

Individual Package - Install

Hi.
I like to install a individual package, I think this works with sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-PACKAGE.
For my case I like to install the ar_kinect package, but when I try apt-cache search ros-fuerte there is not the ar_kinect package.
Can somebody tell me why?
Or how can I install this package?
(I use Ubuntu 10.04, ROS fuerte)
Thank you for your help.

A:

I think there is no .deb file available for this package. You should download the source and compile it yourself.
You should do something like:
rosws set ar_kinect https://github.com/mikeferguson/ar_kinect --git
rosws update 
roscd ar_kinect 
rosmake
