Hi guys,
I'm trying to create my own .launch file but i can't understand how to add the follow rosrun to the file:

rosrun depthimage_to_laserscan depthimage_to_laserscan image:=/camera/depth/image_raw

I know that I can run the node by typing

but I don't know how to add the "image:=/camera/depth/image_raw" part.

@danielq - Can you post the launch file you created? I want to use depthimage_to_laserscan with kinect v2 and want to see how to use the parameters to use libfreenect2 driver with this package.
