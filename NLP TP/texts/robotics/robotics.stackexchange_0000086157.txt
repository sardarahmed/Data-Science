Q:

Cannot initialise gstreamer pipeline

Hi,
[System Info:]

Ubuntu 16.04 in a Virtualbox
Kernel: Linux 4.13.0-36-generic
Architecture: x86-64
ROS kinetic

I am trying to follow the audio common installation and ran into the problem mentioned here
https://answers.ros.org/question/286550/no-element-or-plugin-alsasrc/
i now installed
sudo apt-get install gstreamer1.0-alsa

And the pipeline seemed to work properly:
gst-launch-1.0 alsasrc ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! alsasink

Setting pipeline to PAUSED ...
Pipeline is live and does not need PREROLL ...
Setting pipeline to PLAYING ...
New clock: GstAudioSrcClock
Redistribute latency...
Redistribute latency...
^Chandling interrupt.
Interrupt: Stopping pipeline ...
Execution ended after 0:00:12.309985956
Setting pipeline to PAUSED ...
Setting pipeline to READY ...

But I cant hear any sound from my mic...
Anyone here, who has a hint how to fix this?

Is there any trade-off when setting syn=false? Is there a fundamental necessity to set sync=false in some cases? Or is this something that became necessary with the new gstreamer release?

And more importantly: should the tutorial you linked in #q286550 be updated?

Shouldn't there be an explaination on why it worked fine?
