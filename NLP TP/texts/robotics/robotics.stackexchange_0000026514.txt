Q:

Model falling down when starting

Hi!
I am having problems with my model, it oftens falls to the ground when starting. This is totally random behaviour though... Any ideas why this can be happening?

Could you explain your question a bit more. Do you want to switch off the gravity?

A:

All the links are in exactly the same position, which is probably not what you want. You should set the pose of each link relative to the parent model.
The pose of the model should also be set so that it doesn't penetrate the ground plane on start.
It can be helpful to start the simulation paused in order to see the initial configuration of your model. Pass 'gazebo' the '-u' command line argument to start paused.

Thanks!!! That was it. I fixed the poses and now it is working.
