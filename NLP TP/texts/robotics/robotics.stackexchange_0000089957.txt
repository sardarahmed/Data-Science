Q:

What does [rospack] Permission denied means?

Hi, I've just installed ROS Kinetic with other packages as opencv, gazebo, turtlebot, rplidar and intelrealsense. The thing is that now when I open a new terminal console window or tab appear three errors about rospack, the following:
[rospack] Unable to create temporary cache file /home/pc2/.ros/.rospack_cache.38dCXr: Permission denied
[rospack] Unable to create temporary cache file /home/pc2/.ros/.rospack_cache.t3sveu: Permission denied
[rospack] Unable to create temporary cache file /home/pc2/.ros/.rospack_cache.hlp6zx: Permission denied

And I can't do anything, neither run roscore.

Did you at any point run rospack as the root user? What is the output of:
ls -al /home/pc2/.ros/.rospack_cache.38dCXr

Is pc2 the name of your user account, or some other user?

pc2 is the only user in the computer. I didn't run rospack at any moment, I just installed all and this appeared. I've seen that each time I open a new terminal different files cause this rospack error. The output is always:
ls: can't access to 'the file': file or directory doesen't exist

What is the output of ls -al $HOME/.ros?

thanks for the feedback gvdhoorn :)

A:

Finally I got it, I changed the permissions on the ~/.ros archive and that's it
sudo chown -R $USER ~/.ros

Which user was the owner before you changed it to your user?
Comment by magole on 2019-01-04:
root I think so, but Im not sure. I just changed the user, someone told me to do it in order to solve the problem so I did it without knowing which user was owning the archive ./ros before.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-01-04:\

root I think

well that would certainly be the problem there.
