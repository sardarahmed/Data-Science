Q:

Does the 3DR Solo support ROS?

Hey,  I'm looking into buying a quadrotor for computer vision research, and the Solo looks like a viable candidate.  However, I can't find whether or not ROS is usable with the Linux distribution that the Solo runs.  If it would take a significant amount of time to get ROS working properly, I'm not interested, but the Solo looks quite a bit more capable than the Parrot ArDrone or Bebop.  If you instead have a recommendation for an alternative quadrotor, that would also be appreciated.

A:

For those of you still interested, I managed to connect to the Solo using mavros.  I probably won't have a chance to test the flight capabilities for a while, but I was able to read imu and pressure data from the corresponding ROS topics. I used the following command to establish the connection.
roslaunch mavros apm.launch fcu_url:="udp://:14550@10.1.1.10:14555"
In order for this to work, you must install mavlink in addition to the mavros package.  Otherwise, the command will run, but it will not connect to the Solo.  I will edit this post with additional information when I get the chance.
