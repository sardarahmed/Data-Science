Q:

rosserial arduino Serial Port read failure

Hi, I've written a small sensor_msgs::Imu publisher on a arduino micro which works for a short time but crashes after some seconds with following status:
[INFO] [WallTime: 1402665675.175567] Note: publish buffer size is 512 bytes
[INFO] [WallTime: 1402665675.176102] Setup publisher on /imu_data [sensor_msgs/Imu]
[WARN] [WallTime: 1402665687.484972] Serial Port read returned short (expected 1 bytes, received 0 instead).
[WARN] [WallTime: 1402665687.485703] Serial Port read failure: 
[ERROR] [WallTime: 1402665699.934101] Lost sync with device, restarting...

I supposed this might be some buffer overflow, which is why I increased the nh.spinOnce() during the loop to no effect.
What does the message mean and how can I fix it? Thnx in advance.

You can check how much RAM you actually use with avr-size, see here : http://answers.ros.org/question/11159/problem-setting-up-rosserial_arduino/
and the rosserial documentation : http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial/Overview/Limitations

A:

The library I used had some weird Serial.print()'s in the middle of the code which kinda scrambled the communication with ros. Removing them all fixed the problem.
Thanks to al-dev for the link in the comments, had been an interesting read anyhow.

i have the same problem: lost sync , port read failure. How did you solve it please? I passed a message with 3 float members to arduino mega and it seems lost sync error all the time
