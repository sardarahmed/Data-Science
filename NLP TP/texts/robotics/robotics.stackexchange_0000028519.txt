Q:

Tips for implementing an existing codebase in Gazebo?

Hi guys, I understand this is a general question I am just looking for direction while also not violating an NDA. As the title states, how should I go about implementing an existing codebase for a robot into Gazebo?

Can you be just a tiny bit more specific? Is the codebase in C++? What do you need from simulation?

Yes I apologize its a broad question. The codebase for the actual machine is in C++, I need to use that code in my simulation. I already created a model and a diff drive system

A:

Interfacing with Gazebo can be done through C++ plugins or through the Gazebo transport system. I believe in your case you'll want to implement some model / world plugin which connects to the rest of your codebase. Read about plugins here.

I am having trouble grasping the concept of connecting a plugin to an existing codebase. I can write my own plugins, and I can modify and understand my codebase. Just not sure how to connect them.

You'll probably need to compile the plugin linking and including both Gazebo and your code...
