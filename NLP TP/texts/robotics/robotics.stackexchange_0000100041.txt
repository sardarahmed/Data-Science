Q:

IDE to develop rqt projects

I have worked with ROS packages earlier which uses catkin environment. I have also worked on Qt projects developed in Qt Creator which does not use catkin environment.
I have also seen Qt projects in ROS like Image Viewer.
Qt has different build folder and the items inside it whereas catkin has different directory structure. My query is how to use Qt in ROS environment?

You are using QT 4 or QT5?

Using Qt5.

A:

After some more survey I found that ROS uses a different Qt Creator Plug-in. The installer can be found here. I m using Ubuntu 20.04 and as per the reference page the installer is provided till 18.04 and fortunately it works for 20.04 as well.
Complete process, from installation to project execution is nicely compiled in this video.
