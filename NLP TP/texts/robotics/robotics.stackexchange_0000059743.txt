Q:

How to use ROS nodes (slam_gmapping) in Qt Creator GUI

Hello everyone,
Iâ€™m really new to the ROS and I want to use ROS for my research studies. Basically I hope to use SLAM package in ROS.
Can anyone please be kind enough to give me A-Z instructions to use SLAM package first. Then I want to know how I use this in my own GUI created by Qt creator.
In order to use SLAM in ROS what kind of sensors must be used (LRF, Odometry data, IMU)
Thank you very much.

Hi
Gmapping need's two topics which provide laser scanner and odometry . usually use lidar sensor for laser scanner . if you want to use only laser scanner you can use Hector_Mapping .
for using  Qt Creator GUI in Ros please see this question.
if you want to subscribe map or pose topic in your gui you can build one timer in your code and call  ros::spinOnce() every 10ms.
note: your gui use app.exec() and if you use ros::spin()  then your gui doesn't work .
