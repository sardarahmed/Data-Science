Q:

something wrong with rqt_reconfigure

Hi, all,
I'm trying to get the pointcloud data from point_clooud2, but I just want the pointcloud data with short depth, so I try to use "rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure" to change the depth  parameter, unluckily, I can't find the node "/camera/depth/points" on the rqt_reconfigure_param dashboard, so if there is anyway I can use to reset the depth parameter of the node "/camera/depth/points" ?
To sum up, I want to get the point_cloud data with short depth.
Thanks.

A:

I understand your problem as you "want to change parameter while nodes are running", am I right?
Hopefully so, then does $ rosrun dynamic_reconfigure dynparam list return the node you want? If not, that node is not publishing dynamic_reconfigure-able parameters, which is the root cause of the problem you're seeing. Since rqt_reconfigure uses dynamic_reconfigure API internally, it can't see what dynamic_reconfigure can't.
