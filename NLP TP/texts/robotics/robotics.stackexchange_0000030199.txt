Q:

Could not contact the following nodes: * /joint_state_publisher

Hi there!
I'm having a problem when I launch RVIZ with a join_state_publisher. For exemple, when I do the tutorial from this page (Building Movable Robot Model with URDF) and I close it.
When I execute roswtf, appears that message:
"ERROR: Could not contact the following nodes:  * /joint_state_publisher"
If I try to kill them with rosnode kill /joint_state_publisher it seem's that be OK, but if I rerun it I gave the same message.
I think that this is important because in next reruns of RVIZ it doesn't works correctly (the model not appears completly).
Any idea?

Finally, my launch file looks like this:
