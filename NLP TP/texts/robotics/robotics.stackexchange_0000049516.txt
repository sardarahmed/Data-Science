Q:

Problem running Teleoperation Package

Hi..
I try to move ax12 dynamixel servo by using kinect in Skeleton Tracker Teleoperation Package for Mobile Robot..
http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni/Contests/ROS%203D/Skeleton%20Tracker%20Teleoperation%20Package%20for%20Mobile%20Robot
I have launched skeleton.launch, tracker.launch, robotis.launch, dynamixels.launch but my servo motor don't move at all..
Do I have to add new node for subscribing skeleton joint and publishing it to my servo ?
Thanks for your time..

Hi, I had the same issue which was solved by setting use real robot to true in the tracker_params.yml file. pi_tracker/params/tracker_params.yml
Hope it helps.

Check the baudrate that is being used for robotis_params. Try 1000000.

hi @zab
I found the problem in command_rate, tracking_rate, joint_controller_rate in tracker_params.yaml file.. :) it works fine..
Thanks @Zab.. for your time..
