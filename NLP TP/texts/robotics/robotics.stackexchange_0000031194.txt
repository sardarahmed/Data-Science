Q:

How to make Gazebo use CUDA?

A few things I've read so far:

http://www.ros.org/wiki/diamondback#physics_ode_1.4
http://www.ros.org/wiki/parallel_quickstep

So, with diamondback, assuming I have all the correct NVIDIA drivers and CUDA toolkit installed and working, does Gazebo automatically use CUDA? If not, then where are the files that the parallel_quickstep instructions point to? Namely, "Makefile.gazebo.cuda" and "cuda.patch"? They're not in my gazebo directory by default after a diamondback install.
Thanks,
Sean

What kind of speedup can be expected by using Cuda?
