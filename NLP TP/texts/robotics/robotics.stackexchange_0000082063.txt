Q:

Scripts in /scripts cannot see files in /src/

I am receiving the following error when trying to run a script in my /catkin_ws/src//scripts directory.
robond@udacity:~/catkin_ws$ rosrun sensor_stick capture_features_new.py 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/robond/catkin_ws/src/sensor_stick/scripts/capture_features_new.py", line 7, in <module>
    from sensor_stick.pcl_helper import *
ImportError: No module named pcl_helper

All of the files that I am importing from are present in catkin_ws/src//src/. Yet, somehow they are invisible to my script...
I have run catkin_make, and sourced devel/setup.bash. A complete noob to ROS, I warn you.
Does anyone have any idea what I'm doing wrong? Thanks in advance!

So after many hours of trying to fix the problem I gave up, copied the package &renamed it. Fiddled around, but it always failed to make, so I deleted it. Tried to make the original again, success, and now the script runs! But why...? Did it just need a clean?

A:

The reason it cannot find your module is that it is not in your $PYTHONPATH. The standard way of solving this would be to write a setup.py in your package and invoke catkin_python_setup() in CMakeLists.txt as described in the last portion of this article: http://wiki.ros.org/rospy_tutorials/Tutorials/Makefile
