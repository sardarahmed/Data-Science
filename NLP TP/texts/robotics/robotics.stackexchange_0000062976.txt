Q:

ROS/gazebo consulting service

Hi all,
I was wondering if anyone is aware of a ROS/gazebo consulting service currently in place. I had a look at the consultants-network page and it looks like my initial best candidate for some gazebo support service (hiDof) is at rest as the webpage seems to indicate. Meanwhile I recently received a poll from ClearPath about a support service they are aiming at putting in place - not sure where they are at...
Anyone has an idea of who could best provide gazebo support?
Thanks,
Antoine.

I don't think we want to see business activities on this forum that much, so I keep my answer brief; We have an experience for a consultancy work for Gazebo, drcsim. Please contact us.
