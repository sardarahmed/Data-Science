Q:

Neither rospack find nor roscd can find ca_driver

Neither rospack find nor roscd can find ca_driver, I have tried installing on two different computer using exact instruction given on git page and also tried adding the ROS Path, passing full path to roslaunch but it says:
" [create_2.launch] is neither a launch file in package [ca_driver] nor is [ca_driver] a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file"
Please help.

A:

It looks like the instructions tell you to clone the repository in ~/create_ws, but you actually need to clone it into ~/create_ws/src and then cd back to ~/create_ws to run rosdep update and the remaining build steps.
