Q:

I want my stepper motor to switch speed while traveling (not acceleration wise)

I have this project I'm working on where I'll need the speed of the stepper motor to change set speed at a certain distance, I just can't figure out a way to do it. I'm using arduino and a stepper motor, this is the current code.
#include <AccelStepper.h>

AccelStepper stepper1(AccelStepper::FULL4WIRE, 0, 1, 2, 3);

void setup()
{  
    stepper1.setMaxSpeed(200.0);
    stepper1.setAcceleration(400.0);
    stepper1.moveTo(5000);

}

void loop()
{
    // Change direction at the limits
    if (stepper1.distanceToGo() == 0)
    stepper1.moveTo(-stepper1.currentPosition());
    stepper1.run();

What I want it to do basically is to first moveTo(2500)  at the current speed 200 then after 2500 I want it to increase speed to 400. After it has moved 5000 it turns and moves back to position but that's implemented already.

A:

For this task; increase speed when a certain distance is reached.
I would use encoders on the wheels which will workout the distance travelled and when the target distance is reached then increase speed.
