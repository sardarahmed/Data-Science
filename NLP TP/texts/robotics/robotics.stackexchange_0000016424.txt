Q:

Position Tracking using IMU

I am working on a robot tracking application, where our main tool (a camera) for locating the x & y position of the robot is working on a quite low frequency.
Therefore, I am looking for ways to intermediately track the position of the robot without directly measuring it.
The robot has a built in accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer.
I know that I can double-integrate the acceleration measurements to get a (very noisy) estimate of my current position. I also can use gyroscope and magnetometer to track the pose of the robot (which I am not primarily interested in).
Is there anything else I could do to improve the position estimate given those three sensors, besides double-integration of acceleration?

A:

Basically the solution is to not try to reference where rob is.  What you do is create a notional starting point,and then develop a sensor that measures x&e coupled to a time sensor.  You can develop the notional starting points in time and “Tx&e” units.  Thus you know where you are once you arrive at a known position.
So
NSP X T X x&e = CURRENT POSITION & TIME. Any changes in position applied from known current position gives us a constant position and also a vector
