Q:

Stabilizing a Robot Arm at a Specified Height

I have a 4-bar linkage arm (or similar design) for a telerobot used in the VEX Robotics Competition.  I want to be able to press buttons on my PS3-style controller to have the arm raise to certain angles.  I have a potentiometer to measure the 4-bar's angle.
The potentiometer measures the angle of one of the joints in the shoulder of the mechanism, which is similar to this:

What type of control should I use to stabilize the arm at these angles?

A:

This sounds like a classic case for a PID controller.  The "derivative" part of this controller will help prevent the arm from oscillating as you move to a new angle, and the "integral" part will help counteract the force of gravity acting on the arm.
