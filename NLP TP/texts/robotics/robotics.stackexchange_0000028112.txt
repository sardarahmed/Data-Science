Q:

JointController SetAngularVelocityTarget?

Hello it's me again,
I am using a JointController to move my robots, however I need to set an angularVelocity and I couldn't find this function in the documentation.
Does this exist ? If no, what other way to do do I have ? thank you in advance !

A:

The JointController class uses the SetVelocityTarget function to set a target velocity for a joint's axis. If that joint is rotational, that will be an angular velocity given in rad/s. If it's a prismatic joint, that will be a linear velocity given in m/s.

My 4 joints are now of type revolute2 ( since I want 2 axis ), when I set a velocity it only roll on one axis, how do I do to make it rotate now (set velocity on another axis)? thank you for your answer anyway

Unfortunately, the joint controller doesn't support multi-axis joints. There's an issue open about this: https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issues/2160/jointcontroller-doesnt-support-multi-axis One solution would be to use 2 revolute joints with a dummy link in between
