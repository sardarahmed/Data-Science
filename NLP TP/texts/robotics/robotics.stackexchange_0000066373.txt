Q:

teleoperation using custom key

so far we are moving out P3AT (spawned in USARSim) from my ROS machine using teleoperation.
The difficulty we are observing is,
-using default teleoperation key is not comfortable to operate the robot.
-we want to drive it using arrow key given on keyboard (which is also used by most of the computer games).
does ROS provide this facility. Or what next we should do.
