Q:

package (need URDF file) for ABB IRB4600-60/2.05? OR What is the way to get .stl files for collision of links of robot (ABB IRB4600)?

I am new to ROS. I am trying to develop the URDF file for ABB IRB4600-60/2.05 robot but i am not understanding how to create collision models (meshes > collision (.stl files). Please let me know the way ..should i need to develop by own through CAD software ?
Thanks !

A:

Creating collision meshes is relatively simple: in most ROS description or ROS-Industrial support packages they are simple the convex hulls of the normal (or visual) messages.
You can create convex hulls using a nr of meshing tools. Two frequently used ones are Meshlab and Blender.

Thanks for your response ..It is quite simple by using convex hull option in meshlab tool ..
One can find 'convex hull' option in meshlab   (Filters > Remeshing, Simplification and Reconstructiion > convex hull)
