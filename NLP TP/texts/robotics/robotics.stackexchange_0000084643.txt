Q:

source ~/.bashrc issue at install

Hi everyone,
quick question, I am sure I will sound dumb, but I prefer to ask as I am starting with ROS.
When I run source ~/.bashrc I have the errors below....
Can anyone help me understnad what is going on?

Edit: I am trying to remove all of these, thanks for the help, last idea is to reinstall Ubuntu from 0.

Can you tell us a bit more about your computer? OS (version, how installed, etc)? CPU architecture? How did you install ROS? What Python interpreter do you have installed? Are you using bash, or some other shell?

Hi, I am using Ubuntu 16.04, I installed ROS via the info on the wiki here: http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu, but I am sure I did something wrong (was couple of months ago). As well I have Python 3 installed with Anaconda

A:

There seem two be a few different errors in the output you've posted. What version of ROS are you using and have you installed several versions at the same time?
Your .bashrc script is trying to execute a package setup script /home/jice/cws_oroca/devel/setup.bash but it can't find it at that location. If you check what the actual location is and correct your .bashrc then it should fix the first error.
It's also trying to run /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash and its failing it find it which looks like you were using indigo but you've upgraded and not changed the path for this file in .bashrc
There also seems to be a problem with your python install, or you're trying to use a python library encodings that is not installed, or if it is then the path to its location has not been added to the PYTHONPATH environment variable.
Hope this helps.
