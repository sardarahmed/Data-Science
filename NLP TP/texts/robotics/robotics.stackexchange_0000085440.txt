Q:

When to use a ROS service rather than a normal node

Hey,
I am new to ROS services, I have been working with ROS nodes and topics but I never needed to use services. When looking through the tutorials I didn't fully understand what is the difference between a service and a normal nodes.

Please see #q11834 which has very good answers.

They are different concepts.
Trying to simplify I would say that the service can be seen as function or procedure call, i.e., you call a service for performing one task and obtaining (or not) a result.
