Q:

Repository for source install?

Using the source ( http://www.ros.org/wiki/diamondback/Installation/Ubuntu/Source) I could install Diamondback (1.4.6) on Ubuntu 9.10, Karmic Koala. However I am not sure which repository to use ? Would it be advisable to use Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid) or Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick) source lists ?
Any help is appreciated

A:

If you are doing a source based installation you do not need to add anything to your sources.list files.
