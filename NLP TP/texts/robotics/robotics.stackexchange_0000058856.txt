Q:

detect object with color

Hi
I am using the tabletop object detector to determine some object on point cloud database.
http://www.ros.org/wiki/tabletop_object_detector
I was wondering  if I would able to somehow also extract color information about the objects. I want to know that  can I use color information or RGB image by tabletop library? If not ,does anybody know of a tool that does anything similar???

Thank's Adreno I think it's good. but I got problem in VOSCH installation. I follow this link http://wiki.ros.org/vosch ,but when I run :
rosrun vosch example_vosch rospack find vosch/data/sample_cone_green.pcd
I got the Error that Couldn't find executable named example_vosch below /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/mapping/vosch. what is the problem?

Did you rosmake ? You have to build the package to generate the executables...
