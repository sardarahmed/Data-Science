Q:

Nao cross_compilation libmpfr.so.1 error

When trying to cross-compile for the Nao following the instructions (http://www.ros.org/wiki/nao/Tutorials/Cross-Compiling)
I get the following library error:
/media/external/nao-cross-toolchain-1.10.52/cross/geode/bin/../libexec/gcc/i586-linux/4.3.3/cc1plus: error while loading shared libraries: libmpfr.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
That file is no where to be found in the nao-cross-toolchain folder.  I do, however, have libmpfr.so.4 in my /usr/lib directory.  Any suggestions on how to either download the libmpfr.so.1 file or point the compilation to the appropriate location?

A:

I guess that you're using Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric), which does not provide libmpfr.so.1 any more. According to Nao's documentation, Oneiric is not officially supported by Aldebaran yet. You can still give it a try, but probably some dependencies will be missing.
In the case of libmpfr, you could try to download the package libmpfr1ldbl from Ubuntu Natty, extract it using dpkg -x and copy libmpfr.so.1 to /media/external/nao-cross-toolchain-1.10.52/cross/geode/bin/../libexec/gcc/i586-linux/4.3.3 .
