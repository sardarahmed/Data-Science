Q:

Error when calling catkin_make --> Invoking "make" failed'

Hi,
I'm new to ROS. I was following exactly the steps listed here:
http://pharos.ece.utexas.edu/wiki/index.php/ROS_packages_and_contents_required_to_teleoperate_the_iRobot_Create
However, when I run catkin_make, i got the following error:
user@ubuntu:~/catkin_ws$ catkin_make

How do I solve this?

A:

Add executable flag to the .cfg file:
cd /home/user/catkin_ws/src/irobotcreate_node/cfg/
chmod +x TurtleBot.cfg

Without the exec flag dynamic_reconfigure cannot created the reconfig headers....

It works Wolf! thanks a lot!
I changed to small cap 'x'.--> chmod +x TurtleBot.cfg
