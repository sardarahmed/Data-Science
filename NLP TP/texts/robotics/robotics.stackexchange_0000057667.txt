Q:

Hydro turtlebot simulator bringup issues

I am having problems getting the turtlebot simulator up and running in hydro. I installed ROS, gazebo, turtlebot_gazebo stacks and followed the instructions given here
I am getting the following when I run roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_empty_world.launch

The normal gazebo empty world works fine. Also, I am not sure why quadrotor nodelets are being referenced here.
Can someone help me please ?
Thanks,
Prasanna

A:

This looks like the same symbol error ABI breakage that's been cropping up in a few places.
Try running:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

To install the latest versions of all of your ROS packages.
