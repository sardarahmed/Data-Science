A:

Some things to look out for:

Make sure the node names are
different. If you copied and pasted
launch file code, it could be
happening that both nodes are started
with the same name, which could lead
to the first getting killed as soon
as the second one is started.
Both
approaches might publish localization
information to tf. This could lead to
various issues.

hi!
i tried to run only the hokuyo node without launching the hector_slam package and the same thing happened(ccny stopped working), do you think there is some kind of conflict between these two devices?
