Q:

rtapmap nodes crash on Raspi 2

Hello ROS-community,
I want to start rtabmap on my raspi 2 with ubuntu 14.04 ROS Indigo. I have compiled it from Source at first like the description on github: https://github.com/introlab/rtabmap_ros. It do not worked for me, so i searched for another solution. Someone write, i need to compile it in debug mode. The compilation worked without problems after i set some more swap-space.
But when i start eg.
roslaunch rtabmap_ros rgbd_mapping.launch rtabmap_args:="--delete_db_on_start" rviz:=false rtabmapviz:=true

I get the same error and all nodes crash.
process[rtabmap/rgbd_odometry-1]: started with pid [3792]

process[rtabmap/rtabmap-2]: started with pid [3793]

process[rtabmap/rtabmapviz-3]: started with pid [3794]

See this post: http://official-rtab-map-forum.206.s1.nabble.com/Rtabmap-error-in-process-rtabmap-rgbd-odometry-1-ubuntu-on-raspberry-pi-tp444p1246.html

A:

It looks like you have the same problem as in this post. However, there are still no solutions found yet.
Are the rtabmap_ros binaries working?
$ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-rtabmap-ros
$ roslaunch rtabmap_ros rgbd_mapping.launch

Thanks for your answer!
I tried the installation from the binaries...i get the same error.
When i start other nodes like "$ rosrun rtabmap_ros rtabmapviz"  i get the message "Segmentation fault (core dumped)
(same problem like the guy in your link)

Have you been able to run gdb on the core dump - see where it's crashing out?
