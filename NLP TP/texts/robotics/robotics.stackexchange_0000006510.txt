Q:

Multiple PIDs in quadcopter

I am wondering what the use is of two PID loops to control a quadcopter. One PID for stability control and another PID for rate control.
Why can't you just use one PID per axis to control a quadcopter where you take the current and desired angle as input and motor power as the output?

A:

Because it is an under-actuated system. You can not directly control the linear velocity with only one PID. To move in the 3D space you need to control the linear velocity.
So the first loop uses the angular velocity (or the attitude itself) as control inputs to control the linear velocity, while the second loop uses the torques or rpms of the fans (real commands) to achieve that angular velocity: backstepping-like effect.
