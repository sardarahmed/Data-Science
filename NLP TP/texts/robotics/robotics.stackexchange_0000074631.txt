Q:

Is there any package using which I can use to navigate, avoiding obstacles and using robot_localisation's pose estimate on an unknown map

Hello, I am new to ROS. I have a p3dx robot and I am using it for outdoor navigation. I am using robot_localization package for pose estimate and localization. I have target points in GPS co-ordinates and want a shortest path algorithm like a -star to be implemented.I have sonar sensor to detect obstacles.
Is there any package using which I can navigate in an unknown map or area avoiding obstacles using the above data/configuration. I tried to analyze the Navigation stack but it requires cost map and other localization technique.

The A-star algorithm and the navigation stack both depend on having a pre-built map. Without a pre-built map you will need to look at alternative algorithms for path planning.

A:

In nav2d is the nav2d_operator, which is a purely reactive obstacle avoidance node, that can work without a global map. It uses a local costmap_2d internally, so you should check how to update that from sonar instead of laser range data.
