Q:

how can I make an exe file?

Is it possible to make launch or run file as an exe file like a.out?
I know I cant write down some command on text or something to launch with clicking a file, but I want to make an actual exe file. Thank you!

What you want is generate an executable file from a source file? I didn't understand very well your question.
Could you explain it better?
In the ROS Publisher tutorial a talker and a  listener executable are created:

A:

I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to do here, but I can think of two possible options.
A. You can make a bash script that runs roslaunch/rosrun. This file will be executable
B. You can make a small dedicated c++ application that runs the same command as the bash script above using the system() function.
Why do you need this to be started by an executable file so badly?
