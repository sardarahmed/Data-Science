Q:

"startGrabbing: Node is not writable." in pylon_camera package

Hi,
When I try to launch the pylon_camera node, I receive the following error:

startGrabbing: Node is not writable.

I traced through the code and found that an exception is thrown when the node is trying to set the PixelFormat to Mono8 using the setValue function in pylon_camera_base.hpp in the startGrabbing function.
I'm using the basler ace acA4600-7gc GigE camera with pylon 5 sdk. I can view the camera images and set camera parameters just fine using the PylonViewerApp.
Any advice?
Thanks,
Michael
