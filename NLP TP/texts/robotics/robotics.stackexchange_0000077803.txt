Q:

image_transport republish One Time Use

Folks,
I have several rosbags, 8 seconds long each, which only contain compressed depth images. Since rospy does not support compressedDepth (as far as I know) I am using
rosrun image_transport republish

to go from compressedDepth to raw. But I noticed that only the first rosbag's image gets republished, but not any rosbag after that, unless I re-run the image transport code above after each rosbag finishes playing...kind of a lame behavior in my opinion. Is there an option to tell republish to continue republishing?

A:

Never mind. I added image_transport to my lunch file instead of doing rosrun, and now it works...still weird that it does not continuously tries to resubscribe after the original publishers stops publishing, though.
