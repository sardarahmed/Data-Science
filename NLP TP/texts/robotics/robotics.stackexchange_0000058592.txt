roscreate-pkg drive_base_tutorial roscpp geometry_msgs this is what the terminal looks like:

A:

It sounds like you're trying to follow a rosbuild tutorial and create a rosbuild package in a catkin workspace.
The PR2 packages are not catkinized in Groovy. You should instead set up a overlay rosbuild workspace for working with the PR2 controllers on Groovy.
