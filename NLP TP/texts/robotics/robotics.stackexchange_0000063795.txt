A:

You must have another node running the server.
If you have in your robot /move_base already implemented then it is automatically started.
Otherwise you must provide the server with your own code.
The code in the tutorial is just half of the whole story :)

Can you tell me what is the all story? Where can I learn what should I do in detail?

The story is very simple (conceptually). You need a server running in the backgorund or your client (the program you have run) never will extablish a connection to the server. There are some package like /move_base which start "automatically" a server. In that case, starting that node,...

...you can get your connection.
I can tell you one thing: try to integrate your knowledge with books (ROS by Example 1 & 2 is the best one to me). "in detail" is a good word...I m still learning ROS
