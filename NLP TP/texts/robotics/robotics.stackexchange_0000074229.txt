Q:

RTAB-Map rgbd_launch error Map received with code error 1! problem

Hi, I am trying to use RTAB-Map on my clearpath Jackal robot (am reading its topics through the same wifi). I am not using OpenNI because my robot and ASUS Xtion rgbd camera have already been set up to publish the camera topics (as shown  what i get after I type in rostopic list):
/camera/camera_nodelet_manager/bond
/camera/depth/camera_info
/camera/depth/image
/camera/depth/image_raw
/camera/depth/image_rect
/camera/depth/image_rect_raw
/camera/depth/points
/camera/depth_rectify_depth/parameter_descriptions
/camera/depth_rectify_depth/parameter_updates
/camera/depth_registered/camera_info
/camera/depth_registered/image_raw
/camera/depth_registered/image_raw/compressedDepth
/camera/depth_registered/points
/camera/depth_registered/sw_registered/camera_info
/camera/depth_registered/sw_registered/image_rect
/camera/depth_registered/sw_registered/image_rect_raw
/camera/driver/parameter_descriptions
/camera/driver/parameter_updates
/camera/ir/camera_info
/camera/ir/image
/camera/rectify_color/parameter_descriptions
/camera/rectify_color/parameter_updates
/camera/rgb/camera_info
/camera/rgb/image_raw
/camera/rgb/image_rect_color
/camera/rgb/image_rect_color/compressed

Whenever I run roslaunch rtabmap_ros rgbd_mapping.launch rtabmap_args:="--delete_db_on_start", it takes long for my RTAB to open up, and when it does run, I get the following on the Progress dialog of the RTAB GUI when I click on the Download all clouds button (looks like a refresh button) and I select any of the Options:
17:42:11 Downloading the map (global=false ,optimized=true)...
17:42:14 Downloading the map... done.
17:42:14 [ERROR] Map received with code error 1!

Meanwhile, the terminal keeps displaying:
[ WARN] [1464793454.065524286]: TF_OLD_DATA ignoring data from the past for frame camera_rgb_frame at time 1.46479e+09 according to authority unknown_publisher

Possible reasons are listed at http://wiki.ros.org/tf/Errors%20explained
Anyone know how I might be able to fix this? Thanks for the help! :)
