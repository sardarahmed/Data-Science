Q:

is DRCSIM,for groovy?

there is a missing link between the ROS and GAZEBO-1.7  .
DRCSIM seems to be a way of fixing the link.
I am wondering, does DRCSIM supports groovy, which is the version I am using????

Just to clarify, DRCSim is not "a missing link between the ROS and Gazebo". It is a software build on top of ROS and Gazebo to provide the features needed for the Darpa Robotics Challenge.

ok. got it!

A:

Two versions of DRCSim are currently released in packages.osrfoundation.org:

ROS fuerte version for Ubuntu precise
ROS groovy version for Ubuntu quantal

Building from source you could get the others combinations easily, but they have not being released as packages in the OSRF repository.
If you are interested in building you own packages for theses other combinations, exists   experimental code written for auto builing packages from a local machine (see launch debbuild README).
