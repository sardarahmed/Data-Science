Q:

ROS_comm Instal on Raspberry Pi 3 possibly stuck?

I am a new user, so my apologies ahead of time for the noob question. I am currently installing ROS Indigo (ROS_comm) on my Raspberry Pi which has Raspbian (Jessie). The last command I ran was:
$ sudo ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release --install-space /opt/ros/indigo -j2
as per this set of instructions (step 3.3) Installing ROS Indigo on the Raspberry Pi
The terminal displays (typed by hand as mouse/keyboard unresponsive):
/opt/ros/indigo/include/ros/serialization.h:223.5: note: in in expansion of macro 'ROS_CREATE_SIMPLE_SERIALIZER_ARM' ROS_CREATE_SIMPLE_SERIALIZER_ARM(double);
It has been stuck here for about 4 hours, not sure if this is normal or not. I can't seem to find any info on it. The mouse is hardly responding, so I take this as a bad sign. Any advice is gladly welcomed!
UPDATE: I killed the board and restarted. Ran the command again and it is stuck on the same spot. Green LED on pi is on (as opposed to iterating on/off).
