Q:

Conflicts when source setup.bash

Hi, I wrote an global planner for my turtlebot.
But when I tried to source my .bashrc, only one setup.bash can work.
When I source ~/turtlebot/devel/setup.bash,
I can use simulator or navigation .
But I need to load my own planner plugin,
so I source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash,
Then  I can see the plugin.
But I can not use anything about turtlebot now.
It seems that source ~/turtlebot/devel/setup.bash is cancelled.
If I source ~/turtlebot/devel/setup.bash again,
I can use turtlebot but I can not see my plugin,
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bashstopped working.
Can anybody help me with this?
For convenience, I usually put all such things in .bashrc file.
But it seems that only one setup.bash can work at a time.

I would suggest copying the whole turtlebot package into your catin_ws/src and only sourcing catin_ws/devel/setup.bash will not produce any conflicts. I have been tweaking a lot of turtlebot packages this way and had no issues so far. Try it.

Especially take care of section 3.3 of the tutorial @Thomas D linked.

Also, this question and this question are closely related to your problem.

A:

This sounds like issues with workspace overlaying (http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/workspace_overlaying). You should be able to do what you want, I'm just not sure exactly how without diving into it more. Hopefully that link gets you in the right direction.
