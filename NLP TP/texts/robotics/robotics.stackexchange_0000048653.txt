Q:

Subscribing to multiple topics of the same type

Is it possible to subscribe to multiple topics of the same type using a single callback function? If it's possible, I can't figure out how.
Please and thank you.

A:

Answer (should work with regular messages as well):
SubscriberFilter leftsub = leftsub(it, "/multisense_sl/camera/left/image_raw", 1);
SubscriberFilter rightsub = rightsub(it, "/multisense_sl/camera/right/image_raw", 1);
TimeSynchronizer<Image, Image> sync(leftsub, rightsub, 10);
sync.registerCallback(boost::bind(&imagesub::callback, this, _1, _2));
void imagesub::callback(const ImageConstPtr& left, const ImageConstPtr& right) {
}
