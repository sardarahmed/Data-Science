Q:

rosnode for creative interactive gesture camera

I was trying to use the interactive gesture camera but could not find any ros node written for the same. Is there some node for 'creative interactive gesture camera' available. ?

A:

You mean the CREATIVE SENZ3D? I´m thinking on buying it instead of the ASUS Xtion, put looks like there´s a lot of work to do before making it work with ROS. Do someone have any additional information? It´s there at least a Linux driver? Thanks a lot
UPDATE
I have verified that there´s a Linux driver. Also PCL 1.7.1 support this camera. But I suppose we still need something to generate and publish sensor_msgs/Image and sensor_msgs/PointCloud2 messages.
NEW UPDATE
I'm using now this code (https://github.com/ipa320/softkinetic) with the SENZ3D and all works fine.

I have an experimental package that I am working on
https://github.com/scottmishra/creative_interactive_gesture_camera
that uses the drivers mention by jorge. Its not polished yet, but it does bring the Creative camera into ROS

Great news! Btw, can I ask you if you bought the camera from Intel (http://click.intel.com/) or directly from Creative? I want to buy one, but the comments about no warranty at all on Intel site scare me! Thanks

I'm not entirely sure, I came to my lab after the camera was already here. Though, I think the Creative uses the same sensors as the softkinectic cameras if that helps you at all.

Anyway, I already ordered a camera. I'll give a try to your software when it comes (but will take a while). Thanks!

Hello, I received the camera and started playing around. I compiled your driver but experienced a crash. Can I ask you what are your plans concerning the code? Will you actively develop it in the near future? Do you plan to create and publish a standalone driver node? Thank you a lot

Look forward to further development. By the way, have you made it working? @jorge?

Hi, sorry of answering this 4 months later.... I suppose you already solved your issues, but I'm using now this code (https://github.com/ipa320/softkinetic) with the SENZ3D and all works fine.

@jorge, thank your for your answer, it is very useful and it is not late at all since I do not have time to solve it yet!

what is your experience so far with senz3d vs. kinect or asus xtion? @jorge

Does this work on Indigo? Does it require the Intel RealSense SDK? OpenCV also seems to have a driver, but it only works with an older Intel SDK that's no longer available.
Comment by jorge on 2015-05-04:
Hi, yes, it works on Indigo. You need to install the DepthSense SDK Linux before (and also opencv and pcl but rosdep will to if for you)
