Q:

install ros as root, how to be used by other user

I install ros and create the catkin_ws as a root, and use it for a long time.
Now I find that it is not good to install and run package as a root because sometimes package concerning with graphics interface does not work!
I do not know it as a ubuntu freshman, it is pretty embarrassing.
So, how can I run ROS and use the package in catkin_ws I create as a other user?

Thanks to Patrick Goebel, the author of the book, ros by example.
With my situation, I have to do below steps:
1, change to normal user
2, post-installation
3, move /root/catkin_ws to /home/NORMAL_USER
4, change the authority for /home/NORMAL-USER/catkin_ws
5,remove build/ and devel/ in the catkin_ws
6, rebuild your catkin_ws
7,add path to ~/.bashrc
8,source ~/.bashrc
Here are part of detailed illustrations:
2, after change to normal user ,as for my case, shawn. Reference to official tutorial 1.5 initiate rosdep and 1.6 environment setup
, do post-installation step.
3,
sudo mv -a /root/catkin_ws /home/shawn/

4,
sudo chown -R shawn:shawn ~/catkin_ws

5,
~/catkin_ws$ rm -fr build devel

6,7,8
catkin_make
echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
