Q:

Depend on OpenCV in Hydro

With this commit in rosdep key that, now from Hydro there are at least 2 ROS ways to depend on OpenCV; via ROS 3rd package "[OpenCV2]" or Ubuntu system dependency libopencv-dev.
Should we update the all package.xml in Hydro that depend on OpenCV2 to replace with libopencv-dev?

A:

I guess it was just answered well on Indigo Migration wiki.
The OpenCV packages are not built in the ROS ecosystem anymore, they rely on upstream packages. The rosdep keys are now: `libopencv-dev` and `python-opencv`

If your package supports Hydro and Indigo on one common branch, you want to depend on a common key that will pull in the right OpenCV for you (the ROS package on Hydro and the distribution package on Indigo). Hence, just depend on` cv_bridge` (which will also pull in `rosconsole` and `sensor_msgs)` or `image_geometry` (which will only pull in `sensor_msgs` but is harder to understand as a dependency, purpose-wise).
