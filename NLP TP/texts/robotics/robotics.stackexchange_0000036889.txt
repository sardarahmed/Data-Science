Q:

FindEigen.cmake not found on Maverick only

Hello,
I am trying to release a stack which depends on Eigen3 as a system dependency.
It works for all platforms on Electric/Unstable except Maverick where the CMake Eigen
macro is not found:
 [rosbuild] Building package walk_interfaces
 [rosbuild] Cached build flags older than manifests; calling rospack to get flags
 [rosbuild] Including /opt/ros/electric/stacks/ros_comm/clients/roslisp/cmake/roslisp.cmake
 [rosbuild] Including /opt/ros/electric/stacks/ros_comm/clients/rospy/cmake/rospy.cmake
 [rosbuild] Including /opt/ros/electric/stacks/ros_comm/clients/cpp/roscpp/cmake/roscpp.cmake
  CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:18 (find_package):
    Could not find module FindEigen.cmake or a configuration file for package
    Eigen.

Adjust CMAKE_MODULE_PATH to find FindEigen.cmake or set Eigen_DIR to the
directory containing a CMake configuration file for Eigen.  The file will
have one of the following names:

  EigenConfig.cmake
  eigen-config.cmake

Did anyone else encountered the same problem? Is there any issue with Eigen support on Maverick?
Thanks.

A:

I receive the same error message with Electric under Oneiric if I do not have a FindEigen.cmake file. See the instructions here:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/eigen
However, I notice that recently there has been an odd edit to the wiki page that doesn't make sense. Here is a link to a good version in the history:
