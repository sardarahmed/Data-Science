A:

I don't know much about Outreachy, but it looks like OSRF is already part of Outreachy and has a proposed Turtlebot project open: https://github.com/osrf/osrf_wiki/wiki/Outreachy .
According to their Application Instructions it looks like you need to apply for Outreachy and email OSRF directly, asking to work on the Turtlebot project.
