A:

hwlee@hwlee:~/catkin_ws$ catkin_make

Command 'catkin_make' not found

Have you remembered to source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash before trying to run catkin_make?
As to this:

hwlee@hwlee:~/catkin_ws$ sudo apt install catkin

Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable distribution that some required packages have not yet been created or been moved out of Incoming.

This is caused by mixing official packages (ie: distributed via packages.ros.org) with UpstreamPackages.
Catkin for ROS Melodic would be ros-melodic-catkin, not catkin.
You cannot mix these two package sources.
Please read UpstreamPackages and install ros-melodic-catkin (but you most likely already have it installed).

Omg, you solve this problem perfectly. Thank you so much!!!!
I used ros-kinetic so that I was confused :(
I did two things you said, and I got saved!
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2020-01-15:\

I used ros-kinetic

Did you tag this question with melodic by accident?
Comment by hwlee on 2020-01-15:
Ah, I meant I used ros-kinetic before. I'm using melodic now :)

For what I saw it seems to me to be more related with the missing source. If you have the same error again, add the command gvdhoorn told you inside .bashrc file (at the end)
