Hello
I tried to install KnowRob package (http://ias.cs.tum.edu/kb/wiki/index.php/Tutorial:_KnowRob_basics) but got some errors. First I check the two repositories.
git clone http://code.in.tum.de/git/ias-common.git
svn co http://code.in.tum.de/pubsvn/knowrob/tags/latest
everything was fine
than using http://ias.cs.tum.edu/kb/wiki/index.php/Tutorial:_KnowRob_basics
tried to satisfy the system dependences
rosdep satisfy knowrob
Got the error. rosdep: command not found
After that tried to do
sudo apt-get install [...] # only if something is missing
And got lots error massages like this

Please tag your question correctly, i.e. add the tag knowrob.

A:

Usually, it's good practice to fix the first error first, in this case the "rosdep: command not found". Google or the ROS wiki search will give you instructions how to install rosdep (e.g. http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosdep).
The line "sudo apt-get install [...] # only if something is missing" was not intended to be typed in literally, but means that you should install those packages that rosdep reported as missing.
