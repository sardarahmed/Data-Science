Q:

How to write ros_ign_bridge in launch file?

I use ros2 and ignition to simulate the dynamics of bipedal robot. Thus I need to run bunch of ros_ign_bridge nodes. it is really cumbersome to run those nodes from the terminal. I want to make the launch file to run those nodes. However, I do not know what /TOPIC@ROS_MSG@IGN_MSG is. Probably it is not a parameter neither argument of the node.
Please let me know how to write launch file for the ros_ign_bridge.
ROS2:foxy
ignition: Citadel
OS: Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS Focal Fossa
Thanks

A:

Hi,
To give you an example: /chatter@std_msgs/String@ignition.msgs.StringMsg

chatter is the ignition topic name. This topic will be created in the ROS 2 network with the same name
std_msgs/String ROS type msgs
ignition.msgs.StringMsg: Ignition type msgs

If you want to create a launch file, you have a look to this launch file. The key part:
# Bridge
bridge = Node(
    package='ros_ign_bridge',
    executable='parameter_bridge',
    arguments=['/model/vehicle_blue/cmd_vel@geometry_msgs/msg/Twist@ignition.msgs.Twist',
               '/model/vehicle_blue/battery/linear_battery/state@sensor_msgs/msg/BatteryState@ignition.msgs.BatteryState'],
    output='screen'
)

Hope this help
