Q:

roslaunch ocl deployer node does not recognize '-s foo.ops --'

When I run:
rosrun ocl deployer-gnulinux -s foo.ops
This works just fine, however when I try this from within a *.launch file
(documented here: http://www.ros.org/wiki/ocl)
I get:
Failed to parse arguments: Unknown option -s
It looks like the arguments are being treated differently when called this way.

Hey Brian,
you are definitively using the correct syntax. All I can think of is something goes wrong with combining it with the gnome-terminal command. I'm using very similar syntax, but with the x-terminal instead, so maybe you could try that one and see if that gives you any better results:
< node name="orocos" pkg="ocl" type="deployer-gnulinux" launch-prefix="xterm -e" args="-s $(find orocos)/system.ops --     ">
