Q:

How to run cram-highlevel?

I download cram-highlevel on http://code.in.tum.de/indefero/index.php//p/cram-highlevel/source/tree/ros_electric/
Here is the download link:http://code.in.tum.de/indefero/index.php//p/cram-highlevel/source/download/ros_electric/
I rosmake successfully.
I also have tried all the launch file seems nothing happened.
Where I can start?
Thank you~

What exactly are you trying to do? cram_highlevel is at the moment just a random collection of lisp libraries for all different kinds of functionality.
