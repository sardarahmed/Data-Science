Q:

Gazebo loading error turtlebot3

I couldn't start turtlebot3 empty world simulation as,
ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo empty_world.launch.py here

I'm using Ros2 Foxy on Ubuntu 20.04 with Gazebo 11. But I can start webot turtlebot simulation below command:
ros2 launch webots_ros2_turtlebot robot_launch.py 

How can I fix the issues.
Thank you.C:\fakepath\Screenshot from 2022-05-30 10-10-45.png

Can you check if you can start gzserver alone?

A:

Your error seems to be the same as another question. Can you try the solution provided there?
Run . /usr/share/gazebo/setup.sh then start Gazebo.

I have those lines in my ~/.bashrc for it:
stat /usr/share/gazebo/setup.sh &> /dev/null
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    source /usr/share/gazebo/setup.sh
fi

If it's been solved, could you accept my answer as correct?
