Q:

adding GUI to docker on OSX

I am trying to attach my macbook-air display to a docker container osrf/ros:lunar and getting this error any ideas?
 Sushils-MacBook-Air:~ sushilsundaram$ docker run -it --env=$DISPLAY --name ROS-lunar osrf/ros:lunar-desktop-full rqt
 QXcbConnection: Could not connect to display

When i run echo $DISPLAY
Sushils-MacBook-Air:~ sushilsundaram$ echo $DISPLAY
/private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.1SRZN6cAkV/org.macosforge.xquartz:0

A:

It is quite hard to set up unix socket.
You might consider using VNC server in the container instead.
