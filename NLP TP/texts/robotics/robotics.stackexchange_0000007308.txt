Q:

How to control a dc motor

I have 2 of these 12v motors and a 12v battery
http://www.enigmaindustries.com/Motors/Bosch_EV_Warrior.htm
I would like to know what the best solution for controlling this motor with an Arduino Uno would be.
Does the motor controller need to have a maximum current of 100A?
I though of a 100A transistor connected to the pwm pin of arduino, and then, control the motor with pwm.
Is voltage regulator better than pwm?

A:

Yes, as this motor is rated for 100amps stall at 12V you should probably be using a motor controller capable of supplying that amount of current.  Regarding how to drive the motor, the following may be of use:

A voltage regulator cannot be used to drive a motor.  What it does is convert a certain voltage to another voltage, for example 5v to 12v.  It does not provide variable speed control.
A transistor rated for 100amps at 12V would be sufficient to drive one of these motors, however you would only have one direction of control (for example, turning clockwise but not counterclockwise).  This may be OK for your application, it also may not be.  You could easily hook up the transistor to a PWM pin of your Arduino for control.
If you want dual directional control of your motor, you will need a DC brushed motor driver, or HBridge.

Good luck with your project.  Just a note, if you don't have very much experience I don't recommend messing with such high currents: issues with unsafe wiring due to lack of experience could be very dangerous and expensive.  I'd recommend starting smaller and working upwards.
