Q:

Publish imu topics using logged data

Hi,
I have a txt file which contains sensors (GPS, Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnetic Field) reading along with a time stamp.
How do I write a node to publish these data as topics?
Ultimately I want to use the robot_localization package to fuse all these data.
Thanks a lot.

A:

You'll just need to read the text file, parse the data, create ROS messages with the data, and publish them. As long as they adhere to ROS standards and are supported, you can use robot_localization.
