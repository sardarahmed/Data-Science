Q:

Installing fuerte and indigo together?

I have Indigo installed, but I can not seem to get rosjava/android_core working, and the documentation for rosjava on indigo is minimal. I was thinking of moving to fuerte. I have two options, either to uninstall indigo and install fuerte, or install them side by side. I don't know which is the better/easier option

Comment by McMurdo on 2015-01-07:
It could be possible to compile the packages from source on Indigo. Did you try that?

A:

It's not possible to have them side-by-side because fuerte only supports Ubuntu versions up to 12.04 while the "oldest" Ubuntu version indigo supports is 13.10
