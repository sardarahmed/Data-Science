Q:

How to port the package from one distro to another?

I got a package here which solves my problem but the package was built in Fuerte. Is it possible to port it to Indigo, if so how can i do it ?

A:

You have to port your nodes to catkin:

I have the same issues with package on groovy.
Christian, do you mean that using caktin somehow resolve the port from different distro?

No, he means that you should update the package to use catkin for building it instead of rosbuild. The migration guide shows you how to perform that update. Updating the build scripts is only part though: any incompatibilities in APIs used will also have to be resolved.

Doesn't indigo still support rosbuild? So catkinizing isn't strictly necessary. However, all API changes will have to be adapted. There are usually migration guides for each new release. Check these out for all revisions in between to see how to resolve possible errors.

@dornhege: yes, rosbuild should still be supported in Indigo, but it will require two workspaces and overlays. I just wanted to clarify what @cyborg-x1 meant with 'you have to port your nodes to catkin', as asked by @Amrac.

I would recommend catkinizing to prevent these issues. For porting it might be easiest to see if a rosbuild works, first.

Yep that's it getting rid of rosbuild and use catkin instead will save you headaches I guess ...
-> You can not depend from a catkin package to a rosbuild package (should say enough)
So whenever you have a message defined in the rosbuild package you need in a catkin pkg ... good luck... ;-)
