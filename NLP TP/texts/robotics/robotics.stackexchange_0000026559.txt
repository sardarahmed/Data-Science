A:

Hi,
I'm not not working with ros hydro, so i can't be sure how to fix this.
normaly this dependencies should be installed with the rosdep call....
But you could try to install the ros pcl packages for hydro manually
if you use ubuntu you could try
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-pcl-conversions (which probably contains your missing file...)
in this case it might be usefull to install the other ros-hydro-pcl-* packages to.
or if you prefer building from source you could take a look here:
RosWiki PCL
I hope this can help you
Greetings,
Benjamin
