Q:

Finding node log file location programmatically

Is it possible to programmatically find location of the log file where my current ros node is writing?  I am using ros groovy. I would like to find the location of the log file from my C++ code, not from the terminal. I think I found how to find the log file directory by using ros::file_log::getLogDirectory(). However this does not give me the log file name.

Thank you very much for your answer. However my question was different. I would like to find the location of the log file from my C++ code, not from the terminal. I think I found how to find the log file directory by using ros::file_log::getLogDirectory(). However this does not give me the log file name.

It may help if you tag c++ & other tags that related to your question in your original question

A:

you can

type command  roscore in the terminal

then open another separate  new
terminal & type command roscd log

roscd log will take you to the folder where ROS stores log files

You can declare your question by editting that what you mentioned about"   you want to  find the location of the log file from your C++ code, not from the terminal.
