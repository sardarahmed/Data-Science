Q:

splitting srdf, urdf files

Is it possible to have a srdf file (and as a matter of fact a urdf file as well) that are split into multiple files?
I was reading the docs and an  doesn't seem to exist.
Why do I want this? I have a robot with a modular design.
Or will I have to write a script to generate these files?

A:

For URDF: see wiki/xacro.
For SRDF: this is not natively supported, but there are people that use xacro there as well. See personalrobotics/herb_description for a(n) (random) example.
