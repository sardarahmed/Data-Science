Q:

How can I update the system software DX100 controller - Yaskawa?

Please, can someone help me?
I'm trying to update the system software DX100 controller to DS3.32.00-14 or greater (-14) version.
I need to do it, because I would like to use the MotoROS app. I'm following the  Motoman Driver Tutorial.
Thank you for the answer.

I don't think this is really a ROS question, it sounds like you should contact Motoman support directly for a firmware update to their controller.

A:

As @ahendrix already mentions, please contact your regional Yaskawa Motoman support about this. You can refer them to the tutorial, but it would probably be better to link to the motoman_driver page, specifically the Requirements section (note the DX100 specific information on that page).
That lists the part number your controller needs. Yaskawa should know what to do then.
If not, send us a message on the ROS-Industrial mailing list.
