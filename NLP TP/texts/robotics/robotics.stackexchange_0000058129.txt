Q:

roscd can't see my OpenCV package

Hello,
.I've set my ROS_PACKAGE_PATH to "/home/leo/:/home/leo/catkin_ws/src:/opt/ros/hydro/share:/opt/ros/hydro/stacks"
Now when I do roscd opencv2 it leads me to the package opencv2 but when i type roscd OpenCV it says "roscd: No such package/stack 'OpenCV'"
but that package OpenCV is definetly there I'm seeing it in my "/opt/ros/hydro/share/".What could be the problem?

A:

There is no ROS package OpenCV. Look inside the folder /opt/ros/hydro/share/OpenCV. There is no package.xml. OpenCV is a conventional library that is packaged as ROS package opencv2 for convenience of installation.
