Q:

URDF/COLLADA file is not a valid robot model | no name given for the robot | Universal Robots (UR)

I have dowloaded the Universal Robots (UR3, UR5 and UR10) from:
http://wiki.ros.org/universal_robot
I am trying to load the Urdf | xacro file in Moveit setup assistant...However I cannot load the robot
The error msg in Movelt Apl is
"URDF/COLLADA file is not a valid robot model."
And the terminal returns me the following message:
"No name given for the robot"
I followed the "tutorial" given by the link above...I  executed  the commands:
rosdep update....rosdep install rosdistro etc... and source ...devel/bash..
I also dowloaded the package with the Abb robots....and there was no problem in load them in Moveit. However I need a robot with ee_effector to follow the tutorial from qbotics...Lenthin Joseph...form the book Mastering ROS... anyway when I was finishing the setup from Abb robot moveit stopped and a shadow color appeared..it stopped to work, I don't know why.
I would like to load the ur10 robot!
obs: I have already looked the answers similar to this issue in Forum, however they did not adressed my case!
Could someone help me to find the error?
Thanks in advance

A:

The answer you've posted is actually not the answer.
Those files are used by thousands of people and they are correct as-is.
The cause of your problem is that you've selected the wrong file to load.
Instead of loading ur10e.urdf.xacro, you should load the ur10e_robot.urdf.xacro file.
The former only defines the macro, but doesn't instantiate it. The latter is a top-level xacro that includes the appropriate files and then also instantiates the model.
Loading a file that only defines a macro will result in an empty file after the MSA tries to load it, hence the error.
