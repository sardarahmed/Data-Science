Q:

How do I post-process rviz images?

I've made a gazebo envirnment and successfully visualized the cam image with rviz. However I wanted to do some post process to make it simulate the result of image segmentation and send it back to rviz. Is there any similiar methods or tutorials for this? Maybe a way to import the node to python?

A:

There are so many nice tutorials that you could follow. I am listing down some of them below:

And for the last part of your question, see this.
