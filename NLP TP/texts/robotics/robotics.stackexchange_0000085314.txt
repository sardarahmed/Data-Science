Q:

canopen chain node exit with error code -11

When I run the canopen_chain_node's chain the launch with the following yaml file:
bus:
  device: vcan0
  master_allocator: canopen::SimpleMaster::Allocator
sync:
  interval_ms: 10
  overflow: 0
heartbeat:
  rate: 100 # simple heartbeat producer, optional!
  msg: "77f#05" # message to send, cansend format: heartbeat of node 127 with status 5=Started
nodes:
  node1:
    id: 1
    eds_file: /home/user/eds/phyPS409Y.eds

I get the following the in logs:
# roslaunch --screen canopen_chain_node chain.launch 
... logging to /home/turtle1/.ros/log/d83321c8-1182-11e8-9307-c8ff284dfc57/roslaunch-turtle1-12835.log

But other .eds files work.
This topic did not solve my problem.
I'm using the latest version of canopen_chain_node.

roslaunch --screen should give you more error output.
Comment by Dizett on 2018-02-14:
I added the output

A:

With https://github.com/ros-industrial/ros_canopen/pull/258 merged (2 hours ago), you will get
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'canopen::ParseException'
  what():  Type of 0x6005 does not match or is not supported

Datatype 1 (1 bit Boolean) is not supported by ros_canopen.
Update: I have added an issue.

Yes! Thank you! Python quietly works with .eds files even with incorrect "ObjectType,DataType, AccessType ", but ROS is picky.

Just because I care about type safety at protocol level ;)
