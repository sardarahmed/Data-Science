Q:

Can the number of nodes in a launch file occur issues?

Hi,
Half of the time I launch my project an issue occurs. I'm wondering if it's simply coming from the fact that I launch 15 nodes with one launch file ? (but I would be surprise that a launch file couldn't handle it)
To be more specific, the issue is only with rviz and/or gazebo failing to launch. Is it because I launch too much nodes at the same time or because I launch all the nodes in the same launch file, causing the needed nodes for Gazebo/rviz not being initialized fast enough ?

What issues come up?

When Rviz crashes there is no error output but the rviz icon is frozen and I can only execute killall rviz to stop it and when Gazebo crashes I have [gazebo-3] process has died [pid 24958, exit code 255.

I asked the question out of desperation, it's probably what @Stefan Kohlbrecher said but I can't find the right soltuion so I try to explore every possibility.
I will post my solution if I manage to solve it since lots of people struggle with Gazebo but no one as the right answer ;)

A:

No, this should not be an issue, we've been using single launch files with a significantly higher number of nodes started with them with no issues.
If rviz and/or gazebo specifically have issues, that might point to a graphics driver related cause (seeing how they both use OGRE and are somewhat sensitive to gfx driver setup). You'll find many posts on this site for both gazebo graphics crashes and rviz graphics crashes.

Thank you for your answer I've always been wondering about this, and yes you're probably right for the drivers but I already searched a lot without finding the solution.
