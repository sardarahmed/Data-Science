Q:

Vector3.hh not found on Gazebo9

Hello Gazebo Community,
I am currently trying to run the Wil Selby ROS-quadrotor simulator, but I cant get through. (https://github.com/wilselby/ROS_quadrotor_simulator)
actually I am getting an error which says:
fatal error: gazebo/math/Vector3.hh: No such file or directory
 #include <gazebo/math/Vector3.hh>
is there any possibility to get that Vector3.hh file into my gazebo/math path? I am pretty new to ROS and Gazebo and appreciate any help! Thanks alot!

A:

Gazebo math has been deprecated since Gazebo 8, it looks like your package is meant to be used with earlier versions. You'll need to edit the source code to use Ignition math instead. Here's a full list of functions to be migrated.

Thats a good hint. Just to make sure, do I need to modify the source code of my gazebo version? Is there a chance for you to explain that a bit more detailled, as I mentioned I'm kinda new to all this.
Thanks alot anyways for your advice!

You'll need to change the source code of the ROS_quadrotor_simulator, or downgrade to Gazebo 7.
