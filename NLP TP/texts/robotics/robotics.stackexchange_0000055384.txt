Q:

publish file to image topic

Hi, I want to publish an image file (i.e. image1.jpg) to an image topic I can display in rviz (/camera/image).  Can anyone tell me a simple way to do this?

Did you ever get an example working that you care to share?

A:

Use opencv imread on the file and then rosbridge to convert to the sensor_msgs/Image format: http://wiki.ros.org/cv_bridge/Tutorials/UsingCvBridgeToConvertBetweenROSImagesAndOpenCVImages

Thanks for the answer. How to publish images in a folder continuously?

Try out https://github.com/lucasw/image_manip/blob/master/image_manip/scripts/image_folder_publisher.py
rosrun image_manip image_folder_publisher.py _folder:=`pwd`

and there are likely more to be found elsewhere
