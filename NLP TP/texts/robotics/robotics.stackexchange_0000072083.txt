Q:

Cmake_module_path not found

 CMake Error at rpg_vikit/vikit_common/CMakeLists.txt:26 (FIND_PACKAGE):
  By not providing "FindSophus.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Sophus", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Sophus" with any
  of the following names:

    SophusConfig.cmake
    sophus-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Sophus" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "Sophus_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Sophus"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.

-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
See also "/home/btaher20/catkin_ws/build/CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log".
Invoking "cmake" failed

After  that,I add
set(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR})
find_package(Eigen3 REQUIRED)
include_directories(${EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR})

But  still  same  error
How  to  solve  it? Would  you any body  give link.

A:

This means that the system dependency Sophus cannot be found and is thus not installed.
Check the ROS wiki page about how to install and try again.
It seems to be not configured correctly as a dependency in vikit.

exchange "Sophus" with "sophus" in any CMakeLists.txt file did it for me
