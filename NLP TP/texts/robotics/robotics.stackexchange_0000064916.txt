Duplicate of ubuntu 14.10 and ros installation error help me.

A:

14.10 will be supported in the next ROS release. 14.10 has come out since the last ROS release.
If you need to keep that machine you can use a VM or Docker until the next release is available in May. There will be prereleases also available before the final release.
Target platforms are documented in REP 3 Updates for the next release, Jade, is under review here
