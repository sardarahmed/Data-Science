Q:

building my own rosjava android package doesn't work

Hello!
I want to create my own rosjava android package. For this, I use the instructions on click. It works fine as long as I don't add the dependency "srs_decision_making":
<package>
  <description brief="my_package">

     my_package

  </description>
  <author>Ubuntu</author>
  <license>BSD</license>
  <review status="unreviewed" notes=""/>
  <url>http://ros.org/wiki/my_package</url>

  <depend package="rosjava"/>
  <depend package="android_gingerbread"/>
  <depend package="srs_decision_making"/>

</package>

When doing the "rosmake my_package" I'll get a build error saying:
package org.ros.message.std_msgs does not exist
However, this java package can be found in ~/.ros/rosjava/lib/org.ros.rosjava.std_msgs-0.0.0.jar
Any idea, why it says, it can't find it?

A:

Have you tried adding a dependency on std_msgs to your manifest? It probably shouldn't be necessary. But, if adding the dependency fixes things, you may have found a bug.

It seems to be some sort of bug, I think. I posted it on http://ros-users.122217.n3.nabble.com/rosjava-package-not-compilable-when-messages-includes-as-dependency-td3669216.html.
