Q:

When using roslibjs, getting value of some params returns empty

Hello, I am trying to programmatically fetch params from my ROS instance using roslibjs. When fetching some params, the value returns successfully, however with other params the value returned is empty.
Here is a snippet of the code in question:
var bridge = new ROSLIB.Ros();
bridge.on('connection', onConnect);
bridge.on('error', onError);
bridge.connect('my-ros-server');

...

var param = new ROSLIB.Param({
    ros: bridge,
    name: name
});

param.get(function(value) {
    console.log(value.toString());
});

It would be helpful if you could also post examples of some parameters that work and some that fail.  For example, using rosparam dump param_name to show the type/value of each parameter.

I'll give it my best shot! ros_version returns "fuerte". "rrHardwareStatus4Enable", my own custom parameter, returns blank. Does that help?

A:

Hi all, I wanted to post the answer to my question! I figured it out!
To get the value of a param from ROS using roslibjs, you must supply the full parameter name, not a truncated version!
My application was putting all of the params that ROS reported into a collapsible/expandable tree, and was stripping the /blah/ prefix from params like /blah/blahparam.
To reiterate, to get the value of a param from ROS, you must specify /blah/blahparam, not just blahparam.
Cheers!
