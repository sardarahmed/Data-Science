A:

The navigation_collision_checker_node is a straightforward implementation of using MoveIt! collision checking against an octomap to prevent collisions with the environment. It takes in a Octomap on a topic as well as a Twist and sets output Twist to zero in case a collision is predicted. There's a lot of fancy stuff that could be done on top, but it works ok.
