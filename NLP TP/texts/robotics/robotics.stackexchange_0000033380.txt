Q:

Where is the latest document of Erratic Simulation?

In http://www.ros.org/wiki/simulator_gazebo/Tutorials/TeleopErraticSimulation
I got an error by running : rosmake erratic_gazebo teleop_base
 sam@/home/sam/code/ros/gazebo/stl$ rosmake erratic_gazebo teleop_base

Isn't it would be install with original installation of ROS?I use "ROS version-*" to install every packges.
Comment by Bram van de Klundert on 2011-08-01:
are you sure you have those packages on your pc and in a location where ros commands can find them?

A:

Please see this question. Instead of installing the CTurtle version of erratic_robot stack, install Diamondback version by running sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-erratic-robot if you are running ROS Diamondback.
Note: I have also updated the linked tutorial to use erratic_robot stack to prevent future confusion.
