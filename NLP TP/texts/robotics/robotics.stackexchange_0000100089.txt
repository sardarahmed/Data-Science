Q:

MAXON Escon Motor Controller ROS

I have a mobile robot platform running with 4 Escon 50/5 drivers an 4 DCX motors. I have created my motor controllers .edc file via escon software; but I couldn't find a way to communicate with ROS to control motor drivers. Any help or guidance would be appreciated.

A:

@mergen Take a look at this ROS library: http://wiki.ros.org/epos_hardware
There is some additional information about the motors you are looking in their repo, or you may be able to find someone that has more info: https://github.com/RIVeR-Lab/epos_hardware/issues/26
