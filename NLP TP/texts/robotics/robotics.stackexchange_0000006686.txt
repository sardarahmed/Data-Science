Q:

iRobot Create 2 and Open Interface 2 Spec not syncing up with incoming data

I have the create 2 and have it hooked up to an arduino. Almost all the commands work fine except when retrieving sensor information. If i send a request for packet 18 I get back values that while consistent don't match up, unless I am missing something. So if I press the clean button I get 127 or 11111110 and if i then press spot I get something like 11111010. I might be messing up my endianness but regardless the data isnt formatted how I expected it to be according to the spec sheet. I have 3 create 2s and they all do the same thing. Any ideas? I am using a 2n7000 along with the tutorial from the site but i dont think that has anything to do with the formatting of the byte.
this is the library I am using: https://github.com/DomAmato/Create2
Sorry to take so long to get back on this, anyways the data we get is always formatted this way. It is not a baud rate issue since it understands the commands properly.

        day     hour    minute  schedule    clock   dock    spot    clean
day     3       x       x       x           x       x       x       x
hour    6       7       x       x           x       x       x       x
minute  13      14      15      x           x       x       x       x
schedule    x   x       x       x           x       x       x       x
clock   x       x       x       x           x       x       x       x
dock    27      29      30      x           x       31      x       x
spot    55      59      61      x           x       62      63      x
clean   111     119     123     x           x       125     126     127

Note that the schedule and clock buttons return nothing

A:

The problem was the part we were using. Make sure you use the right transistor. The schedule and clock button still dont produce any output but everything else behaves as it should. 
Error = 2n7000 transistor
Answer = 2n4403
Thanks to Steve for pointing it out though it doesn't just invert the signal it mutates it into the table I posted in my question.
