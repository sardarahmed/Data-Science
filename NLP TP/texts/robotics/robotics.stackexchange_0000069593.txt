Q:

ROS launch resource not found

Hello all,
I am using ROS-Industrial Training and I'm receiving these messages when attempting to launch the supplementary launch files:
raise ResourceNotFound(name, ros_paths=self._ros_paths)
ResourceNotFound: irb_2400_arm_navigation
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/hydro/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/opt/ros/hydro/share
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/hydro/stacks

I was previously using Groovy and never had this problem, if anyone could shed some light on this problem it would be greatly appreciated.

A:

arm_navigation has been deprecated in hydro and replaced by moveit. There seem to be irb_2400 moveit packages. I'm not sure what the content of your tutorial is, but in any case, I'd recommend using moveit based tutorials.

Okay and I did use a moveit based tutorial when creating my own moveit! package based on a URDF I exported from solidworks and received the same message when attempting to launch the launch files that were created. Any thoughts on that particular situation that doesn't involve a tutorial?
