Q:

Moveit: "Group 'arm' includes joints that have more than 1 DOF

I have this error message from ROS when loading the model in the C++ ROS node. All joints in the model have only 1 axis of rotation so this message does not make sense. is there any reason why this message might be showing up?

Could you post your urdf?

The code will not post well but the URDF code is hosted at https://github.com/greenpro/sac_description/blob/master/urdf/scorbot_description.xacro
The rest of the description project is at

A:

First: the error message you quote is actually not coming from MoveIt itself, but from the kinematics plugin you have configured for your arm group. MoveIt itself doesn't really care, but plugins like KDL, LMA and others don't support joints with more than a single dof.
As to a possible cause: in greenpro/sac_config/config/andreas_arm.srdf (here) you have:
<group name="arm">
    <joint name="virtual_joint" />
    ...
</group>
...
<virtual_joint name="virtual_joint" type="planar" parent_frame="odom_combined" child_link="world" />

Your arm group includes virtual_joint, which you have configured as a planar joint. Planar joints combine 2 dof, so I think that is where your error message is coming from.
Btw: the virtual joint is typically not included in any group, as it is the joint that connects your robot / cell to the 'world'.

From greenpro/sac_config@67d1af6463da688cededec1a0def76129ff7209e I have the impression that you've solved the problem by removing the virtual joint frome the arm group?

I solved the problem by remaking the project using the setup assistant and changing the joint to a fixed joint. The removal was from a previous attempt to solve the problem. The configuration is now at https://github.com/greenpro/scorbot_config
