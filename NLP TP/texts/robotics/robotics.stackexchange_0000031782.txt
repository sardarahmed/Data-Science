Q:

It is allowed to change the update() method frequency for PR2 controllers?

I found the parameters /pr2_controller_manager/mechanism_statistics_publish_rate and /pr2_controller_manager/joint_state_publish_rate, but I didn't find anything that allows me to change the update() method frequency of a controller.
There is any way to modify this or the update() frequency is necessary 1000Hz?

A:

The PR2 controllers are design and tuned to operate at 1KHz, changing the update rate of the controller will significantly impact the stability of the controllers on the PR2. It is not recommended to change the update rate, you do so at your own risk.
