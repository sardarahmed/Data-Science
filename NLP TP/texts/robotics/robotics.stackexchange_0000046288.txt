Q:

roscpp failure to call service written in rospy

Is it ok to write a Ros node in cpp to call a ros service written in python?
I'm able to use "rosservice call /service" to do that, but using cpp to call the same service just didn't work. Just want to know is it some problem with my code or just simply cannot call rospy service in roscpp.
Thanks,
