Q:

Set different speed on Turtlebot wheels

How do I set different speed for Turtlebot wheels using python? I've been using Twist() for making the Turtlebot move forward or rotate on one spot. How do I use angular and linear for setting speed on on wheels separately?
For instance, I want Turtlebot to go in a circle with a specific radius.

A:

The robot is not restricted to "one spot"; you can set both translational and rotational velocities in the same message.
With that said, although it's C++, see an answer I posted previously about the relationship between linear and angular velocities (and how to calculate them).
