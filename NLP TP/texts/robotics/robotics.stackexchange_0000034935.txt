Q:

installing ros diamondback on ubuntu 11.10 oneiric ocelot

Hi, I have recently downloaded ubuntu 11.10 oneiric ocelot and i'm currently trying to install ros diamondback. I have tried to install it using the 11.04 sources.list but it says some packages could not be installed and the final line in the terminal window reads:
"E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages."
Is there a way to successfully install diamondback on ubuntu 11.10?
Thanks,
James

A:

We will be bringing our Oneiric builds online now that it has been released.  There are a few patches which will be required.  Note, diamondback is not supported on oneiric as per REP 3 only Electric and later ROS distros will be supported.
If you'd like to run on Oneiric now, I suggest that you compile from source and submit any patches required for the upgrade.
The status of the debian builds can be viewed at http://www.ros.org/debbuild/electric.html

Oneiric debians are now available for most packages.  Oneiric is now listed at http://ros.org/wiki/electric/Installation/Ubuntu
