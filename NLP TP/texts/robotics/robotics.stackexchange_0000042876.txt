Q:

stacks/packages Turtlebot explores floor and maps autonomously?

Hello, ROS ANSWERS community!
I'm looking for stacks or packages for Turtlebot that will have it autonomously navigate a single floor of a building and create a 2D map of it, probably working in conjunction with the gmapping_demo or similar program. I want to have the robot be able to do the mapping all on its own without the need for a teleop.
If anyone has knowledge of any such stacks or packages here on ROS, I would appreciate the help in finding them. Thank you in advance, and have a wonderful day!

A:

Your message is quite old, but I will answer it anyway. Look up the Explore package which implements frontier based exploration. You can use it with SLAM to have your robot build a map autonomously.

I also modified the package to use it with a real turtlebot, but it doesn't work perfectly. https://github.com/LadyZayin/explore

I'll upvote this, if you add a link to the ROS wiki or code. :-)
