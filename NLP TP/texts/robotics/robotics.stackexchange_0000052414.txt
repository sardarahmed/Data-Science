Q:

How to find a laser straight line?

Hello
I would like to user laser for finding some obstacles. So I would like to know how to work with straight lines on laser scan massages. So if the points are the longer straight lines of the sensor massage means the obstacle is a wall. If not than its a something else.. Cause I need to distinguish between a wall and some other tall object. But I dont know how to find the straight line the laser scan sensor massage. Any help??
Thanks

A:

Take a look at the Hough Transform for finding lines.

But I dont wont to use depth images and kinect. Only laser. So how does Hough Transform  work to identify straight lines in laser scans???

For the Hough Transform, the point data from a laser is just fine. It will probably be easiest to do things in the laser's frame so you can treat all the points as 2d.

ok. Thanks. Any help or example code of Hough Transform and ROS???
