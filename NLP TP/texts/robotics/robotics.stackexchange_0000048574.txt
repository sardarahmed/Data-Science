Q:

pcl coordinate system orientation

I am aware that ros uses the positive coordinate system in which x=forward, y=left, and z=up, but can anyone tell me what pcl data uses?

joq, that's what I thought until I used the function pcl::fromROSMsg() and a pcl passthrough filter.  The PCL z parameter pertained to forward direction and y pertainted to the upward direction.  I'm speaking in terms of the pcl namespace.  Is this correct?

Check the header.frame_id field in the message. It may be using an "optical" frame by mistake. See: http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0103.html#coordinate-frame-conventions
