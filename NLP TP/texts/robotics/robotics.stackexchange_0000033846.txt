Q:

rxtools build error on OSX Snow Leopard

When I run "rosmake rxtools" - I get:
{-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
~/ros/rx/rxtools/src/rxtools/rosout_panel_swig_generated.cpp:6149: error: expected `)' before 'void'
/Users/tobymartin/ros/rx/rxtools/src/rxtools/rosout_panel_swig_generated.cpp: In function 'void* _p_wxFileDialogTo_p_wxDialog(void*)':
~/ros/rx/rxtools/src/rxtools/rosout_panel_swig_generated.cpp:6155: error: 'wxFileDialog' was not declared in this scope
~/ros/rx/rxtools/src/rxtools/rosout_panel_swig_generated.cpp:6155: error: expected primary-expression before 'void'
....etc.
The log file says:
~/ros/rx/rxtools/src/rxtools/rosout_panel_swig_generated.cpp:2739:34: error: wx/wxPython/wxPython.h: No such file or directory
~/ros/rx/rxtools/src/rxtools/rosout_panel_swig_generated.cpp:2740:35: error: wx/wxPython/pyclasses.h: No such file or directory
...etc.
I have "ports" installed : py26-wxpython and wxWidgets-python...in, I assume, is the the standard /opt/local/include/wx-2.8/wx/wxPython dir.
Looking at the CMakefile - I see "find_package(wxWidgets REQUIRED)" and later "include_directories(${wxWidgets_INCLUDE_DIRS})"...I assume this environment variable is set by the "find_package" command.
But still, rosmake can't seem to find those headers.  Anyone have any ideas?
Thanks.

A:

Nevermind - I found a solution.  I created a symlink in /opt/local/include  wx@->wx-2.8/wx
with the command: sudo ln -s wx-2.8/wx wx
