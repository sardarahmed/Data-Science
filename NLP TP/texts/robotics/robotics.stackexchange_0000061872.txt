A:

I dont want to steal @bvbdort thunder, but I think you should probably save to a .bag file first and then change to a .txt or .csv file. Going directly to a text file, particularly if you are working with any imaging output from the bot can get weird quickly.
I believe the "ROS" way to do this would be to run a command like
    $rosbag record <topic> 

And then move it over to a .txt/.csv file. A useful script to do this can be found here:
( http://answers.ros.org/question/9102/how-to-extract-data-from-bag/?answer=63877#post-id-63877 )
which converts to a .csv. This will save the data long-term and allow a cleaner transition in the short term.
