Q:

rpath for third party library

I am wrapping a third party library in ROS. The library has a few executables as well. I use a custom Makefile to build the library and the executables. However, when I do "rosrun customlib executable", I get "shared library not found" error. Should I modify the Makefile and use rpath into the executables or is there any default mechanism to take care of such cases? Thanks.

A:

It seems the only solution is to ensure rpath is guaranteed by the third party build system. In my case, I was wrapping my own library which uses CMake. I added CMake rpath commands to the library build scripts.
