Q:

Can turtlebot3_fake simulate lidar and obstacles?

I am experimenting and trying to understand the world of simulator robots and rviz etc. I am working with a TurtleBot3 and wanted to see if I could use turtlebot3_fake to actually simulate Lidar  and Obstacles. Is that possible?

A:

The turtlebot3_fake package does not support the features you mentioned.
The simulate Lidar, Depth, Color camera and Obstacles require a Gazebo simulator.
These features are supported by the turtlebot3_gazebo package as described in the links below.
