Q:

ROS to control servos in R/C-Car?

Hi,
i want to use BeagleBoard Black in an R/C-Car to control the steering and braking servo. Is it useful to use ROS? Or is it "too much"? Which means that this task could be solved by using standard OS like Angstr√∂m or Ubuntu without having more (programming) work to do.
Thanks.

If you just want to control a R/C-Car, I recommend you Arduino and Processing (http://www.instructables.com/id/Processing-Controls-RC-Car-with-XBee-modules/). Actually, I also tried it. As I wanna move an autonomous robot, I use ROS.

A:

That's perfectly doable with ROS, especially if it needs to be fully autonomous. I don't have first-hand experience running ROS on a Beaglebone, but here's a good example of a non-trivial robot using a Beaglebone and servos.
That's a pretty complicated example, so looking at its code might be a bit overwhelming. If you're completely new to ROS, I'd recommend taking it slow and going through all the tutorials and specifics for the Beaglebone, because ROS can have a big learning curve. This servo controller tutorial might be especially helpful. It assumes you're using an Arduino, but the basic idea is the same.

the thing with arduino and ros is that it always have 'lost sync' issue
