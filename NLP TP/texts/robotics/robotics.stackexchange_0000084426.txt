I am trying to run:-

from defusedxml.xmlrpc import monkey_patch
ImportError: No module named defusedxml.xmlrpc
while processing /opt/ros/kinetic/share/turtlebot_gazebo/launch/includes/kobuki.launch.xml:

A:

What ROS version are you using? Kinetic? I assume you are running it in Ubuntu? Did you do the full install?
Do you have Miniconda or Anaconda installed?
If you answer those questions more help can be provided, since the released packages for turtlebot work with no troubles in Kinetic, I've used them many times.

I did full install of Kinetic.I have Anaconda. Although I solved this problem by pip install defusedxml. Now I can run the simulator but I got [ERROR] [1514443066.744419842]: Skipped loading plugin with error: XML Document '/opt/ros/kinetic/share/gmapping/nodelet_plugins.xml' has no Root Element
