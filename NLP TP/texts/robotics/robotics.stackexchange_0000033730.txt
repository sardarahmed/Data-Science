Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Eigen in ROS?

Hi,
I am new to ROS and trying to do research using ROS. My program has lots of matrix computations where I use the eigen to do that. My question is "how can I use eigen in ROS?".
I did some research on that and tried following ROS Wiki, but I have not got any luck so far. Can anybody tell me how to do that?
Thanks.

A:

As of ROS Electric, Eigen is a system dependency, so you shouldn't have to do anything special to use it.
