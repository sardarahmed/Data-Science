A:

rosmake knowrob?
roscd knowrob?
EDIT:
This is a known bug in the binary .deb packages for Fuerte and Groovy. Neither of them are built any more, so there is no way to fix this problem. Please install KnowRob from source into your rosbuild workspace as described in the Installation Guide.

Do I need to rosmake knowrob again? I already did that while installing the  knowrob system with tutorials.
And roscd knowrob? I did it. No difference
This is how it is here:
~/rosbuild_ws/stacks/knowrob
~/rosbuild_ws/stacks/knowrob_tutorials/knowrob_basics_tutorial
Is something wrong?
I first did the "basic knowrob installion" and then "KnowRob system including tutorials".

Oh! Have I made a big, bad blunder by not putting all this in /opt/ros/hydro ?
Comment by moritz on 2014-03-11:
You shouldn't put things under /opt/ros. If your workspace is set up according to the tutorials, that's fine. roscd knowrob should bring you to the respective folder. Have you rosmade the knowrob_basics_tutorial package?
Comment by ratneshmadaan on 2014-03-11:
As I said, I was making a blunder; albeit a different one. Thank you.
And hats off for the thesis.
Comment by Kat on 2014-08-12:
Is this solved? I put the knowrob_basics_tutorial package in /opt/ros/groovy/stacks/ and I still get this error.
Comment by moritz on 2014-08-13:
As I said in my previous comment, you should NEVER put things in /opt/ros manually, but create a proper workspace in your home directory as described in the tutorials.
Comment by moritz on 2014-08-13:
If you use both catkin and rosbuild packages, you will need to create a combined workspace as described here.
Comment by moritz on 2014-08-13:
If you then still have problems, please give details about your system setup (ROS version, Ubuntu version, swipl --version)
Comment by Kat on 2014-08-13:
I installed ros groovy on ubuntu 12.04. The version of swipl is SWI-Prolog version 5.10.4 for i386.
When I roscd knowrob I get /opt/ros/groovy/stacks/knowrob
Comment by Kat on 2014-08-13:
What I did was install knowrob like it said in the tutorial and this works fine. For the knowrob tutorials I used http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/StackInstallation#Using_GIT_to_pull_down_a_repository to install it from github in the opt/ros/groovy/stacks, where knowrob also is.
Comment by Kat on 2014-08-13:
In the git tutorial they assume you have installed ros from svn. But I have not and I don't know what the correct directories are in my case. I have a catkin workspace in my home folder. Should I install it there?
Comment by moritz on 2014-08-13:
Have you installed KnowRob using apt-get? This is broken for ROS Groovy, as said in the [installation instructions. The issue you described is a known bug that cannot be fixed since the .deb are not built any more.
Comment by Kat on 2014-08-13:
Ok yes. I did miss that. I have now installed knowrob and the tutorials from source like the link showed. And both knowrob and knowrob_basics_tutorial are in /home/groovy_workspace/stacks and are found by roscd. But still I get the same error.
Comment by moritz on 2014-08-13:
Is /home/groovy_workspace a rosbuild or catkin workspace? knowrob is still a rosbuild stack. And have you run 'rosmake knowrob'? It should run without any error messages.
Comment by Kat on 2014-08-13:
It is a rosbuild stack using this tutorial: http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/using_rosbuild_with_catkin and I have run rosmake knowrob and it showed me no errors.
Comment by moritz on 2014-08-13:
Hmm, no idea. We regularly install KnowRob without problems using the instructions on Ubuntu 12.04 which is our standard dev platform. It very likely is a problem of your ROS workspace setup, I'd double-check that ROS indeed uses the right version of KnowRob (e.g. uninstall the deb)
