Q:

unit for theta coming from hector mapping or laser scan matcher

hi im using hector mapping on my quardotor and have problems with the theta coming out of /poseupdate. When i yaw the quad 90 degrees i get a value of 0.63 - 0.7 . If i consider this to be in radians and convert it, the value in degrees is about 36 - 40 degrees. I've also tried with laser scan matcher with the same result.

A:

That indeed sounds a bit weird. the pose published on the /poseupdate topic is the pose relative to the /map frame (by default). Did you consider that the orientation is given as a quaternion and that you canÂ´t just look at the "z" component of it to retrieve to yaw angle in rad?
