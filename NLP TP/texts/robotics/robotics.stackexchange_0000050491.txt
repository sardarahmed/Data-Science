Q:

Using robot_state_publisher with a .sdf file

Looking at the documentation of robot_state_publisher, it appears that the package is really only compatible with the .urdf format.  Could it work with .sdf?
If not, what would be the recommended way to create the /tf data from an .sdf model loaded in Gazebo?
My initial thoughts are to grab data from the /gazebo/link_states topic and work it into the tf format ala something like the Writing a tf broadcaster (C++) tutorial.  Running this on Ubuntu 12.04 with ROS Groovy.  I appreciate any insights.

This is a newer post with the same issue: http://answers.ros.org/question/204803/robot_state_publisher-with-sdf-files/

A:

I think the best solution for this problem would to add SDF support to kdl_parser. Slightly more challenging would be to add SDF support to rviz display plugin to visualize the robot.
An easier solution right now would be to maintain 2 copies of your robot (SDF and URDF), or use Gazebo's URDF parser (which lags a bit behind the SDF).
