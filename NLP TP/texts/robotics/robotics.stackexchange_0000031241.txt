Q:

python tutorials for robot setup tf and sensors

Hi,
Very new to ROS.....please excuse
core server navigation visualisation etc
maverick
2.6.35-28-generic
ros-cturtle-core (synaptics version) 1.0.0-s1302849017~maverick
robot node
ubuntu-10-04 architecture armel ( beagle board xM )
ros cturtle compiled on board from svn
Outline
Was planning to implement ROS via python to control.read data from personal arduino robot. My arduino is working well so I do n't really want to start integrating other's libraries into it at the moment.
Progress
Working through the tutorials and most work, transform listener/broadcaster mostly work, but the introductions to time fail.
Now trying to work through the c/cpp tutorials for robot setup and laser sensor.

Issue
I really want to work in python if I can, are there tutorials for these or do you have to setup in C and then use python in a restricted manner?
Thanks
Dave

A:

The navigation stack setup is basically robot configuration setup, i.e. provide laser, odometry, and especially tf + writing config and launch files for the nav stack.
The data can come from any ROS node (i.e. also python), you will just need to publish odometry and tf.
The config and launch files are independent of python (or c++).
The navstack tutorials are mostly C++ independent. The example code is in C++ but besides showing you which values to fill, you should be able to do the same things in python.
It might be a good idea to do the python tf tutorials and you should know how to write a broadcaster from the general ROS tutorials.
