Q:

Was the ROS gpg key supposed to change? Bionic now uses F42ED6FBAB17C654 as of June 6, 2019

My server stopped updating, when I investigated I found that at least the Bionic packages seem to be signed with a new public key. The installation instructions still specify the old key, was this change intentional?
New key: F42ED6FBAB17C654

A:

Actually I see that the installer instructions have been updated so I guess someone knew this was going to change.
The subtle failures this caused was a bit unexpected.

This is indeed a duplicate of #q325039.

The subtle failures this caused was a bit unexpected.

There have been multiple posts about this -- and the preparations -- on ROS Discourse.
It's a breaking change, but it was well announced on the appropriate channels for this type of thing.
