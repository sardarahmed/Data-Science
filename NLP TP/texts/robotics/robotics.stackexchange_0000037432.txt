Q:

Point Clouds in ROS

How to process point clouds taken [published] using ROS using PCL for object recognition?
I've read the PCL documentation and it mentions that we need a PCD file [containing the point clouds] for processing. How do we convert the infinite stream of point clouds published by ROS into a PCD file?

A:

You can convert a ROS PointCloud directly to a PCL datatype so that you can process it using PCL built-in fucntions. See this tutorial.
