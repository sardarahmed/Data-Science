Q:

Rule/practice for the location of storing config files

On Ubuntu Quantal with Groovy on my home dir, I see hidden dirs:
.gazebo
.ros  (might be used for storing logs only?) (*1)
.rviz

Also, there could be pkgs that store their config in arbitrary location. For example rqt_gui stores its setting in ~/.config/ros.org/rqt_gui.ini, which I had a hard time in finding by file search (grep, find) and ended up looking into its code (this is not documented either).
Is there any good rule / practice to standardize the config/setting files' location ROS-wide?

*1...3/4/2013 turned out false. See wiki

Update 3/11/2013 For rqt_gui specifically, it will keep using ~/.config folder since it is/will be not fully ROS-dependent. See discussion here.

A:

The normal ROS practice is to use some subdirectory of $ROS_HOME for storing data generated from ROS nodes.
If $ROS_HOME is not defined, use ~/.ros as a default.

I see also it's documented here.
