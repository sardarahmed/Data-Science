Q:

Installing ROS2 as Debian package leads to broken install

Hello all,
I'm using Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS (Bionic) and I tried to install ROS2 Eloquent using the command
sudo apt install ros-eloquent-ros-base

When I look into my ros folder, this is what I see
me@sirius:/opt/ros/eloquent$ ls
bin  cmake  include  lib  share  src

Apparently, the setup scripts are missing. For testing purpose I also installed ROS dashing and here I get
me@sirius:/opt/ros/dashing$ ls
bin    include  local_setup.bash  local_setup.zsh     setup.bash  setup.zsh
cmake  lib      local_setup.sh    _order_packages.py  setup.sh    share

Did I do something wrong or is the install broken?

Try re-installing? The expected setup.* files are there for me. I don't know what would cause them to be missing.
sudo apt remove ros-eloquent-ros-base

sudo apt install ros-eloquent-ros-base

Thank you, indeed it seemed something went wrong during installation, after running
sudo apt remove ros-eloquent-* && sudo apt autoremove

and install again, the setup scripts are here!

A:

The setup files are installed by the package ros-eloquent-ros-workspace which is a dependency of ros-eloquent-ros-base If you don't have those files I suspect that you didn't successfully install what you thought that you installed. Please edit your question to show the full output of your apt commands so we can help you more.
Also useful would be to show the output of dpkg -l ros-eloquent-*
