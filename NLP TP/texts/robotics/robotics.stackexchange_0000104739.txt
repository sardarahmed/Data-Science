Q:

Servo Tester Only Works When Power and PWM are On Same Battery, Why?

I am having a problem when switching my servo power supply from the microcontroller to a separate battery pack. Fortunately, I was able to replicate the problem with two different cheapo servo testers, as shown below.
In my understanding:

The white (control PWM) cable works as a glorified relay - it tells the servo to give or cut power.
There is NO feedback to the servo tester from the servo potentiometer - that's an internal Servo thing to align angle based on PWM.

With those givens, where is my gap in understanding, why does the second diagram not work, and how do I make it work?

A:

The PWM signal has an undefined reference voltage level, because there is no common ground.
Short the negative poles of both battery packs.
