Q:

how to perform simple collision detection between models in gazebo

I am applying force to a rectangular model(created with spawn_model) that sends it colliding with another much denser model. What is the simplest way to access collision information? I was able to find the package collision_map for ros, but is there something else existing that I could use?

A:

You can add a contact sensor to your model (here's a tutorial), which will tell you the number of contact points, their location on the collision body, penetration depth, and reaction force/torque.
With Gazebo 1.4, you can also visualize contact in the gazebo client under the View menu, select Contacts. This will display each contact point as a blue sphere. You may also need to View->Transparent in case the contacts are blocked by visuals.
