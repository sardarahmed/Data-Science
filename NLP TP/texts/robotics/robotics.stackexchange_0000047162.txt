Q:

Package swig-wx not found in rxtools in Groovy

I have a package that depends on rxtools which in turn depends on swig-wx. My package will not compile in Groovy since it says that swig-wx does not exist. Running  rosdep check on my package results in "resource not found [swig-wx]", but ros-groovy-swig-wx is installed:
 $ rosdep resolve swig-wx
 #apt
 ros-groovy-swig-wx

Does this have to do with rxtools being deprecated in Groovy? Everything works fine in Fuerte.

The deprecation tag in the package.xml is only informational and has no functional effect.

We have a similar problem.
Here is the error log for compiling cob_bringup:
fxm@sony-fxm:~/projects/groovy/care-o-bot/cob_robots/cob_bringup$ make

Package swig-wx was not found in the pkg-config search path.
Perhaps you should add the directory containing `swig-wx.pc'
to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
No package 'swig-wx' found

  Look above for errors from rospack itself.  Aborting.  Please fix the
  broken dependency!

We were able to build and run our simulation after commenting the swig-wx related lines in /opt/ros/groovy/share/rxtools/package.xml.
However, manipulating read-only files can't be the final solution...
Any suggestions? Thank you!
