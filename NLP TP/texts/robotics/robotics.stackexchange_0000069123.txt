Q:

CMake error while executing catkin_make on Ubuntu 14.04 with ROS Jade

I am new to ROS and just getting it installed and configured using the method here: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment
I am a beginner and have minimal knowledge of these things, so it would be helpful if someone could present a simplified solution that would solve my problem. 
I can run everything correctly till I encounter the command catkin_make which produces the following error:

A:

Failing to find a solution, I decided to switch to my default python interpreter from the anaconda version I was using. That solved the problem.

Obviously, that would solve your problem, but it doesn't answer your question.
