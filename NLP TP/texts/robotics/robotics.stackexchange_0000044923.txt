Q:

Problem in my ROS answers profile

I cannot see the option "post a comment" in most of the places. For example, I posted a question few mins ago. I got two answers for that but I am unable to see the option post a comment below the answers. But I can see the comment option below my question. So, I would like to know how to solve this problem.?

A:

I guess the problem is that you do not have enough karma yet. I don't know why the comment function is restricted though. Probably to prevent spam.

yes, now the problem is solved. This is due to that I do not have enough karma. Now, I am able to do comment in all answers
