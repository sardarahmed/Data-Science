Q:

Odom does not move when roll-pitch-yaw is true when using ekf with imu data

I have an xsens mti-7 imu. I plan to progress by integrating wheel odometry first and then gps, respectively. However, before doing these, I'm trying to do ekf using only imu with roll-pitch-yaw angles and roll-pitch-yaw velocity. At this point, the problems I encounter and the questions I want to ask are: (E : Error  Q: Question)
E1: parameters 1 for ekf file:
 imu0_config: [false, false, false, true, true, true, false, false, false, true, true, true, false, false, false]
In this case, the odom frame makes slight movements and returns to the 0-0-0 position while the imu continues to move.
parameters 2 for ekf file :
 imu0_config: [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, true, true, true, false, false, false]
In this case, the odom frame moves with the imu, but when it remains stationary, its angle decreases with a slight acceleration. Although there is no deviation and shift for imu, this happens for ekf.
Q1: What is the reason of this? Why can't I use the angle values for roll-pitch-yaw.
Q2: Why does ekf keep scrolling for 2nd parameters?

Thank you for your reply @Tom Moore . Sorry for the late reply. I solved my issue and I use r_l with rtk-gps. I got very god result. My problem was xsens driver and I fixed it. I close this now.
