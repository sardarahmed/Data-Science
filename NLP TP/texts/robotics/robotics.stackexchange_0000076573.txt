First: please tell us why you want to build the kobuki packages from source. They have been released into Hydro, Indigo and Kinetic, so an apt-get install ros-indigo-kobuki-core should just work.

Second, apparently 沒有此一檔案或目錄 means "no such file or directory": do you have ecl installed? Please tell us which OS this is, how you installed ROS (which tutorial you followed) and how you setup your workspace (git clone .., rosdep, etc).

thank gvdhoorn for answering!!
I just followed this tutorial "http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot/Tutorials/indigo"，I have the troble at Step 2.1，I cant complete "1.3.2 Workspaces" because $catkin_make in ~/kobuki is failed
I have "ecl" file by git clone ,but I dont know it should be installed at where

I installed my ROS Indigo from http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu

re: turtlebot installation: have you run all the rosdep install --from-paths src -i -y? Did those not install ecl?

I meet the same problem.And I do not know how to solve it

A:

The ecl and kobuki both got a minor (synchronised) update that are still in the release pipeline. The problem you have here is you have the as yet unreleased kobuki sources, but have the old released ecl deb.
To solve it for now, just add ecl_core to your kobuki workspace...i.e.
cd ~/kobuki/src
wstool set ecl_core --git https://github.com/stonier/ecl_core --version=release/0.61-indigo-kinetic
wstool set ecl_navigation --git https://github.com/stonier/ecl_navigation --version=release/0.60-indigo-kinetic
wstool update ecl_core
wstool update ecl_navigation

This will be resolved by:

ecl_core 0.61.15, ecl_navigation 0.60.3, kobuki_core 0.6.5 and kobuki 0.6.8 on kinetic
ecl_core 0.61.15, ecl_navigation 0.60.3, kobuki_core 0.7.2 and kobuki 0.7.2 on kinetic

I had the same problem on a Jetson TK1 (Linux4Tegra -> Ubuntu 14.04) with ros-indigo. Here the kobuki_node is located in ~/catkin_ws/src/. Your soultion is nice but first I needed to wstool init ~/catkin_ws/src, then run wstool set and update commands. So make sure to have wstool init first :-)
