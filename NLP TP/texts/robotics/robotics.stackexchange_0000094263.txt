Q:

Question about "./devel/setup.bash" while sourcing setup.bash

Normally i source my environment with "source /devel/setup.bash" but i noticed in the tutorial that there is a period before the file location "source ./devel/setup.bash" Why is that period there?
p.s. This is my first post so im not sure where to really ask this question.

Edit:
This is the tutorial I was following: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/ExaminingPublisherSubscriber

# In your catkin workspace

$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ source ./devel/SETUP.BASH

Could you please link to "the tutorial" you refer to in your question text?
Perhaps even include a quote of the section you mention has the dot in it.

A . (dot) in a path refers to the "current directory".
It makes whatever path comes after the dot relative to the current directory.
So source ./devel/setup.bash sources the file setup.bash in a directory called devel that must be in the current directory.
However, all paths not starting with a / are relative to the current working directory, so the dot is not actually necessary here.

This is my first post so im not sure where to really ask this question.

In the end this is not really a ROS question (more a general Linux one), but given the context it's fine.
