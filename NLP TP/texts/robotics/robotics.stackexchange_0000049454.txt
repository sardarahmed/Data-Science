Q:

Is there any documentation available for rviz gui programming in python?

I have been trying to make a gui using rviz in python. The widgets I am creating have an rviz VisualizationFrame in them. There are gui elements there but there is no documentation anywhere that I could find, especially for the apis to these elements.
Anyone knows anyway I could solve this problem, apart from the many dir() calls I am currently making at each step to know all the callable functions?
I am not sure if this should be another question or can be included here, but is there any documentation for writing the config file for rviz(to load from)?

A:

Depending on what you are doing, rqt may be a good solution.
It is designed to handle both Python and C++ plugins. In Groovy, there is an rviz plugin available for rqt.

Thanks, joq.
I did consider rqt too but later stuck to pure rviz. But, the main thing I want here is a way for coding using rviz without any documentation.
