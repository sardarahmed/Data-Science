Q:

PCL EuclideanClusterExtraction Segfault in Fuerte

Hi there.
So I just moved from electric to fuerte and now I get a seg fault when using PCL (1.5). I am trying to cluster a point cloud to identify some objects (basic tabletop scenario), and I keep getting the same seg fault issue mentioned here:
http://dev.pointclouds.org/issues/673
Can anyone tell me how I can maybe upgrade to a newer PCL version where this bug was solved and use it with ROS fuerte? Thanks a lot.

A:

You could try the solution posted here: http://answers.ros.org/question/39946/upgrading-to-pcl-160-with-ros-fuerte-ubuntu-1204/?answer=39958#post-id-39958
This uses the unstable pcl16 ROS package. This package can coexist with the other PCL, and everything is just put into the pcl16 namespace.
