A:

No change about Stefan's short answer "no" - at least for the time being. There is a Simulator SDK now available in the latest Nao software, so it might be possible to code something up.
Other than that we had some good results with Webots, the Nao basically works out of the box there and the API mostly works like a drop-in replacement for the real robot. You can see some results in the second part of this video (from 0:30). At that time there was no official ROS support but a Python node was easy to integrate. By now I think that Webots directly supports ROS.
