Q:

Is there any graphical software package to make urdf file?

i want to make urdf file for the robot. the problem is, adding each constraints, geometry dimensions manually in a text file is a bit long process. isnt there any graphical tool(CAD software package) through which i can make my robot urdf?
i have already seen for solidworks add-in, but i want alternate solution.
thanks
