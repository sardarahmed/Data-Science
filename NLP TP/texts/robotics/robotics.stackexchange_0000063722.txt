Q:

map_server question

Hi,
I'm new to ROS and I just want a little background information about map_servers.
I was wondering how do I find a map. Do I have to use programs like GeoServer, MapServer, Google Maps, etc to obtain my map? I have also heard about the SLAM technique that can build a map but I am not really headed that way.  I am more focused on knowing if it is possible to input longitude/latitude values and possibly generate a map from that?
Thanks~

A:

map_server reads a single map (it is just a picture) and publish it on a topic or via a service.
what you need is

the slam_gmapping node to create a map on base of odometry and laserscan data
http://wiki.ros.org/gmapping
map_saver to save the map (served by gmapping)
map_server (to read and publish the saved map) and amcl (to localize your robot in the map)

you cant just create a map from longitude and latitude values. please read [1.1 image format] at http://wiki.ros.org/map_server
