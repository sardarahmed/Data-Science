Q:

Realsense plugin how to remove camera display screen from gazebo

(link to the screenshot )
There is no need for the camera display screen in gazebo as I am using Rviz, and it might be slowing down the simulation. How can we remove it?
System

ros melodic
gazebo version 9
rviz version 1.13.4

Edit:
Realsense plugin that I am using: https://github.com/SyrianSpock/realsense_gazebo_plugin

Hi @shanda4,
Try to be more specific with the packages and external ROS tools you are using for the next time please.
I assume you are using this package.
Take a look at this line, with it you will be able to disable visibility on Gazebo.
