Q:

Can't Compile basic Hello World Plugin

Hi I'm in the plug in tutorial (hello world) and when I try to compile I have the following error message.
In file included from /usr/include/c++/5/random:35:0,
                 from /usr/include/ignition/math2/ignition/math/Rand.hh:20,
                 from /usr/include/ignition/math2/ignition/math.hh:18,

                 from /home/blackviper/catkin_ws/src/gazebo_tutorials/src/simple_world_plugin.cpp:1:
/usr/include/c++/5/bits/c++0x_warning.h:32:2: error: #error This file requires compiler and library support for the ISO C++ 2011 standard. This support must be enabled with the -std=c++11 or -std=gnu++11 compiler options.
 #error This file requires compiler and library support \

And a lot more erros follow after that. Is this a sort of compatibility issue? I'm just starting out gazebo ros plugins. I'm using gazebo 7 btw.

A:

Yes, this is a compatibility issue with c++ 11.
To fix that, just add the following line to your CMakeLists.txt:
add_compile_options(-std=c++11)
