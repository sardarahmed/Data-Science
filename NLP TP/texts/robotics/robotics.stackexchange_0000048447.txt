Q:

chipkit max32 Lost sync with device, restarting

I am trying to run the rosserial tutorial "hello world" on a chipkit max 32. I can compile and upload to program to the max32. when I run
"rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyUSB1",
it returns
ROS Serial Python Node
Connected on /dev/ttyUSB1 at 57600 baud
then after several seconds it returns
[ERROR] Lost sync with device, restarting....
when I first start the python node the tx light blinks and every time the node tries to connect.
I have read other posts, but non of them seem to answer or fix the issue. The max 32 is almost identical to the arduino due but it runs on a pic controller.
I am using the latest mpide 23. I am not sure how to get it to connect and work.

A:

Groovy or Fuerte? The release into Groovy is currently broken (but will hopefully be fixed very soon, there is quite a bit of activity on github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial.
