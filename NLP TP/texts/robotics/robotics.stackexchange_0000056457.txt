Q:

how can i install phidgets_ros package in groovy?

Hi, i need to read the data from a 3M Model 800 RFID reader. From this page:http://wiki.ros.org/phidgets_ros/Tutorials/Testing%20a%20Phidget%20RFID%20Reader
it is stated that i would need RFIDscan.py from phidgets_ros package. But i can't find a proper package with RFIDscan.py in it. Please help.
I have tried the following packages, but no help:

http://foote-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/phidgets/
http://ua-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/arrg/ua_drivers/phidgets_py_api/
http://www.phidgets.com/docs/OS_-_Linux#Quick_Downloads
http://wiki.ros.org/phidgets_drivers

In http://wiki.ros.org/phidgets_ros, it is stated that i only need either phidgets_py_api and foote-ros-pkg/phidgets/phidgetspp_c_api, how can i get them?

will this helps? http://code.google.com/p/ua-ros-pkg/source/browse/trunk/config/groovy-deb.rosinstall?spec=svn1657&r=1657

A:

I think you're trying to use the wrong driver. 3M is a different vendor than Phidgets, so there's probably no sense in trying to make the phidgets_ros driver work. Also, that would probably mean some work, since that package is ancient (no updates since 2010).
One thing I can tell you is that phidgets_drivers has nothing to do with phidgets_ros. It currently only provides drivers for the Phidgets IMU and IR sensors, not the RFID reader.
But, as I said, you're trying to use the wrong driver anyway.

i have been worrying about that, just trying my luck, cause that is the only package related to RFID so far. and i had difficulties getting the device recognized. Just checking, if i manage to get the device by any chance, would i be able to read the tags without any driver (as in 3M is shown as ttyUSB)? cause i am using a serial232 to usb converter, which i think ros is able to recognise, and read the data via the converter?
Comment by Martin Günther on 2014-01-08:
If you get ttyUSB running, it shouldn't be too hard to write your own ROS driver (i.e., a ROS node that reads from ttyUSB, converts that data into some ROS message format and publishes it). There are probably good examples of ROS nodes that already do that.
