Q:

Is it possible to have rosdep set-up a ubuntu ppa on your system as part of dependency validation?

Is it possible to have rosdep set-up a ubuntu ppa on your system as part of dependency validation?
Of course, if you have already added the PPA to your system, you can put a dependency on that package, but is there a way for rosdep to also add that ppa to your system as well?
(On newer ubuntu versions this is done by "sudo add-apt-repository ppa:user/ppa-name")

A:

As tfoote explained in https://answers.ros.org/question/70210/does-rosdep-support-installing-dependencies-from-ppas/ , this will never be possible officially and automatically (and I'm glad for it!).
The best option is to ask users of your package to add the PPA manually, and then you can even have a rosdep rule for your dependency.
