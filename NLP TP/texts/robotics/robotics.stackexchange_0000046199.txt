Q:

Planning scene (Get or Set)

Hello,
I don't understand why there are examples with this definition:
ros::ServiceClient get_planning_scene_client = nh.serviceClient<arm_navigation_msgs::GetPlanningScene>(SET_PLANNING_SCENE_DIFF_NAME);

GetPlanningScene with a SET_PLANNING_SCENE_DIFF_NAME?
While in other more advanced implementation, I have seen:
get_planning_scene = nh.serviceClient<arm_navigation_msgs::GetPlanningScene>(GET_PLANNING_SCENE_NAME);
set_planning_scene_diff = nh.serviceClient<arm_navigation_msgs::SetPlanningSceneDiff>(SET_PLANNING_SCENE_DIFF_NAME);

And if you want a snapshot of scene you use get, and if want change the scene you use set.
am I wrong? Could anybody explain to me in detail this functions?
Regards

A:

The latter version you found is correct. Maybe the first one has the define pointing to the correct service name and the variable is just named badly or is doesn't work.
You understanding of the functionality seems also right.
