A:

Open a terminal, navigate to build directory, something like that: /home/user/code/gazebo-1.4/build
Run the command: make uninstall (with required privileges like sudo).
I hope it helps.

Somehow this never did anything for me.  I think it said no target called uninstall or something like that.

You must run the command in the folder that you ran the command cmake and make. It works for me.

so then i think there isn't any unique answer!

Daniel is right. You should conserve the build/ directory from where you ran the "make install" in order to be able to uninstall files. Uninstall procedure needs to know some info coming from the moment of installation (like destination), so a clean clone of the repo it is not going to help.
