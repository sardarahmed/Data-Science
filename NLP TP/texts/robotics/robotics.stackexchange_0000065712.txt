Q:

Installing ROS Indigo by source catkin building error

Hello,
IÂ´m following this tutorial to install ROS Indigo by Source on Ubuntu 14.04: http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Source
Everything worked until that point: 2.1.3 Building the catkin Workspace
Using this command to build catkin Workspace:
$ ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
occurs in the following error message:
==> Processing catkin package: 'catkin'
==> cmake /home/ROSproject/ros_catkin_ws/src/catkin -DCATKIN_DEVEL_PREFIX=/home/ROSproject/ros_catkin_ws/devel_isolated/catkin -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/ROSproject/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G Unix Makefiles in '/home/ROSproject/ros_catkin_ws/build_isolated/catkin'

Unhandled exception of type 'OSError':

Thanks for help in advance!

A:

Judging from the error, it looks like you may not have cmake installed? Did you successfully run the rosdep install ... step in the tutorial?
A work around will be to install cmake, and since you're on Ubuntu you can just do sudo apt-get install cmake, but if cmake was not installed, then it is likely other things which need to be installed are not.
Also, if you were not aware, there are binary packages for Indigo on 14.04 on i386 and amd64, so unless you have a specific reason for compiling from source, you can just sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-... for your packages.

On behalf of @NRW_ROS: You were right. There were some deps missing from rosdep install ... . I forced the installation and it works now. Thanks a lot!
