Q:

Install single package from git

Hey,
Is it possible, using rosws, to install just a single package from a repository? For example I need just the map_server package form the navigation repository. Right now I clone the entire navigation repository, move the map server out of there and remove the navigation repository again, but there must be a better way?
Best regards,
Hans

A:

You can only fetch full source repositories from DVCS like GIT / HG (in a reasonable way). But generally you might want to consider to download the latest released version of a package. You can do this using the rosinstall_generator (http://wiki.ros.org/rosinstall_generator).
