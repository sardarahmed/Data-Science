Q:

Is there something like a node supervisor "class" available?

I want a process to control my nodes, starting
pausing, restarting, checking if it still is operational etc.
Like a library you add to the node doing that with services and
is able to set a value to disable the node from doing processing(by class::running() / class::paused()).
Is there something standardized like that already out there?
Regards,
Christian

I am going to implement something on my own, thanks everybody for your answer.

I asked something similar (http://answers.ros.org/question/213509/is-there-a-way-to-set-the-respawn-property-at-runtime/) and got so far no answer. So I guess there is nothing like that. To get an overview over your nodes, you could have a look at http://wiki.ros.org/node_manager_fkie

Thanks, the software is awesome, not directly what I need but goes into the direction.

See also #q360115, the answer there is to use ros1_lifecycle https://github.com/boschresearch/ros1_lifecycle (or my heavily modified version https://github.com/lucasw/ros1_lifecycle)

A:

This is probably not the answer you're looking for, but in ROS 2 (think long term), it's very likely that nodes will have an (optional) standard lifecycle. See the proposed node lifecycle design document for more details. I believe the proposal addresses what you're asking for.
For ROS 1, i.e. now, there is no general out-of-the-box solution that I know of. I know some projects like ros_control implement project-specific solutions. You might want to implement a custom solution.

Yep currently not, ROS 2.0 is, not there yet. But the ros control is something I want to take a closer look at, but I guess it is not the thing I want right now. Currently its about getting status information and starting, pausing, restarting for all nodes not just hardware.Or I don't get the point?
