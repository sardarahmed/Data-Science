Q:

How to set yaw offset in robot_pose_ekf/robot_localization?

Hi,
I am planning to use odmetry x,y, yaw as well as imu yaw data in robot_pose_ekf package. Since the imu will start at some yaw value relative to magnetic north? Do I have to programatically set that yaw value as 0 and pass the relative yaw to robot_pose_ekf or will it set the yaw offset itself. Thanks

Is this question for robot_pose_ekf of robot_localization?

Hi, I I'm trying both packages and I think I'm going to use robot_pose_ekf instead as it just takes in euler angles as input for imu. But I i think you should be able to tell the package that when the program starts, assume its current yaw is 0 degrees/rads so every reading is relative to that.

A:

For robot_localization, you can set the IMU to relative mode if you want to to start at 0.
