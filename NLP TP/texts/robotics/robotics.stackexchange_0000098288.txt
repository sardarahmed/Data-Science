Q:

ValueError: PyCapsule_GetPointer called with incorrect name

I installed ROS noetic for ubuntu 20.04 following the steps presented on the next page: http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu, but the rqt command is not working for me and it always shows the following error
-->rqt
Traceback (most recent call last):

I'm curious how this happened. Perhaps you had previously installed PyQt5 and PyQt5-sip with pip3, and then the instructions installed an older version PyQt5 and PyQt5-sip via apt. If this is the case, it might make sense to improve the Noetic install instructions somehow.

Can the Noetic install instructions be improved?

Thank you, this solved my problem too.
pip3 uninstall PyQt5
pip3 uninstall PyQt5-sip
