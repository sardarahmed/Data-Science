Q:

Is depth registered image bigger than depth image in size?

Is depth registered image bigger than depth image in size? I can't seem to find the answer in the internet.
I needed to know this for optimization in wireless image streaming. When I stream two openni2 cameras in one wifi network, sometimes it just drop frames. I was thinking if depth registered is larger than depth image, maybe I can just register the image in the base station, thus save bandwidth.

Hi there!
According to the headers of /camera/depth/image:
$ rostopic echo -n 1 /camera/depth/image | head
header: 
  seq: 304
  stamp: 
    secs: 1406254046
    nsecs: 731604330
  frame_id: /camera_depth_optical_frame
height: 480
width: 640
encoding: 32FC1
is_bigendian: 0

and the headers of /camera/depth_registered/image_raw:
$ rostopic echo -n 1 /camera/depth_registered/image_raw | head
header: 
  seq: 0
  stamp: 
    secs: 1406254097
    nsecs: 573718779
  frame_id: /camera_depth_optical_frame
height: 480
width: 640
encoding: 32FC1
is_bigendian: 0

They both are the same size: width, height and encoding are the same.

how did you get that ? when I launch the command I get nothing !
Comment by Martin Peris on 2014-07-25:
you should be running "roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch" or "roslaunch openni2_launch openni2.launch" (depending on your RGBD sensor) on a separate terminal.
