Q:

Is Lego Mindstorm a good start?

I would like to start experimenting with Robots. Is Lego Mindstorm a good start? Should I consider other platforms?

A:

If you want to focus on the software only, then Mindstorms are a great start. Because you have a fixed platform and do not need to care a lot about the hardware. And if you want to mount some homebrew sensors this is also possible. The mindstorms itself are well documented and the hardware/software interfaces are relatively easy.
You can do some stuff by using the Lego-NXT Programming IDE or even write your own programms and let them run directly. At the end you can even upload your own OS to the Arm7 and do whatever you want. Just do not forget the Samba (see NXT Hardware SDK) If you have more question to the Lego-Robots, there is SE for this, too. https://bricks.stackexchange.com/ 
Instead of using Lego you can think about buying some Arduino/Raspy based robots, where you might need to get your hands more dirty (from hardware point of view)
