Q:

Ros PLUGINLIB_EXPORT_CLASS error

Error Message:
[ERROR] [1529093425.848827730]: Exception while loading planner 'ompl_interface/OMPLPlanner': Failed to load library /opt/ros/kinetic/lib/libmoveit_ompl_planner_plugin.so. Make sure that you are calling the PLUGINLIB_EXPORT_CLASS macro in the library code, and that names are consistent between this macro and your XML. Error string: Could not load library (Poco exception = libmoveit_planning_interface.so.0.9.12: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory)
Available plugins: ompl_interface/OMPLPlanner

I believe my macro matches my xml file:
Macro:
#include <pluginlib/class_list_macros.h>
PLUGINLIB_EXPORT_CLASS(vs060A1_AV6_NNN_NNN_manipulator_kinematics::IKFastKinematicsPlugin, kinematics::KinematicsBase);

XML:
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='ASCII'?>
<library path="lib/libvs060A1_AV6_NNN_NNN_kinematics_lib">
  <class name="vs060A1_AV6_NNN_NNN_manipulator_kinematics/IKFastKinematicsPlugin" type="vs060A1_AV6_NNN_NNN_manipulator_kinematics::IKFastKinematicsPlugin" base_class_type="kinematics::KinematicsBase">
    <description>IKFast61 plugin for closed-form kinematics</description>
  </class>
</library>

I also find it very weird that it then lists it as an available plugin at the bottom of the error message.
Im on kinetic 16.04

A:

Exception while loading planner 'ompl_interface/OMPLPlanner': Failed to load library /opt/ros/kinetic/lib/libmoveit_ompl_planner_plugin.so. [..]

The issue is not with the kinematics plugin you mention, but with MoveIt:

Error string: Could not load library (Poco exception = libmoveit_planning_interface.so.0.9.12: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory)

Please see #q294137 for some background.
In your case: did you perform any partial upgrades of your .deb packages or do you have MoveIt compiled from sources? If yes to either of those: do a full upgrade and/or recompile your workspace.
If you compiled the kinematics plugin from source: clean out your devel and build spaces and recompile. That is necessary in any case, but it probably won't influence the OMPL loading error.
