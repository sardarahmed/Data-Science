Q:

building a teleoperated robot

Hello!
I would like to build a low-cost robot, preferably from the NXT kit or cheaper. I would like to run ROS on my workstation such that it controls the robot by sending commands to some kind of wireless interface on the robot and receiving sensory data - this way I don't have to buy a separate netbook or something to install into the robot and at the same time, run some pretty CPU-intensive algorithms. I was wondering if such a setup is possible.
If the above is possible, is there any reason why I should get a turtlebot instead of an NXT if both offer driving capabilities and the "robot brains" does not have to be physically connected to the machine?
Thanks!

A:

You can control NXT by bluetooth. You can use stack http://www.ros.org/wiki/Robots/NXT with standart firmware NXT or own stack like http://code.google.com/p/lego-nxt-car-like/ with LeJos firware
