Q:

How to insert Gazebo plugin in an existing World Model?

OK, from the tutorials I learned how to make a Gazebo Plugin. I successfully made the plugin and got the '.so' file.
I have an existing ROS package, which has world files and a lib folder with many '.so' files. How do I add my plugin to this existing package?
I tried simple copying 'my_model.so' file in lib folder and modifying the respective <plugin ... filename="my_model.so".. > command.
But it did not seems to work?

A:

If done correctly, here is an example I have used before.
You can then include empty_world.launch in a launch file and overwrite the world name like this.
