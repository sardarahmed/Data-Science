A:

After installing ros, all you should have to execute is:
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-gscam

thanks but after I do that, i still get these errors
when I run rosmake gscam, it gives me an error saying "mkdir: cannot create directory 'build': Permission denied.
also if I try to run the tutorial here http://wiki.ros.org/face_recognition (under number 4)
I can't roscd to gscam/bin since it doesn't, also running the second command gives me an error

You don't need to build it if you install it via debian package like above.

Additionally, that tutorial is out of date and relates to an older version of gscam.

thank for your help, appreciate it.
Looking at this tutorial http://wiki.ros.org/face_recognition, (scroll down to 4 - Tutorial)  it says to do
roscd gscam/bin (but I don't have a bin folder!) and
if I try to do
rosrun gscam gscam /gscam/image_raw:=/camera/image_raw
then it gies me an error saying that GSCAM_CONFIG environment variable is not set and 'gscam_config' is not set

should I be worred that I don't have a bin folder though?  none of the commands i find to run gscam work for me

First, the new version of gscam conforms the proper ROS camera API (http://wiki.ros.org/camera_drivers) Second, as the error says, you need to either set the $GSCAM_CONFIG environment variable or the gscam_config ROS parameter to use the program. You can see examples here ( http://github.com/ros-drivers/gscam/tree/master/examples )
Comment by jbohren on 2013-10-16:
The executables that would be built into a package's "bin" folder in a rosbuild-based package, when installed, are placed in /opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO/lib/package-name/. The gscam executable, for example, should be in /opt/ros/hydro/lib/gscam/gscam You can examine the files installed by any package in the synaptic package manager.
