Q:

urdf beginner error

In the first tutorial, for 'creating a urdf file'. On part 2 on creating the tree structure. I saved the xml as advised. Then 'rosmake urdf_parser' it compiles without any errors. Then after when i run the 'rosrun urdf_parser check_urdf my_urdf.xml' line.
the following error occurs :
Could not find the 'robot' element in the xml file
ERROR: Model Parsing the xml failed
If anyone has any ideas for what i could do, i would very grateful.
