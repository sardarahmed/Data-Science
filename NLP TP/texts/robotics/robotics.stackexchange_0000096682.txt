Q:

ROS wiki password reset broken?

When I use the Lost Password page and enter my username and email, I get an error "{u'<redacted@example.com>': (450, '4.1.8 <moin@ros.osuosl.org>: Sender address rejected: Domain not found')}" (redaction my own).
How do I reset my password?

Strange, we've been having some issues lately with the wiki. Can you PM your e-mail address so we can take a look?

A:

The from address of the server was misconfigured. It should be able to send the emails now.
