Q:

Problem installing urg_node on ros hydro

Hi,
I am getting this error when installing the urg_node drivers for hokuyo on Ubuntu 12.04 ROS hydro.
What I did--

I have a catkin_ws workspace with build, src and devel folders
cd into src folder
git clone from the urg_node github page
cd into catkin_ws folder
run the command $ catkin_make

The error I got is this
    -- +++ processing catkin package: 'urg_node'
-- ==> add_subdirectory(urg_node)
CMake Error at /opt/ros/hydro/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:72 (find_package):
  Could not find a configuration file for package urg_c.

  Set urg_c_DIR to the directory containing a CMake configuration file for
  urg_c.  The file will have one of the following names:

    urg_cConfig.cmake
    urg_c-config.cmake

Call Stack (most recent call first):
  urg_node/CMakeLists.txt:7 (find_package)

-- Using these message generators: gencpp;genlisp;genpy
-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
make: *** [cmake_check_build_system] Error 1
Invoking "make cmake_check_build_system" failed

How to resolve this error. The sensor for which I am trying to install the urg_node is hokuyo UHG-08LX.
Like groovy , is there no sudo apt-get command to install the urg_node laser drivers for Hydro?
Thanks

A:

Why not install from debs?
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-urg-node

I have one more doubt, is there no urg_node drivers for ROS fuerte??

According to the wiki page, there isn't a released version for Fuerte: http://wiki.ros.org/urg_node .
