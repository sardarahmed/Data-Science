Q:

Does robot_localization pakcage requires inter-sensor extrinisic parameteres to be known?

Hi
Just two short question

Does this package requires inter-sensor extrinisic parameteres to be known?

Does it requires synchronous sensors? My camera works at 20fps but my IMU works at 100

A:

The state estimation nodes have no concept of sensor parameters. It also has no concept of inter-sensor relationships. It assumes that your sensor outputs one of the supported message types, and that those sensor messages conform to ROS standards.
No. One of the key features of the package is that it can support an arbitrary number of sensors with varying frequencies.

Thanks for explanations. That's really cool. Just one more question:
Can it also handle the case of reltive scale measurements? I use a mono camera as a pose estimator but translational parts of output message don't have absolute scale
Comment by Tom Moore on 2017-09-11:
So every pose message from the sensor is a relative pose to some previous frame? Sadly, this is not yet supported. However, you can (a) change the pose estimator node to produce a velocity instead, or (b) let the pose estimator integrate those relative measurements, and feed that to the filter.
