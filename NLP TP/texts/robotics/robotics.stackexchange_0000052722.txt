Q:

a very simple question about Control Input in SLAM

I recently began to learn SLAM. I read about the materials written by Hough Durrant Whyte, in which it states that the Control Input U is assumed already known. I wonder where the Control Input U come from.
The Complete statement is as following:
The definition of SLAM problem
No information about m is provided
The initial location x0 is assumed known (the origin)
The sequence of control actions Uk is given
Build the Map m
At the same time inferences about the locations of the vehicle Xk
Recognise that the two inference problems are coupled.
Isn't the Control Input U is one output of the Kalman filter? If not, where does it come from?

This is not ROS question. You should ask in other forums about questions not related to ROS.

A:

Hi there, the control input U is the action that you input to the system. If you have a linearized equation of your system then the state space representation of it would be something like:

In that case, u(t) is the input to your system. So if you have a car, it'll be the motor's speed.
You can read more about state space here:

I posted this question many years ago, and today I got the reply. Although I've known the answer, I still want to say: thanks very much!
