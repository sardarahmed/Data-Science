Isn't there a confusion between non-holonomic and holonomic? I always struggle to tell them apart, but I assumed a differential drive robot is holonomic (likely a wheelchair) and a bicycle or car are non-holonmic?

A:

Short answer: yes.
Long answer: yes, the demos are the turtlebot3, which is a differential drive robot. I assume that your robot wheel-chair is also differential drive? It would be a little strange if it were ackermann, but that would be pretty cool.
