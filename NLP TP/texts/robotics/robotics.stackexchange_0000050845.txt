Q:

Mapping and obstacle avoidance with Hokuyo Laser Scanner

Hello everyone!
I would like to use my Hokuyo Laser Scanner to implement mapping and obstacle avoidance capabilities. Can anybody guide me with the steps?
Currently, I am only able to view the laser scan in RVIZ after going through the Hokuyo_node tutorials.

You can use the navigation stack with gmapping or hector for SLAM.
