Q:

Is it possible to launch rviz with a fixed frame size?

Hi all,
I have searched but I can not find any clue to launch rviz with a fixed frame size. For example, I want to set the visualization region to be 1080*900 pixel? How to do that?
I am using Fuerte on Ubuntu*64.

Though not an ideal solution, here's how I have dealt with this. After resizing the window and setting the view, save the RViz config. Load the RViz config during the next launch. You can manually tweak numbers inside the saved .rviz file too.

A:

rviz should remember the last window size/position it was launched with (at least it did when I just tested this). Another option is the use of the wmctrl Unix/Linux command line tool. With this, you can easily alter window sizes and positions of all windows in your X Window manager.
Using
 wmctrl -l

you can get a list of all managed windows. Using one of the names retrieved (it helps when it is unique ;) ) you can then specifiy a window position and size for example like this:
wmctrl -r 'ocs_default.rviz - RViz' -e '0,1920,0,1080,900'

Can this method specify the size of the visual region of rviz, since I have no interest in the control panel.

Indirectly, by figuring out how much "overhead" the borders are (in pixels) and using that information to resize using wmctrl accordingly. I know it´s not the perfect solution, but a relatively easy one that doesn´t require changing rviz code and recompiling.
