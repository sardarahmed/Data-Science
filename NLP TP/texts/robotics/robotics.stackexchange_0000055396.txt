Q:

Embedded (non-ROS) -> ROS over Ethernet

I have an embedded device not supported by ROS but which runs a Linux variant.
I want to connect this to my ROS Groovy machine via Ethernet but not sure on the best approach - however I was thinking TCP would be ideal.
How should i connect these devices and are there any examples from which I can work from?
I.e. How can i communicate between them over Ethernet?
Cheers.

A:

Started with ROSSerial but ran into problems as this was not designed for 32-bit systems.
Solution was to communicate using Python sockets:

The embedded device was setup as a server, and the ROS machine connects as a client to send commands to the embedded device.
