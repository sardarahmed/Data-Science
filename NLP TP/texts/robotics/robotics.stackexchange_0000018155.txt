Q:

extended kalman filters, linearization of output

Say, we are dealing with an odometric localization problem.
In the below example, $(x_k, y_k), (x_l, y_l)$ are cartesian coordinates of the sensor and the landmark respectively. Then the output equation is:
$z_k = atan2(y_k − y_l, x_k − x_l)$
Is the following the correct way of linearizing this equation?
$H_{k+1} = (\frac{−(\hat{y}_{k+1|k} − y_l)}{(\hat{x}_{k+1|k} − x_l)^2 + (\hat{y}_{k+1|k} − y_l)^2}  \frac{(\hat{x}_{k+1|k} − x_l)}{(\hat{x}_{k+1|k} − x_l)^2 + (\hat{y}_{k+1|k} − y_l)^2})$
Can you provide other resources and examples to practice?

Hi and welcome to stack exchange: robotics edition.
Yes. Your derivation for the landmark update Jacobian is correct. If you are doing SLAM with respect to the landmarks, don't forget to form the Jacobian with respect to all state variables, including the Robot's $x$ and $y$ points.
What I mean is, if the state of the system is $x_r,y_r,x_t,y_t$, and the measurement equation is as shown, then the Jacbian of the measurement equation $H$ is $[\frac{\partial h}{\partial x_r},\frac{\partial h}{\partial y_r}, \frac{\partial h}{\partial x_t},\frac{\partial h}{\partial y_t}]$
But ... (spoiler alert)

 surprise, surprise, \frac{\partial h}{\partial x_r},\frac{\partial h}{\partial y_r} is the same as those two entries with a sign flip as you'll see.

Some complaints about the question center around the notation and steps. You are very clearly asking if you have formed the correct Jacobian matrix for the bearing measurement equation. But, that's not clear to everyone, so you may want to write a more thorough background of what you're trying to do, and what notation you're using. (If for no other reason than Google will pick it up better).

If you want to practice forming Jacobian matrices, I suggest you choose  $n$ functions of $m$ variables, and practice taking partial derivatives. Use Wolfram Alpha to check the partials, and use the structure of a Jacobian from Wikipedia to check the composition of the matrix. Robotics-specific examples are limited to $h$=range, bearing, or position estimates. So, $h=||r-l||$, the $atan2$ example from above, and $h=(x_l,y_l)$ are the best you can do.  You can always form the measurement function $h$ as being to two or more landmarks simultaneously, as well.  This is not a good discussion for Robotics Stack Exchange, however.
