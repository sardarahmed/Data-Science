Q:

Error installing using_markers pkg

Hi guys, I am having installing packages around. Now I am following the tutorial Markers: Sending Basic Shapes (C++). I have the kinetic version of ROS which I have installed using apt-get on Ubuntu 16.04.
The problem comes when I execute the command catkin_make in order to build my new code. I get the following error:
CMake Warning at /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:76 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "visualisation_msgs" with any of the following names:

    visualisation_msgsConfig.cmake
    visualisation_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "visualisation_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "visualisation_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "visualisation_msgs" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.

-- Could not find the required component 'visualisation_msgs'. The following CMake error indicates that you either need to install the package with the same name or change your environment so that it can be found.

See also "/home/lucadg/catkin_ws/build/CMakeFiles/CMakeError.log".
Invoking "cmake" failed

Then I've tried to install the package visualisation_msgs as it is always available for kinetic and I still get the same error.
Thank you in advance for your help

Have you tried removing your build and devel folder and running catkin_make again? If it still fails, what is the output of rospack find visualization_msgs?

A:

Found it, the problem was a spelling mistake in the CMakeLists.txt of using_markers package.
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
  roscpp
  visualisation_msgs
)

It should be:
 find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
 roscpp
 visualization_msgs
 )

Initially was visualisation_msgs but the package it is called visualization-msgs
