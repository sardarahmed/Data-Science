Q:

How does a two-gear pull-back car toy work?

This is not a robotics question, but this Stack Exchange is the closest I could find to mechanical engineering. Please refer me to a better place to ask this, if one exists. Hopefully someone might just know this.

I got a pull-back car for my boy at McDonalds, and it has two gears. It starts slow, then speeds up after about two seconds. It's impressive to me, especially given the inherent cheapness of toys sold by McDonalds. It feels solidly built as well.
I couldn't find anything related to this concept. The wiki on pullback motors does not include any information on multiple gears.
Any ideas on how this works? 

A:

These types of low cost 2 speed transmission almost always are based on some gyroscopic effect on a simple gear train.
You are right, even knowing how they work, I could not find any described on the internet. Very surprising.
Look at this image;

Imagine as the speed increases, the lower block will rise.
So now you have to imagine it attached to a shifting lever (or gears themselves).

Combine the 2 concepts and  you have automatic 2 speed gear shifting. 
In practicality, it is usually less costly to use infinitely variable transmissions for the same effect on anything of decent size / value.
