Q:

map_saver for different map topics

Hey there.
I am trying to figure out how is possible to use
rosrun map_server map_saver -f name_of_map

in order to save maps simultaneously made by different gmapping nodes, that is, how to save maps with another topic name than /map.
For instance, /map_1 and /map_2 are being created and the point is to save both maps in different files.
I was watching map_server code in GitHub and found this test launcher:
 <launch>

  <node name="map_server" pkg="map_server" type="map_server" args="$(find map_server)/test/testmap.yaml"/>

  <test test-name="map_server_test" pkg="map_server" type="rtest"/>

</launch>

But I don't know how to modify it in order to accomplish that.
Could you give me a hand?

A:

I found the solution:
rosrun map_server map_saver map:=/map_2 -f name_of_map

Thanks, to add full command looks like this (in my case):
rosrun map_server map_saver --occ 100 --free 10 -f my_map map:=/move_base/global_costmap/costmap
