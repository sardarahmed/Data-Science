A:

Boost1.49.0 is listed as a dependency for gazebo in the quantal version. Be sure you are not running a precise distribution using a quantal sources.list in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/.
If that is not the reason, some extra information is would be good:

Ubuntu distribution being used and architecture (32/64bits)
Clean installation or upgrading?
Output from

grep osrfoundation
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/*.list
