Q:

Husky, turtlebot like simulators for ROS-lunar?

I have been using ROS-Lunar, I tried Husky and Turtlebot but they both arent supported by Lunar.
Are there any similar simulators that I can get to use for my gazebo?
If not, is there any way by which I can use husky for lunar, or any other indigo supported package for lunar?

A:

Have you tried downloading and compiling the source? You may also have to install the dependencies from the source too https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot_simulator/issues/67.

Yes, it becomes really messy because then I have to set all the environment variables, the launch files, the worlds etc and in the end I get stuck. I read somewhere that its not advisable to try to use packages meant for indigo into lunar or any other distro for that matter.

That may be the only way for you to do this with that particular package.
