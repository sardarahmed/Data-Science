Q:

Jacobian for Inverse Kinematics with quaternion of end effector

Quaternion has four parameters. Calculating Jacobian for inverse-kinematics, 3 positions and four quaternion parameters make Jacobian $7\times7$ instead of $6\times6$. How to reduce Jacobian to $6\times6$ when using quaternion?

A:

Jacobian does not have to be a square matrix. It is a matrix that maps joint velocities $\dot{q}$ to tool velocities $\dot{x}$ so its size is whatever fits with the two velocity vectors.
In your case, since the tool velocity vector is $\dot{x} \in \mathbf{R}^7$, a Jacobian will be $J \in \mathbf{R}^{7 \times 6}$, when your robot has $6$ DOFs.
