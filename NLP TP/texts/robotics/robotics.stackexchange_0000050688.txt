Q:

closed-loop inverse kinematics

Hi ROS fans..
I have made a node that controls ax-12 servo motors by using inverse kinematics algorithm. The result is good.. but I want to improve the performance better. So I Have to use closed-loop inverse kinematics algorithm.. I never try it.. and I want to try it now..
Are there ROS packages which I can learn about closed-loop inverse kinematics ?
Thanks.. I hope someone can help me :)

for closed-form inverse kinematics, you can use openrave's ikfast compiler. Openrave has wrapper for ROS

A:

You can try following this tutorial to generate an IKFast solution, as suggested by @cagatay.  You'll need to create a DAE file from your robot's URDF, and will need to install the openrave software.  But, after that, the steps are fairly straightforward.
Note that IKFast is pretty good, but is unable to find solutions for all robot geometries.  In particular, it only handles robots with 6 joints; additional joint beyond that must be specified as "free joints".  It can handle prismatic joints, but with a few limitations.
Good luck!
