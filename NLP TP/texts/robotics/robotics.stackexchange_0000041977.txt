ROS Installation on Red Hat: No rule to make target 'lib64/lib64/libboost_thread-mt"

Hi everyone,
I am in the process of installing ROS (from Willow Garage) on my
machine which currently runs Red Hat Release 6.2 (Santiago). When I
run "make" inside root/build directory of Ros, I get an error that
says "No rule to make target
'usr/lib64/lib64/libboost_thread-mt.so.5'. It's funny that it is
looking for libboost in lib64/lib64, instead of just in the lib64
directory. Does anyone have any thoughts  on where the path to
libboost is set incorrectly?
Thanks,
Grace Lee
