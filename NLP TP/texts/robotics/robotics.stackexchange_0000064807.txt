Please post any errors you received building rosaria to https://github.com/amor-ros-pkg/rosaria/issues, or you can send them to me.

After cloning from git then building, it will be in your catkin workspace. You can run it from there with rosrun.

A:

Hey thanks for the help. btw i solved the problem. i explicitly added my catkin workspace path to bashrc even after sourcing setup.bash in ~/catkin_ws/devel . i had an error even after that. i copied the binary to ~/catkin_ws/install/share and thereafter there was not any problem. this was unusual. but i dont know how it solved the problem.
