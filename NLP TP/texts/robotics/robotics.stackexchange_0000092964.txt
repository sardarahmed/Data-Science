Q:

Couldn't find executable named Keyboard below /home/robot-raspi/catkin_ws/src/mobile_robot_pkg

I am using the book Robot Operating System ROS For Absolute Begginers.
I am trying to make the book robot but I have an error using the command:
rosrun mobile_robot_pkg Keyboard robot_bt_driver.py

Error:
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named Keyboard below / home / pablo-rdgz / catkin_ws / src / mobile_robot_pkg

Can you please make your question readable by removing the boilerplate comments from your CMakeLists.txt file and using preformatted text (101010) button. Also, some more context is probably going to be needed as well

A:

The syntax for rosrun is
rosrun <package-name> <executable>

It looks like, in your case, <package-name> is mobile_robot_pkg and <executable> is robot_bt_driver.py. So, the command should be
rosrun mobile_robot_pkg robot_bt_driver.py

I'm not sure what Keyboard is.

Also, make sure that your node is executable by running
chmod +x robot_bt_driver.py

chmod: cannot access 'robot_bt_driver.py': No such file or directory

You have to run that command from the directory in which that file is located
