Q:

Using ROS for a Delta Robot

At the moment i'm involved in a project where we are trying to built a
Delta Robot. So i start reading the docs and tutorials and i've a few
questions.
The kinematic model for the Delta Robot has already been developed; a
inverse and forward model is available to me.
I'm trying to find out if i'm heading the right way. I've found a page
on the ROS wiki named 'Running arm navigation on non-PR2 arm'
[http://www.ros.org/wiki/arm_navigation/Tutorials/Running%20arm%20navigation%20on%20non-PR2%20arm]
Is it right to say that if i implement the functions mentioned in the
article above that i can have a working Delta Robot (kinematic model,
that is)? Is there perhaps a better way?
We are probably going with the Trio Whistle from ElmoMC for controlling
the motors. I think it's best to start with developing the kinematic
model and then implement packages for communication with the controller.
Any tips or ideas on this? I've already found a package with CANopen
support for the Elmo Harmonica
[http://www.ros.org/wiki/cob_canopen_motor] (basically the same as a
whistler)...

A:

Yes, the URDF does not support parallel robots.
There are two options for you here:
(a) add URDF support for parallel robots and give us a patch we can then integrate. This is going to be a little complicated though.
(b) Abstract your robot in a clever way so you can workaround these limitations. e.g. for motion planning, it seems like you could essentially plan in the space of your end-effector platform and use inverse kinematics to project that down into the joint space of the individual arms that connect the base to the platform. I found a document online that details the IK for a Delta robot - https://docs.google.com/View?id=dfpxhpz9_92hm8h7chc
Once you have a working IK, I/our group can help you more with getting motion planning working on this.
BTW, just looking at some videos online of what this robot can do, it's a very cool robot :-)
