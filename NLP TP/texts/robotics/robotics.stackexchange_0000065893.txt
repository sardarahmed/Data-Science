Q:

Which parameter I should use to check for collision detection

Hi,
I am using the fcl library to detect collisions between two objects
I used the following code:
    bool flag = false ; 
    collisionObject co0(Shpere0, tf0);
    std::vector<CollisionObject*> boxes;
    generateBoxesFromOctomap(boxes, *st_tree);

           for(size_t i = 0; i < boxes.size(); ++i)
           {

               bool res2 = solver.shapeIntersect(*Shpere0, tf0, *boxes[i], tf1, &contact_points, &penetration_depth, &normal);
              static const int num_max_contacts = std::numeric_limits<int>::max();
              static const bool enable_contact = true;
              fcl::CollisionResult result;
              fcl::CollisionRequest request(num_max_contacts, enable_contact);
    //       flag = fcl::collide(&co0, &co1, request, result);
    //            OR 
    //       flag = res1 ;

      }

Which value is the right one ? I want if flag = true then there is a collision and if flag == false then there is no collision .. so which one is the write one ????
    //       flag = fcl::collide(&co0, &co1, request, result);
    //            OR 
    //       flag = res1

A:

I am very new and I am answering with every doubt, but following fcl:

// Given two objects o1 and o2
CollisionObject* o1 = ...
CollisionObject* o2 = ...
// set the collision request structure, here we just use the default setting
CollisionRequest request;
// result will be returned via the collision result structure
CollisionResult result;
// perform collision test
collide(o1, o2, request, result);
By setting the collision request, the user can easily choose whether to return contact information (which is slower) or just return binary collision results (which is faster).

I have come to understand that flag is necessary only to validate that collision test was performed successfully. What you are looking for (the outcome of collision) is the result variable.
