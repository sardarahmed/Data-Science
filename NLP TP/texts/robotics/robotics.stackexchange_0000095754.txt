@Bobby: I would suggest to read through the wiki/ROS/Introduction page, and then follow that up with the wiki/ROS/Concepts page and all pages linked from that.
Those pages may answer a lot of your questions.

I'm really very sorry I'm beginner to this and I'm finding very difficult in understanding the concepts.

You don't need to apologise for anything.
All we ask is that you read those pages, try to understand what they're describing and if/when you have any further questions, you're more than welcome to post your questions here.
What we do ask of you in that case is to be specific, explain what you don't understand, where you read it, include a link to the page, or section or chapter, and clearly state what your question is.

A:

Yes: http://wiki.ros.org/Master#XMLRPC_API
Please check the wiki, and google a bit. This is within the first three hits for "ROS master node communication"
