Q:

EtherCAT with ROS Melodic

Dear all,
I have seen that the SOEM package is available for Indigo, Kinetic and the Lunar versions, but not for Melodic yet. I am currently using the git files to get it working but, my question is, is there any plan to have it also in Melodic? That could be useful.
Thanks in advance,
Txema

A:

soem has been released by Ruben Smits, not by any of the core ROS maintainers.
There is already an issue targeting the same question, but all in all, the repo there is pretty inactive.
It could be released by someone else, but that one would have to take over maintainership as well, so this is something that could only work on a community effort.
It would be important to make sure, though, that Ruben does not plan on releasing later, or one might run into troubles...
