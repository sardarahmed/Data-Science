Q:

Is OpenCV compatible with pyqt?

hello there,
I am using ROS to develop a system in my research. So, I am retrieving video images from the robot and I want to draw a circle on the screen to the object that the robot recognizes.
I have the code for the object recognition and the position of the object with respect to the video , I was thinking of using OpenCV, but I don't know if they are compatible with pyqt and python?
any help
thank you

A:

Yes, you can do it with opencv's drawing functions. Use cvbridge to create cv::Mat from sensor_msg::image without copying.
If you use pyqt anyway, why not use the drawing functions of qt? You can convert the images to QImage (e.g. as it is done here (c++) from an opencv image) and use a QPainter, constructed with the image as parameter to use drawEllipse.
