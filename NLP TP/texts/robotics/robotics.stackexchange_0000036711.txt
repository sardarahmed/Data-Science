Q:

How to define a tranform listener

I am using this code in order to relate the point cloud with the pose information.
Also, the code found here looks like below:
laser_geometry::LaserProjection projector_;
tf::TransformListener listener_;

void scanCallback (const sensor_msgs::LaserScan::ConstPtr& scan_in)
{
  sensor_msgs::PointCloud cloud;
  projector_.transformLaserScanToPointCloud("base_link",*scan_in,cloud,listener_);

  // Do something with cloud.
}

How should I define the "listener_" variable in order to use it?

A:

Just as done in the example. Put it somewhere, the only important thing is that it is persistent, i.e. it doesn't go out of scope and is recreated all the time.

Thanks a lot for the explanation. I got it.

Yes, it does everything by itself. It just needs to stay to collect some data instead of being recreated all the time.

Did you mean "listener_" variable there something need not be defined ourselves but it's configured/(storing values) by itself?
