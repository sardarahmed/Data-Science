Q:

gtesting a custom class

I created the test/myTest.cpp file, which includes the myClass.h header file.
When I compile with make test I get the error ‘MyClass’ does not name a type, where MyClass is the class defined in myClass.h (the error is located where I declare a new MyClass variable)
I think I am missing something with the cmakelists file..
What should I do to compile everything correctly?
I am using ros electric..

A:

Your CMakeList should look something like this:
rosbuild_add_library(myClass_lib src/myClass.cpp)
rosbuild_add_gtest(myTest test/myTest.cpp)
target_link_libraries(myTest myClass_lib)

You are absolutely right... Everything was correct but I forgot to use the right namespace, which caused the error..
