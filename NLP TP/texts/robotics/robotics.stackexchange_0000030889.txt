Q:

Where is ros.h supposed to be found?

I have been trying to compile a c++ ROS node with no luck.
I keep getting an error of cannot find ros/ros.h
I tried creating a new node with roscreate-pkg add pasted in the code from the talker tutorial.
Even though my new package is found by ros, It will not build..
/scratch/ros/publisher/src/publisher.cpp:1:21: error: ros/ros.h: No such file or directory

I have installed ros-diamondback-all  from apt on Ubuntu 10.04. The only mention of ros.h is in
/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/ros_comm/clients/cpp/roscpp/include/ros/ros.h

A:

I'll answer my own question...
It doesn't matter where ros.h is.
In the manifest.xml for the package, add
<depend package="roscpp"/>

And all will be well...

Hello.. im sorry I am totally new with this.. I have the same error.. where is the manifest.xml file supposed to be? I dont have anything similar in my package folder  :(

Did you find out manifest file? It is the package.xml file for your package.

But for that it need to be <build_depend>roscpp</build_depend> (according to the description of the generates package.xml). This still did not solve the problem for me though :-(

@Paddre: this is a VERY old question and refers the the manifest.xml that was used with rosbuild. If you're using catkin the instructions are different; you need a build_depend in your package.xml, and you need to add roscpp in your CMakeLists.txt .

If you're still having trouble please ask a new question instead of reopening an old question.
