Q:

Difference between writing stuff directly into URDF vs. into  tags?

Hello,
I'm wondering what the  tag actually does? Is there a difference between writing stuff directly into a URDF file and writing it into a  tag?
E.g. I can set mue for a link as follows:
 <contact_coefficient mu="100000"  resitution="0"  k_p="0"  k_d="100" />

But also via the tag
 <gazebo reference="link">
  <mu1>1e10</mu1>
  <mu2>1e10</mu2>
 </gazebo>

What's the difference?

A:

As far as I know...
A gazebo reference tag tells your ROS URDF file what properties a link should have in gazebo. It defines the behavior of a link when it is spawned within the gazebo environment ONLY. What you put within a gazebo reference tag does not affect how your robot behaves for instance in RVIZ.
Case in point... See below

  
  
  
  
  
  0.0000001
  0.00001
  Gazebo/Black
 
This snippet reference says for the front_left_wheel link within the gazebo environment... Set values to blablabla... That link would then go on to behave with the set parameters WITHIN GAZEBO only.
