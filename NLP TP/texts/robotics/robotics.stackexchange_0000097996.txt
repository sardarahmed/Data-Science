Q:

What are the recent (newest) FK, IK solvers?

Hi, colleagues!
Please advise me, what is the newest ROS packages for solving forward and inverse robot arm kinematics. Several years ago I tested OROCOS KDL.  Is it actual in using with Noetic?
Particularly, at this moment I'm looking for inverse jacobian velocity control (cartesian velocity back to joints velocities).
What me to look for?
Best wishes!

wouldn't that be inverse dynamics instead?

Generally, yes. But at this moment kinematics is enough.

Well it's a rather different bit of functionality. There are quite a few IK solvers with plugins for MoveIt fi, but far less inverse dynamics solvers.

A:

inverse jacobian velocity control (cartesian velocity back to joints velocities)

Inverse Jacobian velocity control is the exact description for moveit_servo, so you should check that out! If you already have your robot set up with MoveIt, this should be pretty easy to use (also you might already have it installed via apt)

if you have a driver capable of providing the kind of high bandwidth, low jitter interface servo needs.

Thanks, colleagues. Will try.
