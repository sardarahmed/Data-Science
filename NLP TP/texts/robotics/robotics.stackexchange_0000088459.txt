Please add your CMakeLists.txt and your package.xml to your question. Use the edit button/link for that.

What @gvdhoorn wrote, plus - what is the name of your package / msg file?

A:

Without more information this is going to be difficult to pinpoint exactly, but the error message that you quote comes from generate_messages(..) in genpy/generator.py (here). It checks whether the package name it's been passed is a legal ROS name using genmsg.is_legal_resource_base_name(..) (this one).
If that function returns false, the name is not legal (ie: contains characters that cannot be used, such as colons or other special characters other than _ and -), the error is printed and message generation is aborted.
You'll have to check whether your package name you used contains any such illegal characters and then change it.
