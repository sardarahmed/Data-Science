Q:

SDF to URDF converter?

Since SDF and URDF are both used in ROS/Gazebo as mentioned in:
http://answers.gazebosim.org/question/853/should-urdf-in-gazebo-tutorials-be-replaced-with/
http://answers.gazebosim.org/question/543/why-does-drcsim-atlas-robot-model-use-urdf/
Is there a way to convert from SDF to URDF? I have a robot in SDF that I want to use with ROS mechanism_controllers.

hi, sorry for commenting here but I posted my doubt and no one answered.
I have the same problem in using ros. I have SDF file for my model which I got from gazebo and I want to use it in ros rviz. But ros is supporting urdf only.
is it possible to proceed with sdf now ?
