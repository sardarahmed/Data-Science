Q:

Installing Hydro from source: package 'bullet' not found

Hi everyone! I'm in the middle of building Hydro from Source on an ARM board. I got to building the 'tf2_bullet' catkin package and ran into the following error:
==> Processing catkin package: 'tf2_bullet'
==> Creating build directory: 'build_isolated/tf2_bullet'

<== Failed to process package 'tf2_bullet': 
  Command '/opt/ros/hydro/env.sh cmake /opt/ros/hydro/ros_catkin_ws/src/geometry_experimental/tf2_bullet -DCATKIN_DEVEL_PREFIX=/opt/ros/hydro/ros_catkin_ws/devel_isolated/tf2_bullet -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/ros/hydro' returned non-zero exit status 1

Reproduce this error by running:
==> cd /opt/ros/hydro/ros_catkin_ws/build_isolated/tf2_bullet && /opt/ros/hydro/env.sh cmake /opt/ros/hydro/ros_catkin_ws/src/geometry_experimental/tf2_bullet -DCATKIN_DEVEL_PREFIX=/opt/ros/hydro/ros_catkin_ws/devel_isolated/tf2_bullet -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/ros/hydro

Command failed, exiting.

Anyone know a solution to this? Can I install 'bullet' from source somehow?
Thanks!

A:

Hi,
In Ubuntu, you should be able to get the package from the official repositories. If it's not packaged for your release, you can try to build and install the package (follow the instructions on the Wiki for Debian systems).
You can also have a look on the ROS page of the GumstickWiki : http://wiki.gumstix.org/index.php?title=ROS, there's a small part about bullet.
If your want more precise help, we need more details about your setup: What's you Linux distro ? What steps did you try ? And so on, the more relevant details, the better ;)
