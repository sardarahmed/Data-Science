Q:

rgbdslam camera location

Is there a way to calculate or extract the camera location and pose within RGBDSlam. I've been poking at the RGBDSlam code for a while trying to figure out if data was able to be published or calculated somewhere but can't find anything. I think it is inferred somehow as the newest version prints the changed coordinate axis on each update. Thanks!

A:

In the new snapshot (see http://www.ros.org/wiki/rgbdslam/evaluation) you can store the trajectory to file. Also, if you send the model, a transformation from /map to /openni_camera is published.
In the svn version, a transformation from /openni_camera to /slam_transform is published, where (somewhat confusing) /openni_camera acts as the fixed/map frame and /slam_transform is the moving camera postion.

I was able to figure out how to use TF. I'm working on how to parse the output of TF to be able to set up a "coordinate system" so I can locate myself in a previously compiled map for comparison. Thanks!

Which Version are you using? Do you know how to use TF?

I looked through all the topics and nodes after sending the whole model and couldn't find anything labeled as openni_camera or slam_transform. Where should I be looking for the transforms? Thanks!
