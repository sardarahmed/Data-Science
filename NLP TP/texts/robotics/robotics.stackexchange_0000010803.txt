Q:

How are huge industrial robots powered?

Take a look at this monster lifting a car.
Now I don't think one can get that power by plugging into a wall outlet. So how are these huge robots (their servos) powered? Gasoline? How is power stored, if it needs to be? 

A:

Industrial Robots with having as aim manipulation of large objects are powered electrically in almost all cases (30-40 years ago there have been popular hydraulic variants).  
Industrial robots are powered by industrial 400V 3 phase current, so in a sense, they are plugged in a wall outlet, but but a household wall outlet but an industrial one, like this.

A typical household single-phase outlet in Europe can supply a 16 Ampere current at 230 Volts, that is about 3.68 kVA. As a comparison, high payload Fanuc Robot (similar to the one in the question), the M-900iA, equipped with an R-30iB controller requires an industrial 3 phase outlet which can supply 18kVA. Documentation here. This translates to a current consumption of 25.981 Amperes at 400V supply voltage.
Note1: Most industrial robot have a spring system to easier cope with high payloads by balancing the load of axis 2.
