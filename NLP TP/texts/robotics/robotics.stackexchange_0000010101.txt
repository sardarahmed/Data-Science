Q:

Ultrasonic Sensor through a column

I am trying to measure the height of water inside a column. The column is 50mm in dia and 304mm long. I have mounted the sensor just above the column.

To measure the accuracy of the sensor, I filled the column up to a known value (a) and got the average sensor reading (b). a+b should give me the height of the sensor from the base of the column.
Repeating this for different values of a, I got very different values for (a+b). see attached chart.

My question is

Is the sensor expected to have error of this order? 
Is my setup of confining the sensor through a column producing such errors. 
Any other ideas to get the water column height. Please note that during the actual test, the water inside will be oscillating (up and down).I am thinking of making a capacitive sensor using aluminium foil. Water will work as the dielectric and the level of water will determine the capacitance.

P.S. I also did some open tests (not through a column) to get the distance of a fixed object, and it was quite accurate.
Any help is appreciated.
Arduino Code
#include <NewPing.h>

#define TRIGGER_PIN  7  // Arduino pin tied to trigger pin on the ultrasonic sensor.
#define ECHO_PIN     8  // Arduino pin tied to echo pin on the ultrasonic sensor.
#define MAX_DISTANCE 200 // Maximum distance we want to ping for (in centimeters). Maximum sensor distance is rated at 400-500cm.

double DB_ROUNDTRIP_CM = 57.0;

NewPing sonar(TRIGGER_PIN, ECHO_PIN, MAX_DISTANCE); // NewPing setup of pins and maximum distance.

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600); // Open serial monitor at 115200 baud to see ping results.
}

void loop() {
  delay(100);
  unsigned int uS = sonar.ping();
  double d = uS / DB_ROUNDTRIP_CM;

  Serial.println(d);
}

A:

I think the code is just fine. You must however test the code by placing ultrasonic sensor at fixed distance from the wall and testing the distance. Also, it seems you are using SR04 ultrasonic sensor which has a beam angle of 15 degrees and accuracy of 3mm. This might result beam being reflected from water column container. As mentioned in the datasheet SR04 DataSheet, minimum area of measurement must be 0.5 square meters to get correct readings.
