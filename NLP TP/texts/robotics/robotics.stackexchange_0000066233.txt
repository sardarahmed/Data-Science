Q:

bag migration, fill new field with incrementing counter

Is it possible to fill a new message field in an old bag data with an incrementing counter using a bag migration rules file (http://wiki.ros.org/rosbag/migration) and rosbag fix?

A:

Yep it is (as simple as it should be)! Just create a counter and increment and assign it i update()
Snippet of the migration rules class, ( see http://wiki.ros.org/rosbag/migration ) :
migrated_types = [  ]

valid = True

counter = 0
  
def update(self, old_msg, new_msg):
    self.counter += 1
    new_msg.obj_id = self.counter
