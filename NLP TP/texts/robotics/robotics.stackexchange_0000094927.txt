Q:

Problem compiling node with Geany

Hello everyone when i compile my Node;cpp file it points me towards an error in Node.h file
And the error it shows is
Node.h : fatal error: ros/ros.h : No file or folder of this type
I have looked into previous questions asked on this topic, so my file "package.xml" and "CmakeLists.txt" for this node seems correct to me, though i am posting them
package.xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<package>
  <name>p_sedimentation_estimator</name>
  <version>0.0.0</version>

  LIBRARY DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_LIB_DESTINATION}
  RUNTIME DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_BIN_DESTINATION}
)

WHAT or Where could be the problem ??
1)catkin_make runs without error
2)Compilation of the node.cpp program gives this error(Node.h : fatal error: ros/ros.h : No file or folder of this type) in node.h file

is it necesarry to use build also , other than sourcing, catkin_make and compiling.

Help Needed :)
Thanku in advance :)

Could I ask you to please format your questions properly? I've done it for you now (and in your previous questions as well), but for next time: select any code/console text/etc and press ctrl+k or click the Preformatted Text button (the one with 101010 on it).

@gvdhoorn Thanku so much...i will keep it in mind next time :)

@Yadav If I understand your question correctly, at the end you specify three points 1), 2), 3) that you step through, right?
Could you please explain how you "compile" your node? Because this is actually what catkin_make will do for you and thus I don't think you can have 1) successfull and 2) not if you are using the standard workflow...

@mgruhler
Yes,catkin_make runs without error
But when i compile the code in the Node.cpp file alone, using "Geany" it shows me the error(Node.h : fatal error: ros/ros.h : No file or folder of this type) in node.h file
So by catkin_make it gets compiled but it doen't work according to the code in Node.cpp file
Standard workflow ?

@Yadav then you don't have a problem with compiling your code in general, but only using geany.
I've retagged and reworded your question title as such.

A:

As ROS and caktin heavily builds on CMake as a build system, you at least need an IDE that supports it.
Even though it is stated that Geany can use CMake, I haven't found a way to properly configure it with a few minutes of search. You might have to use some plugins.
This is even more true that ROS also requires a few more quirks to set up, usually.
There is a large list of IDEs and how to use them with ROS on the wiki. I suggest you try one of those if you want to compile from source. If you want more fancy stuff like jumping to external (out of your source) function definitions, those instructions might come in handy.
On another note: you tagged your question with Indigo. Indigo is EOL since for almost a year now, I suggest to update to a new one

I could suggest to not use GEANY also :) Thanks @mgruhler @gvdhoom  for the help :)
