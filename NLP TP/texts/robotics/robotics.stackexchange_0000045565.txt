Q:

mathematic library for ros

hi,
I'm working with ros on a project for velocity estimation of a quadrotor based on optical flow. After having acquired images from the camera mounted on the uav and having computed optical flow I need to set a system of linear equations and then compute the pseudo-inverse. Is there a library "easy to use" in ros for such things?

A:

Basically, you can use anything.
The best practice would be to use a ROS-independent system library instead of a custom ROS package for such things.
Eigen is quite commonly used and should do what you want.
