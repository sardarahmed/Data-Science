Thanks, but sometimes when I use the search engine, these has no results which may due to bad internet or something else. Is it normal when you use the Ros's wiki search engine.

A:

Most of the packages have the APIs available if you know what package it's in.  For example, waitForService is in roscpp. You can get to the API from the "package links" box on the right of the page.  That will take you to the documentation where you can find a formal definition of waitForService.
