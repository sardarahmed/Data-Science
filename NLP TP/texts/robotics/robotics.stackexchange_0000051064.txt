Q:

Resetting odometry(pose) information

Hello,
I am conducting an experiment that compares different navigation algorithms for a short distance (<4~5m) using a turtlebot, by plotting the sequences of locations contained in the odom messages. Since I am concerned with only short distances, I am not willing to use any localization to estimate the precise pose(location) of the robot.
The problem is that because I am relying only on odometry information (i.e. how much wheels have turned) to estimate the pose of the robot, odometry messages contain different pose information even for a same location. As a result, everytime I switch between navigation algorithms I need to turn off and turn on the turtlebot package in order to start at (0,0).
Is there a way to manually set the pose of the robot without turning on and off the turtlebot package? I am using turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch.
Thank you in advance.

A:

I don't believe that the turtlebot driver supports re-initializing odometry. I haven't used the kobuki driver, but if you have a turtlebot 2.0 then give it a shot. It has a reset_odometry feature as described here.
In general, you can solve this problem by writing a node that subscribes odom messages and republishes them for plotting. You can then add a service to this node that zeros out the values.

Hi ! I tried to use that reset_odometry that you linked (I am trying to do the same thing as bkim, except that I try to do it for a Turtlebot2), it doesn't seem to work. Maybe it hasn't been implemented yet ?

Has there been any update to this?  I have a similar desire.
