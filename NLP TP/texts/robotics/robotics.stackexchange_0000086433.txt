Q:

why dwa don't considering heading diff as a score anymore?

Hi everyone, I am using dwa for a holomic robot. Since heading towards the global plan is important in my work. In the old trajectory planner, the total score is 0.3*heading diff+goal+target+occ. But in the new dwa planner, it uses alignment cost and goal front instead. Why the new planner uses these 2 factors? And my robot fails to head with the global plan. It looks really ugly in real world!
Thanks for your help!

Please provide links and version numbers for the packages you're referring to.

A:

It uses alignment function instead. But it can't calculate as well as I wish. May I be able to rewrite a costfunction class like heading diff and add it to critic vector?
