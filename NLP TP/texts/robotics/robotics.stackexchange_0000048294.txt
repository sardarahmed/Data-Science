Q:

Turtlebot networking setup error

Hello,
I have a problem with networking setup. I followed this tut.
http://www.ros.org/wiki/Robots/TurtleBot/Network%20Setup
at the last step, on my workstation, I ran
rostopic pub -r10 /hello std_msgs/String "hello"

and when I ran
rostopic echo /hello

on my turtlebot laptop I got this:
WARNING: topic [/hello] does not appear to be published yet

according to the tut.

The message "hello" begin printed
about 10 times a second.

but that is not happening.
Any suggestions will be appreciated.
Thanks!

A:

The standard way is to reboot both the workstation and the laptop, and then check:
echo $ROS_MASTER_URI
echo $ROS_HOSTNAME
In your workstation, the Master-URI should show the IP address of the TurtleBot laptop, but the hostname is the IP address (without http://) of the workstation.
Hope it helps.
