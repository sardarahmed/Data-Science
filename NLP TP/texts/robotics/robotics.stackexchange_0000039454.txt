Q:

Turtlebot rviz "Frame [map] does not exist" error

Turtlebot_bringup kinect.launch seems to work-no errors. However rviz from Workstation (openni-kinect indexed) shows black window with Global Status Error "Frame [map] does not exist" and cannot add Camera or Pointcloud2. For what it matters, the Kinect Camera does work with the Android teleop app.

A:

/map frame is broadcast usually by the navigation stack eg. refer to amcl or gmapping in turtlebot tutorial. Just launching kinect.launch will not give the /map frame.
To add Camera view in rviz, you can change the global frame to one of the kinect's frame (eg depth) or /odom if the robot is up and running.
