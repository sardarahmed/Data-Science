Q:

How to create ground truth for the map from ROS

Hi everyone. I am new to ROS and I am using Octomap to create a 3D map of a lab. I would like to know how to create ground truth for the map from ROS and how to compare the map that I produce using Octomap with the ground truth.

A:

You could make a CAD model of the lab (using something like Solidworks, Fusion 360, or TinkerCAD) and output it as a .stl or COLLADA file (.dae), then display that model in rviz as a mesh resource.
You'll need to figure out the details of lining up the coordinate systems of your ground truth model and the map you're making, but that shouldn't be too difficult.
