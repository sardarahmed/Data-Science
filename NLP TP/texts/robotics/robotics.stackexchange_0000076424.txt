Q:

the necessary of the "rosparam set use_sim_time true " in gmapping

hello,
I would like to know the necessary of  "rosparam set use_sim_time true " when I build exact map by using gmapping and rviz.
When I used "rosparam set use_sim_time true " before "rosrun gmapping slam_gmapping scan:=base_scan", my map becomes error " No map received" in rviz. If I don't use "rosparam set use_sim_time true " ,The error don't appear.
If I don't use ""rosparam set use_sim_time true " , Can I build exact map?

A:

It is not necessary if you are not using rosbag to play back sensor data.
My setup is:

a real robot P3DX
a laser
a cellphone running Android APP to teleop robot

I didn't set the param 'use_sim_time'. I just ran gmapping and teleop robot to build the map, and then used map_saver to get the map and .yaml file.
