Q:

ros-indigo-rviz fails to buil

I'm try to install rviz in archlinux by using yaourt. I run yaourt -S ros-indigo-rviz and everything seems to be all right until the very end of the compile, and error occured:
[100%] Linking CXX executable ../../devel/lib/rviz/two_render_widgets
[100%] Built target two_render_widgets
Scanning dependencies of target librviz_sip
[100%] Running SIP generator for rviz_sip Python bindings...

    Aborting...
==> ERROR: Makepkg was unable to build ros-indigo-rviz.

It may be because of the python version, I have installed python3.4.3, python2.7 in the system.
Could someone help me?

Is qmake on your path?

Hi William, thanks for your reply! I'm new to ROS so I don't know how to check the path. Could you please explain more details of your answer?

A:

qmake is the executable that it is trying to run, based on ['qmake', '-query'], ... being passed to subprocess, and if it is not on the PATH then you could get the error you're getting: OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory, see: http://www.linfo.org/path_env_var.html
