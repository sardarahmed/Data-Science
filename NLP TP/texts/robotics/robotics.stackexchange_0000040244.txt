Q:

ROS offline installation

Hi there,
I know that this question is already been asked but this threat didn't get me to the solution.
I'm trying to install the ROS-Base version on an ASCTEC Pelican. Unfortunately, is there no way to connect the Pelican to the internet. I can checkout the https://code.ros.org/svn/ros/stacks/ros/tags/ros-1.6.8 repository but how do I get the other Packages onto the machine. Would be great to get some help.
Thanks & Cheers

Also please be a little bit more specific about what "other" pachages you want to install.  And what architecture/platform you are targeting.

I would like to use this solution http://answers.ros.org/question/10201/ros-offline-install    which seemed pretty convenient at first but this is where the funny part starts... How do i get the apt-offline package on the non-network machine?

A:

Just go to http://packages.ubuntu.com/ and search for apt-offline. There, you can download the Debian package for your architecture.

I did that and its running on the non-network machine (to be precise the asctec pelican). But how do I set up the softwaresource ( sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu maverick main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list' ) without an internet connection?
