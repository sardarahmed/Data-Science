Q:

replace the existing fuerte with a new copy

ubuntu 12.04 and ros fuerte
Hi,
I currently have fuerte and ubuntu 12.04. I would like to remove all the components of fuerte and again install a new copy of fuerte with all the components. I think i have messed up some files in opt/ros/fuerte.
Any suggestions?

A:

Did you manually messed with files in /opt/ros? Generally there is no need to do so.

Uninstall all fuerte packages with config removal: sudo aptitude purge --prompt ros-fuerte~n
Check directories for left files you don't want anymore:

/opt/ros
~/.ros
~/ros_workspace, ~/ros_stacks or similar
...?

Install fuerte

At the command line: sudo apt-get remove ros-fuerte-*, then re-install.
