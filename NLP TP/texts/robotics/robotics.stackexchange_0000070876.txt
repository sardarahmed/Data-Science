I don't think the Camera1394 package is the one you are after - it is used for Firewire connected cameras.  I expect that you would need two instances of a USB camera driver such as libuvc_camera

What camera models do you have? (A few USB cameras do support the IIDC standard and can work with camera1394.)

actually i have also tried to use uvc_camera but when i run roslaunch camera_node.launch it throws:
Setting auto_focus is not supported
Setting focus_absolute is not supported

joq i am using a basic usb cam from quantum "http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B00L5AWKUM?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00"

A:

I doubt that camera supports the IIDC protocol, so it will not work with camera1394.
You'll need a ROS USB camera driver, instead. There are many available, here is a good list:
