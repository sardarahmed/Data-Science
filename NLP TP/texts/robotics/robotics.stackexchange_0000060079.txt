Q:

Occipital (RGB-D sensor like Kinect) on Parrot AR. DRONE using SLAM algorithm

Hi I'm using Occipital (RGB-D sensor like Kinect) on Parrot AR. DRONE for navigation using SLAM algorithm.... What do I do for obstacle avoidance, is it done by the SLAM or should I use additional sensors If I use additional sensors, how do I make it a part of the SLAM algorithm.

A:

The Occipital "Structure Sensor" looks like an overpriced version of the Kinect or Xtion sensor. It's only selling point seems to be a much smaller size, but it appears to uses the same technology as Kinect/Xtion, so based on this page, it might work with the same code/packages for those sensors that use the OpenNI driver. I haven't used them though, so I can't say for sure if they'll work.
