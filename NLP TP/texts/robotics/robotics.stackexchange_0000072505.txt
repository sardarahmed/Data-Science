Q:

difference between yaw and orientation of a vehicle

What is the difference between yaw and orientation of a car. I know the difference between the orientation and the steering angle of a car. How is yaw related to both of them ? Also is yaw rate same as angular velocity of the car?

A:

Orientation is a high-level term. It includes roll, pitch and yaw if you are representing orientation with Euler angles. If you are representing orientation with Quaternion, it includes x, y, z, and w corresponding to Quaternion components.
In other words, yaw is only one component of orientation.

So yaw is entirely different from steering angle of the car ?

Exactly. Different, but related of course. Steering angle results in lateral force on wheels and this force results in yaw motion.
