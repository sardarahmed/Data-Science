Q:

tf2 stamped datatypes tutorial fails to build

I'm trying to walk through the tf2 tutorials following the instructions here: http://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Tutorials/Using%20stamped%20datatypes%20with%20tf2%3A%3AMessageFilter
Trying to build the source code with catkin results in

fatal error: tf2/transform_listener.h: No such file or directory.

Upon changing the two include files to
#include "tf2_ros/transform_listener.h"
#include "tf2_ros/message_filter.h"
The code can find the header files but now the tf2 member functions are throwing errors.  Changing things to tf2_ros:: fixes some errors but others arise.  This results in a few questions on my end

What is the difference between tf2 and tf2_ros?  Can people point me to documentation on this
Is syncing Stamped data to a specific transformation in time even done via message filters in tf2 or is this functionality replaced with tfBuffer?
Is there a tf2 tutorial that shows how to time sync transformations and stamped datatypes with the correct implementation?

A:

It should be fixed now.
The code is versioned here :
https://github.com/ros/geometry_tutorials/blob/indigo-devel/turtle_tf2/src/message_filter.cpp
