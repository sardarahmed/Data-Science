A:

By using the MessageEvent callback signature you can use the getPublisher() function to retrieve the publisher name (in roscpp). The same appears to be possible in rospy by using Connection Information.

I see that this doesn't work when using Connection Information and bags as the callerid will always be the rosbag player, is it the same case for cpp?
Comment by Stefan Kohlbrecher on 2015-08-19:
If you play back bags, rosbag effectively is the publisher. I think the connection header approach will therefore not work with rosbag. I'm not sure there is a way to recover the publisher id when playing back bagfiles (I guess not).
