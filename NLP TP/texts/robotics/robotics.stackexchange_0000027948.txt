Q:

Why does gazebo contact sensor topic stops publishing on deleting and respawning the object to whch the contact sensor is atached?

I have a box object model to which I have attached a contact sensor, following this tutorial. On spawning the object in gazebo, initially I get the contact sensor data on the topic /gazebo/default/blue_box1/link/my_contact. However, when I delete this object and re-spawn it, no data is published on this topic, and I just get the following
> Msg Waiting for master Msg Connected
> to gazebo master @
> http://127.0.0.1:11345 Msg Publicized
> address: 192.168.5.30

Please help me in debugging this issue. I have already added the update rate in the sensor, so that may not be the cause. Thanks.

A:

This problem may have been resolved with this pull request. You can try compiling gazebo from source, using the gazebo7 branch, or wait for a new gazebo7 debian release.

Thank you; previously I was using Gazebo 2 which comes with ROS Indigo. I integrated ROS Indigo with Gazebo7, and now this problem seems to be resolved.
