Tutorial: Controlling simulated robot in Webots with ROS, using joystick

Tutorial: Controlling simulated robot in Webots with ROS, using joystick 
Tested with: 
Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric Ocelot)
ROS Fuerte, should be compatible with Electric and Diamond
Hi all,
The sample ROS controller for Webots provided at: 
http://www.ros.org/wiki/webots 
no longer works, because it requires the deprecated 'joy' node.
I've used this work by Andreas Breitenmoser & Olivier Michel to create a new Webots stack:  
http://kaist-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/kaist_webots/ 
The structure, compilation and launch method have been modified to suit the current ROS standard. 
Users need to have an existing installation of Webots, but the simulation can be started from a single ROS launch file.
It has been tested with ROS Fuerte, and a complete walk-through guide follows below. 
This tutorial will be posted on the Wiki shortly.

Very cool. Is this a question? If not, Planet ROS might be a better place to post it.
