Q:

Uninstalling ROS and installing it back

Hi,
I'm running Ubuntu 10.04 (64-bit). I had previously installed ros-cturtle but didn't use it much. Since a new version of ROS is available, I wanted to upgrade my version. Unsure on how to go about doing it, I did something stupid and deleted the ros directory on my machine, along with all references to ros I could find with locate (in the hope I could do a fresh install of diamondback). However, after this I installed diamondback and found that roscd is still looking for cturtle:
roscd:cd:4: no such file or directory: /opt/ros/cturtle/ros

I am not sure if roscd is a "binary" that I could find and delete or where its getting this information from. I use Z-shell and I have removed references of ROS_ROOT from my .zshrc. I removed diamondback using sudo apt-get remove ros-diamondback-ros as I want to build and install from source. But before that, I want to get rid of this problem, so any help is appreciated.
Thanks,
S.

A:

It sounds like you still have some references to the old ROS in your .zshrc or somewhere.  The roscd command is defined in roszsh.

Look for references to setup.zsh that are still cturtle related

Look for lines like:
source $ROS_ROOT/tools/rosbash/roszsh

Look for definitions of $ROS_ROOT that are still pointing at cturtle.

It's weired. I restarted my machine and roscd no longer exist. I was able to install diamondback without any problems.
