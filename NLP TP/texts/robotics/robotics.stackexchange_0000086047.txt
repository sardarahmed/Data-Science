Q:

image stream using camera

Hello guys,
My question might seem easy for many since i am still fresh in Ros and Opencv.
I am following the tutorials provided on Ros Website. I am going through the tutorial ''Converting between ROS images and OpenCV images (C++)''.
I am trying to solve point no. 4 in this tutorial ''An example ROS node''. I ran my system and did the catkin_make and it works fine. However, for running the node i need to provide an image stream from a camera. How can I do that. I don't know where to go from there.
I would definitely appreciate any help.
Thanks

A:

If you have a webcam or a laptop camera, you should be able to publish the image stream using the video_stream_opencv package: http://wiki.ros.org/video_stream_opencv
I've used that package successfully to publish a video stream either from a video device (/dev/video0, for example) or from a video file (something.avi, for example).
