A:

Are you by any chance trying to find_package(..) the sys module from Python in your CMakeLists.txt?
If so, that is not needed and won't work: apart from the fact that sys is part of the Python standard runtime libs, Python modules are never find_package(..)ed.
Just remove it from your CMakeLists.txt.
