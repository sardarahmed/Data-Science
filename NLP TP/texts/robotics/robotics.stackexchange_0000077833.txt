This is really more of a question for Mathworks support. Have you tried contacting them?

How can I contact with them ?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2016-12-18:
If you don't have a local/regional Mathworks contact person, you could try any of the options on the Mathworks support site.

I GOT İT. The language of my computer was Turkish. I solved the problem when I made this English (United States).    :) :)

Wow. That is rather surprising.
Have you had contact with Mathworks about this? I'm guessing they would like to know about such an issue.
Thanks for reporting back btw, much appreciated!
Comment by yucelokan on 2016-12-20:
Is not that enough? It's a topic I created
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2016-12-20:
That would seem like it should get their attention. Thanks for that.

That didn't work for me. I'm using Matlab 2016a , WIN7 64 bit OS (default language : English ) ... when i try the 'rosinit' command. Same error occurs ... and i tried everything,but couldn't find the solution

As this is an officially supported Mathworks toolbox, I'd really recommend you post this on their support forums. The chances of getting a good answer are a lot higher then.
Do please post a link here to any issue you post on their fora.
