Q:

Making a graph of the robot links of Xacro file

Hello,
I would like to know if there is a way to make a graph like this from a Xacro file. It is explained that it is possible from URDF with the URDF_to_graphiz. However, it doesn't work with Xacro.
I tried converting it to a URDF file, but that left me with nothing but transmissions from ROS control. Is there any way that is it possible?

Well, yes. Xacro is not urdf. They somewhat relate to each other as classes and objects do in say C++: you have to create instances of your classes to get an object.

this suggests you tried to convert the wrong .xacro file. You have to convert a 'top-level' xacro (ie: the one instantiating all the macros), or it won't work.
If you can give a little more detail (which .xacro are you trying to convert, how did you do it, command line(s) etc), we might be able to help you.

Ok, it's clear where I screwed up. I didn't convert the top-level xacro file. Instead I used the lower level one.
