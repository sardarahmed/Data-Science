Q:

ROS2 Eloquent installation failed in Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS

Referring to link:https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Eloquent/Linux-Install-Debians/   I am installing ROS2 Eloquent into my Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS. 
My system's information is as below (via uname -a) 
Linux myname 5.3.0-28-generic #30~18.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jan 17 06:14:09 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

I could Setup Locale and Setup Sources with no issue. Then, it came to Install ROS 2 packages. 
Running sudo apt update gave me: 
Hit:1 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu bionic InRelease
Hit:2 http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu bionic InRelease

N: Skipping acquire of configured file 'main/binary-i386/Packages' as repository 'http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu bionic InRelease' doesn't support architecture 'i386'

What does the last error message mean? How do I resolve this?
Then, I ran sudo apt install ros-eloquent-desktop and it returned:

    E: Unable to fetch some archives, maybe run apt-get update or try with --fix-missing?

I truncated the response to only keep the last part which I think will help you to know what's wrong. I googled but could not find the solution. I don't have any firewall and antivirus installed as well.
Please help. Thanks a lot.

After running sudo dpkg --remove-architecture i386, the message N: Skipping acquire of configured file 'main/binary-i386/Packages' as repository 'http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntuÂ bionic InRelease' doesn't support architecture 'i386'  is not displayed anymore.
I am still stuck with  sudo apt install ros-eloquent-desktop . The same error message still appears.
Any help is deeply appreciated. Have been stuck for few hours. Thanks.

A:

check your sourse list:
cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d

grep ros * | grep -v amd64
probably you will see  ros2-latest.list:deb http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu bionic main

edit ros2-latest.list
change to
deb [arch=amd64] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu bionic main

Thanks rwu for the answer.
I have actually resolved my issue but I think your way is more proper. It can serve as my remedy if I encounter similar issue in future. Anyway, what I did was:
I ended up downloading the deb package directly from http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/g/gcc-7/gcc-7_7.5.0-3ubuntu1~18.04_amd64.deb followed by installing it via the commands (ref: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/159094/how-to-install-a-deb-file-by-dpkg-i-or-by-apt)
sudo dpkg -i path_to_the_deb
sudo apt --fix-broken install
sudo apt update

Then, I was able to install ros-eloquent-desktop.
