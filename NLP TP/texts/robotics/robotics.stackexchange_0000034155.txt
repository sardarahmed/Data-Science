Q:

Why roscore can' find the good IP adress?

Hi all,
My computer has two IPv4 adresses (one for the wired lan, one for the wifi). The computer name is gilgamesh. Its name on the wired lan is gilgamesh too. But its name through wifi is gilgamesh-wifi.
When I start roscore, with wifi on, it complains about not being able to ping gilgamesh (While it should try to ping gilgamesh-wifi).
How to specify the name of the host computer when launching roscore ? (or any ros server)
