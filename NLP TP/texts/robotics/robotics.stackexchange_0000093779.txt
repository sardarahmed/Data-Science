Q:

Create quaternion from euler in arduino

HI
How to create a quaternion from Euler angles in arduino?
In python it is possible to use this function:
from geometry_msgs.msg import Quaternion
import tf
.
.
.
odom_orientation = Quaternion()
odom_orientation = tf.transformations.quaternion_from_euler(0.0, 0.0, th)

thanks

A:

Hi,
since you just want yaw and not pitch and roll, you can use the following:
geometry_msgs::Quaternion odom_quat = tf::createQuaternionMsgFromYaw(th);
