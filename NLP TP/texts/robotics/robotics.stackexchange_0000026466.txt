@ThomasK Thanks. In my standalone installation (1.7.1) I could find ImuSensor.hh at /usr/include/gazebo-1.7/gazebo/sensors/ImuSensor.hh but ImuSensor.cc or a .so file is nowhere to be found. I am wondering why?

Lack of .cc file is expected, debian packages are not including source files. Headers files are needed for developing against gazebo and binary code for Imu Sensor is part libgazebo_sensors.so. (try to run nm -D libgazebo_sensors.so | grep Imu). I would recommended download source code from bitbucket if you plan on looking at code.
