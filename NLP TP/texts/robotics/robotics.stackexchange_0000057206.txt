Q:

roscreate-stack: command not found [Hydro]

Hi everyone,
It's been a while i've been on ROS (from electric, and now on hydro). I can't seem to get roscreate-stack to work.
It simply says:
roscreate-stack: command not found
I understand this is not available in ros fuerte (as the wiki page says), but is it not available for Hydro too? I'm not fully understanding it.
Thank you, everyone.

A:

Hydro has moved to using catkin, and has moved away from stacks. Everything is a package now. To setup a skeleton package, use
catkin_create_pkg NAME [DEPENDENCY [DEPENDENCY [..]]]

in your source workspace.
Also, see the catkin/CreatingPackage page on the ROS wiki.
