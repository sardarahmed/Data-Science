Q:

calculate depth from point cloud xyz

From a single point in  PointCloud2 ('sensor_msgs/PointCloud2),  a value of
x,y,z. I want to know how to calculate the depth to that point.
For example from point (57,341)
I get (x,y,z)=(-0.6895000338554382, 0.2666066884994507, 1.3790000677108765)

How i calculate the depth from this information ? It is only z value? what the meaning of negative at x?
Thanks for the help.

How did you get the value of x,y,z from PointCloud2?

A:

The x,y,z values of a point cloud point give the position relative to the frame defined in the message header. E.g. the Kinect frame. If you want to calculate the distance between your camera's lens and a specific point you only need to determine the length of the point's vector. vec_length = square_root(x^2 + y^2 + z^2).
