Q:

Install ROS on 11.04 Natty

I'm having trouble installing on 11.04 using these directions. rosinstall returns errors about missing some library so I install the library, run it again and get a new library missing. I think the directions page should be updated to reflect that it doesn't work with Natty.
How should I go about installing on Natty?
