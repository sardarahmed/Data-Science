Q:

Beginner Sets for intermediate devs

For a longer time I'm looking for some kind of robotic set, which is programmable, but most things I've found are related to child education or involves a lot of putting all the hardware parts together by yourself.
I'm working as a Software engineer for a longer time, so I have a good knowledge of software languages also on c/c++ . 
I've taken several steps in on the Raspberry pi which was very interesting but shortly it turns out I'm not that much interested in soldering hardware parts or something like that.
Can you guys give me some advice on where to start with robotic Programming for adults, without getting to deep into elektronics or hardware engineering, if possible, but to conenctrate on Programming?
Any advice would be great
Thanks

A:

If you want to start programming a robot that's already built, the Scribbler 3 (S3) robot by Parallax, inc. is relatively affordable and comes already assembled. The programming relies on Blockly, a GUI-based programming language for robotics systems. I think it's popular in schools.
If you're interested in something a bit more robust, why not look into the iRobot Create® 2 Programmable Robot? It's built from remanufactured Roomba® platforms and comes preassembled. You could customize and program it (direct connection, Arduino, or RaspberryPi).
Finally, since you are already and experienced software engineer and are not interested in assembling hardware, you could look into Gazebo and MoveIt! which are two robot simulation system used in the industry (as far as I understand). They both offer a bridge to ROS the Robot Operating System.
I hope this helps!
