Q:

Which node reads the configuration file?

Hello,
I am working with NXT-ROS. To define the sensors and actuators, you need to create a robot.yaml file. My question is, how is this file used? Is it read by some other node? By which?
I think it might be the node nxt_ros, but i am not really sure.
Thanks

A:

You are correct as per the tutorial:
<node pkg="nxt_ros" type="nxt_ros.py" name="nxt_ros" output="screen" respawn="true"> <rosparam command="load" file="$(find learning_nxt)/robot.yaml" /> </node>
This launch file XML takes the robot.yaml file and loads the values to the ROS parameter server. It does this using the <rosparam> tags. Since it is nested in the <node> tags it sets all the parameters as private names under the nxt_ros node.
Hope this helps.
