Q:

rosserial_arduino and Arduino IDE 1.0 rc2

I'm a newbie to ROS, rosserial and Arduino.  Nonetheless, I'm trying my hand at doing some development.  When I tried to compile the rosserial_arduino example for HelloWorld using the Arduino IDE (1.0 rc2), it wouldn't compile as a result of the renaming of "Wprogram.h" to "Arduino.h".  I solved the problem by editing ArduinoHardware.h to replace:
#include <Wprogram.h>

with:
#if ARDUINO>=100
#include <Arduino.h> // Arduino 1.0
#else
#include <Wprogram.h> // Arduino 0022
#endif

Hopefully (1) this is the preferred solution and (2) it gets propagated into the rosserial package.

Is there a plan to push this fix out in the debs? Still seems to be broken in ros-fuerte-rosserial.
