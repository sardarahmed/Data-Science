Q:

ROS rgbdslam not working as expected

It's my first time with ros and I installed using the RGB-D SLAM for "Not-yet" ROS Users (bottom of the page)
I'm able to run the following but no GUI shows up so after a few minutes of sitting there I ctrl+c. Am I missing something?
$ roslaunch rgbdslam kinect+rgbdslam.launch

NOTE here is an issue I ran into before getting to this point.

Hi!,
Which sensor are you using? Is it the new kinect (Kinect for xbox one). I have tried using the new kinect but facing some issues with the usb port. I have been using the usb 3.0 port. But somehow cannot get the data from kinect.
Wanted to know your inputs on how you got to run the kinect.

@srik11 I'm using the old kinect for xbox 360 on USB 3. It works with freenect but not with rgbdslam (yet)

A:

Hi,
If you use openni, you can use this one:
roslaunch rgbdslam openni+rgbdslam.launch
Hope this helps

This works but for some reason my camera isn't connecting..

This wasn't working on my mac VM (ubuntu 12.04 amd64) but worked on a crappy HP laptop I bought (ubuntu 12.04.05 i386)
