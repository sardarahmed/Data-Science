Q:

Odroid X installing ROS

Hi all, I am trying to use odroid X to install ROS. Operating system is Ubuntu 12.04 from Linaro 12.08.
I have tried follow the steps from http://www.ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Installation/Ubuntu and when i type sudo apt-get update, I got the following error:
W: Failed to fetch http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu/dists/precise/Release  Unable to find expected entry 'main/binary-armhf/Packages' in Release file (Wrong sources.list entry or malformed file)
E: Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.
I am not sure whats the problem, will appreciate the help.

To explain the reason why you need to do an installation from source: the Odroid-X has an ARM processor and the ROS debian packages are only built for i386 and amd64.
