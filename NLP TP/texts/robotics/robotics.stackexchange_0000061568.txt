A:

I believ this error is caused by the pathing described here

~/home/hattan_map5

Try using the absolute path to where this is located (you can find this out by typing pwd in the directory where the map is). Additionally, when you created a map using the map_server, it should have saved to two files: one with the extension .pgm and one with the extension .yaml. Make sure to run roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo amcl_demo.launch map_file:=<full path to your map file>.yaml, and make certain that the image attribute in the.yaml file correctly points to the path of the .pgm.
To clarify, if your files are located at /home/hattan/hattan_map5.yaml and /home/hattan/hattan_map5.pgm, then inside the .yaml file should be the line image: hattan_map5.pgm, and you would run roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo amcl_demo.launch map_file:=/home/hattan/hattan_map5.yaml
