Q:

Installation problem with kinect

Hello. I am new to ROS/Ubuntu and hoping someone could shed some light into my problem.
My main problem is that I cannot see any result of depth and RGB from Kinect, even though I installed following instructions introduced from http://www.ros.org/wiki/kinect.
Below is what I have done so far:

I have installed openni_kinect (electric); "sudo apt-get install ros-electric-openni-kinect "
unplug and plug in the Kinect.
type command "roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch."

 ** result image shown:[link image](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BxupHPuhFy-HOWUxNjEwZTktMTBiMy00OTIxLTg4ZjQtNDhiOTE2YjQ5N2Yw)

As you can see from the image description, it seems the above command has registered kinetic

when I run "rosrun rviz rviz", it does not show anything except black screen so far. Is there anything specific I should be doing to RVIZ to get the kinetic camera to capture?

Thanks for you help.

You need to subscribe the appropriate topic. One is named rgb one depth iirc. Also select color transformer RGB8.

Thank you so much. I did as you mentioned. It worked. I really appreciate that. I have another question. RVIZ screen shows only black and white colors. Is there any way to get RGB with depth and how can I see 3D pictures. Thanks.
