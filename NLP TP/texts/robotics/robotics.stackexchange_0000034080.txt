If Macports can't build log4cxx, that's a MacPorts problem (and they provide a suggestion right there in the error message you posted).

Right now it is failing failing to install log4cxx using:
sudo port install log4cxx
To report a bug, see http://guide.macports.org/#project.tickets
Failed to install log4cxx!
[ rosmake ] rosdep install failed: Rosdep install failed
