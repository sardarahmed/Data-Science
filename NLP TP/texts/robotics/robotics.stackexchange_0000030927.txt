Q:

Vim Code Completion Problem

Hi,
For about 3 weeks, I have been tweaking my vim to get it running for the code completion. The strange thing is that if I write a non ROS-related code, it just works, but when I write a ROS-related one, it does not work (including non ROS-related line, say I type std::), it won't complete any..
I really need this vim to have this code completion working..Hope any Vim experts out there can guide me on this..Thanks in advance.
EDIT:
I've observed one thing in non ROS-related code, if it is still not working if I type std::, but it is working if I type rect. (will be autocompleted with some members in the class). I think if I can resolve with "::" in non ROS-related code, it will also work in ROS-related code..hopefully.
I've also tried to follow one tutorial to reinstall my code completion. At the bottom of the tutorial, there is a test to try to type "std::" in .cpp file. I'm even not able to have it worked.

I found this yesterday:
http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3302 and
http://cx4a.org/software/gccsense/
Maybe these work for you.

I don't know, I didn't try these out.

I'm not so sure about using gccsense for ROS-related code, how to configure our .vimrc?
