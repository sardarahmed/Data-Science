Q:

Code is not visible in tutorial "Writing a Subscriber for gpsd_client (C++)"

Hello there,
I was going through a tutorial on using the gpsd_client package but then stumbled upon a problem regarding the code. Unfortunately I can't see the code included in the tutorial, due to the error included in the screenshot. Could you please help me with what I am supposed to do? 
The tutorial link is given below:
http://wiki.ros.org/gpsd_client/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20Subscriber%20for%20gpsd_client%20%28C%2B%2B%29
Best regards,
Feyzi

A:

Not sure why the links in the wiki are not longer working, I found the tutorials under this link for now:
http://library.isr.ist.utl.pt/docs/roswiki/gpsd_client(2f)Tutorials(2f)Writing(20)a(20)Subscriber(20)for(20)gpsd_client(2028)C(2b2b29).html
I also created an issue as well in the repo, hopefully it gets corrected soon:
