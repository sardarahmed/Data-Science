Q:

gazebo window blinking

Hi,
When I was trying to run Gazebo on Lucid 64bit, but the graphic window inside "Gazebo" window kept blinking.
Some information on my hardware:
My graphics card is ATI Integrated Radeon HD4200, which is listed as a working card in this link http://www.ros.org/wiki/simulator_gazebo/SystemRequirements
I thought it was related to the graphic card driver. So I tried two ways to install the driver:

manually installed the latest driver ati-driver-installer-11-2-x86.x86_64 
use "system"-"Administration"-"Hardware Drivers" and "activate" the default driver listed there.

But the problem still exist, still blinking. Any idea on this?
Thank you in advance.
Vincent

A:

You can try disabling compiz, that should fix blinking.

That happens with AMD cards only, I suppose that's a driver "feature"... future driver revisions will probably fix this.

Yes that solved the problem~ Thanks a lot! So it's a conflict between compiz and gazebo?
