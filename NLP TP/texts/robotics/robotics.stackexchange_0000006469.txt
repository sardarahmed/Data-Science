Q:

Is there a name for the steering style/wheel actuation used on Curiosity?

I read up on the wheels of Curiosity, and also about the suspension. But is there a name for the steering? It looks similar in nature to the front landing gear on an airplane, but searching those terms didn't turn up and answer. I've attached a picture with the area of interest highlighted.

A:

Rocker-bogie is the suspension. The steering is Ackermann.
