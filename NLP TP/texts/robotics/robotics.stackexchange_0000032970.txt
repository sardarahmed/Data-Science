Q:

Robot Model in rviz problems

Work though the urdf tutorials but keep getting errors that visually wrong results. Every link has the error "No transform from [...name...] to [/base_link]"
For example when trying to see the turtlebot model from turtlebot_description I get:

What am I missing? I have urdf_tools.
Thank you

A:

You probably need to start either the robot_state_publisher which converts joint_states + urdf into a number of TF transforms, or the joint_state_publisher which will output joint_states for a robot when not connected to real hardware which does so.
