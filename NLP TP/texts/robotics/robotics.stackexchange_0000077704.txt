Q:

Raspberry Pi Robots and custom sensors

So I am extremely new to ROS, so apologies if this is this years worse question.
I have ROS installed on a Pi, which has a BrickPi shield (drives Lego motors).  ROS works on the Pi as I can see my Neato Lidar data from it (pi is master with Lidar attached)  I used rviz to see the Lidar data.
Aim:  For the Pi to move around an area based on Lidar readings.  The pi is mounted on a LEGO tracked platform (powered by the BrickPi)  This can be controlled via Python
So, am I correct in thinking I need to build a BrickPi Python driver for ROS to use?
Then somehow model the robot in 3D for Rviz to display?

A:

Yes, I think you've got the gist of it. You would want to create a BrickPi_ROS package that handles the communication between ROS and the BrickPi. Here is an examples of a similar ros driver for a motor controller.
https://github.com/smd-ros-devel/kangaroo_x2_driver
It would probably subscribe to a cmd_vel topic and publish encoder data if there is any
Then you may want to use a mapping package like gmapping to turn your LIDAR data into a occupancy map
And a package like AMCL to figure out where you are in the map
And then finally a package like move_base to navigate around autonomously.
Hope that helps

Helps? thats freaking awesome mate.   I will let you know how I get on, do you do much ROS yourself?
