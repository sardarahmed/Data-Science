Q:

error in "Non-ROS Installation" of ROSJAVA

I followed the instruction here   rosjava.github.io/rosjava_core/latest/installing.html
and I failed at this command line at Non-ROS installation :
git checkout -b hydro origin/hydro
the error is:
Fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories) .git
Can anybody help me with this?
I just want to set up the developing environment of rosjava for Android.
I have installed ROS hydro on Ubuntu 12.04.
Thanks!

A:

The documentation is missing one step. The sequence should be:
git clone <censored*>://github.com/rosjava/rosjava_core
cd rosjava_core
git checkout -b hydro origin/hydro

Removed the 'https' prefix from the url to avoid display problems.
