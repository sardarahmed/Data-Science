Q:

problem installing ros in fedora 13

Hi,
I'm trying to install ROS Electric in Linux Fedora 13, and I get the error below. 
Someone experiencing the same? What I'm doing wrong? 
I followed the Fedora Installation Instructions, and already had ROS installed in other machine and everything went fine, but I realy need this in Fedora 13.

Detected ros_comm bootstrapping it too.

A:

ROS Electric is designed to work with Python 2.6, which I believe is also the default for Fedora 13.  See REP 3
Based on your error message you're running an older version of python which is going to be a big challenge, needing to patch many files.
