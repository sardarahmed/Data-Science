Q:

problem with rosmaking mrpt_common package

I'm using Ubuntu 10.04 and installed ros-electric
I downloaded the mrpt_common package with folloeing script
  svn co http://mrpt-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/mrpt_common

and rosmake it.
However, error occurred.
  bcddivad@bcddivad-desktop:~/code/ros/MRPT/mrpt_common$ rosmake

  bcddivad@bcddivad-desktop:~/code/ros/MRPT/mrpt_common$ 

I have the following line in my ~/.bashrc
  export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/bcddivad/code/ros;
  source /opt/ros/electric/setup.bash
  export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/bcddivad/code/ros/turtle_tf:/opt/ros/electric/stacks;

How can I solve this?

A:

Your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH is wrong and the lines in your .bashrc look pretty messy. First you set the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH to the directory /home/bcddivad/code/ros, then you overwrite it and it is probably set to /opt/ros/electric/stacks and then you overwrite it again by setting it to /home/bcddivad/code/ros/turtle_tf:/opt/ros/electric/stacks which removes /home/bcddivad/code/ros.
In general, this kind of problems can easily be avoided by using something like rosws. Also have a look at this answer for a quick way to get things set up cleanly using rosws.
A quick fix in your case would be to edit ~/.bashrc and replace the three lines you posted by:
source /opt/ros/electric/setup.bash
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$HOME/code/ros:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

That way, you use everything set up in /opt/ros/electric/setup.bash and you add $HOME/code/ros and all its subdirectories. You can verify the current ROS_PACKAGE_PATH by executing `echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH`.
