Q:

openni_launch problems with kinect and asus, electric and fuerte

I've tried getting openni_launch to work on Ubuntu 12.04 with fuerte and a Kinect, also on 11.10 with electric and Kinect and on 11.10 with an Asus Xtion Pro Live and now on a second computer running 11.10, electric and the Asus camera. I'm convinced that there's got to be something wrong with the package. I've followed the instructions to the letter. Latest attempt with 11.10, electric and Asus Xtion.
Are there known problems? I've spent probably 40 hours trying to get it working and hired an experienced ROS developer who has probably 15-20 hours into trying to get it working. Are there known problems with it? Has the project been abandoned?

A:

it has to be
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch

and also in feurte use
rosdep install package_name

instead of rosmake package_name --rosdep-install
