Q:

Release schedule for ROS Noetic

Is there a release schedule/timeline/roadmap for releasing ROS Noetic?
When is it likely to available in Ubuntu (next Ubuntu release Focal Fossa is scheduled for April 2020)?

A:

Release schedules (or more correctly: dates) are typically listed on the wiki/Distributions page. Specifically in the Upcoming Releases section.
For Noetic, there is this:

The next release of ROS 1 will be called ROS Noetic Ninjemys.

See ros-infrastructure/rep#202 for proposed updates to Target Platforms (REP 3) with details on targetted versions of OS, C++, Python and other libraries and tools.

Both wiki/Distributions and ros-infrastructure/rep#202 show the current planned released date for Noetic to be: May, 2020.
And it's not really a roadmap per se (more of a TODO list), but ros/rosdistro#21513 (Noetic Kick-off and Release Checklist) has details on the status of the (many) tasks that have to be completed before May.
