Q:

ROS 2: rqt vs rqt_graph

In ROS 2, what is the difference between the rqt and rqt_graph commands?  They both seem to bring up the rqt visualizer, which works great.  Is there actually a difference?  Does one simlink to the other?  I'm using Ubuntu 20.04 if that matters.

A:

rqt is a generic visualizer which has a plugin interface. The rqt generic executable is provided by the rqt_gui package.
rqt_graph is a specific plugin for rqt that provides a convenience command line executable with the same name to launch the visualizer specifically configured with that plugin loaded.
