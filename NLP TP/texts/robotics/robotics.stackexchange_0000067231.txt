Q:

Build failed in Jenkins: Eigen Dependency in Indigo

I tried to release a ROS Indigo version of a package, but I got an email back saying that "the build failed in Jenkins". This seems to be the error:
Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Eigen" with any of
  the following names:

    EigenConfig.cmake
    eigen-config.cmake

However, the package's package.xml has both a build and a run dependency on cmake_modules, and the CMakeLists file contains:
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS cmake_modules [...])

find_package(Eigen REQUIRED)

UPDATE
According to the answer below, I've updated the CMakeLists.txt: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atenpas/handle_detector/indigo/CMakeLists.txt
However, Jenkins is still failing with the same error message as before.

A:

Try the following please:
find_package(catkin REQUIRED cmake_modules )
find_package(Eigen REQUIRED)

where cmake_modules is not a component
Maybe a stupid question: did you install Eigen on your board?

Interesting. I have another project that was released successfully in ROS Indigo which uses catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS cmake_modules ...

Fixed now?
Comment by atp on 2015-04-25:
I fixed it in the CMakeLists file. I only know whether it helped when I get the next email from Jenkins.

Do I have to make a new release? I pushed the changes onto the repository's branch, but they don't seem to be in Jenkins build from last night ...

Actually, to be more precise: is it possible to see what code is trying to be compiled in Jenkins?
