Q:

ROS QoS vs ROS2 QoS

Is there anyway to have similar QoS policies to ROS (as the ones in ROS2) ?
Or is this a DDS specific feature?

A:

This is a DDS specific feature (and actually one of the reasons DDS was chosen as the default middleware for ROS 2).
The things you can change to the ROS 1 "QoS" (in quotes, as it isn't really the same thing) are specified in the TransportHints structure.
