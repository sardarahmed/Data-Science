Q:

stage.rviz missing and URDF

Hello all,
I followed the tutorial on stage for simulating one robot but in the stage stack there is not such file as a stage.rviz. Only a stage.vcg which according to the error prompted is the old extension file.
Where can I find the stage.rviz I can't see to find it anywhere.
Second, I have a URDF file for my robot. How can I load it in Stage using Rviz ? I know that Rviz is going to use it if I launch joint_state_publisher and launch the robot_state_publisher node with my URDF in argument. But will it works if I use that command ?
roscd stage
rosrun rviz rviz -d `rospack find stage_ros`/rviz/stage.rviz

I would try it myself but I just can't find a stage.rviz to load and try for now. I just don't really quite see how to combine everything here. What I want to achieve is to use a stage world for the simulation in Rviz as I want to design a path finding robot. I just want to give him some sort of "world to play with".
Thanks a lot.

Did you figure this out?

A:

I'll just half answer myself in case someone is wondering. Just load the URDF in the parameter and it should be working, the robot model will be loaded. I still don't know where to find stage.rviz.

I suspect the stage maintainers haven't upgraded the rviz configuration, and stage.rviz simply doesn't exist.
