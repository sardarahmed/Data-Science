Q:

Orbbec Astra Camera. Unable to receive images. Missing configuration files

Hello.
So, I run roslaunch astra_launch astra.launch and use Rviz to test out my Orbbec Astra camera. The problem is that the launch application gives me these messages if I try to subscribe to a topic on Rviz:
[ WARN] [1498238437.855693874]: Camera calibration file /home/tbot1/.ros/camera_info/rgb_Astra_Orbbec.yaml not found. 
[ WARN] [1498238564.009640794]: Camera calibration file /home/tbot1/.ros/camera_info/depth_Astra_Orbbec.yaml not found.

I've looked around and I can't seem to find any configuration files similar to what it's asking for.
Can anybody help me? Thanks.

A:

These are not files that are part of the source or binary distribution, as they are unique to each camera: they contain calibration values for the intrinsics of your sensor.
To generate them, you'll have to calibrate the camera. See wiki/openni_launch/Intrinsic calibration of the Kinect cameras for a tutorial (it doesn't completely apply though, according to this post on the ORBBEC forum).

Thank you! We're trying to calibrate it now!
