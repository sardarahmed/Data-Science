Q:

What is the difference between  and ?

I'm pretty new here but wanted to let you guys know I had en error while just follwing the tutorial.
When I reached the "msg and srv" part (  http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingMsgAndSrv ) I encountered an error.
I was asked to put
<exec_depend>message_runtime</exec_depend>
in my package.xml file.
When I entered
$ rosmsg show beginner_tutorials/Num

This was the error I got :

- The manifest (with format version 1) must not contain the following tags: exec_depend

In a youtube video ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4bpTU_bdPs ) I saw
<run_depend>message_runtime</run_depend>
was used instead. This worked perfectly fine for me.
What is the difference between the two of them exactly? Thanks in advance.

A:

It is new convention in catkin package format 2. Basically the <run_depend> tag was replaced by <exec_depend>.
To define format 2 package replace <package> tag in your package.xml file with <package format="2">.
For more information have a look at the documentation here and migration guide from format 1 to format 2 here.
