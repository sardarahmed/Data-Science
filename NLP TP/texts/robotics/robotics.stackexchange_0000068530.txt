Q:

rostpoic pub & teleop_key

reference: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UsingRqtconsoleRoslaunch
I have a question:
when 'roslaunch' launchs the turtlemimic.launch file, there appears two turtles' window. Why can I only use 'rostopic pub' command to drive the turtle1, however, I cannot use 'rosrun turtlesim turtle_teleop_key' command to do that.
the instruction page: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UsingRqtconsoleRoslaunch
the 'rostopic pub' command:
$ rostopic pub /turtlesim1/turtle1/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist -r 1 -- '[2.0, 0.0, 0.0]' '[0.0, 0.0, -1.8]'
the 'rosrun turtlesim turtle_teleop_key' command:
$ rosrun turtlesim turtle_teleop_key

I cannot use 'rosrun turtlesim turtle_teleop_key' command to do that. That's my question.

the unchanged command: $ rostopic pub /turtlesim1/turtle1/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist -r 1 -- '[2.0, 0.0, 0.0]' '[0.0, 0.0, -1.8]' works well.
