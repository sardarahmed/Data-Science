Q:

velodyne_rawscan md5sum missmatch

Hi all,
I am trying to get velodyne rawscan from a input bag which publishes velodyne_common/RawScan (topic= velodyne/rawscan) but I get this error,
Waiting 0.2 seconds after advertising topics...
[ERROR] [1308039369.255405494]: Client [/my_3D_to_2D] wants topic /velodyne/rawscan to have datatype/md5sum [velodyne_common/RawScan/a36da642742ddd79774fbc755f9c5cdd], but our version has [velodyne_common/RawScan/d34cf5a37a401b668e53c57f6409eb76]. Dropping connection.

Please help me.
Edit:
I am playing the bag and trying to subscribe the topic /velodyne/rawscan in a program and print the subscribed input on stdout, but I get the errer and even after using "rostopic echo /velodyne/rawscan" while playing bag I get the following error:
[ERROR] [1308109245.015874373]: Client [/rostopic_13899_1308109244719] wants topic /velodyne/rawscan to have datatype/md5sum [velodyne_common/RawScan/a36da642742ddd79774fbc755f9c5cdd], but our version has [velodyne_common/RawScan/d34cf5a37a401b668e53c57f6409eb76]. Dropping connection

A:

Your problem is that you have a bag file with different message versions than the code you are running.  Usually the bag files were recorded in a past version of ROS and are incompatible.  You should be able to use rosbag fix to fix the bag files.
