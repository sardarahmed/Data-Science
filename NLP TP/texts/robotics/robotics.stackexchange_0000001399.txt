Q:

Wearable Accelerometor

I've worked with wiimote accelerometer, but I think now I want to move past that. Mostly because I want to have a wider range of available gestures and I think that using only one accelerometer has too many limitations for what I want to do. I'm looking for something compatible with arduino or RPi. Does anyone have recommendations on how I should do this?

A:

What you want is a three-axis (or sometimes triple-axis, three-axes) accelerometer, which will allow you to detect the magnitude and direction of the acceleration. If you want to detect the acceleration of one part relative to another part, then you need an accelerometer for each part. I2C is a reasonably standard sensor protocol. I2C accelerometers are available off-the-shelf, and Arduino has libraries for I2C communication.
