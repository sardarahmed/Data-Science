Q:

Camera Calibration Matrix accuracy

When we do camera calibration, we have to find calibration matrix $M$, which is found by first finding extrinsic matrix and then intrinsic matrix. To validate the accuracy of calibration matrix, we compare groundtruth projections $points \times intrinsic-matrix$ against prediction $points \times extrinsic-matrix \times intrinsic-matrix$. To illustrate results, I plotted the figure below. Source
Question: Why the projections from $points \times intrinsic-matrix$ are regarded as the groundtruth please?

A:

The reason that it's the ground truth is because in the tutorial it's all synthetic data and it's using the ground truth parameters of the model to calculate/construct those values exactly.

First we define the necessary parameters and create the camera extrinsic matrix and intrinsic matrix. These are required to build the pipeline and prepare the ground truth.

This example is not how to do a camera calibration in the real world but is teaching you the fundamentals of how the calibration algorithms work, thus you can know the ground truth before you try to do the optimization so see the performance.
