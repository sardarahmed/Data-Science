Q:

Can't locate node sick_tim3xx in package sick_tim3xx

I'm using the SICK_TIM310 laser scanner using ROS Fuerte. I have tried installing the appropriate package from github using (I didn't include the https:// at the start because my karma is insufficient)

svn co github.com/uos/sick_tim3xx.git

in my stacks folder and everything went fine until I tried

roslaunch sick_tim3xx
sick_tim3xx.launch

I get an error saying that sick_tim3xx is not a package eventhough it was in my stacks folder. As a result, I tried downloading the files in a zip file from github and unzipped it to the stacks folder and roslaunch works fine but I get the following error now;

core service [/rosout] found

process[robot_state_publisher-1]: started with pid [27496]

ERROR: cannot launch node of type [sick_tim3xx/sick_tim3xx]: can't
locate node [sick_tim3xx] in package
[sick_tim3xx]

So looks like it is unable to find the sick_tim3xx node. Could I please get some assistance on how to solve this?

hello, I have the same problem with you. Did you solve this problem? Could you tell me how?

A:

You didn't build your package. Run rosmake sick_tim3xx.
