Q:

CMake Error Findurdf.cmake

Hi,
I'm running the UR5-package on indigo against Ubuntu 14.04.
Everything works fine, but since a while I get the following error when catkin_make my workspace.
CMake Error at /opt/ros/indigo/share/kdl_parser/cmake/kdl_parserConfig.cmake:165 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findurdf.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "urdf", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "urdf" with any of
  the following names:

    urdfConfig.cmake
    urdf-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "urdf" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "urdf_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "urdf"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /opt/ros/indigo/share/moveit_core/cmake/moveit_coreConfig.cmake:165 (find_package)
  /opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:75 (find_package)
  universal_robot/ur_kinematics/CMakeLists.txt:4 (find_package)

make: *** [cmake_check_build_system] Error 1
Invoking "make cmake_check_build_system" failed

I did not knowingly change anything.
Anybody knows where that does come from?
Best regards
P.S.: please note I'm a beginner concerning ROS...

Just to make sure: try deleting your build/ and devel/ directories. Then rebuild your workspace.

I deleted both, rebuilt the workspace but got the same error then :(

As described in the answer I chose the way of reinstalling ROS and it is working.
Thanks for your support!! :)

A:

Okay, I uninstalled ROS completely (debian packages and their configs) via
sudo apt-get purge ros-indigo-*

and reinstalled it like described in the tutorial. Then reinstalled the moveit-package and catkin_make the workspace and everything is working well again. (I did not change the workspace).
I guess something was broken in the opt/ros/* folders. Weird...
Thanks gvdhoorn for support!!
