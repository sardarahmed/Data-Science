Q:

mutable_gravity in tutorial

Hello!
As you guess, I have started to study the tutorials for the gazebo plugins.
I was doing the "Programmatic World Control" (http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=plugins_world_properties&cat=write_plugin)
and in the line that change the gravity:
// Change gravity
      msgs::Set(physicsMsg.mutable_gravity(),
          ignition::math::Vector3d(0.01, 0, 0.1));

It uses physicsMsg.mutable_gravity()
I searched the API for the definition of mutable_gravity() but I couldn't find something.
As I try to understand what is going on I need to know where I can find these definitions.
Could anybody point me the direction?
Kind regards,
Angelos

good question

A:

gazebo::msgs::Physics is generated using protobuf. The method mutable_gravity() is automatically generated from the field optional Vector3d gravity in the protobuf file. Here is an overview of using protubuf in C++. This link describes the C++ code generated from protobuf messages. And this link is the protobuf definition in gazebo 8 for the mesage you're using.
