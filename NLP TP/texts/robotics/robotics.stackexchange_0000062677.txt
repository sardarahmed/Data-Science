Q:

How to use multiple RGB cameras with ROS?

Hi dear ROS community!
I would like to learn how to use multiple RGB cameras with ROS in a single PC. I already know how to use a single camera with the gscam package, I can read the video stream in the /camera/image_raw topic.
However, I couldn't find any information about the use of multiple cameras with ROS (let's say 3). I would like to create a node for each camera ( e.g. /camera01/image_raw, /camera02/image_raw, etc.) and then process them separatedly. I don't know if this is possible using gscam.
In general, what is the proper way (good practice) to use multiple RGB cameras with ROS?
Thank you very much!

I don't know about RGB, but for RGBD it is possible to use multiple Kinects. Look into the openni_launch-package. There you can give each camera it's own namespace, like you proposed in your question

A:

Generally, running multiple copies of the same system is easy enough, since each node has it's own private namespace.
However, having used gscam, this might be tricky because it's very un-ROS in the way it reads the device name from an environment variable.
If you use usb_cam, you should be able to specify the input device for each node with the video_device parameter.
