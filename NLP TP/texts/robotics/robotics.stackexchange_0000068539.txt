Q:

Velodyne driver installation

I am trying to install the drivers for Velodyne 32E. I downloaded the folder from https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne and then I am typing cmake ../ to build it.
I am getting an error:
--from catkin.environment_cache import generate_environment_script
--ImportError: No module named catkin.environment_cache
I have installed catkin_pkg using pip.
What should I do?

A:

That is not the way to build any ROS package, including the Velodyne driver.
ROS packages are built using catkin_make, or some similar tool. See the catkin documentation, many tutorials and API documents are listed there.
EDIT: start with the first three catkin tutorials:

creating a workspace
creating a package
using a workspace

That should teach you how build this or any other ROS package.
EDIT2: There are instructions for installing ROS on OSX, but I have only used Linux. OSX does not look easy, but some people do successfully use it.
Those instructions recommend homebrew rather than macports.

Thank you for your reply!
I am really new with all these. I haven't use ROS before. I though that by installing catkin and catkin_pkg, I would be okay. Apparently I am not. Could you please help me by enumerating a few steps that I have to follow? My goal is to convert pcap files to pcd files.

I forgot to mention that I am using a mac.

Thank you again! I did as you said and I found a problem installing pcl_ros:
$catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
...
Add the installation prefix of "Eigen3" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.....
I have Eigen3 installed with macports. What should I do?
