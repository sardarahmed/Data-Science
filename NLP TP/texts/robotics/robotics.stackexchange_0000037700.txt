Q:

Turtlebot Dashboard Warning : robot_state_publisher

I am getting the following warning from my turtlebot dashboard:
Node: /robot_state_publisher
Time: 1328731882.225292572
Severity: Warn
Location: /tmp/buildd/ros-electric-robot-model-1.6.4/debian/ros-electric-robot-model/opt/ros/electric/stacks/robot_model/kdl_parser/src/kdl_parser.cpp:treeFromUrdfModel:173
Published Topics: /rosout

The root link base_footprint has an inertia specified in the URDF, but KDL does not support a root link with an inertia.  As a workaround, you can add an extra dummy link to your URDF.

Does anyone have an idea as to what is causing this warning, and how to fix it?  Thank you very much!

I have updated to the latest packages, and I am still getting this error when I run minimal.launch
