Q:

win_ros on debian squezze

I want to install the win_ros packages in order to have a cross-compiling build environment for mingw programs. I was following the guide (in http://www.ros.org/wiki/diamondback/Installation/Windows) but I get this error:
/srv/ros$ rosinstall /srv/ros http://code.google.com/p/win-ros-pkg/source/browse/stacks/win_ros/trunk/winmaster_diamondback.rosinstall
rosinstall operating on /srv/ros from specifications in rosinstall files /srv/ros/.rosinstall, http://code.google.com/p/win-ros-pkg/source/browse/stacks/win_ros/trunk/winmaster_diamondback.rosinstall
ahhhhhhhh, yaml parse error: mapping values are not allowed here
in "<file>", line 46, column 28
Usage: rosinstall PATH [<options> ...] [URI]...

rosinstall: error: None

Are there any other requirement to use correctly this rosinstall command?

A:

The problem is that the URL you are using is the HTML rendering of the rosinstall file. You have to use the raw file (there is a "view raw file" link on that page). Using the following line, it works:
rosinstall /srv/ros http://win-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/stacks/win_ros/trunk/winmaster_diamondback.rosinstall
