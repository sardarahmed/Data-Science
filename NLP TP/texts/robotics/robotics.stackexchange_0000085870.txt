Q:

How to catkin_make one package

I'm trying to install my custom ROS workspace from source.
What I've done is to download the source code of version of ros-kinetic-ros-base, then I add some additional packages into ros-base.
When I add one package, I always execute ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release to catkin_make all packages. This gonna take much time.
So I'm thinking if I can catkin_make only one package that I added because others have been installed before.
For example, here is the structure of my ros-base:
/home/ros/
|-----------src
|-----------build_isolated
|-----------devel_isolated
|-----------install_isolated
As you see, all have been done correctly after executing ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release. Now I add a package named newPkg into ./src. To rebuild, I have to execute the command again, which will rebuild all packages.
So is it possible to catkin_make the only one package?

A:

Check #q54178.
Personnally I use catkin_make -DCATKIN_WHITELIST_PACKAGES="foo;bar".
