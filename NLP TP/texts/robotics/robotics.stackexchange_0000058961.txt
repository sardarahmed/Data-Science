Q:

Looking for sample code except for PCL/Tutorial

I'm looking for some sample code except for codes on the page( http://wiki.ros.org/pcl/Tutorials ) to get more knowledge about relationship between ROS and PCL. Could anybody tell me an information if knowing the web page that puts sample code? My goal is to build a people detection.

A:

For example,

https://github.com/davetcoleman/point_cloud_lab
https://github.com/ankush-me/sandbox444/blob/master/display_pointCloud/src/display.cpp

I think that a code display.cpp on 2. is interesting, because this program can show images acquired fromfromROSMsg on visualizer.
