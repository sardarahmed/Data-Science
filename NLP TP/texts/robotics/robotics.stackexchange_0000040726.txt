Q:

Is anyone else thinking about wrapping the leap for ROS?

This seems like it would be really fun in our community!

The Leap technology is 200 times more
accurate than anything else on the
market â€” at any price point. Just
about the size of a flash drive, the
Leap can distinguish your individual
fingers and track your movements down
to a 1/100th of a millimeter.

Doesn't look like it has Linux support yet... :(

It does support Linux, however I am not sure what is it ! It is surely NOT OpenNi and they have not yet unveiled their technology. So a ROS port-in may only be possible if one can 'hack-into' the hardware, I was seriously thinking on the lines of using Arduino as a middle level hardware.

A:

I just integrated the Leap in ROS. Functionality is limited but you are welcome to fork me on GitHub: https://github.com/warp1337/rosleapmotion
