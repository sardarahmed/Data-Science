Q:

What is 'slop' in ApproximateTimeSynchronizer?

I'm going through the message filters in ros noetic and came across the following class.
class message_filters.ApproximateTimeSynchronizer(fs, queue_size, slop, allow_headerless=False, reset=False)

What does the parameter slop stand for?

A:

From this documentation line 237:

"slop" parameter in the constructor that defines the delay (in seconds) with which messages can be synchronized

I would point to the Python API documentation for ApproximateTimeSynchronizer instead.

Very good point, thank you!

Hello, however this param is missing in the C++ API. May I know why?

Please see #q375572 (among others, such as #q284758). The comments point to  setMaxIntervalDuration(..).
