Q:

Problem in running brown driver?

Every time when I need to start the brown_drivers irobot_create_2_1 I need to change the port /dev/ttyS0 to /dev/ttyACM0 using terminal command.
rosparam set /brown/irobot_create_2_1/port /dev/ttyACM0 

moreover I need to get permission to open the port ttyACM0 (using terminal command as bellow) as my user at ubuntu system do not have access.
sudo chmod 0777 /dev/ttyACM0 

Please tell me what change should I make in driver.py node of irobot_create_2_1 package so that I need not to change the port from /dev/ttyS0 to /dev/ttyACM0 every time?
Please do tell me how I can get permanent access to open the port /dev/ttyACM0.

A:

It sounds like you need to write a udev rule. udev can map new devices to whatever name you want and can even change permissions. There are lots of guides on the interwebs for how to do this, and this one should get you started.  Good luck.
