Q:

rviz over Wifi "brw_upload_constant_buffer: Assertion" failed

I have ros setup on two machines connected by wifi, one on my robot, the other on a laptop, using the ROS_MASTER_URI approach.  I've confirmed proper operation using the tutorials.
When I start rviz, it connects and brings up the gui for a spit second (I can see my robot model and everything as it should be), then crashes with this error:
rviz: brw_burbe.c:265: brw_upload_constant_buffer: Assertion 'brw->vs.constant_map[i] <= nr' failed.
Any idea what's happening or how to fix this?
Thanks!

A:

Does this happen when you run ROS and Rviz on all one machine?  I don't think that the error you put is in any way related to the networking portions of rviz.
