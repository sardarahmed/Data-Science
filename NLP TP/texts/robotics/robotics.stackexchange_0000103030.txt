Q:

ROS2 rolling header location for different Ubuntu version

I have two clean installed Ubuntu, 20.04 and 22.04, and both of them are installed with ROS2 rolling.
Somehow I found their std_msgs headers are located in different folders as shown .
The Ubuntu 22.04 has one more extra include layer for the std_msgs. Is this the expected behavior for different Ubuntu versions?
Thanks!

I wouldn't call it behaviour, but: yes, this is expected. See ros2/ros2#1150 for context.
Note: unless you're (planning to) manually manage your include paths, this change should not have any affect on your development workflow. CMake will take care of sorting things out for you.

please note: Rolling on Focal (20.04) is no longer being updated. It saw its last sync on 2022-01-28, which is over a year ago. See the following discussions for context:

Preparing ROS 2 Rolling for the transition to Ubuntu 22.04
Preparing for final Rolling sync on Ubuntu Focal 2022-01-25
Rolling Ridley has rolled onto Ubuntu Jammy
New packages for ROS 2 Rolling Ridley 2022-01-28

Basically: Rolling on Focal is very different from Rolling on Jammy.
