Q:

What's the name of a robot manipulator construction with multiple thin arms joined together?

I am seeing on some videos robots picking items and putting them somewhere in order.
Here are some examples:

How are these types of manipulators called and where can I find schematic illustration explaining principles of its work?

A:

They are parallel manipulators.
You may find chapters on parallel manipulators in robotics textbooks, for example, A Mathematical Introduction to
Robotic Manipulation, useful. There are also a number of articles related to kinematics analysis of those manipulators (such as this article).
