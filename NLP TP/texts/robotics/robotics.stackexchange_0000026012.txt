Q:

Problem with with DRCSim 2.2 tutorial

Hey Guys,
I am new to Gazebo/ROS/DRC Simulator. I tried following  this tutorial:
DRC Tutorial: Atlas Robot whole-body joint trajectory control  to get me started. But I ran into this error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
File "traj_yaml.py", line 79, in

interpCommand = (1-ratio)*initialPosition + ratio *
commandPosition ValueError: operands
could not be broadcast together with
shapes (0) (28)

Which after some debugging, I concluded that the function jointStatesCallback was not being called at all. After issuing the following command
rosservice list
I get a list that does not include '/atlas/joint_states', which the program is trying to subscribe to.
I'll appreciate some insight as to what I am doing wrong here. The DRC Simulator works fine for other tutorials.
Thanks.

/atlas/joint_states is actually a ros topic, so try rostopic list.
