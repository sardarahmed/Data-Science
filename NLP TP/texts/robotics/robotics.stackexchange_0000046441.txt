Q:

Catkin-izing OpenCV-based package

I converted my package that relies on OpenCV to catkin but I am getting lots of OpenCV errors. Is there somewhere that documents the required OpenCV changes to port to the new version?
catkin_make is outputting these errors.
This is my CMakeLists.txt and this is the Github package repo.
Thanks!

A:

You need opencv and all the other elements in your CATKIN_DEPENDS element also in your find_package call.  CATKIN_DEPENDS only exposes those elements to your downstream packages, not your own package.

perfect, thanks! each dependency sure requires a lot of duplication in the package.xml and CMakeLists.txt
