Q:

Which camera for turtle3 burger and how to plug it?

I sent these questions to turtlebot@osrfoundation.org , and they answered me to ask them here.
I am preparing a course with Turtlebot3 burgers for Master 2 students at a French engineers school called Efrei.
I intend to make them run on the autonomous race track from that page: http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/autonomous_driving/#autonomous-driving
But first, they need to plug the camera on the turtlebot3 burger.
The web page refers to "See Features of 4 screw holes in the page very carefully before mounting on the frame of any conductive materials"
But I could not find that page, even on Google.
Do you know if there is any guide or video for that, please ?
Another question: the webpage refers to that model: https://www.waveshare.com/rpi-camera-g.htm
But the appendix about the raspberry pi camera refers to another one: http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/appendix_raspi_cam/
Which one do I have to buy, in order to avoid problems as much as possible ?
