Q:

changing roslaunch parameter

Hi!
I would like to use an external webcam with a laptop that already has a built-in webcam which is mapped to /dev/video0.
The uvc_camera node wants to use /dev/video0 and  would like to change it to /dev/video1 is there any way to change the parameter from command line?
I know I could change the .launch file, but I don't want to touch it.
I tried to run roslaunch as follows, but it didn't work:
roslaunch uvc_camera camera_node.launch device:=/dev/video1

What is the best way to change a parameter in roslaunch without editing the original roslaunch file?
Update 1:
In the meantime I just found out, that if I copy the original launch file to somewhere in my home directory, I can edit it and I can launch it from there as well. This was probably too obvious, but I was confused by having the package name after the roslaunch command. For example:
cp /opt/ros/groovy/stacks/camera_umd/uvc_camera/launch/camera_node.launch /home/user/ros_workspace/
roslaunch /home/user/ros_workspace/camera_node.launch

A:

As you said, no parameters are defined for that launch script. It is possible to add them.

Simple solution: make a copy of the script in a package of your own (e.g. my_camera_params), and edit to taste.

Complete solution: open an enhancement ticket, fork that UMD git repository, add <arg> tags for all the parameters, submit a pull request to Ken Tossell.

You can also modify the (private) parameter value after the launch file has run, from the calling/external code.  This technique will not help in this case, though, since the uvc_camera node only reads the parameter value at initial start-up.
