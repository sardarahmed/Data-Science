Q:

Find Eigen on OS X

I'm currently using this method:
project(grizzly_msgs)
find_package(catkin REQUIRED)
find_package(Eigen REQUIRED)

catkin_package(
  INCLUDE_DIRS include ${Eigen_INCLUDE_DIRS} 
  DEPENDS eigen
)

This works great in Ubuntu and on the buildfarm, but gave me a problem when I attempted to compile under OS X / Indigo / homebrewâ€”unable to find the EigenConfig.cmake module. I have Eigen 3.2 installed via homebrew, but it doesn't seem to supply a cmake module. Is there some better way to do this which will work for Ubuntu and other OSes?

Update: Looks like the FindEigen.cmake module is right there in the usual place:
/opt/ros/indigo/share/cmake_modules/cmake/Modules/FindEigen.cmake
Do I need to build_depend on cmake_modules in order for cmake to find these?

A:

Ah yes, need to build_depend on it and then find it. Details here:

Yes, this is in the Indigo migration guide: http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Migration#catkin
