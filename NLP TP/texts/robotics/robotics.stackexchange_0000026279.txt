Q:

Any C++ example for DRCSIM v2.5?

Just could find examples for python at DRCSIM v2.5 and my old C++ ROS node is not working anymore as we should disable BDI control and use AtlasCommands and not JointCommands anymore... There is any workaround for this problem?

A:

There's a new tutorial for the forthcoming drcsim 2.6 that's in C++.  That should mostly work for you on 2.5, with the exception of the desired_controller_period_ms variable in the command message; that's not present in 2.5.
You can also look at the code for the pub_atlas_command tool, which we use for testing.
