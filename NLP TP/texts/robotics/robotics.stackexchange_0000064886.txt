Q:

How to aviod running the command "source devel/setup.bash"

Hello All,
I've built a catkin package which has a main node and links against a repository. My problem is that everytime I need to use the package I have to run  "source devel/setup.bash" before running the command 'rosrun'. Otherwise, I receive an error.Is there any way to solve this problem and avoid to run this command everytime?
Thanks.

A:

If you add  source ~/ROS_WS/devel/setup.bash to your bashrc it will automatically source it as soon as you open the terminal.

Note: if you have multiple workspaces, adding a source .. line to your .bashrc is actually a pita.

@gvdhoorn. By a pita you mean is not good? if so, What do you suggest?

Yes, a 'pita' is not good :).
If you have multiple catkin workspaces (not multiple packages), you could perhaps do something with suitably configured terminals (ie: have each terminal source a different setup.bash). Then start the appropriate terminal. Personally, I just source my workspaces.

Thanks, I get it. So far I have edited bashrc file because sometimes things get complicated and I forget some details so by editing bash file I reduce the probability of receiving errors.
