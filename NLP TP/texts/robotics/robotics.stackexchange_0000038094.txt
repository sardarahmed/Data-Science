Q:

Does a xacro exist for the kinect

To date, I have put together two robot systems that use a kinect sensor.  My current approach is to copy and paste the kinect urdf into each of the system urdf's (this is obviously prone to errors).  It seems to me that the kinect is complex enough and used by enough people that a common xacro would be useful.  Does anybody know if there is a xacro for the kinect sensor itself.
