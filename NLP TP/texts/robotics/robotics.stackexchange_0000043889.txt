Q:

how to kill brown driver from a node

Hi,
I am implementing an algorithm on icreate and i am using brown driver for this.
I have an issue that when my node finishes its task, i want brown driver binary to stop as well. Otherwise, the robot keeps going although i kill the node.
How can i kill the brown driver from a node?
Any help is appreciated.

A:

Generally speaking, robot control through the starting and stopping of processes is sloppy and hard to control. Is it not possible for you to just send some sort of "stop" command, instead?

Thanks firstly. i just wanted to somehow integrate into the launch file. It might be the driver's buffer issue as well. However, i do not have much control over the the brown driver. I was wondering how to trigger a system call from the node.

You really shouldn't be doing this. What are you trying to do exactly?

Actually, the robot is doing coverage for some cells according to the algorithm and the robot does not stop somehow ! So i wanted to stop brown driver which will cause the stopping for sure. There might be some sync. issue as well.

I'm doing some work with odometry, and I reboot the driver each time I start (to zero the wheel odometry).  In all of the code I wrote, I have a shutdown command that kills all of my nodes triggered by the end-of-experiment condition, but I still need to ctrl-c kill the driver.
