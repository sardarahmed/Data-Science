Q:

How to create a simple map for simulation in stdr simulator?

I want to carry out a simple simulation in stdr simulator for which I'll be needing a simple map with four boundaries i.e. a square room. How do I create a map for this purpose?

A:

It has been a while since I have used stdr_simulator but map in only a png file.
So you can create such map manually in a drawing software like GIMP.
Then, add a metadata file with the same name but with the .yaml extension. This file will contain the following elements:
image: frieburg.png
resolution: 0.05
origin: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
occupied_thresh: 0.6
free_thresh: 0.3
negate: 0

The above example comes from the stdr_ressouces package.
