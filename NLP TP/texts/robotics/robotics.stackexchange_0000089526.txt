Q:

Mysteries of the skeleton trackers

Hey folks,
we are currently looking for a skeleton tracker we can use in our ROS project. We found these

skeleton_markers -> works only with
indigo, not with kinetic and is in
“end-of-life”
openni_tracker -> does not even work
with indigo
other stuff like the
Chaos84/skeleton_tracker are oftern
many years old as well and very
poorly documented

What happened to them? Did they simply get out of fashion because something else replaced them or some companies bought some technologies (Apple)?
Do you know of a well maintained skeleton tracker already integrated in ROS or outside?
Thanks!

Hi felixd,
Did you find something ?
Comment by felixd on 2019-04-05:
@alterf Yeah, please see below.

A:

We finally ended up using the concepts openni2_tracker but had to heavily modify (=rewrite) it, since the code was so bad. Unfortunately I cannot release it publicly since I do not have the required rights to do so.
(Sorry for the late answer, I was very busy.)
