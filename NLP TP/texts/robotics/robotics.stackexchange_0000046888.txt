Q:

rosversion ros issue in Groovy

I used to use rosversion to confirm to 'everything is all right' notion and it worked fine in Electric and Fuerte. However now I am using Groovy and everything is about okay and till now I have tried simple programs and things are fine, I am still using rosbuild and my .bashrc is setup like this;

source /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash

source ~/groovy_workspace/setup.bash

but

rosversion ros

gives a

Cannot locate [ros]

output -- much to my annoyance ! Any solutions ?  Is it just me or is it a common problem ?
UPDATE
Following the advice of KruseT,

rosversion roslang

gives

1.9.39

is that the correct version of groovy release ?

A:

What had been the "ros" stack is now a metapackage. metapackages consist only of a package.xml (stating the version), and this currently does not get installed.
You can now get the same effect by calling
$ rosversion roslang

or using any other package name, instead of a "stack" name.
EDIT:
I created a report here: https://github.com/ros/rospkg/issues/18
But the root problem here is that for meta-packages, the meta-information (such as version), does not get installed, so not sure whether you'll ever be able to call rosversion ros with a useful result again.
EDIT: ROS Groovy comes released with 1.9 as major and minor versions. So it seems right. For more detailed answer, ask a new different question.

@KruseT Thank you -- I would guess that there should be a command line tool to check for the version of a software, this is probably a part of 'best practices' of ros (typically any software)
Comment by KruseT on 2013-01-03:
The appropriate way of checking the version of installed ROS is: $ dpkg -l ros-groovy-ros
