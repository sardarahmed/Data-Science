Q:

How is manifest.yaml generated?

I'm trying to understand and even improve rosdoc_lite and have a question... let's take roscpp as an example.
Where is the landing page for http://docs.ros.org/indigo/api/roscpp/html/ generated from?
Back in the day we use to have manifest.xml files in every package that would do this, but looking at https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/tree/indigo-devel/clients/roscpp this does not exist.
I see that now a manifest.yaml is generated, such as here:
http://docs.ros.org/indigo/api/roscpp/manifest.yaml
But how does the description get generated?

A:

The landing page is a doxygen mainpage: see here
The manifest.yaml is an internal data storage generated by rosdoc/rosdoc_lite and then rendered by the wiki. It's aggregated from various sources, depending on the package type. The description comes from the package.xml for catkin packages like roscpp.
