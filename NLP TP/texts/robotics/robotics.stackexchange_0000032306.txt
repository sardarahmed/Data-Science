Q:

Rviz tf error: unknown reason for transform failure

Hello everybody!
My OS: Ubuntu 10.04
My TF configure: /map -> /odom -> /base_link -> /base_scan.

While the TF seems not problem, there is still an fatal error at RVIZ. RVIZ show an error about laser scan: unknown reason for transform failure. I'm confuse, so I need your help. I'm appreciate for any hints.

A:

How are you publishing the /scan topic?
It has to have the frame_id /base_scan set.
Also it should have a current timestamp (i.e. corresponding to those in the rviz machine), this might be a problem with multiple computers.
Do you see a scan, if you set the fixed_frame in rviz to the frame_id of the scan?

In my scan topic, I provide frame_id of scan to be "base_scan".  Also, I'm setting the header.stamp of scan message to be current time as timestamp.

when I set /base_scan to be fixed frame in RVIZ, the fatal error is gone.
