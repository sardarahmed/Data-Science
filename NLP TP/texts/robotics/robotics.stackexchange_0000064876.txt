Q:

roslaunch does not work but rusrun does

Hi,
When starting my node "test_node" from the package "test_pck" with rosrun, everything works fine. Now i have written following launchfile named test.launch which i have placed in src/launch/
<launch>
<group ns="test">
  <node pkg="test_pck" name="test_name" type="test_node"/>
</group>
</launch>

however if i run "roslaunch test_pck test.launch" i gett following error in the terminal:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/opt/ros/indigo/bin/roslaunch", line 34, in <module>

from ._Log import *
File "/opt/ros/indigo/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rosgraph_msgs/msg/_Log.py", line 7, in <module>
import std_msgs.msg
ImportError: No module named msg

The terminal output of rospack find std_msgs is /opt/ros/indigo/share/std_msgs
I have absolutely now clue what i can do in order to solve this problem. Thank you for every hint!

Do you have std_msgs package installed? And edit your question with this command's output: ls -l `rospack find std_msgs`/msg

A:

This looks like a bug in roslaunch; not in your launch file or your packages.
There are two things you can try to check if this is a bug in roslaunch:

Try running roslaunch by itself: roslaunch. (It might fail or it might not, depending on how the imports are structured).
Try running roscore: roscore . roscore uses parts of the roslaunch API, and I suspect it will fail in the same way.

If either of these commands gives you a similar stacktrace to the one you're getting now, then this is definitely a bug in roslaunch and should be reported on their bug tracker: https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/issues
If both of those work, then it's more likely that there's some kind of error in your launch file.
