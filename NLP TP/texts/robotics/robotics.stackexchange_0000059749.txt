Q:

Creating ROS Workspace - catkin_make catkin_pkg error

ROS VERSION : INDIGO (desktop-full)
OS : Ubuntu 14.04
I install ROS using prebuild debian(sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-desktop-full).
Going through ROS tutorials, i get the following error while creating a workspace(catkin_make)
ImportError: "from catkin_pkg.package import parse_package" failed: No module named catkin_pkg.package
Make sure that you have installed "catkin_pkg", it is up to date and on the PYTHONPATH.
CMake Error at /opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/cmake/safe_execute_process.cmake:11 (message):

anaconda may be interfering, can you do python -c "import catkin_pkg; print(catkin_pkg.__version__)"?

This is what i got:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in 
ImportError: No module named catkin_pkg

i am having the same issue, got any solution?

A:

I believe that the issue is with a path conflict with ROS and Anaconda. I experienced the same thing a while back.
