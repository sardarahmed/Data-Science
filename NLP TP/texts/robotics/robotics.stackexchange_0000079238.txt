Q:

ROS on Ubuntu/Lubuntu 16.10

Hello,
I have been trying for a while to install ros on lubuntu 16.10 and it's not working. On the official site the most recent Ubuntu version they refer to is: 14.04, does this mean that the ubuntu 16.10 is still not supported or am I not doing it right?
Thanks in advance

A:

ROS REP 3 for supported platforms. 16.10 support will come with the upcoming Lunar release.
