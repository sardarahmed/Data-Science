Q:

urdf_parser check_urdf in groovy

I don't find any urdf_parser binaries at the Groovy release. Is it hidden somewhere of it didn't compile for this release?
Edit 1:
Is there a tool like urdf_parser on groovy?

A:

This package is deprecated. You are supposed to use the urdf-dom dependency directly instead of this package.
As far as I know this is the source code the binaries are compiled from
https://github.com/ros-gbp/robot_model-release/tree/release/urdf_parser
So I guess there are no binaries in groovy.
