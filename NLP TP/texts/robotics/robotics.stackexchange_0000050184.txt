Q:

roscore crashing after automatic update

I just sudo apt-get updated my fuerte installation and roscore now crashes.
Here is the message
auto-starting new master
process[master]: started with pid [4443]
Traceback (most recent call last):

Log files are all empty.
I tried removing and reinstalling ros but it didn't work.
Seen this other question but it's the other way around for me and besides being on 12.04 LTS, I can't even do a dist-upgrade.
Also tried this (recreating the workspace) but it didn't do anything.

A:

These are the (exact) same symptoms I experienced in groovy a few days ago (see Q/A). Have you tried the "dist-upgrade" option?

Tried, dist-upgrade won't do anything on my machine (I suppose 12.04 LTS can't be dist-upgraded until another LTS come out).

dist-upgrade does not change what distribution you are on.  It is simply a command which allows apt to install new dependencies, which is forbidden in a standard upgrade.
