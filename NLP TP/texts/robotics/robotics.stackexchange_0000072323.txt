Hi everybody, I occured a problem during the installation of Humanoid_Navigation package. Following this guide http://wiki.ros.org/humanoid_navigation?distro=hydro when I do "catkin_make", something goes wrong:

CMake Error at humanoid_navigation/humanoid_localization/CMakeLists.txt:7 (find_package):
By not providing "FindEigen.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Eigen", but
CMake did not find one.
Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Eigen" with any of
the following names:
EigenConfig.cmake
eigen-config.cmake

Add the installation prefix of "Eigen" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
"Eigen_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Eigen"
provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
installed.
-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
Can someone help me?
Thanks to all!

A:

You don't have EigenConfig.cmake. Try getting cmake_modules (http://wiki.ros.org/cmake_modules).
