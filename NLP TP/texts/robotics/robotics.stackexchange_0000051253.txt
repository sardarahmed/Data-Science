Q:

MoveIt tutorial: .yaml sensor file

Good afternoon,
I'm trying to run the QuickStart tutorial for MoveIt! and I'm not being able to see any of the measurements from the sensors in Gazebo in the RViz.
I was wondering if anyone can tell me how the .yaml file sensors_rgbd.yaml works to get the sensor data from Gazebo to MoveIt! I've already checked and the /head_mount_kinect/depth_registered/points topic is being published correctly from Gazebo, but there are no subscribers for it.
Thank you in advance,
Tiago
--------- Edit ------------------
So, I think I figured out a part of this. What I think is that I'm getting caught in this part of the code:

if (!sensor_list[i].hasMember ("sensor_plugin"))
{
    ROS_ERROR("No sensor plugin specified for octomap updater %d; ignoring.", i);
    continue;
}

Because in sensors_rgbd.yaml there is no sensor_plugin field. So, does anyone have an idea of what value should I give to it?
Thanks again,
Tiago Pimentel

A:

I found the answer to this problem already.
In the sensors_rgbd.yaml file, there's one important item missing that allows the sensor data to be transformed by move_group to be used in RViz.
You have to add the line:
sensor_plugin: occupancy_map_monitor/PointCloudOctomapUpdater
inside the sensor information, I put it right after:
point_cloud_topic: /head_mount_kinect/depth_registered/points
so far as I understood, this tells move_group which plugin it should use to transform/understand the data from the sensor.
I hope this helps anyone that has the same problem I had!
Have a great day,
Tiago Pimentel
