Q:

OpenCV circles grid calibration

Hi everyone,
I was wondering if anyone has had experience with the new OpenCV circles grid calibration pattern.  Any better results?  Any worse results?  Sad that your beautiful metal checkerboards are obsolete?  :P
If it proves promising, we should probably update the camera_calibration package to support it.

I think it can eventually have a succinct answer.  Eventually we'll have a preferred method of calibration or at least circumstances.  The question really is: which is better?

This is probably a better question for the mailing list since it doesn't have a succinct answer.

A:

The blob detector is indeed more robust to noise than the corner one and we experimented better results with it.
Adding it to the camera_calibration package is on the agenda but there is not timeline yet.

Is this already added in the experimental branch?
