This might be a little late for you but in case anyone else is looking for the same answer here is what I've found.
The herkulex_servo_controler repo here contains a simple ROS node to control a single servo that could easily be expanded to control any number of servos. I'm about to start using these servo's for a project myself so I'll try using this package as a starting point and will extend it to drive any number of servo's
