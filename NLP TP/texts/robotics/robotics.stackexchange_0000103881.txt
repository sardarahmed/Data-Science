Q:

Gazebo plugin location and documentation

I have a basic question regarding gazebo plugins. The gazebo tutorial 'Moving the Robot' available at Link refers to the differential drive plugin coded as shown in the picture.

Where can I find more information about these plugins, more specifically:
a) Where can I find the list of all plugins?
b) For a given plugin, where can I find the details of the plugin such as filename to use (e.g: filename="gz-sim-diff-drive-system"),  name of the plugin (e.g: name="gz::sim::systems::DiffDrive">) and the other parameters of the plugin (left_joint, right_joint,wheel_separation etc.)
TIA

A:

They are in the Gazebo Sim github repository:

System plugins can be found here,
Gui plugins are here,
Example worlds using these plugins are here.

Documentation of each plugin is written in the header files, e.g. here.
The 'name' of a plugin is in the code, typically at the end. E.g. here.
The 'file name' is the name of the compiled shared library. E.g. gz-sim-diff-drive-system for libgz-sim-diff-drive-system.so.
I was expecting to find the name for each system in the respective CMakeLists.txt file, e.g. here but it does not fully correspond. Based on this comment I conclude that the CMakeLists.txt name always gets a prefix gz-sim- and a postfix -system.
Gui plugins on the other hand do seem to get the name from the CMakeLists.txt file, without suffix or postfix.
There is an open issue about a default repository for community-written plugins, but no concrete suggestions yet. So I currently just put my plugins in a github repository (for now only a 'waste bin' plugin).
