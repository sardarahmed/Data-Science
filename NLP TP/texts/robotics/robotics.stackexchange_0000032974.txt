Q:

Collada files in remote_lab

Hi all,
I'm trying to generate DAE files (with Wings3D) but I have problems to show the generated files into remote_lab:
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'diffuseMap' of undefined colladamodel.js:490
I'm not sure about what I'm doing worse or what I'm not doing. So, anyone knows the correct form to generate collada files for remote_lab?
Cheers,
