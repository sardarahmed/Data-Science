Q:

State of a Robot

I saw the expression "robot state" in many articles and resources, but I could not understand what that exactly mean.
What does state of a robot exactly refers to ?

A:

To extends the answer from the_parzival a bit:
There are different kind of robots so that 'robot state' can have different meanings. If you have a drone or Roomba-robot, the most important state is related to its pose (position, orientation, speed, acceleration, ...). Other states are the Battery state, Motor speeds (and temperatures), essentially every value of your system that can change over time. 
The other group of robots have a fixed position, but are themselves more complex: Robot arms ( or CNC mills and similar machines). Their base has a fixed position, but their position is described by a set of joint angles (and speed, acceleration,...). In this case, the robot state can be the set of angles, or also the pose of the end-effector (or a combination). 
So the 'robot state' depends on how your robot looks like and what you are interested in.
