A:

The error indicates that something went wrong when serializing the message or that the serialized message was corrupted during transmission. In your case, it looks like more bytes were received than required for representing some message sent by nxt_lejos_proxy_mod. Without knowing more about that node, it's hard to say what exactly went wrong.
It seems like connections stay valid if such an error happens. The subscriber that was throwing the error might work with corrupted data though.
