Q:

Is there anyway i could use turtle bot with gazebo?

I have been looking forward using turtlebot on gazebo simulator. Currently i have ROS lunar with me.

I have already tried things written in indigo but its doesn't work with lunar? has any of you work with lunar and turtlebot at same time? for example i tried using keyboard for movements its says "command is unrecognized" something like that. any one?

Please don't use an answer to provide more information. This isn't a forum. Please update your question with what you've tried and the results and the tutorials that you've gone through.

A:

Check out the tutorials for turtlebot_gazebo. You'll have to click on the "Indigo" button but everything should be pretty much the same for Indigo and Lunar.
Please note that I found this by typing:

into Google as a search term.
