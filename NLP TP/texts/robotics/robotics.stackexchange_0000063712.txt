Q:

Stage for Indigo allows more than one laser?

I remember that package ros_stage in fuerte/electric didn't allowed it. I found a thread where they made a patch (http://lists.ros.org/message/20101203.131043.e45a3945.en.html, formerly http://ros-users.122217.n3.nabble.com/Simulating-multiple-laser-scanners-in-Stage-td2008197.html) and used their code. However, has it been solved in indigo version?

I'm trying to make an accurate
simulation of my robot in stage, but
I've run into a problem with adding
multiple laser scanners. I added two
lasers to the position model in my
world file, but stage dies on launch
with the following message:
[FATAL] [1291323094.990198245]: number
of position models and laser models
must be equal in the world file.
My robot has one laser on the front,
and one on the back, both with 180
degree FOV.
Any help with this would be much
appreciated.

Hi Zac!
The current version of stageros allows
exactly 1 laser per robot, no more no
less.
I submitted a ticket with a patch a
while ago to add the new
sensor_msgs/Range to stage, and I
changed it to allow multiple sensors
per robot.
I you'd like I can send you the
patched version of stage for your to
run your sims. I never tried it with 2
lasers though, just with a laser and a
sonar on a robot.

There's a pull request to add multisensor support: https://github.com/ros-simulation/stage_ros/pull/10
