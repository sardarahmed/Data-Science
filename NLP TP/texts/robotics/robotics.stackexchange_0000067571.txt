Q:

Segmentation fault at MoveIt python tutorial

I am trying to follow the python tutorial, but this simple file already crashes:
#!/usr/bin/python
import sys
import copy
import rospy
import moveit_commander
import moveit_msgs.msg
import geometry_msgs.msg

print "============ Starting tutorial setup"
moveit_commander.roscpp_initialize(sys.argv)
rospy.init_node('move_group_python_interface_tutorial',
                anonymous=True)

robot = moveit_commander.RobotCommander()

And the result in a segmentation fault.
Here is a backtrace: http://pastebin.com/3bftAaaj
I am trying to get MoveIt to work with Amigo (https://github.com/tue-robotics/amigo_moveit_config). But I get the same error if I only have a roscore running. (No parameters loaded).

Nope, nobody replied here, nor on the github issue I created :-(.
Haven't found a solution yet.

Me too! Did you find the solution for the issue?
Comment by gurusub90 on 2016-02-19:
You have to go through the robot configuration for your specific robot. I have no idea why though!

I did follow the robot configuration wizard for Amigo. Still same issue :(
