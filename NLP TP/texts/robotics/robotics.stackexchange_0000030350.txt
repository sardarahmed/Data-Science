Q:

Vslam ubuntu packages not installing

I want to move from my Cturtle vslam installation to the diamondback version. After doing a sudo aptitude update and a sudo aptitude full-upgrade I try to install the ros-diamondback-vslam package however this fails because of different version dependencies:
koen@pma-09-031 ~ $ sudo aptitude install ros-diamondback-vslam 
The following NEW packages will be installed:
ros-diamondback-vslam{b} 
0 packages upgraded, 1 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
Need to get 155MB of archives. After unpacking 357MB will be used.
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
ros-diamondback-vslam: Depends: ros-diamondback-common-msgs (= 1.4.0-    s1298335197~maverick) but 1.4.0-s1299027564~maverick is installed.

Is this caused by a problem in the package generation?

A:

vslam is currently broken, so the debian packages are not available for diamondback.  You will have to install from source if you wish to use it.  In general, experimental/research stacks may often go into a broken state, at which point their debian packages will be pulled.

The debian build status pages http://www.ros.org/wiki/release will give you information about what is in the repository.  Pre-1.0 stacks should be considered volatile and will be pulled if broke.  Stack owners are generally aware when their stacks are pulled, so there is no need to file a ticket.

Is there a protocol to notify such broken debian packages? Or do I file a ticket each time?
