Q:

dynamixel ax12 tutorial

I have acquired a Dynamixel AX12 + Dynamixel2USB, and I'm trying to follow up the next tutorial:
http://wiki.ros.org/dynamixel_controllers/Tutorials/ConnectingToDynamixelBus
Once I reach point 2, I'm not able to discover the motor. The error is just:

[INFO] [WallTime: 1492617892.352673] pan_tilt_port: Pinging motor IDs 1 through 25...
[FATAL] [WallTime: 1492617894.452074] pan_tilt_port: No motors found.

I have checked if the FTDI kernel module is working and it's loaded, checked with lsmod & modinfo
Also I have attached an oscilloscope to the motor DATA and see the RX signal is reaching the servomotor, but is not responding.
I'm feeding the motor with ~12v. And I'm using this pinout:

Anyone has experienced this behaviour before?
Thanks in advance!

I'm working under Kinetic  + I have slow down the launch file baud rates to 9600

A:

Does the Dynamixel RoboPlus software work with the servo? It's Windows-only, unfortunately, but testing with that first will tell you if the problem is hardware or software.

Looks like the problem was that the Dynamixel were not responding due to power grounding. I have shared the USB and power supply grounds together and now works. Not sure why is happening, becuase this should be already done using the Dynamixel connectors that are daisy chauined...

I think you can test with the dynamixel_workbench
http://wiki.ros.org/dynamixel_workbench  // However, I am not sure. Still trying to get dynamixel_sdk working with ROS.
