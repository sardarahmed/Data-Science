Q:

No definition of [sensor_msgs] for OS version []

Hello, I am new to ROS. Just installed Indigo on linux Mint 17 (ubuntu 14.04 based).
When going through a tutorial I run:
$ rosdep install joint_state_publisher

And get the next message:
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
joint_state_publisher: Unsupported OS [mint]

After a little research, I tried
$ export ROS_OS_OVERRIDE=ubuntu:14.04

But now, after the same rosdep install call I get:
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
joint_state_publisher: No definition of [sensor_msgs] for OS version []

I am not very sure of what I should try now. I thought Ubuntu 14.04 was supported and in most similar issues people get some key inside the last brackets of the message.
I read about declaring a new OS, but Mint is already in the list of rosdep and that's getting me even more confused.  I also got to this issue on github, which is still open and seems related.
I am lost but willing to work a lot on it, so any advice is appreciated. Thanks a lot.

A:

Setting ROS_OS_OVERRIDE ought to be the easier solution. I would start by playing with that first.
You may need to use export ROS_OS_OVERRIDE=ubuntu:trusty instead of 14.04, because ROS uses the ubuntu release names to identify Ubuntu releases.

rosdep doesn't always play nice with ROS_OS_OVERRIDE. I think it would work if you use --os=ubuntu:trusty.

Thanks a lot! I tried first to run rosdep with --os=ubuntu:trusty and it worked like a charm! I then ran "export ROS_OS_OVERRIDE=ubuntu:trusty" just in case for further use. Thanks again!
