Q:

Easiest way to show travelled path on gmapping generated map

I'd like to create and then export a map created with gmapping along with the path my robot has travelled to a graphic file. Do I need any additional packages for that, or it's just a matter of configuring gmapping? I'm running gmapping with a modified version of laser_scan_matcher as odometry source (it also publishes an \odom topic, not only a \tf from \odom -> \base_link).
Any hints appreciated.

This is basically a duplicate of this question. See my answer there for a possible solution to your problem.

Thanks. I haven't found this answer before.

Thank you very much again. Works like a charm. BTW. I was unable to install hector_slam (hector_common, actually). hector_roscpp_introspections crashes saying: introspection.cpp:225: error: ‘struct boost::filesystem::path’ has no member named ‘native’. Any solutions? Diamondback, Ubuntu 10.04.

Oh ok, thanks for the heads up, I'll investigate this.

Also, I had to increase time ROS waits for /map -> base_link in hector_trajectory_server, trajectoryUpdateTimerCallback to ros::Duration dur (1.5); Otherwise poses container in /trajectory message was mostly empty in my system. In case people are using slower machines, this might be necessary.

I would also uncomment ROS_ERROR in the aforementioned method to leave a hint for users struggling with the same issue. But again, thanks for the software - hope constructive comments are always appreciated :).
