Q:

How to move rviz 3D view with keyboard ("W,A,S,D", etc.)?

Is it possible in rviz to use keyboard key presses to enable movement of 3D camera view, instead of using mouse clicks and drags?
For example, I hope to press key "W" to move forward, "A" to left, "D" to right, "Z" for up, etc.
Or if this is currently not possible in rviz, how can I develop a plugin to enable that (which class to inherit and functions to override)?
Thanks in advance!

A:

There's the fps_motion_tool, an rviz plugin that does exactly what you want. Not sure about its current status, but if you run into problems, I'm sure the author (hdeeken) will be happy to help you.

thanks! This solved my problem!
the package was still on rosbuild thus cannot be used in indigo, but after minor fix it works well.

@Wanli, I just wanted to let others know, rosbuild packages can be used in indigo, you just have to download and build them yourself, i.e. you can't have the ROS farm build binaries for rosbuild packages on indigo, see: http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0003.html#indigo-igloo-may-2014

Just got an update from the author hdeeken, the original repository (fps_motion_tool) is obsolete. Please use rviz_fps_plugin now.
Also pull request (catkin upgrade) was created and merged to the new repository.
