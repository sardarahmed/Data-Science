Q:

How to use "pointcloud_to_laserscan"?

I can view my velodyne point cloud in Rviz but I want to convert the 3-D data into 2-D laserscan.
When I run
rosrun pointcloud_to_laserscan pointcloud_to_laserscan_node

I can see the there is a new topic /scan but I cannot see any laserscan image in Rviz. I found there is no input to the node (not subscribing from anything) as its description says http://wiki.ros.org/pointcloud_to_laserscan by
rosrun rqt_graph rqt_graph

Can anyone please tell me how to solve it?

A:

rqt_graph may not show sources or sinks that aren't connected, if you have that option disabled.
From the documentation it looks like the pointcloud_to_laserscan_node takes it input on the cloud_in topic, so you should remap that to the pointcloud output topic from your velodyne.
rosrun pointcloud_to_laserscan pointcloud_to_laserscan_node cloud_in:=/your_velodyne_points

(replace /your_velodyne_points with the pointcloud topic from your velodyne)
