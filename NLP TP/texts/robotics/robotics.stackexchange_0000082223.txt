Q:

How to write a shell script to start everything?

I am very new to shell script. Is this possible to write a script basically starts for example gazebo, rviz and slam? I tried to execute command by python by you can only execute one at a time, executing next requires exiting the current one.
Thanks!

A:

You can launch several nodes using a unique launch file.
For example, this is a launch file that can launch rtabmap_ros, hector_mapping, rviz and other things.
Notice the parts that start with <node (...) > and end with </node> : those mark the limits between the start of the different nodes.

Also, check out the tips for larger projects. This is a far better way to go than using shell scripts. They have their place, but launch files are far more powerful in this context.
