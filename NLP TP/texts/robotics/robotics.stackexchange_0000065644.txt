Q:

sudo git clone git://ram.umd.edu/ros/gps_umd.git

This command does not work because the link is dead.  I need help getting it to work in ubuntu.

A:

Looks like ram.umd.edu does not serve those git repositories anymore, and it looks like it has been like that for some time (see link for umd-ros-pkg expired. Please update fi).
It would appear however that Ken Tossell has a fork on his github account: github.com/ktossell/gps_umd (from: wiki.ros.org/gps_umd). Perhaps you can use that?
PS: why the sudo?
