Q:

CATKIN MAKE ERROR "make -j4 -l4" failed

I am new to ubuntu operating system. And I am trying to install and run RGBDSLAM on ubuntu 16.04LTS following the guidelines on this webpage here. The installation procedure works fine until I insert the command of catkin_make. This is the error that I received.

Hi guys!
I have the same error, and I tried to solve it following the guide in the github issue forum; actually, it didn't work and I don't know why.
Do you have any suggestions?
