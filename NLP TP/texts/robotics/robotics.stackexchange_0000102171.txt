Q:

ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker crash on Windows 10

Following the tutorial to install ROS 2 Humble on Windows 10, I am stuck at this point where I am unable to start a basic example:
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker
[ros2run]: Process exited with failure 3221226505

I am getting the exact same error from both the DOS CMD and the Windows PowerShell in both admin and user modes.
Any idea on how to debug this?

A:

I found out the reason for this crash: my ROS_DOMAIN_ID environment variable was containing a non-integer value. Setting it to an integer value fixed the crash... I hoped to get a more user-friendly message to debug this..

I have this exact problem, but I don't have a ROS_DOMAIN_ID environment variable, I tried setting it to integer value anyway, but I still have the same issue. I don't know where the problem could be, could you give me any pointers on what else I should look for.
