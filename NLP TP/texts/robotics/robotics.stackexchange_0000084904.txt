Q:

time interval between messages published on a topic

Hi everyone,
I want to calculate time interval between messages that are published on a topic. The topic is /aruco_poses and of type aruco_mapping/ArucoMarker. It has std_msgs/Header field with stamp containing sec and nsec. But I don't know how to access nsec field from the topic. Any idea?
Thanks in advance!

A:

You can do this with ROS times and durations: roscpp, rospy. You will have to save the previous message, then when you get a new one you can do double elapsed_time = (msg.header.stamp - prev_msg.header.stamp).toSec() (rospy has similar logic).
