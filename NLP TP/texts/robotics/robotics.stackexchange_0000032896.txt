Q:

how to specify gcc options while building ROS programs

Hi All,
When I compile my (non-ROS) programs with the third party libraries, I need to provide gcc with some options as well as paths to include head files and libraries. Usually this is how the gcc command looks like:
gcc -Imy_include_files_path   -SOME_OPTIONS   -Lmy_library_files_path  source.c
Now I want to use these third party libraries with ROS, how can I specify those options in ROS?
With Many Thanks,

I think this has been answered here already.
The ROS build is based on CMake. You can find a basic tutorial on CMake here.
