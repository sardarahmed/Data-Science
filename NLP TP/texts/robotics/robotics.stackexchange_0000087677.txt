Q:

Multi-robot Navigation - Cooperative Navigation

I have setup navigation stack successfully . I have following configuration :

Mutiple bots under different namespaces
Seperate Planners for individual bots
Static Map generated before-hand
No laser scans, only gps and odometry

I want bots to avoid colliding into each other. I think the navigation stack doesn't have such a capability yet.
Avoidance based upon location of there neighbour bots.
Is there any way navigation package provides that utility?

I think you have to write your own algorithm to do same.

A:

So I have figured a way out,
I am using social navigation layer in creating my CostMap.
Though it requires lidar scans to look for people, since my robots are connected over internet I am subscribing to their poses and publishing onto people topic which navigation layer uses.
So I can do co-operative navigation using GPS and network only.
