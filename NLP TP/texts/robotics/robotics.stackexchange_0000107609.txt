Q:

Rviz Tf breaks when I change fixed frame to odom frame

how are you all doing?
I've been trying to use the ros humble robot_localization package to estimate my robot's pose using odometry and imu data. The thing is, when the fixed frame is the base_footprint all the robot's TF are parsed ok.

When I set my odom frame as the fixed frame some of my transformations break.

But if I look at the broadcasted frames the tf tree seems normal.

Although it isnÂ´t something critical to me, it is bothering me a lot.
Thanks in advance.

A:

Your /tf timestamp values are not consistent. Most likely you have some nodes with use_sim_time parameter set to true, and other nodes with it set to false.
