Q:

hector_localization build error

Hi again,
trying to catkin_make the hector_localization package in ROS Hydro on Ubuntu 12.04 I get the following errors:
CMake Error at /opt/ros/hydro/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:75 (find_package):
  Could not find a configuration file for package geographic_msgs.

  Set geographic_msgs_DIR to the directory containing a CMake configuration
  file for geographic_msgs.  The file will have one of the following names:

    geographic_msgsConfig.cmake
    geographic_msgs-config.cmake

Call Stack (most recent call first):
  hector_localization/hector_pose_estimation_core/CMakeLists.txt:7 (find_package)

  Adjust CMAKE_MODULE_PATH to find Findgeographic_msgs.cmake or set
  geographic_msgs_DIR to the directory containing a CMake configuration file
  for geographic_msgs.  The file will have one of the following names:

    geographic_msgsConfig.cmake

Any idea how to fix it?

Do you have all dependencies installed? Especially "geographic_msgs"?

A:

Well, what solved the problem was manually installing two packages from git.
Namely geographic_msgs and uuid_msgs.
I'm not quite sure why those went missing but now hector_localization compiled.
Thanks Dirk!

I am completely new to the structure of GitHub and of repositories, in general.  Which commands did you use to install the geographic_msgs and uuid_msgs?
Thanks!
