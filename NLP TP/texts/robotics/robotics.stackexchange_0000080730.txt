Q:

ROS Wiki: Node Information not shown

Hello,
I edited the ROS wiki about elas_ros, where I added a link to the source code on github. But after this change the information about which topic the nodes subscribe to and what they publish (which would be under "3. Nodes") is not visible anymore. When editing the text, the text is there, but not when it is displayed as a normal wiki page. What might be the problem?

A:

I've added a fix.
{{{#!clearsilver CS/NodeAPI

Seems like a new line is needed after the curly brace.
