Q:

Resize my robot (or map)

Hey guys,
I was searching, but can not find a solution. Maybe I not using rights words for a right search.
I have a simulation in gazebo with a map and a robot, I call my simulation via Roslaunch.
And I need to make my robot start on simulation a little smaller than now, but I do not know in which file I need change the code for that.
Can someone tell me what type of file I need to open for that change?
If you guys need, I can give the github link of my simulation, but I think there is some type o default file for that.
Thank you

I have found something like proportion, but didn´t work
And the only "size´s" number i have found are zero by default

A:

The size of your robot is defined by the URDF or SDF file, so you'll need to change the size there.
Of course, it's a lot more complicated than just a single scaling parameter, because you'll have to scale each of the links, meshes, and collision meshes for each link, and if you have the mass or inertia of your robot defined, it would be wise to scale those too.

Man, this look really complicated hahahaha
But I will study and try.
You know if change the map size is easier?

If the world is less complicated than robot, it's probably easier to scale the world.
