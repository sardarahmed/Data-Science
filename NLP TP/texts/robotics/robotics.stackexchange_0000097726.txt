Q:

How do you do obstacle avoidance with MoveIt?

Sorry if this is a noob question, I'm just getting started with ROS / MoveIt.
Let's say you have a robot arm, and that there will always be an S-shaped object that a robot arm should move around. What should you do so that the robot arm navigate around this object?

A:

You could add the object to the URDF. See here. That's what I would recommend since it will always be there.
OR, in code, you could set up a Planning Scene and add the S-shaped collision object to it. There's a tutorial here. The message definition is here.
OR you can add the collision mesh with the RViz MotionPlanning plugin (GUI). Of course, then you would have to re-add the object manually every time you launch the robot.
