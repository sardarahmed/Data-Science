Q:

About the collision map of PR2

Hello! I have some problems when I try to get the collision map of PR2. The error is that "Client [/rviz_collision_tutorial_1] wants topic /tilt_scan_cloud_filtered to have datatype/md5sum [sensor_msgs/PointCloud/d8e9c3f5afbdd8a130fd1d2763945fca], but our version has [sensor_msgs/PointCloud2/1158d486dd51d683ce2f1be655c3c181]. Dropping connection." My ROS is fuerte. Thank you so much.

i refer to the tutorials in "http://wiki.ros.org/motion_planning_environment/Tutorials/Making collision maps from self-filtered tilting laser data" .

A:

From the text from the tutorial page you are referring to:
If using an OpenNI device that outputs only PointCloud2, you should use a node from collider or octomap_server instead.
This is your problem and solution.
