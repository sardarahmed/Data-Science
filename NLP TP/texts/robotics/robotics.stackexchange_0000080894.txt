Q:

ResourceNotFound: xarco

Hi,
I am trying to write a launch file for a URDF. When I run  rosrun xacro xacro workcell.xarco the ,xarco runs no problem, but when I run my .launch file I get
ResourceNotFound: xarco
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/kinetic/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/home/donni/ROS_ws/ind_ws/src
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/kinetic/share

Also, when I run rospack find xarco, ros doese not find xarco. How is ros able to run xarco using rosrun, but can't find it with rospack. Also, how do I add xarco to my ros environment?
Thank you

A:

You have the r and the c in the wrong order.
It's xacro, not xarco.
And the xacro package is almost certainly part of the default ROS install, so you should already have it.
