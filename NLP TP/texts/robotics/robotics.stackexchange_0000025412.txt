Q:

Is it possible to distribute sensors over multiple computers?

I would like to simulate a number of robots (up to let's say 10) in real time, each with a significant sensor suite. Is it possible to distribute sensors as slaves to the physics simulation across multiple machines? If it's not right now, does the architecture readily support it? I could imagine a plugin to the main server to broadcast world changes, and a "fake" physics that passes that on to the local sensors on each slave machine.

A:

Sensor simulation is currently not distributed. I've created a ticket for this:

Hi nkoenig. I wonder if there is any update on this. The ticket is still there.
