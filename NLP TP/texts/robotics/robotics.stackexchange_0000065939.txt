Q:

process crashes, no log file where it says

When I change some parameters in some octomap_server initialization code, I get a crash which I can't debug.
[octomap_server-2] process has died [pid 22734, exit code -6, cmd /home/chris/ros_ws/devel/lib/octomap_server/octomap_server_node cloud_in:=/cloud __name:=octomap_server __log:=/home/chris/.ros/log/798b4038-b889-11e4-97b4-b8ca3a7c5dcb/octomap_server-2.log].
log file: /home/chris/.ros/log/798b4038-b889-11e4-97b4-b8ca3a7c5dcb/octomap_server-2*.log\

I would normally just use the log file it tells me, but for the node that crashed there is no log file in the directory it specifies. I have grep'd all the source code for exit(-6) etc and can't find anything. Any suggestions how I can actually see why its crashing?

A:

Did you try running the process through a debugger? E.g, if you are using a roslaunch file, try adding gdb to the launch-prefix.
