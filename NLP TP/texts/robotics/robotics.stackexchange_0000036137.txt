Q:

exclude dependancy while using rosdoc

Hello everyone
I have a ros stack, which I like to generate its documentation using rosdoc. but then it generates documentation for alot of other ros packages.
I'd like to generate documentation only for my packages
I'm aware of the exclude attribute for the rosdoc configuration, but it excludes a pattern, and I want to exclude dependancy
Any ideas?
thnx

A:

If you just run "rosdoc " it should just document that package, though older versions of rosdoc had a bug that would cause the behavior you described.

works perfectly, also under diamondback. Many many thanks

If you pass in multiple packages, it should create a common index.html.  I believe diamondback may still have the  bug.

I have diamondback
I don't want to run rosdoc on single packages, there are alot of packages, and also because it will create separate doc folders, with no common index.html
