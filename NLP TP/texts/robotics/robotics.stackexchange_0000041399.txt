Q:

intrinsic calibration of the kinect cameras

I do the tutorial in http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_launch/Tutorials/IntrinsicCalibration?action=show&redirect=openni_camera%2Fcalibration
3.RGB camera
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch
rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py image:=/camera/rgb/image_raw camera:=/camera/rgb --size 5x4 --square 0.0245
I commit my successful calibration
and
4.IR(depth)camera
rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py image:=/camera/ir/image_raw camera:=/camera/ir --size 5x4 --square 0.0245
I also commit my successful calibration
Question.

How can I know the calibration result?

How can I compare the before calibration?

(Should I see a noticeable difference when viewing the raw and rectified images?)

A:

You can view the yaml file
$ ls ~/.ros/camera_info/
depth_B00362708888047B.yaml  rgb_B00362708888047B.yaml

Perhaps it is possible seen that you have less distortion round the edges of your image?
