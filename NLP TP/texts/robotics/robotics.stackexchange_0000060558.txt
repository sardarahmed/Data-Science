Q:

Could not find library corresponding to plugin

I make a simulation to check if my program is correct. After I transferred my code on Turtlebot PC to one on Another PC, I executed catkin_make. After that, I checked that there is libompl_planner_rrt.so in /catkin_ws/devel/lib.
I got the next error message, but I'm not sure.

[FATAL] [1404362140.989502266, 6.774000000]: Failed to create the ompl_planner_rrt/OMPLPlannerRRT planner, are you sure it is properly registered and that the containing library is built? Exception: Could not find library corresponding to plugin ompl_planner_rrt/OMPLPlannerRRT. Make sure the plugin description XML file has the correct name of the library and that the library actually exists.

Could anybody tell me a clue?
I have already added plugin.xml to package.xml.

 &ltexport>
    &ltnav_core plugin="/home/kmurata/catkin_ws/src/ompl_planner_rrt/bgp_plugin.xml"/>
 </export>

I executed rospack plugins --attrib=plugin nav_core.

navfn /home/kmurata/catkin_ws/src/navfn/bgp_plugin.xml
goal_passer /home/kmurata/catkin_ws/src/goal_passer/bgp_plugin.xml
ompl_planner_rrt /home/kmurata/catkin_ws/src/ompl_planner_rrt/bgp_plugin.xml
base_local_planner /home/kmurata/catkin_ws/src/base_local_planner/blp_plugin.xml
carrot_planner /home/kmurata/catkin_ws/src/carrot_planner/bgp_plugin.xml
global_planner /home/kmurata/catkin_ws/src/global_planner/bgp_plugin.xml
clear_costmap_recovery /home/kmurata/catkin_ws/src/clear_costmap_recovery/ccr_plugin.xml
rotate_recovery /home/kmurata/catkin_ws/src/rotate_recovery/rotate_plugin.xml
dwa_local_planner /home/kmurata/catkin_ws/src/dwa_local_planner/blp_plugin.xml
move_slow_and_clear /home/kmurata/catkin_ws/src/move_slow_and_clear/recovery_plugin.xml
eband_local_planner /home/kmurata/catkin_ws/src/eband_local_planner/elp_plugin.xml

This means that ompl_planner_rrt is registered. Am I wrong?
Now I'm trying simulation with Gazebo, rviz and Turtlebot3D model.

A:

That probably means that you forgot to register your plugin in package.xml and create the plugin description file as explained in http://wiki.ros.org/pluginlib

Thank you, Martin Peris! I have already add a plugin.xml to package.xml. Is this wrong? What should I do when I transfer my code on a PC to one on an other PC? I'm sorry, I have executed my code on my Turtlebot PC.

To transfer your code from one PC to another, should be enough to copy your package folder from the catkin environment in the origin PC to the catkin environment on the destination PC. Then just run catkin_make on the destination PC. It should work

I think so, but I got same error message. I'm not sure how I should do. Thanks!
