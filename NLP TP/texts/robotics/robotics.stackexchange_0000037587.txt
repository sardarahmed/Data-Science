Q:

Why ROS Topic should get XMLRPC address:port but ROS Service doesn't?

I followed ROS Introduction (Radu Bogdan Rusu) in Events/CoTeSys-OS-School.
This is ROS Topic mechanism:

I can see in step 2, Listener get Talker's XML/RPC's address:port.
This is ROS Service mechanism:

I can see in step 2, Listener get Talker's XML/RPC's data address:port.
My question is why ROS topic should let Listener get its XML/RPC's address:port but ROS Service doesn't?
By the way:
1.what is second picture's step 3? Is step 3 is Listener making a data port connection(foo:3456) to Talker?
2.Is "foo" a IP address?
Thank you~

A:

Publishers have an XMLRPC interface for getting the connection information, so that subscribers can request the most appropriate transport (TCP or UDP), and get an appropriate response. Since services only have one underlying transport, this extra layer is unnecessary.

I have no idea where step 3 went.

"foo" is the ROS_HOSTNAME of the machine that talker is running on. In most cases this just the machine's hostname, but it may also be a string representation of an IP.

And a little more inaccuracy in the pictures. In the first picture, in step 3, connect ("scan", TCP) should be connect ("bar", TCP). This led me to a small misconception, until I learned the original page here:
