Q:

camera laser calibration package?

Hello,
is there any available package for calibrating the extrinsic parameters of camera + laser range finder system?
I found the old laser_camera_calibration package, but I can't figure out where to find the source (roslocate does not return any result, and it is not in the browse list), and it does not seem to have been worked on since 2009.
Thanks in advance
Raph

A:

You can have a look at the paper of Vijay Pradeep on the calibration of the PR2. (here). And in the source code of PR2.
Wim told me that there is an intern working on the extension on the camera pose calibration package, I proposed helping in extending this package to a more general 'multi sensor calibration' package.
