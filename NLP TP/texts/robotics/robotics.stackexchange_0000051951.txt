Q:

roscd: No such package/stack 'beginner_tutorials'

Hi!
I have found a bunch of questions about the same issue, but I don't think my problem is the same.
So basically, I am super new to ROS and was going through tutorial page ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage
I created a package using:
~/catkin_ws/src$ catkin_create_pkg beginner_tutorials std_msgs rospy roscpp
It gave me next lines:
Created file beginner_tutorials/package.xml
Created file beginner_tutorials/CMakeLists.txt
Created folder beginner_tutorials/include
Created folder beginner_tutorials/src
Successfully created files in /home/natalia/catkin_ws/src/beginner_tutorials. Please adjust the values in package.xml.
Then I try command like
roscd beginner_tutorials
and it says:
roscd: No such package/stack 'beginner_tutorials'
I have checked my path with
echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
and got:
/home/natalia/catkin_ws/src:/opt/ros/groovy/share:/opt/ros/groovy/stacks
and beginner_tutorials folder is in src, so it seems that path is already correct.
Do you have any suggestions what might be wrong?

So after trying rospack profile --length=200 I got:
0.005637   /opt/ros/groovy/stacks
0.001263   /home/natalia/catkin_ws/src
0.001116   /opt/ros/groovy/stacks/navigation
0.000486   /opt/ros/groovy/stacks/simulator_gazebo
0.000481   /opt/ros/groovy/stacks/navigation_tutorials
0.000405   /opt/ros/groovy/stacks/visualization_tutorials
0.000317   /opt/ros/groovy/stacks/common_tutorials
0.000285   /opt/ros/groovy/stacks/executive_smach
0.000198   /opt/ros/groovy/stacks/physics_ode
0.000185   /opt/ros/groovy/stacks/geometry_tutorials
0.000167   /opt/ros/groovy/stacks/robot_model_tutorials
0.000109   /opt/ros/groovy/stacks/slam_gmapping
0.000107   /opt/ros/groovy/stacks/robot_model_visualization
0.000092   /opt/ros/groovy/stacks/documentation
0.000036 * /opt/ros/groovy/stacks/laser_pipeline
0.000034 * /opt/ros/groovy/stacks/common
So I think that there is nothing wrong with path? But I still cannot use roscd or rospack etc. to packages I create. However, it works fine for roscpp, for example.

A:

Maybe it's just a missing catkin_make and source devel/setup.bash, although given the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH it should work.
You could try something like rospack profile --length=200 to see what it searches.

I had the same problem. For step by step beginners:
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/
$ catkin_make
this will traverse the packages and add a subdirectory.
followed by
$ source devel/setup.bash

You can also create an alias to run all of the commands:
alias cat_make='cd ~/catkin_ws/ && catkin_make && source devel/setup.bash'

so all the commands will be run by just typing cat_make (or another alias name you choose)

Thanks a lot. When i set catkin_make and source devel/setup.bash worked.
