Q:

Contributing packages split across multiple Git repositories

I've written quite a few nodes for a custom robot that I've been working on. Several of these nodes are general purpose hardware drivers that would be useful to the larger ROS community. I have been using Git for version control and have a separate repository for each package for several reasons (e.g. to keep separate commit histories, to have more granular control of push access).
This leaves me confused as for how to get these packages listed with Wiki pages on ROS.org. Most of the documentation assumes that each person or organization uses one large repository (e.g. "umd-ros-pkg"). One option I was considering was to make an overarching GIt repository that contains the other packages as submodules. What is the preferred method of dealing with this situation?

A:

You can just provide a link to a rosinstall file with the package names and repositories you would like indexed. It's more flexible and also allows you to easily add more stacks later - all you have to do is update your rosinstall file and the indexer will pick up your new stacks next time it reads that file.
See this mailing list thread for some details: https://code.ros.org/lurker/message/20110816.202545.649d3b91.en.html

This sounds like what I am looking for. However, I am still unclear on a few points: (1) Do I put the rosinstall file in a separate repository? (2) How do I get the indexer to find my rosinstall file? (3) Must the repos listed in the rosinstall file contain stacks (i.e. not a single package)?
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-04-17:
(1) You don't need to. The indexer just needs to know a URL for downloading it. (2) Write an email to the ros-users mailing list with your repository announcement and URL to your rosinstall file. (3) They should. Note: ROS now supports unary stacks: http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0109.html

Thanks for including a link to the REP for unary stacks. I completely missed that addition.
