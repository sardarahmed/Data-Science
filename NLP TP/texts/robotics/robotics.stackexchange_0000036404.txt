Q:

Problems with joystick tutorial

I am trying to run the tutorial "ConfiguringALinuxJoystick#Starting_the_Joy_Node" on Ubuntu 11.4 with ROS electric.  Everything is good until I run the joy node.  I get an error [ WARN] [1323609269.393225314]: Shutdown request received.
[ WARN] [1323609269.393347028]: Reason given for shutdown: [new node registered with same name]
Any help would be appreciated,
Morpheus

Do you know how to use a normal joystick to control a turtlebot based kobuki?I have some trouble with it . I refer to this website:http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_teleop/Tutorials/hydro/Joystick%20Teleop.
