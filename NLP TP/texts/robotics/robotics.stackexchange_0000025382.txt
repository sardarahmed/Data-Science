Q:

cast_shadow unchecked causes crash

Hi,
I'm using gazebo 1.2.5 in gentoo linux.  When I run gazebo with default world and add a cylinder and uncheck the cast_shadow property in somewhere in the link section of the cylinder, it causes gazebo to crash with the following error message:
Exception [Publisher.cc:79] Publishing and uninitialized message on topic[/gazebo/default/model/modify]. Required field [link[0].visual[0].name] missing.
Qt has caught an exception thrown from an event handler. Throwing
exceptions from an event handler is not supported in Qt. You must
reimplement QApplication::notify() and catch all exceptions there.
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'gazebo::common::Exception'
It happens every time.  GDB shows no backtrace.
Thanks.

is this fixed in the dev branch?

A:

This is the same issue: https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issue/180/crash-when-changing-dimensions-of-box.
There is a section of code in the GUI which needs to be fixed, and this is part of it. Follow the above ticket for updates.
