Q:

rospack cannot find package every-time terminal restarted

I have two packages one name test_package (built first) and one name cylinder(later).
I found that every time I start a new terminal or restart the terminal, I have to source the setup.bash again for cylinder package otherwise it is not found.  For every terminal, I need to source before running rosrun cylinder xxx.
The test_package worked fine.
I wonder if is there a solution, shall I just try rebuild this package again, I don't know whether rebuilding work or not though... Has anyone else experienced this before?

A:

This is exactly what we'd expect.
If you want the cylinder package to always be available you'll need to add a line into your .bashrc file to source it for you. .bashrc is located in your home folder and you'll want to add a line like the one below but update the path to match where your cylinder package is:
source /home/your_user/cylinder_workspace/devel/setup.bash

Hope this helps.
