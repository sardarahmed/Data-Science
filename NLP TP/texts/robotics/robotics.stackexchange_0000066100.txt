Q:

How can I control the rqt_plot x-axis scale?

I'm using rqt_plot to plot movement of the turtle in turtlesim. Steps:

$ rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node
$ rosrun rqt_plot rqt_plot
In the "Topic" box of the rqt_plot window, type "/turtle1/pose"

In the window, rqt_plot is scrolling too fast. The width of my window represents 1 second. How do I change the x-axis scale to show more data and scroll more slowly?

A:

I don't remember exactly, but there's some combination of right- or middle-click, the CTRL key and dragging which zooms the X and Y axes.

It's right-click and drag on 14.04 and Indigo.
