Q:

Understanding Python Code

Hy!
I tried to understand the Python Code from the locator package and have problems to find the answer what are the parameter "map_frame" and the "odom_frame"?
Where gets rospy this parameters?
self.map_frame = rospy.get_param('map_frame', 'map')
self.odom_frame = rospy.get_param('odom_frame', 'odom')
Thanks!

A:

Please tag your questions.
It's getting these parameters from the ROS parameter server. Have a look at the ros tutorials.
