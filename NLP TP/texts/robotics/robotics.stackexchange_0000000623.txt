Q:

When taking VCC power from an arduino to a 12v regulator, then to a 5v, do I need two sets of capacitors?

I'm building an open-source bio-research hardware (ask me how you can help!) and I've got this guy here:

My big questions are:

Can I get away with all the ground being common? (I've got a 12v and 5v needing to be grounded)
Do I need two sets of capacitors? There are 2 wired up to the 12v regulator and 2 wired to the 5v regulator. (These are shown in blue)

I've generally denoted connections which go UNDER the shield as orange, and those above as green.
If anyone happens to see something which might backfire, feel free to point it out. As this is also my first time making anything quite like this!

I've verified the regulator positions and they are correct.
This is a proto-shield for an Arduino R3 Uno.

That's exactly what should be done.

Yes, you usually want to keep all capacitors as they are even if you are cascading voltage regulators. They help keep the regulator stable and avoid sharp voltage variations. 
Be aware that either regulator might limit the amount of current that can be supplied to your system (if you have things hooked up in the 12V regulator besides the 5V regulator, for instance).
I find it odd that you need a 12V regulator though... Where is the input voltage coming from?
