Q:

For new package downloading

Hi,
May I ask a fresh question, that when i try to run find_object package,it does not be downloaded. And reference is "http://www.ros.org/wiki/find_object/Tutorials/Running%20the%20basic%20find%20object%20demo"
I ask some of my colleagues that it only should download one by one files at "https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/branches/trunk_cturtle/stacks/find_object/",.
which is so confused to me, cause it has too many files and sub-files.
So could there be anther way to download this SVN source quickly?
Best regards.

This question applies to many use cases, in addition to that specific tutorial.

A:

That tutorial skips over several important preliminary steps. This is the best answer I know. Maybe someone else has a better approach.
Install the ROS binary packages if you have not already (see: Ubuntu C-turtle installation).
Create your own rosinstall file (find_object.rosinstall for this example), containing these three lines:
- other: {local-name: /opt/ros/cturtle/ros}
- other: {local-name: /opt/ros/cturtle/stacks}
- svn: {local-name: find_object, uri: 'https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/branches/trunk_cturtle/stacks/find_object'}

Run rosinstall on that file, and source the setup.bash script (which you should probably add to your ~/.bashrc script).
You can do all of the above with these shell commands:
$ cp /opt/ros/cturtle/.rosinstall find_object.rosinstall
$ roslocate info find_object >> find_object.rosinstall
$ rosinstall ~/ros find_object.rosinstall
$ source ~/ros/setup.bash

Follow the tutorial after that.

how do you create the rosinstall file? do you just create with a text editor and place it in the /opt/ros/cturtle/ directory?

C-turtle was a long time ago. You probably want to run a more recent ROS distro. Each distro comes with a .rosinstall in its top-level directory.
