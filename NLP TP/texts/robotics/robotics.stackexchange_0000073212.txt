Q:

Raytracer in occupancy_grid_utils

Dear Ros Users,
I am trying to perform a raytracing from a pointcloud in my node. The aim is to have a result similar to the one provided by octomap_server, but in my node.
I tried to occupancy_grid_utils package in ros_indigo, but it seems that raytracing is not well performed, in particular it seems that rays are "cutted" before the end point
Do you have any suggestions?
Thank you!

Hi,
I think that raytracer is for 2D and not for 3D.
Best,
