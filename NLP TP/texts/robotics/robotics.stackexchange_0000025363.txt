Q:

Adding another robot model and controlling it

Hi
After I unpinned the drc robot and it fell down because my control wasn't right, I want to try again with out starting gazebo again. I tried deleting the model and putting in another one but then it liiks as if the control node isn't controlling it. any ideas how should I do it?
Thanks
Nachum

A:

Quoting from @hsu's comment:
actually, I recommend Edit -> Reset Model Poses, this way, there is no need to restart all the controller components.
