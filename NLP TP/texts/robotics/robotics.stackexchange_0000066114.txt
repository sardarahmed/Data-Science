Q:

how to compensate gravity in gazebo?

Hi
I have set PID controllers in gazebo, now I want to add the gravity compensation. what should I do?
actually i want to add offset to the output of PID controllers.
is there any topic that i can publish to it ?
i'm working on a industrial robot that have 5 joints + gantry ( visual servo ) .

A:

I believe there is no ready-made controller providing PID control with feedforward gravity compensation. You could look into modifying the PID approach you are already using (custom gazebo plugin? gazebo_ros_control?) and adding gravity compensation.

I would add it either to your 'robot driver', or as a separate controller that runs in parallel to the PID. I'd avoid trying to extend the PID implementation, as gravity compensation is model-based, whereas a plain PID is not. More details on your approach would help, as Stefan points out.
