Q:

Can P gain too high cause roll of death?

I've been sperimenting with PIDs on my quadcopter and I've noticed that pitch P = 65 causes double front and back flips which looks like a roll of death (or in this case a flip of death) and lowering pitch P to 60 solves the issue. 
Why is that? 
Can I mitigate this with filters or D gain?
I've also noticed that certain values of P and D mix well and make the quad smooth but if I bump up the I gain to twice as high as my P gain then my quadcopter bounces back.
Is this reasonable or there's a problem somewhere else? 

A:

Yes the proportional gain can cause overreaction. As it is only concerned with instant correction a larger gain value of P can make it over compensate. Basically I like to think of it as, in any instant point the grater the difference between the actual position or signal the more you have to accelerate to get there as quick as you can.
This can be corrected by using a derivative gain. The D gain is only concerned with compensating for the rate of change. This make it good to reduce the overshoot of your system (preventing death rolls).
What you are noticing in the last part of your question is a natural ratio of the gains. A good method to find those well performing ratios is to use the Zieglerâ€“Nichols tuning method. 
Also, if you are interested in control systems I would strongly suggest looking at Brian Douglas' YouTube series on control systems.
