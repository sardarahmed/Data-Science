Q:

Could XV-11 break or discharge? [closed]

Hi! I use a neato xv-11 to do a scan. Until a few days ago I had no problem, now sometimes does not work because it shows very few points and a red circle appears in the center. What do you think it might be? It is powered by USB. Thank you!

I solved the problem increases the motor voltage that was lowered. Now it works well!
