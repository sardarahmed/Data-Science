Q:

Unable to run Rviz and RTABMAP using SSH

Hey everyone,
I am a student of Habib University and I am working on an Autonomous Rescue Robot.
The project aims to develop an Autonomous Robot that can make an entire Map of an unknown site 'Autonomously' and simultaneously send live Mapping and Localization data to a remote PC.
I am using a RaspberryPi 3 in which I've installed Lubuntu and ROS Kinetic. The problem I am currently facing is that I can connect to the Pi using SSH but when I run the Rviz and Rtabmap commands, it gives me an error.
rosrun rviz rviz
QXcbConnection: Could not connect to display
Aborted
Is there any other way I can run Rviz and Rtabmap on a remote PC and visualize the Mapping and Localization data?

No, we weren't able to fix it. We had to install and Run the ROS on a laptop.

Hi
if i understand correctly your pi hasn't any display device for running rviz i suggest you to use ros network and run rviz in your pc
