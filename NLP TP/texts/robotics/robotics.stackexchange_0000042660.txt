Q:

How to set /dev/irobot_create as the Turtlebot base device

Since I have multiple USB devices attached I'd like to make sure that when I run minimal.launch it uses /dev/irobot_create rather than the default /dev/ttyUSB0.  What's the best way to do this?

A:

You need to supply the port parameter in minimal.launch. See http://ros.org/wiki/turtlebot_node#Parameters
You'll have to change minimal.launch as follows:
FROM:
<!-- Turtlebot Driver -->
<node pkg="turtlebot_node" type="turtlebot_node.py" name="turtlebot_node" output="screen" respawn="true" args="--respawnable">
  <param name="bonus" value="false" />
  <param name="update_rate" value="30.0" />
</node>

TO:
<!-- Turtlebot Driver -->
<node pkg="turtlebot_node" type="turtlebot_node.py" name="turtlebot_node" output="screen" respawn="true" args="--respawnable">
  <param name="bonus" value="false" />
  <param name="update_rate" value="30.0" />
  <param name="port" value="/dev/irobot_create" />
</node>

The ROS wiki contains more documentation here if you want to read up on supplying parameters through launch files.
