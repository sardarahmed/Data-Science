Q:

python nodes not running

I am trying to run the talker_publisher.py code in programming robots with ROS book , I have written the code just as the example in the book but it gives me this error :
/usr/bin/env: ‘pyton’: No such file or directory

though I have python 2.7 installed so what's wrong ?

A:

/usr/bin/env: ‘pyton’: No such file or directory

If this is a direct copy-paste from your Python script, then I believe you're missing an h there.
The name of the Python interpreter binary is python, not pyton.
Change the first line of your script (where I'm assuming you specify the Python interpreter) to:
#!/usr/bin/env python

and things should start working.
Note that this is not a ROS problem at all. In the future, please try to search (using Google fi) for these kind of problems. That way you don't have to wait for someone from this forum to answer you, and you have a much larger community (ie: the entire internet) to help you instead of just the ROS community.
