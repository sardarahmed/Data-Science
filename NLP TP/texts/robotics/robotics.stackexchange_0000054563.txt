Q:

Uninstall and reinstall ROS

Hi guys,
I wanted to remove my ROS fuerte and reinstall it due to some error I can't solve even with solution. So I wanna ask whether can I remove current ROS and reinstall it later on? Will my package still remain or I need to create them all over again after that? How am I suppose to do?
Here's the error wish someone could have help me so I don't need to remove my ROS.

What do you mean with 'Will my package still remain'?
Comment by FuerteNewbie on 2013-10-03:
All those package that I created in my workspace.

A:

If you created your workspace properly, you should be fine. The only thing the workspace does is sourcing /opt/ros/fuerte/setup.bash this happens in ~/yourworkspace/setup.bash. So if ROS is reinstalled at the same place there should be no problem I think.
To uninstall ROS completely (debian packages and their configs) do:
sudo apt-get purge ros-fuerte-*

To reinstall simply follow the instructions from the wiki.

So after I delete my ROS and reinstall, I dont need to reconfigure anything about my workspace and all those packages right?
Comment by BennyRe on 2013-10-03:
I think so. Nevertheless I recommend a backup of your machine. You never know...

I think that should work.
