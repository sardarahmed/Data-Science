Q:

Hi all :
I'm trying to do the libviso2 now . There is a README .txt

Move to libviso2 root directory
Type 'cmake .'
Type 'make'
Run './viso2 path/to/sequence/2010_03_09_drive_0019'

I done the first 3 steps ,but I really don't know how to do the last line ....
What is path to sequence ???  It's that a directory ?
Can somebody helping me ~~~~~ please ..... Thank you

A:

It seems it's not ROS related question.
libviso2 can evaluate in ROS with viso2_ros package
I recommend referring below link:
