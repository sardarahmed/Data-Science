Q:

[solved] gazebo_plugins in ROS fuerte: permission denied

Hi guys,
I have a weird problem when I add as dependency gazebo_plugins in a package built with ROS fuerte. If a add this dependency in a manifest.xml like the following one

    
        Contains plugins for Gazebo.

<depend package="roscpp"/>
<depend package="gazebo"/>
<depend package="gazebo_plugins"/>

<export>
    <gazebo plugin_path="${prefix}/lib" />
</export>

and I compile my package ros tells me the following
[rosmake-1] Starting >>> gazebo_plugins [ make ]
[ rosmake ] All 2 lines
{-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mkdir: cannot create "build" directory : Permission denied
[ rosmake ] Output from build of package gazebo_plugins written to:
If I remove that dependency everything goes fine.
I need this dependency since this package is also suited for ROS electric that needs that, otherwise it cannot find folders like odometry and more.
Does anyone has the same problem? How can I solve it?
Thanks in advance for any responce,
Neostek

It seems to be the problem of gazebo_plugins package.

A:

I solved this problem. I do not know why there is no NO_BUILD file in gazebo plugin packagem then ROS tries to compile that package that is in /opt where it has no permission. If you reset the file, then everything is fine.

Never change any files in /opt. That is really bad, not only because your changed files will be overwritten by the next update. Instead, always create an overlay. See http://ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Installation/Overlays
