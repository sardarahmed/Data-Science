Q:

rosjava error: Unknown CMake command "add_java_source_dir"

Hello,
I am trying to compile a package containing ROSJAVA related code.
I am getting an error while compiling the package as below:
mkdir -p bin
cd build && cmake -Wdev -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=rospack find rosbuild/rostoolchain.cmake  ..
[rosbuild] Building package eskorta_wifi
[rosbuild] Including /opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/ros_comm/clients/rospy/cmake/rospy.cmake
[rosbuild] Including /opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/ros_comm/clients/cpp/roscpp/cmake/roscpp.cmake
[rosbuild] Including /opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/ros_comm/clients/roslisp/cmake/roslisp.cmake
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:23 (add_java_source_dir):
Unknown CMake command "add_java_source_dir".
I have checked the cMakeLists.txt which indicates right directory. It is pointing to /bin directory of the package.
Please suggest If we are doing something wrong.
Prasad

A:

rosjava doesn't seem to be installed correctly. CMake is unable to resolve the macro add_java_source_dir which is part of rosjava's cmake integration. Can you roscd into it? If not, how did you install it? Did you install the ros-diamondback-client-rosjava debian package?
