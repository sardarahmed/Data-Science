Q:

multiple kinect

Hi,
I'm trying to display pointclouds from two kinects! Actually I've instantied two openni_node (one for each kinect), remapping the topic from "camera" to, respectively, "kinect1" and "kinect2". Then I've created two other nodes that subscribe /kinect/rgb/points and, rototranslate one of the two flows.
But, when I try to visualize the output, the result is a very low frame rate video with a substantial delay!!
What can i do??
Thanks a lot
