Q:

Unable to contact my own server

I'm in the midst of trying to set up turtlebot and I have encountered this problem.
When I type "roslaunch turtlebot_bringup robot.launch" on my laptop, the following message appears
Unable to contact my own server at [http://10.217.252.66:58698/].
This usually means that the network is not configured properly.

I tried pinging myself and it works. Any ideas what might be wrong? Thanks

How to you check your .bashrc form and how do you find your ROS_IP

You can open .bashrc by typing gedit ~/.bashrc in the terminal.

A:

I solved it. I changed the following in my .bashrc from
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://10.217.252.66:11311 
export ROS_HOSTNAME=10.217.252.66

to
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://laptop_name:11311
export ROS_HOSTNAME=laptop_name

If you wanted to use numbers, you may have needed ROS_IP instead of ROS_HOSTNAME.
