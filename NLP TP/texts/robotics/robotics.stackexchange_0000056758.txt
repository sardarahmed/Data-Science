Q:

OpenNI/rviz connection to Kinect failed

Hey everyone,
I'm running Ubuntu 12.04, ros hydro, openni and now I'm trying desperately to connect my kinect to rviz.
My aim is to realize a SLAM algorithm on my Eddie robot, therfore i use the guide of Dr. Rainer Hessmer: 2d SLAM with ROS and Kinect. I would give you the link, but i have to less karma..;-)
The first steps are easy, installing the ros and openni doesn't make any problems. But after the install process, neither rviz nor openni is able to locate the kinect: rviz says: No tf data.  Actual error: Fixed Frame [openni_camera] does not exist.,openni says: no device connected (after using roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch to start the framework.).
Ubuntu itself connects with the kinect: lsusb displays the connections, so i think the drivers which come with openni are actually working.
What am I doing wrong? Any suggestions?
Thanks for your help!!!
Robin

Alright you should give a little bit more detail about your specific problems but I'm guessing these two links should help:
