Q:

URDF and RVIZ2: cylinder not showing

Hi,
I am working through the urdf_tutorials and I found that rviz doesn't show the cylinder model correctly, it only shows the circle on the floor and isn't 'extruded'. The box and sphere work fine and are shown in rviz. There aren't any errors shown in the terminal.
Link to rviz display
I am using:
ROS2 - galactic,
RVIZ2 version Alpha
Packages:
joint_state_publisher
joint_state_publisher_gui
OS: Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS 64bit with kernel 3.36.8
It looks like this is a bug in the parser? Thanks for the help!

Looks like a repeat question. Take a look at https://answers.ros.org/question/374069/rviz2-only-render-boxes/

Thanks osilva, putting LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8" to .bashrc solved my issue.
echo 'export LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8"' >>~/.bashrc

I have adjusted the ROS2 documentation to include this step. Pull Request
