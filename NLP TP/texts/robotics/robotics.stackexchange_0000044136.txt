Q:

Can a rosbridge HTML client access ROS parameters?

Hello,
Can an HTML client connecting to rosbridge (v1 or v2) access ROS parameters?   I am developing a rosbridge/HTML5/javascript GUI to teleop my robot and I'm wondering if I can set a number of parameters in the launch file used to fire up rosbridge and then access those parameters from the HTML/javascript client.
Thanks!
patrick

A:

I know that you can with rosbridge 1.0; there's a psuedo-service call that you can make to get and set parameters. I can't find the documentation for it at the moment; it shouldn't be too hard to find in you grep the source for rosbridge.py.
EDIT: In rosbridge 1.0, it looks like these services are /rosbridge/get_param and /rosbridge/set_param (rosbridge/bin/rosbridge.py lines 89-107)
I assume that it's possible with rosbridge 2.0 as well, but it's a fairly new project and the documentation doesn't seem complete just yet. Again, a short tour through the source should find it.

Thanks Austin.  So far I haven't be able to find the magic incantation in the source but I will keep looking...

Awesome!  Thanks Austin.  Dunno how I missed that since I was grep'in left and right among the files for "param" but obviously did something wrong.  In any event, this will be very useful.
