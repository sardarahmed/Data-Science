Q:

Roslocate shows wrong package version - how do I install the right one?

I've just installed ROS Kinetic from source on my Raspberry Pi (running Raspbian Stretch), and I'd like to add rosserial and rosserial_arduino.  When I looked up the packages with roslocate, I got this:
pi@raspberrypi:~/ros_catkin_ws $ roslocate info rosserial
Using ROS_DISTRO: kinetic
- git:
    local-name: rosserial
    uri: https://github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial.git
    version: jade-devel

pi@raspberrypi:~/ros_catkin_ws $ roslocate info rosserial_arduino
Using ROS_DISTRO: kinetic
- git:
    local-name: rosserial_arduino
    uri: https://github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial.git
    version: jade-devel

I haven't generated a rosinstall including these yet, because I'm worried about those version descriptions.  Is it nothing to worry about, or do I have to do something special to get the Kinetic versions rather than the Jade ones?

A:

Answering my own question after looking at the details of older versions on rosserial's wiki page: it's actually the right version.  Rosserial jade-devel is the version to use for Kinetic (and Lunar.)
