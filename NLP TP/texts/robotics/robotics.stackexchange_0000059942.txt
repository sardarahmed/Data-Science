Q:

How to delete polygons in rviz

Hi guys,
how can i delete old polygons in rviz. For Marker there is the command:
visualization_msgs::Marker::DELETE

I didn't found something similar for polygons. Does someone know the command for it? I searched also in google, but unfortunaly i find no answer yet.
Thanks a lot.

A:

The concept of "delete" doesn't exist for most display types, because they're visualizing the state of a continuous stream of data. Most display types do have a history or buffer size, which indicates how many messages to keep and display; perhaps you can adjust this value?
If you're explicitly trying to present a user interface in rviz, you should probably be using markers or interactive markers, which give you more control.
