Q:

SSH Tunnels and ROS

Hi,
Is there a way to tunnel ROS traffic over SSH, for example in cases where the ROS MASTER is not on the same network as another machine that I want to be able to connect to it. Thanks!
Edit: Never mind, I figured out how to use openvpn to achieve the same result from http://lists.willowgarage.com/pipermail/pr2-admins/2010-June/000055.html . But maybe this is useful for other people.

A:

As you mentioned OpenVPN is the most common solution to this, and is what we use at Willow and on the PR2s.

ROS uses ports allocated to it by the system, so they're not known ahead of time which makes setting up the forwarding hard, unless you basically forward all ports.

That's what I had thought, but after figuring it out I'm still a little curious as to whether it's possible to do it via ssh tunnels or not. But I guess because ROS nodes use a lot of different ports it'd be hard to do.
