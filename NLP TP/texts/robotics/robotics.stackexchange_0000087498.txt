Q:

Panorma Turtlebot

I am working with the turtlebot 3 when i am using the function
rosservice call turtlebot3_panorama/take_pano 0 360.0 30.0 0.3

i never get 360 degree pictures but rather 180 degree
Also when i select the panorama picture in rqt_image_view during the process of snapshot taking it seems to crash the process resulting in: at the end of panorama programm

A:

I've seen this same error writing a node in Python. The problem was that, before cv2.imencode(), one of the images was None (the NULL equivalent in Python). So check that your images are not NULL or 0xN or whatever alike. Good luck!
