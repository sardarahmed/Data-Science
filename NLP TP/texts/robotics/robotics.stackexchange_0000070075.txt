any ideas about this?
I am pretty sure my cameras are OK, I could find in ls /dev/video* , I even write a simple opencv program showing that I can get my camera run.
Any ideas about this? Thanks!

What permissions does ls -l /dev/video* show?
Comment by flankechen on 2015-10-27:
@joq, the permission is: crwxrwxrwx+
Comment by joq on 2015-10-27:
How about /dev/bus/usb/001/*?

A:

Hi,
Unless you're logged in a root then you will not have permission to write to the /dev/bus/usb/001/002 device.
I've just worked around this and it's a bit messy and you have to do it every time you connect the camera. Change your path to /dev/bus/usb/001/ and type "sudo chown  002"
This will give your user the permissions to access this device.
