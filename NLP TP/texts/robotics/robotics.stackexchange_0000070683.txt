Q:

Publish to topic from file

Hello,
I am quite new to ROS. I have a logfile (format: .pcapng) and I want to write a node which receives the logged udp-packets (as a simulation; later, the node should receive these packets from a CAN). My problem is the following: I know how to write a subscriber-node, but how can I make the file publishing the packets (as messages) to a topic?
I have read something about ROS bags, but I am not sure whether they are the way to go. I would prefer some kind of programm with which I could play the file, so that I simply had to write the subscriber node.
Thanks!

A:

It's a bit more complex, but the  velodyne_driver node just does that (ie: it uses a pcap file as stand-in for a connection to an actual device).
See ros-drivers/velodyne/velodyne_driver/src/lib/input.cc, L187-L304, which is then used in the velodyne_driver/src/driver/driver.cc, L89-L99 itself.
