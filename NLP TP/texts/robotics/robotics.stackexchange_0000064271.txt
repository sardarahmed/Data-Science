Q:

turtlebot_node/TurtlebotSensorState.h: No such file or directory

I write my code use bumper sensor. But when I include library TurtlebotSensorState and catkin_make has error
/home/mai/catkin_ws/src/second/src/bump.cpp:9:49: fatal error: turtlebot_node/TurtlebotSensorState.h: No such file or directory
#include <turtlebot_node/TurtlebotSensorState.h>
^

A:

TurtlebotSensorState is a ROS message type defined in the "turtlebot_node" package. If you get an "No such file or directory" error that likely means you havenÂ´t properly specified the "turtlebot_node" dependency in the package you are working on. See Dependency Management here.

You have to also adjust settings in the CMakeLists.txt, see the link I posted.
