Q:

general doubt in erratic urdf

I am trying to write a urdf for a rover which is like erratic robot in some aspects,but it is very big compared to it.So i tried changing urdf file of erratic  to suit my rover.However i was not able to change the wheel of the erratic robot because it is a stl file.Can you suggest me anyways to change the stl file to make it bigger.i am a newbie to ros.pardon me if the question is trivial.thanking you

A:

Hi, there are a couple of things you can do. The easiest one to try is to specify a scale parameter on the mesh (see http://www.ros.org/wiki/urdf/XML/Link for reference on URDF). Another option is to replace the mesh with a primitive cylinder shape which should work equally well.

I tried that but i was not able to parse it.It is showing the following error.Invalid  tag: Cannot load command parameter [robot_description]: command [/opt/ros/cturtle/stacks/common/xacro/xacro.py '/home/avinash/ros/raven_robot_model/urdf/raven.urdf.xacro'] returned with code [1].  raise XacroException("included file [%s] generated an error during XML parsing: %s"%(filename, str(e)))

Execute "gedit rospack find erratic_description/urdf/erratic_wheel.xacro" and modify lines 36 and 44 to have scale attribute, e.g.  to make the wheel twice as large.
