Q:

SIFT object recognition using Laptop camera + ROS

Hi,
I need help to implement SIFT object recognition in ROS with the help of taking images from Laptop camera. Is there any code that is already there for ROS + SIFT object recognition?

A:

Sift can be implemented using opencv2 library. Convert your image from a ROS type image to a opencv type image using cv_bridge and then you can use the opencv libraries to implement SIFT. Remember to also include #include <opencv2/nonfree/features2d.hpp>. Sift features can be initialized using cv::Ptr<cv::FeatureDetector> detect = new cv::SiftFeatureDetector; and Sift descriptors : cv::Ptr<cv::DescriptorExtractor> detect = new cv::SurfDescriptorExtractor; You could replace the word Sift with Surf or Orb for the feature detector. And you could also replace the descriptor with Surf or Brief.
