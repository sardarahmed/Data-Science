Q:

openni_ros - xtion pro - network connection has been closed!

I'm trying to get some depth data out of the Xtion Pro.  I'm on ubuntu 10.0.4.  I'm using the latest version of openni_ros and I'm following the directions at http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_launch under 3. Quick Start to the T.
Unfortunately, I don't see any data in rviz, and I get the following message in the console.  It looks like it can't detect my device?
[ INFO] [1314686850.673973496]: Number devices connected: 1
[ INFO] [1314686850.674117789]: 1. device on bus 003:02 is a PrimeSense Device (600) from PrimeSense (1d27) with serial id ''

Reason: openni_wrapper::OpenNIDevice::OpenNIDevice(xn::Context&, const xn::NodeInfo&, const xn::NodeInfo&, const xn::NodeInfo&, const xn::NodeInfo&) @ /opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/openni_ros/openni_camera/src/openni_device.cpp @ 61 : creating depth generator failed. Reason: The network connection has been closed!

Any ideas on what this closed network connection might be?  And how I might repair it? Any one else using an Xtion Pro experiencing similar issues?

Yes, using Electric.  Yes running roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch.  Yes it is an Xtion pro.  Any additional info I could give to get help?

A couple clarifications: you're using Electric and getting this error following roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch? Also, your device is an Xtion Pro (no RGB camera) and not the new Xtion Pro Live? Following the openni_launch instructions, I'm able to use my Xtion Pro.

A:

Hi. It seems that your system is confused between the Diamondback installation and the Electric installation. The last line of your error dump references Diamondback. Make sure your environment is set up correctly.
