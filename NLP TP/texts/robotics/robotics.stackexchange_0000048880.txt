Q:

rviz goal topic: fuerte vs groovy

Did the default 2D Nav Goal topic advertised by rviz change from fuerte to groovy? It appears the new default is move_base_simple/goal, and the old one was just goal.
Is this intentional? I think it's cleaner if the default topic is just the generic goal, and the user can remap this using launch files, or vcg files. It seems the change broke our launch files between fuerte and groovy.

Please use https://github.com/ros-visualization/rviz/issues for bug reports.
The next release of RViz will have this fixed.

Thanks. Wasn't sure if bug or user error.
