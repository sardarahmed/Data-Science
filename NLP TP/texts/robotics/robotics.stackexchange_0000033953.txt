Q:

Unknown CMake command "rospack"

I'm trying to build old ROS package (originally made in 2009 by a third party). make returns this error:
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:5 (rospack):
Unknown CMake command "rospack".

1st 5 lines of CMakeLists.txt:
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.6)

include($ENV{ROS_ROOT}/core/rosbuild/rosbuild.cmake)

rospack(navgtn_common)

rospack runs from terminal with admin privilege.
rosmake seems also stuck at rospack in the same manner (output).
Google  tells me that using find_package might be a solution (reference) but then I haven't figured out which package to call within that function.
Env: diamondback, Ubuntu 10.10
Any idea? Thanks.

A:

You are looking for a ROS package, right?
Then have a look at the rosbuild find_ros_package docs.

@dornhege thanks. Replacing "rospack" with "rosbuild_find_ros_package" has cleared the error. Didn't know CMake macros and command-line tools are different...
