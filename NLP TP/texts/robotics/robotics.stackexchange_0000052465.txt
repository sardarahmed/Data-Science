Q:

rospack error(libboost_system_mt-1.48.so)

Hi, I'm trying to cross-compile Nao V4.
But when I use rospack command, following error message comes out.
rospack: error while loading shared libraries: libboost_system-mt-1_48.so.1.48.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
I tried installing library files by "$ sudo apt-get install libboost-system libboost-dev etc. But nothing has been solved.
In fact, I found out this error when I tried to source $TARGETDIR/workspace_nao/setup.bash, which contained "rospack" command. This content came from tutorial. When I tried to source setup.bash, following error message came out.
rospack could not be found, you cannot have rosbash features until you bootstrap ros
So I think that it is the error coming from rospack error related with library(libboost?).
Is there Anyone who knows the solution?
Thanks in advance! :)

Actually, I'm using ubuntu 10.04 now, but I'm not sure why libboost1.48 is needed..

A:

If you have switched Ubuntu versions you need to make sure to clean all build artifacts.  Likely you have either a CMakeCache or simply libraries which were linked on the other OS and now cannot be loaded because there's a different version of boost installed.
