Q:

Quaternion to Radians

Hello,
I'm writing a node to control my robot, but the odom orientation is in quaternions and the algorithm I have uses angles(radians). How do I convert this? There probably is some function that does this?
Anyone knows?
Thx so much.

Have you tried Google? Something like "ros quaternion to euler"? We do expect a little effort of your own here ..

A:

See this answer. It has examples of nodes in roscpp and rospy that do the conversion. If you just want to run the conversion in your code you can strip out the relevant function calls.
