Q:

Calibrating Logitic C920 HD 1080p using ros kinetic

I am trying to follow the ROS monocular camera calibration for a USB camera I have, but the calibration routine fails when I try to run it. I was expecting to see an image like the one below, but I get a segmentation fault instead.

These are the commands I used to try to start the calibration routine:
mona@Mona:~$ roscore
mona@Mona:~/catkin_ws/src/usb_cam$  rosrun usb_cam usb_cam_node
mona@Mona:~/catkin_ws/src/usb_cam$ rosrun rviz rviz
mona@Mona:~/catkin_ws/src/usb_cam$ rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --size 8x6 --square 0.108 image:=/camera/image_raw camera:=/camera

But this is the output I get:
('Waiting for service', '/camera/set_camera_info', '...')
Service not found
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

What am I missing? How should I get it to work? When I list the ROS topics, I get:
$ rostopic list
/rosout
/rosout_agg
/usb_cam/camera_info
/usb_cam/image_raw
/usb_cam/image_raw/compressed
/usb_cam/image_raw/compressed/parameter_descriptions
/usb_cam/image_raw/compressed/parameter_updates
/usb_cam/image_raw/compressedDepth
/usb_cam/image_raw/compressedDepth/parameter_descriptions
/usb_cam/image_raw/compressedDepth/parameter_updates
/usb_cam/image_raw/theora
/usb_cam/image_raw/theora/parameter_descriptions
/usb_cam/image_raw/theora/parameter_updates

A:

Based on rostopic list I realized the correct name of camera:
/usb_cam instead of /camera
so the command changed to
$ rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --size 8x6 --square 0.108 image:=/usb_cam/image_raw camera:=/usb_cam
('Waiting for service', '/usb_cam/set_camera_info', '...')
OK

Using the /usb_cam name, I was able to connect to the camera and get video:

You might notice that CALIBRATE button is grayed out so you would need to move in various direction (back and forth/right and left) so it becomes green. Eventually you will see the following (pretty much like calibrating a parrot drone):

Now go ahead and press the calibrate button and you are good to go.
For example, I am interested in the fx, fy, cx, cy that are presented in camera matrix. There are output on screen after you click on CALIBRATE button:
