A:

I would say it should work as long as you can make all of the parts work together. Here is a driver for the BNO055: https://github.com/mdrwiega/bosch_imu_driver ....and you could use some of that with some of this: http://www.hessmer.org/blog/2010/11/21/sending-data-from-arduino-to-ros/
or for a much easier method, use this: https://github.com/RTIMULib/RTIMULib-Arduino and probably communicate with rosserial- http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial and here is something to help you install it if you are running kinetic -http://answers.ros.org/question/236351/rosserial-on-ros-kinetic/
good luck
