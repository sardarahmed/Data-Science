Q:

Revolute joint in Gazebo with gazebo_ros_control not working

It seems like we can't control revolute joints with gazebo_ros_control plugin.
The easiest way to reproduce it is to clone the gazebo_ros_demos repo and edit the rrbot.xacro by replacing the continuous joint with a revolute joint.
Then the control doesn't work anymore.
here is the part of the urdf I changed (l.55-63 of rrbot.xacro):
  <joint name="joint1" type="revolute">
    <parent link="link1"/>
    <child link="link2"/>
    <origin xyz="0 ${width} ${height1 - axel_offset}" rpy="0 0 0"/>
    <axis xyz="0 1 0"/>

    <limit effort="100" velocity="30" upper="-3.14" lower="3.14"/>
    <dynamics damping="0.7"/>
  </joint>

Has anybody succeeded in controlling revolute joints in gazebo ?

Have you specified the limits?

I think I found my mistakes, I swapped the upper and lower limit values ....

A:

I found the solution, the lower and upper limit were inverted
