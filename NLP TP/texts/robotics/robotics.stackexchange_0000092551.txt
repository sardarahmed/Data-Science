Q:

[ROS2] Will all nodes implemented on_parameter_event be notified if set_parameters is called?

If we do ros2 set param <node> <param> <value>, they will all be notified. How about if we create a parameter client and call set_parameters(...)?

A:

I am not sure if I get the answer myself.
I was using AsyncParametersClient and all other nodes implement on_parameter_event are not notified.  I was also calling set_parameters in another thread so that's an issue.
But if I use SyncParametersClient, they are notified.

Another thing is, only the node that is passed to the parameter client is notified. All other nodes are not. If we run ros2 param set ..., all other nodes are also notified.
