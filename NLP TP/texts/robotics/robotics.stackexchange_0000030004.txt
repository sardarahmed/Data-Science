Q:

Transform between Kinect skeleton base frame and camera frame

I am trying to use the ROS NI drivers (openni_camera) with the Kinect, and additionally use openni_tracker to get the transforms for the joints for a detected skeleton. However, the joint transforms are published under the "/openni_depth" frame, which doesn't exist in the tree of frames published by the kinect_frames.launch file. Setting an identity static transform between /openni_depth_frame and /openni_depth didn't seem to give correct results.
Does anybody know the transform between /openni_depth and a frame in the hierarchy published by the driver?
Thanks,
Peter Brook

That kforge link didn't seem to work, I get a 404 error. It seems that https://kforge.ros.org/openni/ isn't on the server?

I've opened a ticket to make these line work by default again. https://kforge.ros.org/openni/Trac/ticket/6

A:

I just tested it now, openni_depth was changed to default to openni_depth_frame so that also needs to be the default in openni_tracker.
I'm updating the code to be parameterizable with parameter ~/camera_frame_id defaulting to openni_depth_frame.

It might be interesting to have the output printed in ROS_INFO or ROS_DEBUG format.
