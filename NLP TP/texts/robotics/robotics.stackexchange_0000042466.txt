Q:

Subscribe to information output to screen by Gmapping?

Is there a way to subscribe to the information output to the screen by Gmapping? It prints out a lot more information that it allows subscriptions to or services for. I want to be able to get that information without modifying the Gmapping code.

In which datum specifically are you interested?
Comment by IFLORbot on 2012-07-19:
Specifically, I'm interested in the Average Scan Matching Score and the Scan Matching Failed alert.

I'm unfamiliar with how to open the output in a pipe....
EDIT: After reading about ROS launch output, (either output to "screen" or "log") piping does seem to be the ONLY way. Thanks for the advice

@dornhege was right. I was able to pipe it into a simple publisher I wrote. Thanks. I am now opening up a new Question to see if I can add pipes to roslaunch xml files.

A:

IIRC gmapping does not use ROS_... output, so it is not possible by a ROS way. You could still open the output in a pipe or something like that.
