Q:

ros wiki package website incorrect

For my package 'moveit_simple_grasps' the ROS wiki seems to have the wrong website on the right side toolbox...
On: http://wiki.ros.org/moveit_simple_grasps
There is a link that says "moveit_simple_grasps website" but it links to
https://github.com/davetcoleman/simple_grasps/
When it should link to
https://github.com/davetcoleman/MOVEIT_simple_grasps/
According to ros / rosdistro / indigo / distribution.yaml
moveit_simple_grasps:
doc:
type: git
url: https://github.com/davetcoleman/moveit_simple_grasps.git
version: indigo-devel
release:
tags:
release: release/indigo/{package}/{version}
url: https://github.com/davetcoleman/moveit_simple_grasps-release.git
version: 1.2.0-1
source:
type: git
url: https://github.com/davetcoleman/moveit_simple_grasps.git
version: indigo-devel
status: developed

So where is it getting this incorrect information? Is there some hidden filter for the moveit keyword I don't know about?

A:

It is wrong in the package.xml:
https://github.com/davetcoleman/moveit_simple_grasps/blob/8210abc0236f99e73900a7a8709842ed78bd3a4a/package.xml
