Q:

Please suggest me which RTOS can be integrated with ROS?

Hi,
I am working on a 7- axis robot in which each joint is controlling by a BLDC motor with the help of Elmo gold whistle drive. The motor drive is using Ethercat  as a communication interface using SOEM drivers. Now, coming to the Ethercat communication part, is it necessary to use RTOS to avoid packet loss or can SOEM driver it-self can take care about the transmission and packet loss?  What is the role of RTOS, if it is necessary to integrate?

A:

It is possible to use SOEM to control a number of EtherCAT slaves without an RTOS. This is done on the KUKA youbot for example:
https://github.com/youbot/youbot_driver
Since the Master is in control of the EtherCAT cycle, package loss should not be a problem. However, on a general-purpose OS (non-RTOS), such as Ubuntu with mainline Kernel, you will experience control jitter. In some cases, the EtherCAT slaves expect a new control message every few milliseconds. And if they do not receive the message in time, they will shut down. This behavior is entirely slave dependant.
