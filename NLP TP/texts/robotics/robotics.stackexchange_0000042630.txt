What is Nav?

A:

The costmap needs to be in a fixed frame, i.e. frames that do not move in the world. Normally, only map and odom are fixed frames and since you do not have odom, using map should be fine.
The reason why odom is used in map is that map can "jump" because of the particle filter based localization algorithm. If that happens, obstacles get sort of blurred because different cells are set in the costmap. Odometry is continuous, i.e. no jumps can happen and the costmap isn't blurred.
