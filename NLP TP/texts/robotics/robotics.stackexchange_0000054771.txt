Q:

Publishing scene does not make planner take it into account

Hello everyone,
I'm working with a model of the schunk 7DOF arm in moveit. I import objects into the environment and publish the scene but still the planner provides a path that goes through the object. I get the sense that the planning pipeline and rviz are not communicating on the same topic.
How do I find out and fix it?
Thanks much

A:

Turned out the issue was using the joint state publisher gui to set the goal configuration. Path planning worked fine if the final configuration was set from rviz.
