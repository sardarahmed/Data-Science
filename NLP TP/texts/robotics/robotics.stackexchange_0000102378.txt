Q:

Could an upgraded Ubuntu cause problems?

I had previously used Ubuntu 20.04.4 on an Odroid M1 without any issues. Compiled and successfully used a few packages of ROS including rosbridge and rplidar. Since the update I have not been able to execute rosrun as it says the files are not executables. In the time I have not changed any of the ROS directories and not been working on them. I always source before hand but the problem remains.
Could these issues be attributed to the upgrade of Ubuntu and if so how can I get my projects working again?
In the mean time I have tried reflashing the image so the packages must be installed again. Catkin_make completes successfully but nothing will execute.
At the moment all attempts at rosrun xxx xxx.launch return the error:
odroid@gnome-desktop:~$ rosrun rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket.launch
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named rosbridge_websocket.launch below /opt/ros/noetic/share/rosbridge_server
[rosrun] Found the following, but they're either not files,
[rosrun] or not executable:
[rosrun]   /opt/ros/noetic/share/rosbridge_server/launch/rosbridge_websocket.launch

A:

The rosbridge_websocket.launch is a lunch file. Therefore, please use roslaunch instead of rosrun as shown below:
roslaunch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket.launch

Okay great that works perfectly now for rosbridge_server. There is a new problem that arose now in that it doesn't work for built packages from the catkin_ws. Trying to launch my rplidar with the sae command and as suggested in the official documentation (http://wiki.ros.org/rplidar). The following error occurs:
odroid@gnome-desktop:~$ roslaunch rplidar_ros rplidar.launch 
RLException: [rplidar.launch] is neither a launch file in package [rplidar_ros] nor is [rplidar_ros] a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

The same happens with Hector_slam. This is after I have sourced both catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash and /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
