Q:

DDS on ROS osrf prototype

Hi everybody.
At the moment I'm trying do build a DDS implementation on ROS. The only code I found about it was the
https://github.com/osrf/ros_dds .
I've build the cpp example and it worked, but when I want to build the prototype, the catkin_make is not working
***DDS parse error DDS undefined at line: 27 (searching from scope 'Time_')
make[2]: *** [~/ros_dds/ros_dds-master/prototype/devel/include/std_msgs/dds_impl/Time_.h] Error 255
make[1]: *** [ros-packages/std_msgs/CMakeFiles/std_msgs_generate_messages_idlcpp.dir/all] Error 2
make[1]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....
[  7%] Built target actionlib_msgs_generate_messages_cpp
[  7%] Built target diagnostic_msgs_generate_messages_idl
[  7%] Built target diagnostic_msgs_generate_messages_cpp
make: *** [all] Error 2
Invoking "make" failed

Is there any solution for this?
Is there any other prototype or developed thing?
I don't want to wait until ROS2 is released :)

Are you really trying to implement DDS on top of ROS? The repo you refer to as well as ROS 2 implement ROS on top of DDS.

Yeah, that was the plan. I want to have a showcase for DDS, favoring it with ROS (e.g. using gazebo) and I'm very interested in using ROS. I thought there'd be more development of it. Next I'll try the one of William down there.

There is also the work done by these guys to use DDS as a transport option in ROS 1: http://cyberdb.github.io/micROS-RT/
