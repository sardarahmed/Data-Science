A:

This link may be helped youhttps://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2/issues/19,I used the http://recherche.enac.fr/~drouin/slam/orbslam2/poine_orbslam2_04_07_16.tgz which is wrote by @Michael and I can save the map and load the map successfully.(Note:when you use this package you should add the camera.with and camera.height in your yaml file). Good luck!
