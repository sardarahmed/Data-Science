Warning: stack names have underscores, but the corresponding Debian package names substitute dashes. So, it's really ros-fuerte-camera-umd.
Comment by Eric Perko on 2012-05-23:
Note that not all stacks/packages have debs.

A:

The debs should be named ros--
What I do is:

Find the package in the wiki. In the navigation bar you usually can find out the stack is named STACK.

Look for ros-fuerte-STACK.
