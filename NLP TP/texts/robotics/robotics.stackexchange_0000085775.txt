Q:

Path of catkin workspace appears in install space

UPDATE 201803100806 I can provide a reproduce sample.
Workspace path is mixed in install space. This makes me worry that I might have done something wrong, but I'm not quite sure.

Q1. Is this supposed to be so?
Q2. If the built package distributed to another computer that doesn't have the same path, would it still work?

Issue
In install space I see many mentions of the absolute path of catkin workspace as some of them citead below. I do NOT though see the catkin ws path in setup.*sh, and also when I ran source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash I do not see the catkin ws path in any environment variables.
Commands to reproduce:

A:

I may have missed it, but what is your question exactly? Many of the occurences that you show are in if (..) .. else .. constructs, and the workspace path is not supposed to be used then, as those if statements check for which space they are actually in.
