Q:

Hydro Indigo interoperability

If I have one system running ROS Hydro and another system running ROS Indigo, will nodes started on one of these systems be able to interact with nodes from the other (presuming the ROS_MASTER_URI is set correctly)?

In general yes, as long as the message definitions have not changed. It's not recommended, and should be heavily tested before being relied upon.
