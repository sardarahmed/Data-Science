Q:

accessing skeletal tracker data

I had a problem in accessing and processing of the data given by Kinect in Openni package.
The problem is I am piping the Kinect data to a text file using
rostopic echo /tf >> data.txt
then I am simultaneously trying to access the same data file in another program, but once i run this program the previous command stops writing into the data file. Can anyone please tell how do I make the computer do both the tasks simultaneously?

A:

It sounds weird what you are trying. Of course it depends on the application but use this as thumb the rule:

If you want to see or store logging data: using ROS looging features and tools (like rxconsole) are recommended.
If you want to store structured data for an specific postprocessing or analysis: using rosbag is recommended.
If you want to communicate many processes: using the ROS communication mechanisms (topics, services, actions) are recommended.
