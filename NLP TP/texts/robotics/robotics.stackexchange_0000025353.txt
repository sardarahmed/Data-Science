I think its the directory of the world file, are you also getting directory not found error?

Hi,  I am getting an error that says "Image filename is empty"

I believe this is an error that you can ignore, and has been removed in the default branch. Are you experiencing any related problems?

when I specify a png heightmap, it doesn't load the heightmap, instead a large 2d black rectangle where the heightmap should be.  The Pioneer robot is next to this space on the ground.  I have attached a screenshot of gazebo, my heightmap mage, and the world file at http://inky.ws/g/2cz

oh, and I am using gazebo-1.2.5

A:

Base paths for relative URIs are specified in environment variables. For example GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH.
