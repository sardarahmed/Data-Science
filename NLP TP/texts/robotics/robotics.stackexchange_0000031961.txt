A:

You need root permissions to create files in /opt/ros/diamondback/ros
Instead, you should create them somewhere in your user directory, for example, ~/ros
You will need to set your $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH variable to let ROS know to look into that directory. To do so, edit your /opt/ros/diamondback/setup.sh file to include these lines:
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/ros
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks:${ROS_PACKAGE_PATH}
