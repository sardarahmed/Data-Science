Are you sure the earlier commands completed successfully? If you don't have that file, I fear that you haven't installed ROS at all.

Kinectic works fine on Raspberry Pi with Mate 16.04

As @S_Lzrnk mentions, Indigo is not supported on 16.04, but Kinetic should be. I'm not sure about RPi2 binary builds though.

HI... I got the solution. If you use the command
sudo apt-get update --fix-missing

this will solve the problem.
