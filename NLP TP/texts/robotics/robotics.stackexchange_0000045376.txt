Q:

GraphName() private access Error in rosjava_core

Hi,
I created my own new package and took the Talker and Listener code from pubsub tutorial pkg.I build it using "gradle build" command I get error for both Talker and Listener:
my_workspace/test_java_core/src/main/java/org/ros/test_java_core/Listener.java:28: GraphName(java.lang.String) has private access in org.ros.namespace.GraphName return new GraphName("test_java_core/listener"); I took listener and talker from pubsub tutorial.
how to fix it? Thanks,

A:

The "Getting Started" page is a little outdated on that point. Instead of:
return new GraphName("rosjava_tutorial_pubsub/listener");

you should use:
return GraphName.of("rosjava_tutorial_pubsub/listener");

The rosjava_tutorial_pubsub package already has these changes.

it builds but it does not creat ".classpath",".project" files and ".settings/"directory as in pubsub pkg. Because I cannot run it I execute "./build/install/test_java_core/bin/test_java_core org.ros.test_java_core.Talker" get error:"./build/install/test_java_core/bin/test_java_core: Data not found"

add
apply plugin: 'eclipse'

to your build.gradle, run gradle eclipse.

It builds and now the files are also made but it gives the same  which I mentioned above when I apply command "./build/install/test_java_core/bin/test_java_core org.ros.test_java". Do I need to add something in baschrc? I dont know why it cannot find /build/install/test_java_core/bin/test_java_core.
