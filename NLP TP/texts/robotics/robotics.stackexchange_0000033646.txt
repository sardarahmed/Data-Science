@tfoote Sorry for hijacking the question, but it is related. This timer uses the wall time right? I couldn't find any evidence other than triggeering earlier than expected when Gazebo runs at 0.3 time factor.

Yes it's what we call wall time. It's just timeouts from gtest/python unit testing frameworks. Otherwise if the simulation hung the test would never time out.

Makes sense. Thanks a lot!
