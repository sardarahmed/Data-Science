Q:

Find Rostopic dataType cpp

Hi
I am writing a publisher/subscriber for a ros topic, but i would like to find the dataType of the topic programatically (instead of from rostopic info) in the code. Is there a way to query the topic info in c++?
A sample code would be much appreciated.
thanks
sid

A:

Yes, the Master/Slave using xmlrpc is used for that. There is some python sample code. You should be able to use that same functionality in C++.
