Q:

Is there any ROS class have videos available?

What I know about ROS video is only about Workshop or CoTeSys, that is great for anyone who want to learn more about ROS.
I want to know if there exist any formal class for ROS, it will be very great to deep understanding ROS, and contribute to it.
If no one exist,is anyone can create it?
Thank you very much~

There are several classes linked on this page. However, I'm not sure if there are videos for any of them.
