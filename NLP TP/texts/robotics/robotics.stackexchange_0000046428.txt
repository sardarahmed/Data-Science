Q:

Catkin conversion: /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lPACKAGE_NAME

I'm trying to convert some packages to catkin from rosbuild but one of my packages, "clam_controller", keeps getting the error:

/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lclam_controller

Which appears to me to be trying to link against itself. Nothing else is yet linking to this library - nothing depends on clam_controller yet.
I'm sure this is a simple fix but I have tried everything I could in tweaking my new CMakeLists.txt. The super simple old rosbuild script is here.
I'm on Groovy and Ubuntu 12.04.
Thanks!

A:

In your CMakeLists your telling it to link against that:
target_link_libraries(joint_state_aggregator 
  ${PROJECT_NAME} ${catkin_LIBRARIES} )

just remove ${PROJECT_NAME}
