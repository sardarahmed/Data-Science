Q:

Why do people use camera instead of laser sensor for robot navigation?

I am working on Robot localization and navigation in urban environments. I want to use a camera. But I am a little bit confused about LRF (laser range finder) data or other laser data.
Why people want to use camera?
Why not LRF or other laser data?
Can anyone explain please in favor of Camera?

A:

A 3D laser range finder or LIDAR such as the one on the Google Car is far more expensive than a camera. The other reason is that while in case of a LIDAR the distance of every pixel is available, the generated data to be processed is enormous. You have to transfer and process data faster which comes out again as rising cost. Finally cameras usually have a longer lifetime, so there is less maintenance required.
With relatively cheap cameras and computer vision, pretty good results can be achieved.

A:

In addition to those points in Bence's answer, cameras can:

Calculate many complex features that result in very robust matching between frames, and object recognition
High angular resolution (typical low->high range goes from $0.5^\circ$ -> $0.025^\circ$)
Lower power usage
Passive sensor (doesn't require 'clean' signal of a laser)

A:

navigation in urban environments

Depending on the laser, there might be legal constraints on where you can use it. Running around town throwing laser rays around might require special permission/licence.
