Q:

Is multiple cameras views for mjpeg_server possible?

I am trying to set up multiple camera views for tele-operation under mjpeg_server. I would like to utilize up to 4 cameras running on one machine simultaneously to be output to one webpage. Or possibly use uvc_camera to run the camera feeds into ros and use rosservice to set which camera outputs to mjpeg_server. Anyone running this type of setup or something similar, any advice would be appreciated. I have also tried using the options under gscam. But it only allows for 2 camera views in the same window and I was not able to get it working either.

A:

I assume a page can display 4 different image streams by including 4 img tags to the appropriate topics, which might look something like: "img src="http://localhost:8080/stream?topic=/robot/cameraN">"
I have not tried this yet for 4 image streams, but it should be easy to test.
