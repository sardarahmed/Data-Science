Q:

Running Nav2DWidget without pr2/gazebo/rviz

I got the Nav2DWidget tutorial to work fine but my objective is to have a simple mobile base in the place of pr2. I see that the system uses a move-base action but I am not sure how to re-purpose it to work it with a simple mobile base.
Thanks in advance.

A:

The move_base node provides the move base action. All of the tuning and setup can be lengthy, but there's a good ROS tutorial that goes through the basics pretty well: http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup . I believe there are also several books on the subject, but I haven't read any.
