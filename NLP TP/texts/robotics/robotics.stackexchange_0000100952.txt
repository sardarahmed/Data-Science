Q:

ros2 concatenate LaunchConfiguration with string for function argument

In a ros2 python launch script, I want to concatenate a LaunchConfiguration with a string and pass it to a function. I can't seem to figure out how to do this.
def load_file(package_name, file)
   # body of function

prefix = LaunchConfiguration("name")

# package_name = prefix + "_pkg"
contents = load_file(package_name, file)

Here package_name needs to be the concatenation of a LaunchConfiguration and a literal string. There must be a way I can do this - no?

A:

As far as I know, the only easy way* to concatenate a LaunchConfiguration with a string is by passing them as a list in any parameter of type "SomeSubstitutionsType" as shown here.
*The harder convoluted way would be by using the OpaqueFunction as described in this answer. It's feels hackier but gives more flexibility

Since the parameter that needs the concatenation isn't a substitution type, the list method doesn't work. However, the OpaqueFunction approach works and I was able to get it to work. Thanks.
