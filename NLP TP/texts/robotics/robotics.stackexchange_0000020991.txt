Q:

How can I leverage my experience with the JVM and Android to do some hobby-level building and controlling robots at home?

I'm looking for a product for home hobby-level robotics. Something that has modular robot hardware allowing me to design the robot itself, but lets me write the logic in a JVM or Android language. I have searched several times so I'm not expecting a big list, but it could be designed any of three ways that I can think of:

connects to a configurable API endpoint, OR conversely,

publishes an HTTP or RPC API for a controlling client to connect to, or

supports running a jar or apk on the robot itself, or
plugs into and carries around an Android device or small computer with some standard language-agnostic way of communicating with control APIs locally.

I'd like to dabble in robotics. The thing I know best is the JVM. For better or worse, I've worked almost exclusively with the JVM for over 10 years and know several JVM-based languages. Call me specialized, but I'm not investing full work days in developing a new skill, and if I can't lean on my familiarity with known tech, I would anticipate dipping a toe into robotics to be more frustrating than fun. I know the JVM is heavy for the low-cost, bare-metal architecture choices that are typically made in the field of robotics; let's not talk about that here.
Extra points if a kit comes with a Kotlin library.

A:

Have you taken a look at LeJOS? It's a port of the Java VM and SDK to the various Lego MINDSTORMS robot kits. The Lego kits themselves are quite capable as hobbyist robotics kits go, I bought the NXT version years ago and had a lot of fun with it. The newest EV3 kit has a powerful ARM CPU and an SD card reader for loading software, it looks like a good option if you don't want to spend much time fiddling around with firmware installation.
