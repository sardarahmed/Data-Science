Q:

roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch no devices connected

I have seen alot discussions regarding this topic. And i was able to install numerous libraries relating to this topic. Using the guidlines mentioned in this link on github, i executed the command of  ./bin/Protonect and kinect was working giving visuals. After i closed it and tried to run openni launch, it gave me this error which is mostly discussed.

Im using ROS Indigo 14.04 LTS with processor Intel® Core™ i5-3210M CPU @ 2.50GHz × 4  and the graphics is Intel® Ivybridge Mobile. Im using Kinect V2.
Im totally out of options of how to proceed and still want to figure out how to make things work using kinect V2. Kindly provide me with suggestions or solutions on how to make kinect v2 start working.

Just a note: please don't indent lines with 4 spaces or more, as that is how code blocks and performatted text gets recognised on this forum. I've updated your question already, but keep it in mind for next time.

@gvdhoorn Thank you for updating. My error for not writing in proper format. Forgot to write in proper format. Any suggestions on the question asked.

A:

Well, afaik, the Kinect2 isn't compatible with the infrastructure that the openni package provides. I would try getting iai_kinect2 working.
