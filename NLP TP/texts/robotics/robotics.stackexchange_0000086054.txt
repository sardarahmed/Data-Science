It might be useful if you could post a bag file.

Upload it to something like Google Drive or Dropbox, then post a link here

A:

I'm using the same drivers and I experience the same phenomena with the HDL-32. However, if you save the point cloud, e.g. with...
$ rosrun pcl_ros pointcloud_to_pcd input:=/velodyne_points 

...you should see that the full point cloud without the shadow. In addition, if you record the data and then play it back with rosbag, you shouldn't see the shadow but you may still see a "ripple" effect that rotates around the cloud in the same way.
I think that the problem is related to how RViz displays or refreshes point clouds in it's visual display. As far as I can tell it doesn't seem to adversely affect the point cloud in any way.

Hmmm... that's odd. It would be best if you could upload a sample bag file to something like Google Drive or Dropbox and then post a link to it in your question. Then everyone can see it and take a look.
