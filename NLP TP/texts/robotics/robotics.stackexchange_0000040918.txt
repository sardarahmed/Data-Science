Q:

compressed image to image

I'm using rosjava to write code, but now when i use pi_face_tracker, i come across problems. The input of the pi_face_tracker should be type image, but what i get form the camera is compressed image. What should i do to solve it? Thank you.

A:

You can use the republish node to convert the transport from compressed to raw. Your call will look something like this:
rosrun image_transport republish compressed in:=(in_base_topic) raw out:=(out_base_topic)

I don't know what class i can use for this in rosjava, can you help me on it?

@han: I am not sure if I understand your question. You cannot call this in code from Java. It is a C++ binary. You should run it as a node alongside pi_face_tracker.

How could I include this rosrun inside of a launch file?
