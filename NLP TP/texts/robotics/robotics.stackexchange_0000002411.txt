Q:

Robotic part to dispense candy

I'm a complete newbie trying to build a simple robot that dispenses candy (M&M, skittles, etc).  However, since I'm not familiar with the field, I'm having a hard time googling because I don't know the correct terms to search for.  I'm looking for a piece to build a robotic 'trap door' of sorts that will open for a specified amount of time to release candy.  What parts can I use and what is are called?  I've tried robotic lever, robotic door, etc with no luck.

A:

Your mechanism will depend on the type of dispenser you want. Like if its gravity feed or not. I will assume it is, so I make this sketch to give you some idea:

The hole size will depend on how many candy you want to dispense at each stroke. (Of course its related to the candy size). The electro-mechanical actuator can be a crankshaft one, a solenoid, a linear motor, and goes on.
You can use a vibrator attached to the cup if the candy tends to get stuck.

There are two good search terms that come to mind.  The first one is a "candy machine mechansim", or "dispenser mechanism" (e.g. http://www.woodworkingformeremortals.com/2012/10/make-candy-dispenser.html).  There are several models of off-the-shelf pet food dispensers and cereal dispensers that use this method.

The second term would be a screw conveyor (a.k.a. "auger dispenser"/"food auger"/"grain auger"), which describes a more continuous-flow version of what you are describing.

This type of dispenser controls the volume that is delivered by rotating the auger by a fixed amount, not by dumping a fixed-size container.
Beyond those, there are some homemade concepts that use some variation on the idea, like this one:
