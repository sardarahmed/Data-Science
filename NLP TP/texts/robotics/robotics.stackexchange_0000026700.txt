Q:

Cannot connect Internet if I run gzserver?

If I run gzserver, Internet doesn't work. And then, I use "sudo /etc/init.d/network-manager restart" to reconfigure the network setting, Internet is work. But once I run gzserver, it doesn't work again. (My OS is ubuntu 12.10.)
How to solve this problem(the gazebo and Internet are available together)?thanks a lot!
