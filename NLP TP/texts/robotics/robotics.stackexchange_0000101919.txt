Q:

Theora_image_transport Packet not paired through ROS1_Bridge

Hello,
Laptop on Ubuntu 20.4
Noetic and Foxy installed.
I'm running a usb_cam node on my laptop on Noetic.
When I run ROS1_bridge, the image_raw and image_raw/compressed are forwarded to ROS2 but not the image_raw_theora topic.
I checked if the pair was available with ROS1_bridge and it's not the case.
As far as I understood, when compiling ros1_bridge is looking for every *_msgs package. The issue here is that theora_image_transport is not finishing by msgs
I tried to compile on my own the package image transport but It didn't changed anything.
Do you have any clues on the issue ?

A:

I solved the issue by forking the ros1_bridge.
The issue was that ros1_bridge only forward messages that are from a package finishing by "_msgs"
If needed here is my fork, you can also easily implement any package not finishing by _msgs just by modifying the lines 481 and 482 of __init.py
