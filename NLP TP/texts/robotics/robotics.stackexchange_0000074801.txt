Q:

Is there a tool to pause/resume/seek MoveIt trajectories?

I am planning robot trajectories using MoveIt, sometimes the path is very long and I want to see only a specific part of the trajectory.
Is there a tool in ROS that provides a seek bar and allows me to pause/resume trajectories?

Good question. I haven't seen something like that. It would be quite involved though: caching trajectories, sitting between MoveIt and whatever controller you have configured, recalculating time_from_start and velocity/accel profiles, etc.

@gvdhoorn should I open an issue on MoveIt issue tracker? This probably requires work in more packages than just MoveIt.

I would suggest opening one on the MoveIt tracker. At the very least we can discuss there where this sort of functionality could/should live.
Although I expect the consensus will be: if there is no (re)planning involved, implement an action server that supports what you want and use that.

O wait. I missed this part:

sometimes the path is very long and I want to see only a specific part

If it's really just about visualisation -- instead of execution, as I initially understood your question: that has actually recently been added. See ros-planning/moveit#491.
The updated MoveIt! RViz Plugin Tutorial tutorial shows what this looks like now (in Introspecting trajectory waypoints):

My goal is to be able to pause/resume/seek the simulation. I'll take a look at this and try it!

Afaik this is really just for visualisation.
For execution I don't think there is something.

I have tried it and it looks surprisingly easy at first sight. I won't select your answer as correct right now as I'm not sure yet how I can use it but it is certainly very useful. I will comment again when I understand more about how it works!
