A:

According to the roslaunch doc it shouldn't work: "The  tag can either reference a YAML file or contain raw YAML text."
You could try writing a small node that takes a path and uses rosparam.load_file()

Yes I thought about that too, but I thought there might be an easier solution.
But if I write a node, how can I guarantee that all parameters are loaded before my launch file startes the next node that is depending on them?

One solution would be to offer a service once all parameters are set and to make the other nodes wait for that service to become available before doing anything.

Mh, that would work, but needs more codeing than adding a line for each yaml file in the launch file :(
There might be an different way? Would be a cool feature for rosparam

We are actually following a database approach to that. In my project we are using mongodb and have a tool that reads yaml files, saves the found parameters in the datacentre and also sets them on the parameter server. You can have a look at this
