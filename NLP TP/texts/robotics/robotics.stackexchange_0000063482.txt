Q:

Warning "Map update loop missed its desired rate" keeps on comming

hello, i am setting up Navigation stack as explained in the Navigation Stack Setup Tutorial, My my configuration files are as follows:-

6. move_base.launch
<launch>

  <!-- Run the map server -->
  <node name="map_server" pkg="map_server" type="map_server" args="$(find my_robot_name_2dnav)/map/map.pgm 0.05"/>

  <!--- You can see original move_base.launch -->
  <!--- Run AMCL -->
  <include file="$(find usarsim_inf)/launch/usarsim.launch"/>
  <include file="$(find amcl)/examples/amcl_omni.launch" />

  <node pkg="move_base" type="move_base" respawn="false" name="move_base" output="screen">

    <rosparam file="$(find my_robot_name_2dnav)/launch/local_costmap_params.yaml" command="load" />

  </node>

  </node>

  <node pkg="rviz" type="rviz" respawn="false" name="rviz">
  </node>
</launch>

now where i launch the move_base.launch file everything goes fine but i am getting a warning as:-
  [ WARN] [1413922749.722348193]: Map update loop missed its desired rate of 2.0000Hz... the loop actually took 2.9248 seconds

in my previous question i asked about the reason of this warning but still i am confused and could not remove this warning, please help me out so that i can solve it.

I have met the same problem,the warning always occured when i tried to change the value of controller_frequency in both larger and smaller conditions. But it seems only a little harm in  the running process.I also expect someone who can point out the real problem it is ,with much appreciation.
Comment by dornhege on 2014-10-22:
What system are you running on and what sensors and global map size do you get? 3 seconds for an update seems really slow. Does this happen only once?
Comment by Aarif on 2014-10-22:
@dornhege i am using ros-fuerte on ubuntu machine.
& a p3at in USARSim (on windows machine).
MAP SIZE: 4000, 4000
Subscribed to Topics: laser_scan_sensor

@dornhege Thanks for you reply.
i have change update frequency from 2.0 to 0.25, now no such kind of warning appears.
but getting a new warning
 Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors

You just changed the parameters to suppress the warning without solving that it is slow. The other warning could be due to the robot/navigation setup now or still caused by the same problem.

A:

This means that your map cannot be updated as fast as you've parameterized it. You can choose to use a smaller or lower resolution map or provide more computational power.

There's a tuning guide
