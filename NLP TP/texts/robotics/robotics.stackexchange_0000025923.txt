Q:

Are there any default model topics?

I made a model for a Pioneer 3AT Mobile robot and looked at the output from 'gztopic list' but I only found one related topic:

/gazebo/default/Pioneer3AT/joint_cmd

Is there an example of how to publish to the /joint_cmd topic?

Are there any other default topics available such as a /joint_state or /pose available?

Do I need to write a model plugin to implement those functions?

A:

Here is an example of a Gazebo plugin for controlling a vehicle with joints.
To publish to Gazebo topics, you can make use of gazebo transport. See this example on how to write a program that publishes to gazebo topics (the example uses custom msgs which should not be needed in your case). Supported msg descriptions can be found here

Also, the joint_cmd topics are used by the Joint Control widget on the right hand side of the gazebo window.
