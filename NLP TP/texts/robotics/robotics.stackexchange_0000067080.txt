Q:

Launching gazebo server

BH
I'm trying to launch a gazebo server with the help of gzserver but I get this error:
Error [RTShaderSystem.cc:409] Unable to find shader lib. Shader generating will fail.Error [Server.cc:285] Could not open file[worlds/empty.world]
When I go to the directory where empty.world xml file is placed I see it exists.
This is its content:

model://sun
model://ground_plane
<max_step_size>0.01</max_step_size><real_time_factor>1</real_time_factor><real_time_update_rate>100</real_time_update_rate>0 0 -9.8
Does someone have a clue what is wrong?

A:

I encountered 'Error [Server.cc:285] Could not open file' when I tried launching gazebo with roslaunch gazebo_ros. I specified world_name:=<worldname.world> (from within the directory where the .world was located). When I added the full path to the file, the error went away.
