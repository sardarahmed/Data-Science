Q:

Dynamic models of parallel robots in the form of multi-mass systems with stiffness coefficients

I want to develop a dynamic model of a parallel robot for control tasks. It is known that equations of motion based on Lagrange equations can be transformed into a state space and use such a model. 

I was wondering if it is possible to somehow include the stiffness matrix of the manipulator in this model and get a model like the one shown in the second figure.

A:

The equations of motion is simply 
$$
\begin{align}
J_m \ddot{\theta}_1 + K_{md}(\theta_1-\theta_2) &= \tau_e \tag{1} \\
J_d \ddot{\theta}_2 + K_{md}(\theta_2-\theta_1) &= \tau_L + \tau_s \tag{2}
\end{align}
$$
Rewriting (1)&(2), we get 
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
J_m & 0 \\ 0 & J_d
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\ddot{\theta}_1 \\ \ddot{\theta}_2
\end{bmatrix}
+
\begin{bmatrix}
K_{md} & -K_{md} \\ -K_{md} & K_{md}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\theta_1 \\ \theta_2
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\tau_e \\ \tau_L + \tau_s
\end{bmatrix}
$$
