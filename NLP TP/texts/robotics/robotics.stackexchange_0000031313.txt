Q:

Smach without ROS

I am doing some tests with smach and I didn't want to pull in ROS yet. In the wiki it says that smach is ROS independent. However, in util.py there is a "#import roslib; roslib.load_manifest('smach')" that doesn't make it so. I commented it out, but I am not sure if everything will work fine.
Is loading the manifest necessary to run smach? Can it be really ROS-independent?

A:

The Smach package can be used independent of ROS. I believe the import of roslib in the util.py is actually an oversight, and it should be removed. I fixed this in the default branch of the executive_smach stack, and am running our entire regression test set to verify that nothing relies on the import.  I filed this ticket to track the problem.
