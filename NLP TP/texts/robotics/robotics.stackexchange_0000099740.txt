Q:

CFG_EXTRAS equivalent for ros2/colcon

We have a ROS1 CMakeLists.txt that contains:
catkin_package(
  INCLUDE_DIRS include/
  CATKIN_DEPENDS roscpp
  CFG_EXTRAS Findthis_package.cmake)

For colcon on Foxy, how do we specify loading in an extra .cmake file?

A:

I did a little more searching, and in colcon the keyword is CONFIG_EXTRAS and is used in ament_package(), as documented here.
So, my solution is to use this instead:
ament_package(
  CONFIG_EXTRAS cmake/Findthis_package.cmake)

Note that the full relative path is needed, whereas catkin_package() assumed the cmake directory.
