Q:

Which robot can or should I get to run ROS?

I've heard a lot of good things about ROS and I want to try running it.
PR2 is a little too expensive to me though. Is there anything more afordable to give ROS a try?
What is the best use of my money?

A:

Note that if you want to try running ROS you don't really need robot hardware. The cheapest option costs no money at all - It's running a robot in simulation. There are quite a few robot models available for doing that. I can recommend the 'erratic_robot' stack, which provides a differential driven robot that you can use to drive around in gazebo simulation.
It of course always depends on your focus, but for playing around, understanding basic concepts of navigation, the coordinate frame conventions etc. this is a very good option.
