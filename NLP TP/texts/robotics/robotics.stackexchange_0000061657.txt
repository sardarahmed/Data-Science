Q:

Costmap orientation

Hi,
I know that when using a static map in the navigation stack, the costmap origin will be overwritten by the static map. How ever changed the orientation of the static map's origin but it doesn't seem to affect the costmap's origin and I can't find a parameter to set the origin manually.
Any tip would be helpfull.
Thanks.

A:

As far as I remember the orientation is ignored in the current code, so you might have to resort to manually rotating the gridmap in an image editor.
