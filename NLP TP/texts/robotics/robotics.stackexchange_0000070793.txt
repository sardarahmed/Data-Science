Q:

How to disable "Policy CMP0045 is not set" warnings?

I only create catkin package without edit anything.
When I catkin_make , it shows a lots of warnings.
It makes me very hard to see the other error or warnings.

Which version of cmake are you using? Which OS, which version? Which version of ROS? etc
Comment by sam on 2015-12-09:
I remember I install cmake 3.0 due to caffe CNN lib. I use ubuntu 12.04 64 bits. I use Hydro.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2015-12-09:
As most of ROS' CMakeLists.txt are written against CMake 2.8.x, I can imagine that there will be some issues when using them with newer versions of CMake. I'm not sure what the most efficient way would be to work around this I'm afraid.

A:

Hi!
To solve this, I use the following in the header of the CMakeLists.txt of the package ..
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8)
project(Name)
cmake_policy(SET CMP0054 OLD)
cmake_policy(SET CMP0045  OLD)
