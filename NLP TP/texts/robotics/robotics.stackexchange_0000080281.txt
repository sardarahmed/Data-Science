Q:

What's the meaning of “There can be no more than one package in each folder”？

According to this tutorial,it says:"There can be no more than one package in each folder.
This means no nested packages nor multiple packages sharing the same directory."But next to this, a catkin-work space can have many packages,how can it be explained?

A:

According to the official doc: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage
you can have in your workspace several packages(package means here a ROS project with one or more executable applications)
what you are not allowed to do is: putting package1 and  package2 in the same folder

see the image and realize that packages inside workspace_folder/src/ are ok ALWAYS, but you CAN NOT put inside package_1 another 2 packages.....
