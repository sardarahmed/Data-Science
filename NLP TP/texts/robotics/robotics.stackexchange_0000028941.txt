Q:

ROS2 Ignition Gazebo in VM with ogre1

Hi, I try to test gazebo ignition through a Ubuntu 18.04 VM with OpenGL capabilities and I obtain this error when I launch :

ign gazebo lights.sdf -v 4

and it's all blurry and the interface is unworkable at all.
Is there some limitations using ogre1 in Gazebo for now ?

A:

I've been using Ignition with Ogre 1 and 2 without any issues both on Ubuntu and inside Docker containers. So I guess the problem is coming from the VM. Does Gazebo-classic work for you?

Yes it works, I succeed with docker and rocker but in my VM it was a very strange behavior, maybe it comes from the OpenGL version inside it (2.0)
