Q:

need help with creating my first gazebo plugin

Hello.
my intention is to control and move a simple robot within the gazebo simulation. i already created the robot model with a urdf file and now i want to move it around.
as i understand, the best way to do that, is to create a plugin.
i tried to follow step by step the instructions on :
http://ros.org/wiki/simulator_gazebo/Tutorials/GazeboPluginIntro
but when i type "rosmake" I get an error :
/home/daniel/ros_workspace/gazebo_tutorials/src/simple_world_plugin.cpp:1:20: fatal error: gazebo.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.
I tried to update ROS by typing  "sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-desktop-full"   but still, the problem remains.
I am using ROS Fuerte with Ubuntu 12.04.
Is anyone can suggest a better tutorial, or a way to overcome this problem?
Thanks.

have you set your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH correctly ?
if not try rospack profile then export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, that should work

A:

I had the same problem and found that if you include "common/Plugin.hh" instead of "gazebo.h" it will work. My only explanation for why is that the tutorial is a "work in progress."
