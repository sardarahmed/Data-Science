Q:

dwb_local_planner

I am trying to implement the robot_navigation package into my robot. I clone the the entire robot_navigation folder into my catkin workspace and use catkin isolated make because when doing the regular catkin build it gives me a CMake Error "This workspace contains non-catkin packages in it, and catkin cannot build a non-homogeneous workspace without isolation....". The isolated build works, but when trying to run plan_node.launch in the dwb_local_planner/launch folder using roslaunch results in the error "ERROR: cannot launch node of type [dwb_local_planner/planner_node]: can't locate node [planner_node] in package [dwb_local_planner]. I have researched and everything I could find saying it wasn't sourced, but to my knowledge I did source it correctly. When running my other launch files in a separate folder it works correctly, but the terminal outputs the following:
[FATAL] [1517335343.278669007, 0.826000000]: Failed to create the dwb_local_planner/DWAPlannerROS planner, are you sure it is properly registered and that the containing library is built? Exception: According to the loaded plugin descriptions the class dwb_local_planner/DWAPlannerROS with base class type nav_core::BaseLocalPlanner does not exist. Declared types are  base_local_planner/TrajectoryPlannerROS dwa_local_planner/DWAPlannerROS nav_core_adapter::LocalPlannerAdapter

log file: /home/USR/.ros/log/b1f50d24-05e7-11e8-a9e0-6c0b84aabb26/move_base-11*.log

My question is if anyone knows why it isn't launching correctly?

By robot_navigation, are you referring to the navigation meta-package?
If so, why are you cloning the robot_navigation package directly into your workspace instead of installing it via $ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-navigation?

There is no link, but I think the OP is referring to https://github.com/locusrobotics/robot_navigation (which contains a dwb_local_planner package)
