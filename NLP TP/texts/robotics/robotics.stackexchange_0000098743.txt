Q:

Why ROS Noetic has its own pybind11, while it's on Ubuntu 20.04 already

Just a curiosity!
On Ubuntu 20.04, there is a package called pybind11-dev, but also, a ROS version, called ros-noetic-pybind11-catkin, I would rather use the one from Ubuntu but, am I going to miss something from the ROS version? Or not?

A:

As you can infer from the name, pybin11_catkin is a:

Catkin wrapper for pybind11

which basically means:

This repository wraps the recent releases of pybind11 for use in catkin-based projects.

Among other things, this makes it easy/ier to build / use pybind11 in Catkin (and Colcon) workspaces, and consequently, ROS packages.
Other advantages would be the use of this package across different OS (which may not have pybind11, but do support Catkin workspaces/ROS) and a more homogeneous development environment (pybind11 available at the same version everywhere).
See ipab-slmc/pybind11_catkin#3 for what appears to be a discussion around utility of the package. This links to arturmiller/pybind11_examples for some examples.

I would rather use the one from Ubuntu

By all means do.
If you are on an OS which packages pybind11 at a suitable version and you don't need/want to depend on the Catkin wrapped version, then don't use it.

Got it, thank you!
I also thought that, because ROS doesn't recommend mixing Debian packages from both the community repository, and from upstream distribution, that this could be a problem but, things are a bit different with pybind11...
Cool!

Are you referring to wiki/UpstreamPackages?
That's specifically about upstream versions of (the core) ROS packages. Not system dependencies.

Yes, I was talking about the wiki/UpstreamPackages, thank you for your clarication!
