Q:

how to use python3.8 with ROS Kinetic in a node (import rospy)?

Hey,
I am using ROS kinetic which supports python2.7.
I want to run a node with python3.8 using rosrun.
when I used a shebang to test the script without any "import rospy" it worked.
but when I include "import rospy" to turn the script into a node and be able to send values, it gives me the following error:
in 
import yaml
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'yaml'
I would greatly appreciate any idea to make ROS kinetic itself use python3.8 instead of python2.7 and fix this issue.
Thanks in advance

Can you update your system to a later version of ROS that uses Python 3.8? Noetic should do it.
