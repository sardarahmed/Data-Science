Q:

How to make my robot move parallel to edge of the table?

I have an autonomous differential drive robot that moves on the floor and its purpose is to always move parallel to the longer edge of the table (just assume that the table never ends). It looks something like :

Now, the robot will be using this same method to align itself to the table edge for the first time. Also, when it travels forward (along the edge), it is prone to deviate from its path due to various reasons. Again, this method will guide it to stay on the right track.

I can't use any line-following method.

Actually, you are quite wrong, the way I understand the problem. It is a line-following. It is just that the line is not painted (like on the road). The line is the edge of the table.
The way I see it, your robot needs to look up, and detect the line "painted" by the edge of the table on the ceiling. Once the line is detected, just follow it.

I have in mind 2 ways to detect the edge of the table.

Contrast based: using an imaging sensor (e.g., camera), detect the edge of the table by detecting the contrast / color change. Based on this, adjust the trajectory.

Distance measurement: an IR sensor (practically, more) can be used to measure the distance to the first obstacle (table or ceiling), vertically. It should be easy to do, considering that the ceiling is significantly higher than the table.
