Q:

Backwards movement in Autoware 1.13

I am using Autoware 1.13 in ROS Melodic. I am using Gazebo for my car simulation and until now I have successfully managed to follow waypoints in a map using MPC and astar.
Specifically, I load the PCD map and the vehicle model in Autoware and then I enable the following modules from Computing tab:
  - ndt_matching
  - vel_pose_connect
  - lidar_euclidean_cluster_detect
  - costmap_generator
  - lane_rule
  - lane_stop
  - lane_select
  - waypoint_loader
  - astar_avoid 
  - velocity_set
  - mpc_follower
  - twist_filter

It works really well for waypoints that are in front of the car and can successfully follow them.
But, in some cases a maneuver may be needed and the car should go backwards for a while and then move forward again.
Does Autoware 1.13 give this option?
If yes, how is this achieved? Is there a special configuration needed for MPC to allow this movement?

https://github.com/Autoware-AI/core_planning/blob/6f74dfc7b2dfd1a20713ce24eb352debb981c833/freespace_planner/README.md might give a hint

The planner is providing me with waypoints that are backward movements. But the issue is that the car is not moving at all, the velocity commands sent to the topic remain 0

does pure_persuit node do backwards driving maybe? https://github.com/Autoware-AI/core_planning/tree/6f74dfc7b2dfd1a20713ce24eb352debb981c833/pure_pursuit/src
Comment by kosmastsk on 2020-07-17:
I checked using Pure Pursuit as well, but the result is the same. Actually, as far as I understood from the code, pure pursuit finds that can_get_curvature is 0 in these kind of paths and as a result the twist command sent is 0.

Unfortunately, this feature was started as part of 1.13.0 but was never competed. See https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.ai/core_planning/-/issues/8 (archived) for more details about what was competed and what still needs work. We are happy to accept merge requests to compete this feature but I do not believe it is being actively worked on at this time.
