Q:

Homebrew failed "Failed to download resource "sdformat""

Hello. I am using mac os x 10.9.4. I was using gazebo 2.2 with ogre1.7.4
Today I updated ogre to 1.9 therefore I re-install gazebo from homebrew. I did brew update but this error happened:
curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 404 Not Found
Error: Failed to download resource "sdformat"
Download failed: http://gazebosim.org/assets/distributions/sdformat-2.0.1.tar.bz2

As the homepage of gazebo was totally reformed, is there any patch to formula to fix this error?
Thank you.

I believe the old links are working again. Sorry for the disruption. Also, feel free to post on the issue tracker for the homebrew tap:
