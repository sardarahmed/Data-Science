Q:

hydro Gazebo on a Jenkins -> FAILURE: Test Fixture Nodes [...] failed to spawn

I am running a gazebo simulation on a jenkins server under hydro. I have an issue there. 
I do not have this problem when I am either:

running the simulation locally
using groovy (on the server, too)

This is the relevant output:
spawn_model script started

  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/unittest/case.py", line 420, in assertTrue
    raise self.failureException(msg)

I think this problem depends on the /gazebo/spawn_urdf_model service.
Any Ideas, how to fix this?
Thanks for your help!
Update:
I now looked deeper into the problem: I reinstalled all dependencies from apt packages using ros-hydro-desktop-full
I found an error in the logfile of world_state_publisher:
/opt/ros/hydro/lib/robot_state_publisher/state_publisher
[33m[ WARN] [1406034138.074698487]: The 'state_publisher' executable is deprecated. Please use 'robot_state_publisher' instead[0m
[33m[ WARN] [1406034138.106214435]: The root link dummy_link has an inertia specified in the URDF, but KDL does not support a root link with an inertia.  As a workaround, you can add an extra dummy link to your URDF.[0m

It turns out that this link is actually missing in the simulated robot model. 
Can anybody help me on that?

Has no one an idea? Can you maybe give me an idea what I should check? What can be different between the case of launching it locally and on a jenkins server?

A:

FYI: This was basically a big dependency problem. It was solved here: http://answers.ros.org/question/187417/problem-running-gazebo-failed-to-load-plugin-libgazebo_ros_controlso/?answer=187418#post-id-187418 (Plus by adding several more missing dependencies)
