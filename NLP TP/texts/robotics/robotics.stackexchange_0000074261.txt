Q:

Moveit on Ubuntu 16.04

Hello,
we would like to use Moveit on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. The only officially supported ROS version for this release is Kinetic Kame, but Moveit is only really available for Indigo.
Will there be any kinetic-moveit packages soon? If not, what would be the best way to get Moveit running on 16.04?
Best Regards!

A:

Hi Nicolas, you can check the status of packages here kineticPlanningMaintenance. You could also create an issue on their github issues page (I don't know if that is the right approach). It also looks like they have a kinetic-devel for their moveit_core branch, you could try to  check that out as well.

This is all right approach; so far there's no option to use MoveIt! on Kinetic other than building from source. MoveIt! maintenance team is under restructuring and I assume it may take awhile before it'll be released.

That's good to know! I found their blog but the last update is from 2015. Do they update somewhere else?

Not that I know of other than the blog you mentioned and the email forum.
