I don't see any error messages in the output. Can you explain what you expect it to be doing, and how it isn't working?
Comment by saikishor on 2017-03-10:
Yes I also don't see any error, but I want to compile a package with catkin_make The result is nothing, it is not able to create the new nodes!!!!
Comment by ahendrix on 2017-03-10:
It looks like it built a node called ros_project. You may want to check that there's a package.xml in each package, and it would help if you post your CMakeLists.txt
Comment by saikishor on 2017-03-11:
Actually, I have created a new package called package_pub_sub, but there is no info about that package and the nodes are not created for that package....
Please find the CMakeLists and Package.xml here:

Package.xml : http://pastebin.com/QHUTAm9G

It looks like your package.xml may not be named properly; it should be all lowercase: package.xml (if catkin_make can't detect your package.xml, it won't build your package)
Comment by saikishor on 2017-03-11:
Yes sir, it was all in lowercase "package.xml", but still this happens. I don't know the reason

A:

Try to change your package name: soar-to-ros_interface to soar_to_ros_interface, remove hyphens and see what happens. This is the only warning given out during compilation.
