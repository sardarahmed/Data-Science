Q:

Visualizing kinect data on rviz

I am a beginner of ROS, Kinect and Ubuntu. What I want is to visualize Kinect's data on rviz environment then run object recognition on it.
I've tried a few tutorials but had no luck. All I got was an empty rviz world.
Since I am a beginner I would appreciate any step-by-step instructions (preferably for hydro or groovy).
I would also like to note that I've managed to get visual from Kinect so the device is working fine.

A:

You can  install the a package for kinect:
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-openni-launch

Then to make the package publish kinect's topics:
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch  

To visualize the depth image run:
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/depth/image

To visualize for example the Point Cloud in rviz you can add a PointCloud2 Display ad choose the appropriate topic.
