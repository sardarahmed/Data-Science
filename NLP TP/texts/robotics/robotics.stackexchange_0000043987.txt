Q:

sound_play playWave() is not playing sound

I followed the directions I received in:
http://answers.ros.org/question/41385/play-a-sound-file-in-a-python-node/
I had the sound_play's soundClient functionality working for some time.
However it has inexplicably stopped working and I'm unsure as to why.
I'm starting the sound_playnode.py and running the following in another node.
The relevant lines from my node (and launch file) are:
<param name = "my_file" value = "file://$(find my_audio)/a_sound.wav" />

from sound_play.libsoundplay import SoundClient

soundhandle = SoundClient()
my_sound = rospy.get_param('my_file')
soundhandle.playWave(my_sound)

With numerous print statements I can tell that the soundhandle.playWave(my_sound) is being called and does not appear to generate an error, but no sound is played. I have tried the second method as well, but with the same results.
I can run
$rosrun sound_play play.py "/absolute/path/to/my_file.wav"

and get the sound to play every time.
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks

A:

What about calling soundhandle.playWave('/absolute/path/to/my_file.wav'), does it work?
