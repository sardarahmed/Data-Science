Q:

[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named the listener (C++ program)

I am basically trying to run a listener that listens to the video feed of an AR.Drone through the topics being published by the ardrone_autonomy node on a ROS Kinetic running on a Ubuntu MATE 16.04 LTS on a Raspberry Pi 3. Now I have gone through this guide here, and tried to execute the command:
rosrun zlab_drone videoFeed_listener

But I get the error:
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named videoFeed_Listener below /home/sharand/catkin_ws/src/zlab_drone

Here's my CMakeLists.txt:
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)
project(zlab_drone)

find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
  cv_bridge
  ardrone_autonomy
  image_transport
  sensor_msgs
  roscpp
  rospy
  std_msgs
)

catkin_package(

)

include_directories(
  ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS}
)

include_directories(include ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS})

add_executable(listener src/videoFeed_Listener.cpp)
target_link_libraries(listener ${catkin_LIBRARIES})

What exactly am I doing wrong?

A:

The problem here is that I name the executable listener and try to call on videoFeed_Listener. The wiki should be a bit more clear about the addexecutable() and target_link_libraries() functions. The right call would be:
rosrun zlab_drone listener
