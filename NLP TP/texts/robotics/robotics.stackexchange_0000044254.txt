Q:

Error when trying to start rxconsole

Hi,
I'm new to ROS and can't figure out why I can't start rxconsole. I'm simply going through the tutorials and everything went fine until now. When I type rxconsole I get the following error:
(rxconsole:4996): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: "pixmap",

(rxconsole:4996): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: "pixmap",

(rxconsole:4996): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: "pixmap",

(rxconsole:4996): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: "pixmap",
[ERROR] [1348039963.832866342]: [registerPublisher] Failed to contact master at [localhost:11311].  Retrying...

And then it's just stuck there. Does anyone know what the problem might be?
I'm using Ubuntu 11.10 in a virtual machine.

Is roscore running? Try executing the following in a separate terminal:
