Q:

TI ARM with stacked RAM

Do any of the TI ARM SOCs, e.g. OMAP or Da Vinci, have a version with stacked RAM? (e.g. DDR2 or mDDR) For miniature robots like micro drones, it would be really nice to not need to spend board area on an external RAM chip. Thanks!

A:

According to TI's website, some of the OMAP processors (specifically the OMAP-DM5x range) have stacked RAM.
