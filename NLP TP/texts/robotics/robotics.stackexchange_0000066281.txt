Q:

catkin rosserial_arduino not generating custom package messages

I've made good progress with building my Arduino projects with CMake, but have hit a snag. My project uses custom messages in a separate package, and using make_libraries.py separately, everything works as expected. Cleaning the workspace and running catkin_make verbose=1 robot_arduino_firmware_sensors where robot_arduino is my arduino package and firmware_sensors is my c++ path (firmware/sensors.cpp). I can see the make_libraries script running, with the Arduino messages generated, except at the bottom is failed to generate libraries for the following packages: robot_msgs. That of course means that compiling my Arduino firmware fails.
Most information seems to say I should source indigo's setup.bash, which works when using make_libraries.py separately but I can't seem to include that in the catkin script. Seeing as it works correctly when separate, I suspect that may be the only issue. Anyone have a suggestion?

A:

Answers and comments here pointed me in the correct direction, which turned out to be sourcing my workspace correctly. I cleared the /devel and /build folders, then ran source <ws>/install/setup.bash and catkin_make. No custom message errors were reported. I updated my firmware code, compiled and uploaded and now I'm in business.
