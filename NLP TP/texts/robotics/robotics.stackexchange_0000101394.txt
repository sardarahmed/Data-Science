Q:

ROS detection Arduino

Is it possible to get an Arduino to do its tasks until ROS is connected? Once ROS is connected change its tasks. I am unable to find any way to detect ROS connection. I have seen similar questions where people are trying to figure out if ROS is connected. The common method seems to be using "ros/master" and "rosgraph", neither are usable in Arduino.
Is there a way to get Arduino to detect ROS without the above-mentioned methods?
Thanks

A:

Can I connect an Arudino to a laptop and run it?
( I have ROS running on my laptop. )
In that case, we believe that the rosserial package can be used to achieve this.
After starting ROS, it sends a topic to Arudino indicating that it has connected to Arudino; Arudino subscribes to the topic and switches the flag in the callback.
If you switch tasks according to that flag, haven't you done what you wanted to do?
