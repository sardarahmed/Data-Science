Q:

Error building workspace of MoveIt 2 (Humble)

Hi everyone,
I've been trying to build the workspace of MoveIt 2 with ROS 2 Humble. Following the tutorial, every time when I run colcon build --mixin release in the terminal, 2 packages always return the same error output, here is what I read in the shell:

Summary: 55 packages finished [3.46s]

Dose anyone know how to fix this?
Thanks a lot.

A:

Hi there,
stderr is a common output in ROS2 when building. usually, it doesn't mean it hasn't built properly and is often related to displaying certain warnings and messages.
So, in most cases - you should be able to use whatever you built without any issues.
