Q:

RViz notification on "params modified"

Hello all,
I want to create a panel in RViz (part of a plugin) and this panel would contain widgets allowing me to create/modify ROS parameters.
Now, as is, my RViz panel will not be updated if the parameter gets modified outside of RViz - the parameter value displayed by RViz will be wrong. Hence my question: is there a ROS mechanism allowing to get notified on parameters value change? ...or another mechanism allowing to sync my panel?
Should I simply setup a 5Hz timer to update my panel? Or is there a better approach?
Thanks,
Antoine.

A:

For parameters that are expected to change, dynamic_reconfigure is generally a better solution. If that isn't an option, I believe you will have to poll for changes (like with a timer as you mentioned).

Dan's answer is good, but if you must use params, note that if you are using C++ you can reduce the overhead associated with constantly polling the parameter server by using ros::NodeHandle::getParamCached()
