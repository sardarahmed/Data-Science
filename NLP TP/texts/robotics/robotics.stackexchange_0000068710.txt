Q:

What does the "depth" mean on earth?

I am really confused about the meaning of "depth" which is acquired by a RGB-D camera.
I think there are two meanings,
1: The distance from a point in the 3-D world to the infrared camera center.
2: The Z value of the 3-D world point in the camera frame.
Which is right?
If the second meaning is right, the depth values of all the points in a wall which is parallel with the RGB-D camera should be equal, but the fact is not like that. However, many 3-D vision books indicate the second meaning is right. I am really confused. Who can help me?

The data being provided should have a frame_id defined which will tell you which coordinate frame the data is referenced against.
