Q:

How to test whether stereo cameras is synchronization?

I made a stereo camera consist of two digital cameras. I want to test whether the left and the right images is synchronization. Are there some tools or nodes which have this function? (PS:I can get the timestemp of the images)

A:

One simple method is recording some image messages using rosbag and viewing them with rxbag. The rxbag GUI will let you zoom in on the message timestamps, making it easy to see how close they are for the two cameras.
