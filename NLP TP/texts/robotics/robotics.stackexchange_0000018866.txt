Q:

Task oriented robot language?

So, what I understood by the term "Task Planning" is, "to implement a task to be done by a robot by mimicking a real-world scenario".
This article is also using the term "Task" but it is saying something different.

... To enable user-friendly operation of the system operation, particularly in the phase of preparing new tasks, the original Multi-arm Robot Control (MRC) system has been developed. It incorporates a task-oriented robot language and graphical user interface ... 

So, is this article talking about the same thing or different?
I am confused. Coz, their description is unclear.
Are they creating a new programming language and embedding it into the robot, or are they planning a task using an "off-the-shelf" programming language?

A:

In contrast to motion planning, task planning operates on a symbolic higher level. Often, it's connected to natural language descriptions like “open door” and “stand-up”. This makes it a natural choice for a domain specific language. The words in the new language are equal to the actions a robot can execute.
The alternative would be, to realize the tasks in a normal programming language like C++. But then, the actions are also equal to high-level words which are defined in a class. In both cases the idea is to build on top of the low level primitives an elaborated natural language layer which makes it easier to author longer robotics action sequences. A single task command is equal to many low level actions of the robot.
If the tasks are embedded in a simulation the resulting symbolic task simulator is called qualitative physics engine. The model accepts instructions in natural language and predicts the outcome of the action.
