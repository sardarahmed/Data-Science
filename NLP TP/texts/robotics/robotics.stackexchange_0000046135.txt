Q:

what does a topic get when 2 nodes publish to it?

If 2 nodes are publishing to the topic l_leg_uhz_position_controller/command what would the joint do? try doing both?

A:

In general, messages from multiple publishers get interleaved, with no reasonable way to predict the order in which they will be received. In some cases that can be quite useful, for example when aggregating rosout or diagnostic messages.
As @Ben_S said, the semantics of mixing controller messages depend entirely on that controller's implementation. Most likely it will get confused.
