Q:

Sick and ROS slam

Hello everyone,
I'm working with a p3dx using Aria and ROS. I did a teleop package and then I used the sonar device to avoid obstacles.
Finally I added a sick laser. With the data obtained with this laser I have to draw a map. Does any ROS package do that? Maybe openCV?
Thank you beforehand

A:

You can use the GMapping package to create a 2D gridmap using your SICK:

Thanks a lot. I get the buffer reading with an Aria callback (readingCB). So I guess I have to create ros callback and publish this buffer to gmapping node.
The readings are ArPoseWithTime.
Thank you

One more remark: GMapping uses the Laserscan message and odometry information from TF. So make sure to not only publish your laser message, but also the TF-frames needed, i.e. one odometry-start-frame, a base_link frame and one for the position of your laserscanner.

I have a problem. I'm working with MoblieSim and I have tow nodes: teleop_node and movement_node. The first one is running in my laptop and the second one in the p3dx. I need the stage package in order to know the odometry. How can I know the odometry from mobilesim instead of Stage Robot Simulator?

Since I guess this relates to a different issue, I propose you open a new question for that. You will get answers faster and from more people then...
