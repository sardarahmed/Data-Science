Q:

Fail to import rospy

Hello Guys
I'm trying to implement a code to call ROS topics inside a Python code.
When i try to import rospy and roslib I have the message:
import roslib
ImportError: No module named roslib

my initial code is:
from collections import deque
import numpy as np
import argparse
import imutils
import cv2
import os # incluido para chamar comando do linux.
import time #incluido para utilizar o delay
import roslib
import rospy
from geometry_msgs.msg import Twist

This is not a solution, but: you don't need to import roslib any longer in a rospy script. Unless you're using some functionality from it of course.

A:

You need to have the ROS Environment sourced in the terminal where you run this.
Follow the tutorial about  Setting up a ROS Workspace.
Remember to call source <PATH_TO_YOUR_WORKSPACE>/devel/setup.bash in every new terminal you open.

Or even better, writte down the source <PATH_TO_YOUR_WORKSPACE>/devel/setup.bash into your .bashrc file, which will source the setup file automatically everytime you open a new terminal.

@kharkad you are correct.
Though once you start working with multiple workspaces this can lead to a lot of confusion. Thus, until you know what this is about, I personally think it helps people understand what is required and why if you have to do that manually...
