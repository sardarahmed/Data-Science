Q:

How to promote robot_state_publisher rate?

I want to use tf broadcaster to move arms in rviz, but the rate of robot_state_publisher is 10Hz, which cause lag in simulation. I want to know how to fix that.
I use rosrun tf view_frames to check the rate.

A:

I try to add <param name="rate" value="1000"/>  in my launch file and it seems better now.
The robot_state_publisher rate becomes nearly 50Hz.
