Q:

Topic for motor current

Hi everyone,
is there a standard topic to output currents used by a motor? I know i can give efforts of motors in the joint state message but i also would like to provide the raw current values of the measurement.
Do i just use a std_msgs topic like Float64 or is there something better?
And is there a naming convention for things like this? If so could someone point me to the REP?
Best Regards
Georg

A:

One example message type that exposes actuator currents (but also many, many other fields) is the pr2_mechanism_msgs::ActuatorStatistics.
std_msgs, as suggested in the original answer defines floats and float arrays, but does not contain message types with specific actuator current semantics.  If you don't find a suitable existing alternative, you can create a simple message that wraps a Float64[].

Thanks. I Went for the Foat64 Array. I am not entirely happy with it as you dont get a mapping of motor to the value but i wanted to keep the dependencies to non standard packages low. Also creating a new message just for such a "debug" topic seemed exessive.
