Q:

rosnode ping /node only once

I need to use 'rosnode ping /node' command inside my rosnode source file. Is it possible to ping a node only once? If I simply write "rosnode ping /node", it repeatedly pings the node for some duration. Any information or help regarding this would be much appreciated.
Thanks
PS: Is it possible to suppress the output on the console, like quite mode as opposed to verbose mode?

A:

From the rosnode ping --help output (also on the wiki page of rosnode (wiki/rosnode: ping)):

Usage: rosnode ping [options] <node>

Options:

  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -a, --all   ping all nodes
  -c COUNT    number of pings to send. Not available with --all

So this should do what you ask:
rosnode ping -c 1 <name of node>

Not that I know of.
PS: it's not a good idea to ask follow up questions in comments under questions with an already accepted answer.
Visibility is really low in that case.
It could be someone else knows, but they won't see your question, as the "rosnode ping only once" question already is answered, so they have no reason to look at it.
