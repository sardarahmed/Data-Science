Q:

mavros missing on kinetic?

Hello,
I was using mavros on Indigo and cannot manage to install again on kinetic.
The package does not show up in the list of ros-kinetic-* packages.
I additionally tried to install it manually, following the instructions on this page:
https://github.com/mavlink/mavros/blob/master/mavros/README.md#installation
However, when replacing my distro from jade to kinetic in the following command line:
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro jade -y

I get the following error: E: Unable to locate package ros-kinetic-control-toolbox
I could not find the package in the list of ros-kinetic-* packages and I made sure to update my system and upgrade it.
Has anyone managed to install mavros on kinetic?

A:

It seems at least the packages in this page are already build and their binaries are available already on Kinetic. Have you run apt-get update?
Also, Jade and Kinetic are not meant to work on the same Ubuntu distro. See REP-0003 for the supported hosts:

Jade
Kinetic

Thank you 130s for your answer.
I found my mistake. I tried to install two distros of ROS to access older packages but did not readjust my sources.list and keys. After setting these for kinetic, I was able to access the package without problem.
