Q:

rosrun controller_manager controller_manager list

I am attempting to spawn controllers but interactions with controller_manager seem to hang.

when I attempt to launch my controllers I see the following after a timeout:

[INFO] [WallTime: 1398097365.560001] Controller Spawner: Waiting for service controller_manager/load_controller
[WARN] [WallTime: 1398097395.567543] Controller Spawner couldn't find the expected controller_manager ROS interface.
[gripper/controller_spawner-1] process has finished cleanly
log file: /home/user/.ros/log/57c14baa-c96f-11e3-b22a-c81f6621927d/gripper-controller_spawner-1*.log

Subsequently, if I attempt to merely list controllers/types the call hangs until I kill the process:

rosrun controller_manager controller_manager list

Anyone have any tips on what I am doing wrong? I have confirmed that ros_control and ros_controllers are installed.
Thanks in advance.

Do you have a control process running? Can you see the controller_manager service with rosservice list ?

No, it does not appear in the list of services....

A:

I found my mistake. I had a type-o in my URDF. I was using an incorrect tag in the gazebo plugin namespace element. Namely, I had
<gazebo>
  <plugin name="gazebo_ros_control" filename="libgazebo_ros_control.so">
    <robot_namespace>/gripper</robot_namespace>
  </plugin>
</gazebo>

When I should have had
<gazebo>
  <plugin name="gazebo_ros_control" filename="libgazebo_ros_control.so">
    <robotNamespace>/gripper</robotNamespace>
  </plugin>
</gazebo>
