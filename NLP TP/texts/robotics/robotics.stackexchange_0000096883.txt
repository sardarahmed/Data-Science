Q:

Website for showing upstream dependencies for Noetic release?

Hello,
I know I saw it somewhere but I can't seem to find it now.  Where is the web tool that shows what the upstream dependencies are for a specific ros release.  I'm working on a Noetic release of several packages and I'm trying to figure out if all my upstream dependencies have been released and what versions they are.

Probably what you are thinking of: status_page/blocked_releases_noetic.html.
