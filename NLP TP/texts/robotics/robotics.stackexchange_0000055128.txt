Q:

How can I move my arm between two points using moveit commandator

Hi
I am created a moveit plugin for my 6DOF arm.And I am trying to move my arm through a line. And I have two end co-ordinates of a line say (x1,y1,z1) and (x2, y2, z2) .
I can able to move to a random pose using
from moveit_commander import MoveGroupCommander

#if name == '__main__':
group = MoveGroupCommander("arm")

# move to a random target
group.clear_pose_targets()
group.go()

But I am not found a function that helps me to plan between two points.
Thanks

A:

here is the code defining the MoveGroupCommander class

I'd recommend playing around with this (and any python code that you want to explore) in a REPL that has autocomplete (ipython is good). From there, you can see what functions exist for group by typing group.-[tab] , and what their arguments are by typing group.set_pose_target(-[tab].

To answer your direct question, this should work:
group.set_position_target([x, y, z])
group.go()
