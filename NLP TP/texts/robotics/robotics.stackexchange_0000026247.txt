Q:

Is there a way to directly control the acceleration of a link

Hi,
I want to simulate a point mass in Gazebo.
Is there a way to directly control its accelerations (along the x and y axies) ?
In other workds, can we apply forces on links ? or merely on joints ?
And thanks!

A:

Hi,
yes, you should be able to apply forces on links, here is the API. See which one suits you better, SetForce or AddForce.
A simple code example:
this->my_model->GetLink("link_name")->SetForce(math::Vector3(0, 0, 0));
this->my_model->GetLink("link_name")->AddForce(math::Vector3(0, 0, 0));

Cheers,
Andrei

Thanks!
Well, I want to control it using rospy. I imagine I will have to wirte a plugin using cpp right ? :s

most probably yes, there are good tutorials on gazebosim.org that can show you how to write them.
