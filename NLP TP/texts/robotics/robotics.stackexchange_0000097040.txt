Q:

Possible to have buildfarm status in PR on Github?

I have configured bloom to enable Pull Request testing on the buildfarm.
On the Github side, giving admin access to the whole org seems a bit too much, so I am using the alternative solution using webhook, as described here in the wiki.
On a PR, a build is triggered on the buildfarm, but no feedback is given on the Github PR page.
Is this behavior normal while using webhook, or am I missing a configuration somewhere?

Edit: here are the permissions I have given: (a bit more that what is advised on the Wiki). But I have just noticed that the Pull request review comments is missing.
