Q:

Frame rate settings for usb_cam?

Hi,
I am trying to interface my webcam using the usb_cam package and am having success.
But it's only pumping out images at 6 fps.
Is there a config I can change to increase my frame rate?

what image size have you get?

A:

The frame rate is limited by shutter speed, so it may be affected by auto-shutter, auto-exposure or other settings, depending on ambient light level.
