Q:

FollowJointTrajectory Usage

On the PR2, the joint controller provides two different actions, JointTrajectoryAction and a the new FollowJointTrajectory. Is there any documentation on how to use this action? I've run both and seem to get the same trajectories with the different JointTolerances I've tried.
Running electric on a PR2. Relevant links: control_msgs, FollowJointTrajectoryAction.

See my answer to this question: http://answers.ros.org/question/2765/where-is-the-node-for-follow_joint_trajectory
We'll try and put up some Wiki documentation soon.

The other useful bit that I got from Stu offline is "The short version is that FollowJointTrajectory adds tolerances that,
when violated, cause the trajectory to abort"

Still no answer?
