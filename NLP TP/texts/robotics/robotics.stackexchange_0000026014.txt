Q:

symbol lookup error with latest gazebo(1.5.0-1~precise)/drcsim(2.1.0-1~precise) from .debs

Since I (apt-get) upgraded, I get
gazebo: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/drcsim-2.1/plugins/libgazebo_ros_api_plugin.so: undefined symbol: _ZN6gazebo9transport9PublisherC1ERKSsS3_j

with gazebo(1.5.0-1~precise)/drcsim(2.1.0-1~precise) installed from .debs on my Ubuntu 12.04/AMD64 machine. It ran without problems before, so this appears to be a bug. Is this happening to anyone else?
/edit: Happens for example when starting default atlas:
roslaunch atlas_utils atlas.launch

I can reproduce this in a 12.04 32bit system. It was also the case with the prerelease binaries from the last couple of days. The problem is on the drcsim side. I built drcsim (2.2) from source and got it to work, though. You beat me to posting the question :-)

A minimal test to reproduce is to run gazebo -s libgazebo_ros_api_plugin.so

HI. I got the same message. Did you fixed it?

A:

Looks like you were unlucky enough to update in between the release of gazebo 1.5.0 and drcsim 2.2.0.
We're working through the drcsim 2.2.0 release now and expect it to be out soon.
In the meantime, I suggest that you roll back your gazebo installation by grabbing a 1.4.0 .deb from the archive, e.g. something like should do the trick on a 64-bit machine:
wget http://gazebosim.org/assets/distributions/gazebo_1.4.0_amd64.deb
sudo apt-get remove -y gazebo gazebo-prerelease
sudo dpkg -i gazebo_1.4.0_amd64.deb
sudo apt-get install -y drcsim
