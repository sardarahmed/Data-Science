Q:

How to rosmake pcl_ros in Mac OS X?

Hi everyone!
I'm trying to rosmake pcl_ros but I'm bumping into this error:
{-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  mkdir -p bin
  cd build && cmake -Wdev -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=`rospack find rosbuild`/rostoolchain.cmake  ..

I have vtk installed:
$ brew install vtk
Warning: vtk already installed

I am running Mac OS X Lion 10.7.3 and ROS electric, I followed the tutorial on how to install ROS using Homebrew.
Any suggestions? Thanks in advance!

A:

You can't, but it is possible in fuerte.
UPDATE:
Look at this answer to see what you have to do for getting rosdep to find pcl.
Also, I got ros_pcl to compile but in my efforts to get OpenNI working with ROS I messed something up and now ros_pcl won't compile again and I can't seem to fix it. :(

Thanks Kevin, time to update to Fuerte!!! It's just that it is so hard to get things working on OS X I'm always a bit lazy on updating!

There are still a lot of issues for OSX in fuerte, but I got pcl_ros to compile, but I can't get openni_camera to work ... so good luck!

Hi Kevin, did you follow the homebrew instructions?  I get an error about "no definition of [pcl] on [osx]" during the rosdep install phase when attempting to build pcl_ros fuerte on osx.
