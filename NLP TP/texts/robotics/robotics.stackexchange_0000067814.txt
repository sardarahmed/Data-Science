Q:

Wiki: Improve hector_mapping description w.r.t. odometry

The summary of hector_mapping says:

hector_mapping is a SLAM approach that can be used without odometry as well as  on platforms [...]

This does not make it clear that the mapping cannot be improved by available external odometry. I suggest changing this to

hector_mapping is a SLAM approach that does not use odometry and can be used  on platforms [...]

Good point! But it seems I can only edit the part starting with 1. Overview. Can I also edit the PackageHeader(hector_mapping) somewhere?

That part of the page is auto-generated from the package manifest. You'll have to submit a PR against that repo and see if the authors accept it.
