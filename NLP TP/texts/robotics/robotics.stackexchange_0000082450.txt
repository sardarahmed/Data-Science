What is the cause of this error.?
I have subsequently re-installed a new kinetic instance in a virtual machine ubuntu 16.04 with python 3.6 (default). It appears to run now. I previously ran with 2.7 environment (Anaconda).. this now gives the same error. What Python should be used?

A:

Lunar only supports Python 2.7 (see REP-3 and (fi) #q269143). If you want to use Anaconda, you'll have to make sure that all ROS Python packages have been installed for that as Anaconda does not use the default / system Python packages. That is most likely why you are getting that error.
There have been quite some questions and answers about Anaconda posted/resolved recently, so a search should provide some pointers.
