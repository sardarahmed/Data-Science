Q:

Rosmake: avoid rebuilding dependencies

I'm currently working on a ROS package which has many dependencies.
Every time I make a change to package and want to recompile it, I run
$ rosmake `package-name`

which actually builds the package and all of its dependencies, even if they have already been built during some previous compilation and their sources did not change.
Not being familiar with rosmake, I don't know whether this is how it works or I am missing something.
Is there a way to tell rosmake to skip dependencies whose binaries already exist?

A:

Yes:
roscd packagename
make

That's basically what rosmake does for all packages in the dependency tree.

Right. Reading carefully http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosmake: "If you really just want to build a package, and you know that its dependencies are up-to-date, you just type make in that package's top-level directory".

Does this skip dependencies whose binaries already exist, or skip all dependencies that are up-to-date, or skip all dependencies? Seems like you could get into trouble by using make on its own.

It skips all dependencies. If in doubt, run rosmake.

So - I find that running rosmake packagename --pre-clean helps sometimes when there have been errors, what would be nice is being able to skip certain dependencies that you know compile (and take the longest) and still use --pre-clean..

You can run make clean in whatever directories you think appropriate, leaving the others alone.
