Q:

controll rrbot from ros node instead manually

In this tutorial how can i control the position of rrbot by sending the position commands from ros node instead manually. I also tried this tutorial to control volocity of joint of velodyne sensor but i am confused how i can exactly control the robot from ROS in gazebo. Can  just make one ros publisher and than publish those same msgs from ros node doing some trajectory planning?

Well i also want to subscribe to the joint states published by the rrbot inside the ros node. Can i make simple ros subscriber and than just read them? I am using c++ api.
