Q:

Roboearth OpenCV Error

I haven't been able to save models using re_object_record record_gui in the roboearth stack.
I am using ubuntu 12.04 and ros-fuerte.
I am recording the objects without any errors, but when I click on save button, I get the following error
OpenCV Error: The function/feature is not implemented (OpenCV was built without SURF support) in cvExtractSURF, file /tmp/buildd/ros-fuerte-opencv2-2.4.2-0precise-20120908-1624/modules/legacy/src/features2d.cpp, line 77
caught exception
result = false

By looking at a similar question here, I guess that this error might be resolved by linking the correct version of the library, namely libopencv_nonfree.so
I am stuck at this point. Do I really need to link opencv nonfree library? If so, how do I link it?
Thanks in advance.

Sorry about that, please run "svn up" and try it again.

Thanks ddimarco, this will solve the SURF problem I suppose. I cannot compile the re_vision however, some declarations in the headers are missing. Here is a screenshot http://i.imgur.com/MzpZh.jpg . I declared getNumberOfPoints() in PatchFile.h, then some warnings and errors emerged.
