Q:

Get sensor_msgs/LaserScan message from simulation(v-rep)

Hello all,
is it possible to use LMS1xx package, but get the messages from simulation(eg. in vrep) instead of the real laser scanner?
Thanks in advance.

A:

It should work. I have worked with simulated Hokoyu laser scanners, in vrep, then exported the data from vrep as pointcloud into ROS, then used pointcloud_to_laserscan package to output a scan

Nice, but is it not so that the pointcloud_to_laserscan package changes 3D point clouds to LaserScan messages? I also get point clouds from v-rep, but from a 2d laser scanner. Can u plz help me with that?
Thanks
