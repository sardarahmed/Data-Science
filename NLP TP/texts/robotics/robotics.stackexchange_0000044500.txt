Q:

Mac os 10.8.2 Ros Fuerte, tutorial "CMake with rosserial_arduino" problem

Was following http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/CMake tutorial on ros website, "cmake ." command finished and then when i ran "make chatter" command, got these errors:
avr-g++: error: unrecognized command line option '-arch'
avr-g++: error: x86_64: No such file or directory
make[3]: *** [CMakeFiles/chatter.dir/src/chatter.cpp.o] Error 1
make[2]: *** [CMakeFiles/chatter.dir/all] Error 2
make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/chatter.dir/rule] Error 2
make: *** [chatter] Error 2
I think it has something to do with CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS flags, wonder if there is any way to remove "-arch x86_64" flag.
Additional info:
$ which avr-g++
/usr/local/bin/avr-g++
$ avr-g++ --version
avr-g++ (GCC) 4.7.0
$ which gcc
/usr/bin/gcc
$ gcc --version

A:

Managed to change it manually, by editing CMakeFiles/chatter.dir/flags.make file, but then got stuck with another problem :) "fatal error: Arduino.h: No such file or directory" well at least my arduino ide works with ros..
