Q:

Remote car controlling

Before I start asking you for help let you know that I am newbie in electronic field.
All I want to know is the principle of wheel rotation (left-right) from remote car gadget. I am not talking about changing the spin rotation of DC motor (up,down buttons from remote), I am asking about left and right movement of wheel.
I know that spin change depends on polarity of DC motor, so changing polarity changes spin, but what is the principle of changing the left and right positions of front wheels.

A:

A DC motor has 2 directions, forwards and backwards.
The DC motor does not control the direction of an RC car, instead it's the steering mechanism.
Rather than write everything here - I have found an article for you that I believe will explain the principles of car steering. Hopefully it's a good starting point for you; feel free to Google for further information that you require. 
The term how car steering works returns a lot of results. Good luck!
