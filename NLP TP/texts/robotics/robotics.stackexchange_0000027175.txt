Q:

Downgrade from Gazebo 4

I'm trying to downgrade from Gazebo 4 to Gazebo 3 and make it work with ROS Indigo. I'm using the following steps:
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu `lsb_release -cs` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-latest.list'
wget http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ros-$distro-gazebo4-ros-pkgs

The problem is that I get the message "E: Unable to locate package ros-indigo-gazebo3-ros-pkgs". What am I doing wrong in the steps I'm using?
UPDATE: Does the package ros-indigo-gazebo3-ros-pkgs actually exist?

There is no ros-indigo-gazebo3-ros-pkgs.
Can you say what problem exists in Gazebo 4 that makes you want to downgrade?

Please see this issue (http://answers.gazebosim.org/question/7293/robot-that-worked-in-gazebo-2-fails-to-launch-in/).

A:

You can install the gazebo3 package and build gazebo_ros_pkgs from source on trusty.

Try installing libgazebo-dev as well

Excellent, thank you both. Sorry for the repeated comments. Something went wrong with the network on my end.
