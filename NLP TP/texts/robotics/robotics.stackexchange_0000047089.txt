Q:

octomap_server globally referenced pointcloud and transform

Hi,
I am trying to pass globally referenced point clouds and trajectories to octomap_server, but it's not producing the desired results? The point cloud and ray tracing are being inserted from the single origin of the first scan.

A:

Found the issue:
// directly transform to map frame:
pcl::transformPointCloud(pc, pc, sensorToWorld);

I believe this was performing a transform on already transformed trajectories. By commenting this entry out, rebuilding and trying again, the insertion and ray casting are working correctly.
