A:

It's not the same. The first expects three Euler angles and will produces an arbitrary rotation in space and results in a quaternion. The second only needs one angle and will produce a rotation around the z-Axis and return a quaternion message.

Thanks,  Iâ€˜m just to verify it.

If you pass 0 for roll and pitch the results should be equivalent, although different data types.
Comment by gong on 2011-07-13:
so, if I just provide yaw the two methods would be the same?
