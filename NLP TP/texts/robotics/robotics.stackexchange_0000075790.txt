Q:

A Robot should stop moving If cmd_vel is stopped Publishing or If STOP command send

Hello
I have one confusion
I am publishing cmd_vel ( geometry_msgs/Twist ) messages using teleop_twist_keyboard .
The Robot subscribes this messages i.e cmd_vel  message.
When should my robot stop moving ?
a) As soon as I stop sending or publishing the cmd_vel from the Keyboard
OR
b) It should stop moving If i send him a STOP command
Please can anyone Suggest which one is the Right ?

You've updated this without providing any additional info; it looks like you're trying to gather additional answers. Is there something that was unclear or not satisfying about my answer?

A:

For safety, most robots use the first option (a), with a timeout.
If the ROS node that receives /cmd_vel doesn't receive a message within a certain time period, it brings the robot to a stop. I'd recommend a 1 to 2 second timeout for most indoor robots
The timeout ensures that if the connection to teleop is lost, or an autonomous navigation node stops sending commands, the robot comes to a stop instead of driving into a wall or other obstacle.
