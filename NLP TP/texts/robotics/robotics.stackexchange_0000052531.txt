Q:

How to use Least Squares method to extact line from laser scans datas?

Hello
I would like extract lines from my laser scans data. So I find that Hough Transform can do that but maybe the easiest way is the Least Squares method. So any help of implementation of Least Squares method in ROS/C++??
Thanks

A:

I've seen a lot of academic papers submitted on this topic - there are also many other places online to find a Houghs Transform  or Least Squares algorithm. I'd suggest you start looking elsewhere online - I don't think this is the best place for that kind of question.

ok. I saw online lots of C++ code of Least square and Hough Transform , only was not sure how to implement that on ROS .. Thanks anyway
