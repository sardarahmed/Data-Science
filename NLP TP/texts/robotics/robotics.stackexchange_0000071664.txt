Q:

Well, I have a urdf, mesh(stl files), manifest file, display.launch and gazebo.launch files

Well, I have a urdf, mesh(stl files), manifest file, display.launch and gazebo.launch files. What do i need to do next to launch my robot in gazebo or atleast spawn it in gazebo. Tutorials are helpless till now. Do i need to make a catkin_ws or some package or something....please help... This maybe basic but i am new to ROS and even LINUX. I would appreciate if everything is explained in detail starting from very basics. I have installed ROS indigo and gazebo.
My files can be viewed from this link:
