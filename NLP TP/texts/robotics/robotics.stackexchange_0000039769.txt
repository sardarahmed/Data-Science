Q:

Dependency [openrave] cannot be found

I installed ros-electric and openrave on my ubuntu 10.04, and I'm trying to create a package "grasp" by the command as follow
  roscreate-pkg grasp openrave roscpp

and I turns out
  bcddivad@bcddivad-laptop:~/code/ros/openravecode$ roscreate-pkg grasp openrave roscpp
  ERROR: dependency [openrave] cannot be found
  bcddivad@bcddivad-laptop:~/code/ros/openravecode$ 

can anyone please help me ?

I installed openrave by the commands given on the website here
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:openrave/release
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install openrave

Do I have to do anything else to let ros to include the openrave library?

I installed Openrave with thte instruction on the web site, will there be a package for openrave? Thank you!

A:

I guess you didn't install openrave. For electric, there doesn't seem to be a debian package containing the openrave ros package. There is a ros package [here] though (http://ros.org/wiki/openrave).
Normally, openrave doesn't really need to be a ros package to be used in your ros nodes. You can remove the dependency on openrave in manifest.xml and install it from a PPA as explained here.
Edit: According to this page you need to add something like the following to your ROS package's CMakeLists.txt:
find_package(OpenRAVE REQUIRED)
include_directories(${OpenRAVE_INCLUDE_DIRS})
link_directories(${OpenRAVE_LIBRARY_DIRS})
