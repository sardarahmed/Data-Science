Q:

problem with package shape_msgs

common_msgs: actionlib_msgs | diagnostic_msgs | geometry_msgs | nav_msgs | sensor_msgs | shape_msgs | stereo_msgs | trajectory_msgs | visualization_msgs
rosws set common_msgs --git https://github.com/ros/common_msgs.git
rosws update commomn_msgs

the package shape_msgs, I have included it in my stack but, "rospack find" is not finding that package.
Robot_self_filter package has a dependency on the shape_msgs package.
so when i try to launch
roslaunch erratic_navigation_apps demo_2dnav_slam.launch

it is showing the following error:
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [robot_self_filter/self_filter]: Cannot locate node of type [self_filter] in package [robot_self_filter]

Please read the support guidelines. Be specific and at least include steps to reproduce the error, your ROS version and Linux distro. Please always tag your questions appropriately and don't retype commands/erros but copy-paste them (there's a typo in a rosws command).

A:

You don't mention building anything.  The executables cannot be run without building them first.
