Q:

ROS and real time kernel

Hi,
I'm new to ROS, but I really need it for my project. I know there has been a few questions about ROS and real time, and I heard that ROS is NOT real time, and I need to use OROCOS if I need real time.
But, I rather not deal with OROCOS at the moment, and I would like to know if there is anyway to use a real time kernel, like rt-kernel or Xenogami, with ROS. I could not find a good instruction on how to do so..Is there any document or tutorials about it?
Any help would be appreciated
Thanks,
Steve

The vanilla Linux kernel has provided quite decent real-time performance for many years. Unless you have unusually tough latency or hard-response guarantees, it will probably work fine.

Thank you for your reply...I will check vanilla kernel

A:

A non-OROCOS approach for having hard realtime guarantees in the controllers is used on the PR2. You can read some further info on that here.
