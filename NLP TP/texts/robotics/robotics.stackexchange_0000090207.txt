Q:

precise timing with rosbag or an alternative

The beginner's tutorial reads, that rosbag may be not precise when it comes to the timing. Some tasks I face are not Lyapunov stable, so precise data playback is necessary.

Could rosbag be precise with the usage of advanced technical hacks? E.g. RAM-disk as a bag file destination and dedicated CPU core for recording/playing. Are there any ROS directives/modes for precise timing?

Are there alternative means of recording and playing messages and requests/responses with precise timing (95% <1ms)? Unfortunately, some non-trivial data like camera output might be involved.

For simplicity let's assume we work with a single machine to avoid network latency issues.
ROS Kinetic, Ubuntu 16.04.05 x64.

A:

There is a solution where you can playback a bag file with perfectly accurate 'simulated' time, but not real time. The rosbag API provides the tools to make a node which can scan a read messages out of a bag file in any order or at any time. Using this package you can make a node which can read out and process the data with the exact time-stamps in the bag file, regardless of the actual real time taken to do the processing.
Hope this help.s
