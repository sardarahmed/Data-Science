Q:

Gazebo window can not be maximized in Ubuntu 12.04

When launching gazebo, there are some important controls (clock) that can not be seen in the default window configuration. When I try to get the window maximized, the button and the contextual menu of the window are disabled, and then is impossible to access the clock control tool.
After testing, I found that there are two alternatives to get the window maximized, the first is double-clicking the window title bar, the second is using the full-screen gazebo alternative, when the window is in full-screen mode the Maximize button appears, and can be clicked, when returning to default view (non full screen), the windows remains maximized.
It could be great to have a natural way to see the time controls, instead of having to use tricks to get it.

use two screens would be a way to overcome

What is your screen resolution?

My screen resolution is 1366x768, and use two screens is not a solution.
