Q:

How to increase the quality of the map using gmapping and Hokuyo sensor

Hello
I built a map from the scan a Hokuyo lidar sensor using slam_gmapping package. The problem is that the generated map of the area that I scanned is very small with low quality and resolution. I would appreciate If you suggest me by changing of which parameters of Hokuyo and gmapping I could build a high map map.

A:

We have ~delta parameter in gmapping for resolution of the map. You can decrease this value. But of course in exchange for performance. You can check wiki page.
