Q:

network interfaces configure for Hokuyo ust 10lx

Hi all, I have a Hokuyo ust 10LX LRF, which use ethernet RJ45 connector, rather than USB.
Sequence listed below:
Step 1. Use  10LX's default setting , 192.168.0.10 as LiDAR IP address.
Step 2. Set network.
$ sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
auto eth0
allow-hotplug eth0
iface eth0 inet static
address 192.168.0.15
netmask 255.255.255.0
Step 3. Power on LiDAR with 12V@1000mA power supply,
Step 4. Plug RJ45 connector into PC's ethernet port.
Step 5. However get errors saying 'Destination Host Unreachable'.
$ ping 192.168.0.15
64 bytes from 192.168.0.15: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.032 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.0.15: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.037 ms ...
ping PC okay, but fail to LiDAR:
$ ping 192.168.0.10
PING 192.168.0.10 (192.168.0.10) 56(84) bytes of data.
From 192.168.0.15 icmp_seq=1 Destination Host Unreachable
From 192.168.0.15 icmp_seq=2 Destination Host Unreachable
From 192.168.0.15 icmp_seq=3 Destination Host Unreachable ...
Thanks very much for your help!

A:

Check the output of ip route and make sure that there is a route going to the 192.168.0.0/24 block using eth0.
