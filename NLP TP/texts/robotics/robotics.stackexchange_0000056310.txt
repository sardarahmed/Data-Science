Q:

Rebuilding single package with catkin

I have a catkin workspace with a lot of packages. Now, if I make changes to CMakeLists.txt in one of the packages, how do I rebuild only that single package, provided my changes do not concern any other package (e.g. other packages need not to be rebuilt)?

A:

catkin_make --pkg [YOUR_PACKAGE]

should do what you are asking for.
