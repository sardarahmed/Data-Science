Q:

Cannot locate launch node of type + Can't locate node

Hi,
I'm trying to create a node using this code in order to obtain the turtlebot coordinates in the map reference frame.
I've tried adding the node in an existing package, but I wasn't successful.
Therefore, I've created a new package (following this, this and this tutorials). In the last tutorial, instead of using the publisher and subscriber codes, I used the one I mentioned above.
I've used xy_pos as the package name and turtlebot_coordinates as the node name.
I'm able to use rosrun xy_pos turtlebot_coordinates, it works fine.
However, when I try to use the node via a launch file, I've got the following error:
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [xy_pos/turtlebot_coordinates.cpp]: can't locate node [turtlebot_coordinates.cpp] in package [xy_pos].
The part of the launch file related to this node is:
<node name="turtlebot_coordinates" pkg="xy_pos" type="turtlebot_coordinates.cpp" output="screen"> </node>
It's not a problem with ROS_PACKAGE_PATH ( roscd xy_pos works fine)
I've tried the solution for this question but it didn't work.
Does someone have any suggestion?
P.S: I don't know if this influences in something, but my launch file is inside an existing package. So while the new package is inside catkin/src/, the launch file is in a package inside opt/ros/hydro/share/. Is it a problem?
Thanks!

hello, I have the same problem with you. Did you solve this problem? Could you tell me how?
Comment by gerhenz on 2014-12-18:
Yes. Just remove the .cpp from the type argument as stated in ahendrix's answer below.

A:

The node name you use in roslaunch should be the executable name; not the source file name.
Try it without the .cpp:
<node name="turtlebot_coordinates" pkg="xy_pos" type="turtlebot_coordinates" output="screen">
</node>

I was getting confused because for nodes written in python you need to include the source file name in the launch file. I didn't know it was different for nodes written in C++. Thanks ahendrix!

Yeah I think its a bit confusing too :S

The way I remember it is that the pkg and type arguments to the node tag are the same arguments I use with rosrun.

hell yeahhh! pkg and type should be the same argument! 45 min. trying to figure out this shit man!!! :D

Don't forget that you are actually executing yourscript.py for python nodes and running the executable (which probably is a name) for cpp nodes.
