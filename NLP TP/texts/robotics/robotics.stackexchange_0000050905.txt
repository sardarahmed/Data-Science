Q:

Real time data analysis, any tools or package inside ROS?

Hello
Im wondering is there any tools or some packages inside ROS that permit real-time data analysis. I have used ROS in our mobile device , but I need to perform some online (real-time) analysis of the datas provided by my ROS nodes. Like speed profiles, distances to some object or obstacles , would like to be collected in long period of time, stored in some location and than in real-time (on-line) make them available for analysis. Is there any help inside ROS or do I need some additional Hardware and Software outside ROS??
Any help or comment would be welcome
Thanks

A:

There are tools like rqt_plot for realtime plotting. And rqt_bag for recording and playback of generic data, which itself has plugins for viewing various types of data.
If you have more specific requirements please clarify your question.
