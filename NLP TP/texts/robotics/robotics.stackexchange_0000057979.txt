Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: actionlib_java

Hi everyone.
I have installed the last update of ros-hydro-rosjava.
As I need preemtable actions, I decided to use actionlib just to find out that last posts regarding actionlib_java are years old. I assume that in the current status of rosjava actionlib is not supported.
My questions are:
Does anyone know whether this functionality is going to be supported and when?
Any advice on how could I implement preemtable actions without actionlib? Using rosjava is mandatory because of project requirements.
Cheers,
Juan

A:

No plan that I know of and I'm not exactly sure of the current status having never tried it, but I know that Damon has said that it really needs some love and just needs someone to step up and do it.
As a workaround, if you are wanting to write the client side in java to connect to a server side in python/c++, then you can do it fairly simply by just attaching handles to the publishers and subscribers manually. That is, use pubsub in a way that gets what you want out of the action server. It's more work to do it like this than to use a convenient action client front end such as there is for python and c++, but it works.
