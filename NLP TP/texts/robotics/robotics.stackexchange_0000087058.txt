Q:

Reliable IMUs for ROS

Hi,
I'm having problems in finding reliable IMU's in ROS. So far, I have tried the UM7 and the myAHRS+ with no luck. The first one, keeps resetting its magnetic reference and the second one works well but the x axis is pointing to the north ( x-north, y-west, z-up convention ) instead to the east ( ROS convention x-east, y-north, z-up convention ).
Does anybody know one that works out of the box?
Best,

This is just convention and can be fixed simply by rotating the outputs to correspond with the ROS expectations

A:

Check out razor IMUs: http://wiki.ros.org/razor_imu_9dof
I've worked with them and with the ROS package the setup is easy and it works flawlessly with this one:
https://www.sparkfun.com/products/retired/10736
But as you see that has been retired, when I bought it I got the https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14001
and there are some PRs on the page of the razor_imu_9dof to make it work with the M0.

Great! Thanks!
When you refer to the page of the razor_imu_9dof, are you talking about this webpage: http://wiki.ros.org/razor_imu_9dof?
What does PR stand for?
Best,

PR = Pull Request, sorry. And when I said the page I refer to the github repo, from what I've seen so far there is a fork with the code for the M0 so you are good to go:

@bpinaya did you ever run into this problem? https://github.com/KristofRobot/razor_imu_9dof/issues/41
Comment by bpinaya on 2018-07-04:
Not really, but from what I see it's due to the config file: https://github.com/KristofRobot/razor_imu_9dof/search?q=cfg&unscoped_q=cfg
Maybe an old branch? I'll give it a look in the weekend, but when I used it it was straight forward.

I forgot to catkin_make to generate the files for the dynamic reconfigure and now it works.
Comment by bpinaya on 2018-07-05:
hehehe no problem, it's always better to remove /devel and /build and catkin_make again.
If you liked my answer please accept it ;)

@andrestoga I am having troubles with the razor IMU, I am using https://www.sparkfun.com/products/retired/10736 with an arduino mega. Can you provide some details about your setup? thank you
