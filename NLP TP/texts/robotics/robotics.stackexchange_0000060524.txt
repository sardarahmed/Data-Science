Q:

3D Real Time Mapping

Hi everyone,
I'm looking for some advice on how I can build a 3D map in real time using an Asus Xtion (or Kinect). I have tried RTABMAP and had some success, however when I get into an environment that has very few visual clues I run into trouble. So I'm kind of at a bit of a dead end at the moment so any advice on where to look or other packages to look at would be great appreciated.
Thanks.

A:

I had a blog post last year discussing some of the 3d mapping packages released into ROS: http://www.showusyoursensors.com/2013/02/3d-mapping-is-here.html

Hi Fergs, thanks for your response. Sadly I've tried all the packages you mention in that post and none of them quite do what I'm after. It seems to me thats theres been no development since then!
