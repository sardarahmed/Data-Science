Q:

Fusing Multiple Laser Scans

Hi,
I have a RPLIDAR A2 and an  Orbbec Astra. The former is the one I am using for my gmapping at the moment and most of the time it  works really well. I was wondering about fusing its (forward scans) with the same range from the Astra. Just to help ensure accuracy from both the sensors....
Is there any point in doing this? And how could I go about it?
Thanks
Mark

A:

while, I did a fusion between rplidar and Asus xtion pro, and it works fun now. Due to roswiki is down now, could you please put more information about Orbbec Astra?
