Q:

Integration of Kuka KR16 with KRC2 controller

Hey
Recently I have started working with ROS and RSI (so I am new in this) to control a Kuka KR16-2 robot with KRC2 controller. We just installed the KSS 5.6 and RSI 2.3. I have looked on the ROS support and I found the Kuka Experimental which integrate the robot KR16, but the files for the rsi_hw_interface (https://github.com/ros-industrial/kuka_experimental/tree/indigo-devel/kuka_rsi_hw_interface) are for the KRC4 controller.
I understood that for KRC4 is using the RSIVisual which (of-course) are not compatible with KRC2  (e.g. in KRC2 the folder C:\KRC\ROBOTER\Config\User\Common  does not exist; RSI_CREATE is not a valid command; etc.) and that I need to convert the files from KRC4 back to KRC2. However, sine I am a baby in this I do not know from where to start and where to stop. Is there someone still working with KRC2 controller and ROS? Can you share with me the files for KRC2?

Hi
I have a PR against kuka_experimental that adds support for KRC2. It works for me, but as far as i know it has not been tested by anyone else. Would be great if you can test this and see if it works.
Some warnings:
Using RSI the robot can move at full speed in teach mode.
Set the HOME and upper\lower bound variables to something suitable for your setup. They are in the configuration fold of ros_rsi.src
PR is at https://github.com/ros-industrial/kuka_experimental/pull/74
