Q:

About using external libraries in one workspace

Hello, I have a Workspace baz and I want to figure out how to include more libraries, for example foo and bar to my Workspace baz and use it together.
The space for the libraries is /baz/src/roo/include
In this case, one of the libraries is roslibjs and I cloned it from git, but there is no CMakeList.txt or package.xml in it.
roslibjs
How does that work?
Thanks beforehand!

A:

Have you followed the roslibjs tutorials? Afaik, 'everything' is explained there (everything is in quotes, because it obviously assumes knowledge about ROS).
