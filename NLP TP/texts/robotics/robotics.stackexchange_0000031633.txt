Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: perception pcl

Hi,
Currently I am trying tutorial for PCL as described in http://www.pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/using_pcl.php#using-pcl
But, as in perception_pcl package in ros I could not find file named "FindPCL.cmake".
Perhaps, someone could give some enlightenment here.
I am still a bit confused how to use pcl in ros.
Thanks in advanced.
Kang

In general it's best to add more detail to your headline. Try something like "Perception_pcl can't find FindPCL.cmake"

A:

The tutorial you linked above is for using standalone PCL in your own CMake based project. It is not for using PCL within ROS.
If you are looking for how to use PCL in your own ROS nodes, see the pcl_ros docs. In a nutshell, create a package as usual (this is described in the beginner tutorials elsewhere on ros.org), add a dependency on the pcl_ros package and then you should be able to include pcl headers into your package.
If you are trying to use standalone PCL in your own CMake based project outside of ROS and are having trouble, you should send an email to the pcl-users mailing list detailing the issues you are having.
