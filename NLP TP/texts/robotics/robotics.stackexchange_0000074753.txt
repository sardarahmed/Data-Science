Q:

How to read Xsens IMU output values (measurement unit)

Hi to all,
I'm using a xsens MTI-10 IMU sensor (the orange version) and I would like to know how to read the output values.
For example, I get these kind of readings:
header: 
  seq: 620
  stamp: 
    secs: 1466618458
    nsecs: 864463090
  frame_id: /base_imu
orientation: 
  x: 0.0
  y: 0.0
  z: 0.0
  w: 0.0
orientation_covariance: [-1.0, -1.0, -1.0, -1.0, -1.0, -1.0, -1.0, -1.0, -1.0]
angular_velocity: 
  x: 32650.0
  y: 32783.0
  z: 32780.0
angular_velocity_covariance: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
linear_acceleration: 
  x: 33146.0
  y: 35201.0
  z: 36234.0
linear_acceleration_covariance: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

How do I have to read these numbers (for example,  x: 32650.0)? Are they radiants or degrees?
Can you help me, please?
Thank you!!

may be, they are only raw data and then I need to convert them in order to obtein the correct values? If so, I can't find the conversion formula..

A:

How are you getting this readings? Are you accessing the IMU using a UART on your computer, creating the message and the publishing what you get?
In any case, something is wrong with the code you are using, the quaternion should indicate a vector of norm equal to one. All elements are equal to zero on what you shared.
cheers...

The problem was related to the raw data.
I changed the output mode and now I'm able to correctly read the values.
Thank you for your help!
