Q:

sudo apt-get ros-kinetic-rtabmap-ros E: unable to locate package

I am using Ubuntu Mate 16.04 on Raspberry Pi 2. And ROS kinetic base is installed on it, every other package installs easily but I am unable to resolve the issue while installing rtabmap-ros. I have tried using ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS image for ARM and installed a Lubuntu desktop on it but the error is still present.

Maybe the package just is not released?

A:

Hi,
Binaries for arm are not built because libpcl-dev was not found on the initial release of Kinetic: https://github.com/introlab/rtabmap/issues/80, so rtabmap build is disabled on arm (don't remember where exactly on the buildfarm it is set).We may check to re-enable if libpcl-dev is now released. For now, you may have to build rtabmap from source: https://github.com/introlab/rtabmap_ros#build-from-source
Build status: http://repositories.ros.org/status_page/ros_kinetic_uxhf.html?q=rtabmap
EDIT: It looks like pcl_ros package is not built either: http://repositories.ros.org/status_page/ros_kinetic_uxhf.html?q=pcl
cheers
