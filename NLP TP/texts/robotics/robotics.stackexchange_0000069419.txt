Q:

How do I use catkin in a directory containing a space character?

I'm trying to use catkin in a directory that contains a space, when pressing TAB to trigger the tab completion the script fails:
```~/SpiderOak Hive/catkin_workspace/devel$ roslaunch fanuc_m10ia_support find: /home/dell/SpiderOak': No such file or directory find: Hive/catkin_workspace/src/fanuc/fanuc_m10ia_support': No such file or directory

My `.bashrc` looks like:

source ~/SpiderOak\ Hive/catkin_workspace/devel/setup.bash

Clearly a `\` is missing somewhere to escape the space character, where should I add it?
I've tried adding it to line 3 of `setup.sh` (it does not change anything):

: ${_CATKIN_SETUP_DIR:=/home/dell/SpiderOak\ Hive/catkin_workspace/devel}

Yes, the `Spider Oak` app does not allow to rename the sync directory.

Can you try doing ln -s /SpiderOak\ Hive/ SpiderOak_Hive  and then work with that static link which points to the original folder but with a name containing no spaces.

Nice idea but it doesn't work either!

**Comment by [gvdhoorn](https://answers.ros.org/users/5184/gvdhoorn/) on 2015-08-29**:\
This is very easily reproducable (just create a workspace path that includes a space in it) and I would say this is a bug. Could be that somewhere some script does not properly quote paths. Adding escape chars everywhere would only be a *work around*. I'd report this at the `ros_comm` tracker.

A:

It is not possible to use catkin in a directory containing special characters for the moment, an issue is opened here if you want more information and/or want to contribute to ROS by adding this feature:

My question was closely related to SpiderOak; an alternative solution is to not use the SpiderOak Hive and setup sync folders instead. See https://spideroak.com/forum/search/?q=rename+hive for more details.
