Q:

rosrun rviz rviz fails with "BadRequest()" error

Hi,
I am trying to run the rviz program in Ubuntu 11.10 with the Electric Full version ROS installation. I start by running
roscore
then running
rosrun hokuyo_node hokuyo_node
in a new terminal tab. Both execute without any errors.
However, when I open a new tab and run
rosrun rviz rviz
I receive the following error:
(rviz:7219): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: "pixmap",

(rviz:7219): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: "pixmap",

(rviz:7219): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: "pixmap",

(rviz:7219): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: "pixmap",
[ INFO] [1328153638.238979048]: rviz revision number 1.6.7
[ INFO] [1328153638.239041152]: ogre_tools revision number 1.6.2
[ INFO] [1328153638.239071158]: compiled against OGRE version 1.7.3 (Cthugha)
The program 'rviz' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'BadRequest (invalid request code or no such operation)'.
  (Details: serial 13 error_code 1 request_code 138 minor_code 66)
  (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
   that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
   To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
   option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)

I know I installed all of the files and dependencies correctly (except for the hokuyo_node--rosdep did not recognize the package and so I had to compile it myself. It then installed with no errors or warnings.) and the same command works on a different computer.
Can someone please help me with this?
Thanks!

I also have this problem. After reading this post I just kept trying and within 3-5 times it would work.
