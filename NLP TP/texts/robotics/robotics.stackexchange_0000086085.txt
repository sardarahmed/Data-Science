You tagged this with ros-industrial, but at least in the ROS-Industrial project/repositories, I do not know of any model for that particular scanner. Note also that the driver is not hosted by any of the ROS-Industrial organisations.

That was just a hopeful attempt in case anyone had used the sensor with ros-industrial

A:

Since there are no gazebo models for the Omron OS32C laser scanner, I have designed a primitive version using the CAD models and data from Omron website. The gazebo model can be found here.
