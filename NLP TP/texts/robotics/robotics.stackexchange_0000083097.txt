Q:

I am having errors while getting octomap from rgbdslam_v2 GUI and also where do I get the output of online octomapping?

As it is essential to get octomap for navigation and path planning but I am not able to do that I have followed the answer also but it isnt helping.

There is also error while opening pcd files from the rgbdslam_v2 GUI.
The error of opening of pcd file is this:

[ERROR] [1506803049.883978384]: Cloud has "flat" dimensions: 1 x 14585991

I am using roslaunch rgbdslam rgbdslam.launch
and then play my rosbag file and the GUI is building 3D map but not octomap. Once the process is over I try to save the octomap but the only output I am getting is this(this is map.ot file generated from save octomap):
Octomap OcTree file
(feel free to add / change comments, but leave the first line as it is!)

id ColorOcTree
size 0
res 0.05
data
