Strange, when i tried your method, I get an error, E: Unable to locate package ros_fuerte_erratic_robot. Does anyone knows where I went wrong?
Comment by arebgun on 2012-11-05:
The proper command is: "sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-erratic-robot", notice the dashes (-) instead of underscores(_).

Thanks arebgun! It works!

A:

Diamondback is not supported on Ubuntu 12.04 . If you want to install erractic_robot on 12.04 under Fuerte, try for a package like ros-fuerte-erratic-robot. If that deb doesn't exist, you can try installing from source if that package, but the package may or may not be supported on 12.04 & ROS Fuerte.
UPDATE: erratic_robot is available for 12.04 and ROS Fuerte and is available in the package repositories.

erratic_robot stack is supported in Fuerte and is available in Ubuntu 12.04, there shouldn't be any problems installing it from package repository.

I can verify this.  I just installed erratic_robot from Fuerte under Ubuntu 12.04 today, and everything seems to work as advertised.
