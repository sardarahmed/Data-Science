Q:

Â¿There is an example of a working example of serial port on ROS Indigo and C++?

I'm working with ROS Indigo and Ubuntu 14.05, and I've found a serial library from William Woodall and John Harrison (https://github.com/wjwwood/serial/) that seem to be exactly what I want. They say that is compatible with ROS, but I'm not finding the way to make it work. A working example with a "hello world" on serial port will be enough for me, because I think my problem is with the dependencies on the CMakeLists.txt.
PD: By now I'm able to compile and run the "serial_example.cpp" included on the package, but that doesn't use ROS, I've tried to make it work but i don't know where's my error.

A:

You can take a look at the code of some of the packages that use the serial package. For example:

http://wiki.ros.org/ax2550
http://wiki.ros.org/flir_ptu_driver
http://wiki.ros.org/serial_utils
http://wiki.ros.org/um6

should give you an idea on how to integrate it in a ROS package.
Hope it helps!
EDIT:
Here you have a very simplistic and crude example of a node using the serial package.
