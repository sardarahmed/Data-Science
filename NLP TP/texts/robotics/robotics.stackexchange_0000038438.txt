Q:

Making my Turtlebot with ASUS Xtion

I have read tutorials etc for making your own turtle bot, I wish to do it using ASUS Xtion; do I need to use the modification kit as it is used when assembling the turtlebot using Microsoft Kinect ?
Any first hand experience will be most useful.

A:

No; the Asus Xtion only needs USB power, and already has a USB connector.
If you want a bracket, iHeartEngineering makes one that is pretty nice: http://store.iheartengineering.com/I-Heart-Engineering-TurtleBot-Mounting/dp/B0073NXVW6

You'll also need to launch the asus version of the TurtleBot urdf, if you want the camera to be correct in the visualization

If you need it, the alternate URDF is available here. https://github.com/IHeartRobotics/iheart-ros-pkg/tree/master/ihe_hardware/turtlebot_xtion_top_description
Also, since it is open source the files for making your own are available here.
