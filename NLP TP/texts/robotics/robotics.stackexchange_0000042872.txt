Q:

Tutorials - Understanding ROS Nodes

Hello!
I have Ubuntu 10.04 and installes ROS electric.
I am trying to make $ rosmake turtlesim (Tutorials - Understanding ROS Nodes), but get following error message:
rosmake  Packages requested are: ['turtlesim']
rosmake  Logging to directory/home/janina/.ros/rosmake/rosmake_output-20120802-160904
rosmake  Expanded args ['turtlesim'] to:
[]
rosmake  WARNING: The following args could not be parsed as stacks or packages: ['turtlesim']
rosmake  ERROR: No arguments could be parsed into valid package or stack names.
How can I install the turtlesim package? I think it,s missing?

A:

You need to export the package paths correctly. As you allready noticed your packages can not be found. The reason is most likely that you did not correct setup the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH variable.
you can check the Path by:
echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
The output shows the paths which ROS is searching for Packages.
