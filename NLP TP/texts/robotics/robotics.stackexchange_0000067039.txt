Q:

problem with tf tree, robot_pose_ekf, odom_combined

Hello, I've been working with a turtlebot with a kobuki base , i'm trying to use robot_pose_ekf but i found a tf problem,
in this case base_footprint will have 2 parents (odom_combined published by robot_pose_ekf node and odom published by
nodelet_manager node)
So  how can i resolve this problem, should i change some parameters in launch files?
Any help please

A:

When you want to do this sort of thing you need to pick one tree which will be the primary and reconfigure the other frames to hang off as leaves.

thanks for your response,
juste another question please:
i want to compare the trajectory of my robot with odometry (nav_msgs/Odometry) and odom_combined published by robot_pose ekf.
Comment by sophye_turtlebot on 2015-04-23:
In this case should i change odom parametr in stack navigation with odom_combined or stack navigation should stay with the same topic /odom ((nav_msgs/Odometry) ).

so in this case i navigate my robot and i just compare the the result of two topics ( /odom and /odom_combined).
Thanks in advance

in another way I want to know if we send the navigation stack as goal (1metre). in this case if we work with odometry or odom combined the robot will walk 1 meter or the movement will depends on the values of the odometry?

finally
I want to know if the odometer is just a topic that shows the estimated position of the robot and displays it on a topic or values actually affects the robot's movement
