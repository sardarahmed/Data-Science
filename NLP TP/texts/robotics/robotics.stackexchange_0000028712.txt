Q:

Why is the Real Time Factor different in /gazebo/diagnostics topic and in the bottom toolbar in the simulation?

As you can see below, when I visualize the topic /gazebo/diagnostics, the real time factor is different than the value at the bottom of the window. Why is that?

A:

The RTF is not provided by the server, so each client calculates its own way. The GUI and the gz stats tool use the same math, which is based on the last 20 samples, but the DiagnosticsManager just does instantaneous calculation.

TimePanel::Update() - this is the one you see on the GUI

StatsCommand::CB - this is the one you get from the gz stats command line tool

DiagnosticManager::Update - this is the one on the ~/diagnostics topic
