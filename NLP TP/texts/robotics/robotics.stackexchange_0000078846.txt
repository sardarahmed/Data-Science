Q:

Robot does not listen to 2d pose estimate

when I try to tell it's 2d pose estimate it just stays where it is and show particle clouds around it's wrong location.
that is shown in this image.
I am very new to ros and i'm running out of time where learning step by step is more or less out of my options any help would be appreciated

a bit more information would be appreciated. E.g. what localization are you using? I am guessing amcl?
The amcl inipose topic is initialpose. So check that your are actually sending this there.
Also, is rviz on a remote machine? This could make a difference too
Comment by Acecryz on 2017-02-09:
yes I am using amcl, initialpose has a connection to the /amcl. I am not using a remote machine it's on the same PC. I will post my rqt_graph if that helps
Comment by mgruhler on 2017-02-09:
with rviz running, please...
Comment by Acecryz on 2017-02-09:
rviz is running
Comment by mgruhler on 2017-02-09:
but not showing up in the graph. Please configure the graph so that we see it.
Or: rosnode info /rviz_5468461351 (check to get the right one, should have some numbers trailing).

Comment by mgruhler on 2017-02-09:
Alright: rosnode info /rviz_ then hit tab and take the one that actually completes!
Comment by Acecryz on 2017-02-09:
I updated the question with the rosnode info /rviz_ sorry I tried using the preformatted text button but it didn't work
Comment by mgruhler on 2017-02-09:
rostopic info /initialpose? Any output in rostopic echo /initialpose when you send the initial pose via rviz?

When I try to rostopic echo /initialpose it gives a warning that it has not been published yet
