Q:

Another OSX Lion snag: no formula for libyaml

On my brand new today Macbook Pro 10.7.4, following the instructions here, it fails on step 1.2.2:

brew install ros/fuerte/libyaml
Error: No available formula for libyaml
Please tap it and then try again: brew tap ros/fuerte

The only warning I got from  brew tap ros/fuerte  was related to flann, which I doubt is relevant.
Thanks for any help.

I have reason to believe that this is a problem with my homebrew installation and isn't related to ros.  I'll let you know.

A:

Support for Fuerte is still experimental.  I would recommend Electric on OS X for the time being.
As for this problem, there used to be a version of libyaml specifically for ROS, a frozen version if you will.  This strategy of freezing non-ROS formulae hasn't worked out so well, so the duplicate formulae in the ros-fuerte tap have been removed.  This is why you can't find the libyaml in the ros/fuerte tap.
You can simply replace this command with brew install --universal libyaml and you should be able to continue, but I think you will run into more issues shortly after.  You can continue down this path with Fuerte, or backup to Electric, up to you.
