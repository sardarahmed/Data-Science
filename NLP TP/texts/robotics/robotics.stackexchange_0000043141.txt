Q:

IMU_UM6... where to install?

imu_um6 is a package with no associated stack. I would like to install this in the opt/ros/fuerte stacks folder with other drivers (those drivers that come with stacks install here).
I did try creating a workspace and placing imu_um6 here but when running rosdep I get errors relating to not finding key resources in the opt/ros/fuerte location.
How do I best install imu-um6 and associated dependencies?

A:

well, um6 depens on rospy,geometry_msgs, sensor_msgs and tf which are already installed with fuerte distribution. Make sure that you put your imu_um6 package in your workspace directory and run rospack profile command after that compile it by make, then launch the test file. I believe that there will be no problem. I hope that this helps you

I followed your instructions and everything seems to work, but if the um6 is in a workspace how do I get an application like hector_slam to access the IMU data if hector_slam is in a different workspace? Should the imu_um6 driver be loaded in the hector_slam workspace?

there will be no difference because your package path contains both your workspace and stack directory
