Q:

ubuntu 11.10, ROS electric and TiXmlElement ( tinyxml ) compiling error

/opt/ros/electric/stacks/pr2_controllers/control_toolbox/lib/libcontrol_toolbox.so: undefined reference to TiXmlElement::Attribute(char const*) const' collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
I have following compilation error and don't have any idea how to solve it. I think it might be linked to this following problem:
http://answers.ros.org/questions/2296/revisions/
But still quite don't know how to solve this.
EDIT:
After doing fresh install of ROS to ubuntu I get this error msg:
Failed to find stack for package [control_toolbox] Failed to load rosdep.yaml for package [control_toolbox]:Cannot locate installation of package control_toolbox: [rospack] couldn't find package [control_toolbox].
What would be the correct way to fix this? I think last time I used apt-get to instal necessary library.

Hi,
Check if the following problem helps.

Thanks,

Updated
Use the following to checkout the control_toolbox into your ros_workspace
svn co https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/stacks/pr2_controllers/branches/pr2_controllers-1.4/control_toolbox wg-ros-pkg/pr2_controllers/control_toolbox

You have to compile this package using
rosmake control_toolbox

I hope you have a ros_workspace in place so that ros path fetches downloaded package without any issues. If not pls go through http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment
Hope this helps,
Karthik

When an answer is correct please mark it as so using the checkbox.  I've done so for you.

Thank you this helped. I have to assume there was something wrong with my initial control_toolbox install.
