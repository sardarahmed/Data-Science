Q:

Cannot run camera_calibration

Why can't I run the camera calibration? I am using diamondback in Ubuntu 10.10. I get the ff:
Waiting for service /stereo/left/set_camera_info ...
Service not found
Waiting for service /stereo/right/set_camera_info ...
Service not found

Can you post the output of "rosservice list" while your stereo driver is running and which stereo driver you are using?

A:

I already found it, remapped the ff: right_camera:=/stereo/right left_camera:=/stereo/left to this: right_camera:=/right left_camera:=/left

Can someone check this? I cannot check it myself, thanks

Could you please share what driver did you use and maybe your .launch files? I am trying to make it work with the usb_cam driver in groovy, but I always get the same errors.
