Q:

rosdep does not find dist

I set up rosdep(init, update) and trying to install python-certifi. And I allways get the error:
root@ros-in-docker:/project# rosdep install python-certifi

ERROR: Rosdep cannot find all required resources to answer your query
Missing resource python-certifi
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/kinetic/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/project/src
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/kinetic/shar

But it seems to be in the list for Ubuntu Xenial:

A:

Afaik rosdep only installs the dependencies of ROS packages. You cannot use it to install dependencies themselves. python-certifi is not a ROS package.

Hmm, but this states it differently...

That's a reference to the xml format used for ros packages and doesn't reflect the command line syntax.
