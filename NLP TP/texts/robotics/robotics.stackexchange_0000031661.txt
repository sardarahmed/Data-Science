Q:

Dependency install failure: ros-diamondback-ros-tutorials

Hi All,
I am using Ubuntu 10.10 and try to install ROS. I followed every step found on the website, but something is wrong at the last step. Any suggestions or hints would be appreciated.The output is as follows. (The Linux kernel is 2.6.37, and before I tried to install ROS, I had installed Matlab R2010b -- not sure if this is related, just FYI)
$ sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-desktop-full

Could you update the title of your post to more specifically state your issue; something like "Dependency install failure: ros-diamondback-ros-tutorials"

Yes, I ran it.

Did you run 'sudo apt-get update' before 'sudo apt-get install...'?

A:

I got similar errors when I accidentally added the wrong package source. E.g., I added the source for Maverick even though I was running Lucid.
Double check which version of Ubuntu you are running using
cat /etc/issue

and the package source you added using
 cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list
