Q:

How display pointcloud messages in browser using rosjs?

Hi guys, 
I have found the same question but the answer seems to be obsolete.
Concerning, this link. I can't find some JavaScript files used in this tutorial. Especially visualization.js.
They are not included in rosbridge nor wviz packages. I can't find them on rosbridge website  
Are they obsolete ? Where can i find the last version? 
By the way, how can I display my pointcloud from ROS messages in my webpage using rosjs.
Thanks,
BeuBeu

Hi Beubeu,
as Dejan pointed out wviz now lives in bosch_web_visualization stack. Wviz uses javascript files included in

rosjs_visualization (this package might be what you're looking for btw),
rosjs_common, and,
rosjs_resources

Just to test, you could trying installing wviz and adding a laser scan display in the scene.
If (that works) && (you want to make your own custom web page) && (you need help) then let's take the topic to bosch_web_visualization user group.
If you are interested in visualizing point clouds, then please use Brown's pcl_filter package (it will throttle the data and prevent Chrome from crashing). In the near future rosjs_visualization (and wviz) will use compression to reduce the bandwidth consumption. Until that day, pcl_filter is our best friend.
