Q:

Does Selflocalizer get map via service call from MapServer?

It is not shown in rqt_graph the service call connection for SelfLocalizer node to where ?
From rosnode info SelfLocalizer it shows
* /SelfLocalizer/get_loggers
 * /SelfLocalizer/set_logger_level

Are they from MapServer node ? And what does MapServer node do, because is is not in Nav2d package ?

afaik mapserver publishes the map as it is (occupancy grid). The localization happens with other algorithms, like AMCL for example.

A:

Yes it is, but service connections are not shown in rqt_graph. You can use "rosservice list" to show the available services, but this will also not show which node is calling these services.
The MapServer is from the ros-navigation stack: http://wiki.ros.org/map_server
