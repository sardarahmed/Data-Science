Q:

ROS driver for Lightware SF-40/C laser scanner

Has anyone written a ROS driver for the Lightware SF-40/C laser scanner
I found one for SF-10/C altimeter here https://github.com/wavelab/ros_lightware. Not sure if this will work for SF-40/C as well.

A:

Looks probable, we don't have one to test, but the interface looks the same.

Able to read the data via minicom.
Also the lightware terminal doesn't work with Wine on Ubuntu. Did you happen to try it?

The code works by reading a fixed number of bytes, and is not receiving those bytes.  You may need to set it to streaming mode first.  Did not try lightware terminal in Wine.  This is a pretty basic driver, shouldn't take too long to figure out the differences.
