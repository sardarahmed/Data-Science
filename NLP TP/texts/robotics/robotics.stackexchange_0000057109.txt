Q:

Error in openni_grabber.cpp while installing ROS Groovy from source on Ubuntu 13.10

Hi there,
When running the command ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install I get the following error:

This code block was moved to the following github gist:
https://gist.github.com/answers-se-migration-openrobotics/7b5a9aed20274fa53774a1cc2568ba13

Any idea at all in what could be the problem in openni_grabber.cpp?

A:

It seems like you have a Eigen version installed that is too new for PCL. It seems in 3.2 the sqrt function moved from eigen::internal::sqrt to eigen::sqrt. See this question:
http://answers.ros.org/question/128916/ros-groovy-compile-fails-at-pcl/
So you could either try to change the source of PCL or make sure it is using eigen 3.1 to compile.

I changed the question, cause the solution for the eigen.h error is given in this answer. But after that, It crashes in another error.

How exactly did you change the eigen file? What version are you using? Can you try using a version of Eigen that is known to work with PCL, like 3.0.5 or 3.1.0 as suggested in the answer I linked? I dont know if the new error is due to Eigen, but it makes things easier to start with validated deps.

What I did was changing Eigen::internal::sqrt to pcl::sqrt and Eigen::internal::sin/cos to sin/cos, as suggested in a related post here in the forum. Anyway, how can I change the version of Eigen?

Not sure. I'm on a Mac so I have a hard time testing this. I guess Eigen is system installed?
