Q:

Symbol lookup error: libgeometry_shape.so: undefined symbol: _ZN6Assimp8Importer18SetPropertyIntegerEPKciPb

System Ubuntu 14.04 with ROS Indigo (updated to the latest already)
This problem confuses me for days. So every time I start the move_group or the rviz this error occurs, I then checked the library in the /opt/ros/indigo/lib and dumped the strings in file libgeometry_shapes.so and found that the undefined symbol is actually in there.
I have another Ubuntu 14.04 with Indigo and the move_group is working fine, I am not quite sure why it's not happy with the libgeometry_shapes.so, the only thing I have done to this Ubuntu is that I used the nvidia-375 driver for the graphic card in order to use cuda for the KinectV2, can this possibly be the cause?
Many thanks!

A:

This is not exactly an answer, but I figured out why. ROS moveit uses a dynamic library called assimp, but only works with assimp v3.0, not assimpv3.2, that is where goes wrong, I think.
Anybody facing the same problem or do anyone how to manually link to another library?

Why did you install assimpv3.2 on ubuntu 14.04?
Most likely they broke ABI. So you have to recompile libraries
in /opt/ros/ that use assimp to use the new version.
Otherwise problems are to be expected.

That's true, I cover the assimp 3.2 with assimp 3.0 and the problem is fixed. The reason why I have a assimp 3.2 is probably because I installed cuda or changed to Nvidia graphic card and the library is automatically installed.
