Q:

Which topics can i use to receive all turtlebot sensors information?

i already have the turtlebot 2, and i want to subscribe all topics that have any information from sensors. I already subscribe the odom topic and cmd_vel topic, and i want to know which topics are lacking

void odomCallback(const nav_msgs::Odometry::ConstPtr& odom)
{
ROS_INFO("I received odom: [%f,%f,%f]", odom->pose.pose.position.x, odom->pose.pose.position.y,odom->pose.pose.position.z);
}

ros::Subscriber sub_odom = nh.subscribe("odom", 1000, odomCallback);

This code is right? Where can i see more subscribers to the other sensors?

A:

Basically everything under /mobile_base/sensors/ although some are redundant/processed.
