Q:

Irobot Create 2 installation issues

I robot create 2 driver installation confusion
Installed driver for Irobot Create 2 from here. I am a little stuck though. I was expecting a GUI or a place to input commands and not really sure what to do next. https://github.com/MirkoFerrati/irobotcreate2ros
I run
rosrun irobotcreate2 irobotcreate2
and get:
[ INFO] [1466316801.213298743]: Roomba for ROS 2.01
[ INFO] [1466316801.350324458]: Connected to Roomba.
[ INFO] [1466316801.451156961]: Waiting for roomba sensors

The tutorial says:
rosrun irobotcreate2 irobotcreate2
to run the basic software and have access to the following topics:
/battery
/bumper
/buttons
/cliff
/cmd_vel
/digit_leds
/ir_bumper
/ir_character
/leds
/mode
/odom
/play_song
/rosout
/rosout_agg
/song
/tf
/wheel_drop
you can read sensors (/battery, /buttons, /bumper, ...) and send commands (/cmd_vel, ...).
No idea what to do with these commands without a UI. Any help would be much obliged. First time ROS user..

A:

While I agree that the package seems to be not documented enough, it does say you can send velocity commands by /cmd_vel. I suggest you go through this generic tutorial once again, and replace the topic name appropriately to work with Create2.
