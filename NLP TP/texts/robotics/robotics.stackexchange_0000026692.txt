Q:

How to run Gazebo 1.9 headless

For a series of unattended simulations, we'd like to utilize a bunch of VMs on a server. For this, we'd like to run a Gazebo simulation server in headless mode (since a] the server has no graphics card and b] Gazebo does not like VirtualBox's OpenGL capabilities).
I've found a few mentions of using the commandline argument -r to run in headless (no OGRE/OpenGL) mode, but this seems to have changed in recent Gazebo. In the --help screen of Gazebo 1.9.5, the -r option is listed as "record", and no mention is made of a headless mode.
So my question is, how do I run a Gazebo 1.9 server in headless mode?
PS: If this is not available in the standard binary releases (we're using the DEB packages at the moment), I could also recompile Gazebo. I just need to find out how to use a Gazebo 1.9 with a ROS-fuerte.... (but that's not part of this question)

A:

Yes, if your robot model has a camera then gzserver will try to create a camera. You are right, the behavior of gzserver should be: "Output a warning about no opengl support, and then continue." This sounds like a bug.
I've created and issue for this. Could you add your robot model file to that issue?
