Q:

Is it possible to send data to ROS from a machine not running ROS

My problem is as follows:
I need image capture from the screen of a Mac, which doesn't run ROS well (or at all from what I can really tell). I basically need to pass in the current screenshot of the mac to ROS for further processing. I have ROS on a ubuntu VM, so basically I just need something that can very lightweight pass the screenshot data from the Mac to the VM.
I was thinking of doing this via the internet, by sending the image to a website and writing a script that will pull the image in ROS but this will have a large bottleneck.
If my problem has not been well stated, please let me know and I'll try to write it better. The short is, is there any way to create a pseudo-rostopic that doesn't need the full ros stack for images so I can get the screenshot data to ROS for further image processing (and passing the results off to a robot that runs ROS).
