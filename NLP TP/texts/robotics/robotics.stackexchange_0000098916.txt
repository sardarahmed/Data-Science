Q:

How to configure none node loggers for rosout

For fine grained configuration of log levels we want to use a none node logger or a child of the node logger. For both I can see the output on the console but not on topic /rosout. Also using --ros-args --enable-rosout-logs did not help.
How can I configure such loggers correctly?
