Q:

How does a self-driving car locate itself when the environment changes?

There's something I don't quite understand about SLAM. When a self-driving car wants to locate itself using a prior map, how does it do that when the environment keeps changing, e.g., new cars parked on the curb, etc.? Even if it uses a 3D map, the current sensor would be quite different to the prior map if there're new objects on the road.

A:

The landmarks chosen for a given location should include many that only infrequently change - for example, features of buildings, such as architectural motifs, corners of the structure, utility installations etc.
Parked cars would make for poor landmarks precisely because of their transience.
