Q:

depthimage_to_laserscan launch

hi,
i create a launch file that convert depthimage to laserscan:
<launch>
    <arg name="camera"  default="camera"/>
    <arg name="publish_tf" default="true"/>
    <group if="$(arg scan_processing)">
        <node pkg="nodelet" type="nodelet" name="depthimage_to_laserscan" args="load depthimage_to_laserscan/DepthImageToLaserScanNodelet $(arg camera)/$(arg camera)_nodelet_manager">
        <param name="scan_height" value="10"/>
        <param name="output_frame_id" value="/$(arg camera)_depth_frame"/>
        <param name="range_min" value="0.45"/>
        <remap from="image" to="$(arg camera)/$(arg depth)/image_raw"/>
        <remap from="scan" to="$(arg scan_topic)"/>
    </group>   
</launch>

when i run: roslaunch fake_laser_pkg start_laser.launch, i receive this error:

[start_laser.launch] is neither a
launch file in package
[fake_laser_pkg] nor is
[fake_laser_pkg] a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was
written to the log file
what can i do please?

Where did you put the launch file?

in ==> catkin_ws/src/fake_laser_pkg/launch/start_laser.launch

A:

Are you sure that calling your node is correct? I think it should be something like this:
<node pkg="nodelet" type="nodelet" name="depthimage_to_laserscan_loader" args="load depthimage_to_laserscan/DepthImageToLaserScanNodelet $(arg manager)">

Did you source the setup.bash file? if not try executing:
source devel/setup.bash
