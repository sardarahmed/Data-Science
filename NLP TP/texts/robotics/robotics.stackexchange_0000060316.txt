Q:

Problems when installing segway-rmp package

Hi!
I am using ROS Hydro on Ubuntu 12.04. I downloaded the segway-rmp-ros-pkg from here:
http://wiki.ros.org/segway_rmp
I followed all the steps up until doing the rosinstall. I put in the wrong path to the ros directory and got the according error message, until I realized that it was in /opt/ros/hydro. After running that command succesfuly, I was prompted to run a "source" command by rosinstall. After doing so, I was not able to proceed to the next step, which is running roscd segway_rmp. This is, however, not the main issue. I closed the terminal and tried opening a new one, but whenever I now open a Terminal, I don't get the $ sign with username, but the terminal is completely empty. Only when I hit ctrl-c do I get the command line back. Sometimes, when I hit ctrl-c, I get a message telling me about latest tracebacks, all going to python files. I am unsure what went wrong here, maybe someone can help me!
I already restarted the computer, but I keep getting the same issue with every new terminal I open.
Thanks,
Marc

A:

That suggests that you have something inside your .bashrc which is hanging. The tracebacks may help you with finding what your ctrl-c is interrupting.

I got onto that route after searching... I reset my .bashrc file by copying an original from etc/skel. With that setup, I am able to start a new terminal, but obviously I lost all my ROS stuff since the environmental vars are not there anymore. I try to re-add ROS source, but the terminal hangs.

Is it possible the setup.bash is corrupted? Is there a way to reset it together with the other files in /opt/ros/hydro? Thanks a lot!
