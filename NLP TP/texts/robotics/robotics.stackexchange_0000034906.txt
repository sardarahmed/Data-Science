Q:

upgrading from diamondback to electric. problems with turtlebot?

Hi, is there any other option to upgrade than uninstalling one and installing the other?
If I'm working with the turtlebot and I have electric in the workstation and diamondback in the turtlebot laptop will it work?

A:

Both distributions can be installed together on any system.
However, only one at a time should be present in your $ROS_ROOT and $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environment variables.
You should not attempt to run nodes built against different distributions together, whether on separate machines or a single one.
