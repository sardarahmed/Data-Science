A:

It looks like you're having network connectivity issues. Can you ping ros.org or fetch the failing URL manually?

Can you ping ros.org from the command line? Try: ping ros.org

That sounds like there's something wrong with your network configuration. I don't have any specific advice, but once you get it figured out you should be able to proceed with your ROS installation.
