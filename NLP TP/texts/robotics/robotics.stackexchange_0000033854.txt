Q:

calibration of a custom robot with a Swissranger

I am interested in using the pr2_calibration package to calibrate a custom robot.  My robot has a 7 DOF arm, 4 DOF neck, 3 cameras, and a Swiss Ranger flash LIDAR.  I am wondering what is the best way to model the Swiss Ranger for the pr2_calibration package.  It doesn't really fit the existing tilting laser or camera models.  Although, i could probably go in either direction.  Has anyone done this before?
