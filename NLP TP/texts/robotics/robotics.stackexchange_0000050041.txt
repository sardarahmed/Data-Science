Q:

After update UWSim only with --disableShaders

I have installed ROS Groovy and UWSim and everything was working fine.
Next day Ubuntu "Update Manager" said there is cca 100 updates recommended and I updated everything. After that I can run UWSim only with
rosrun UWSim UWSim --disableShaders

What I need to do to repair that so I can run UWSim normally?

Hi,
UWSim has some pending issues with ocean shaders on some graphic cards from osgOcean visual effects but if it worked earlier it should work. You should check your graphics card configuration. If you are running UWSim on a laptop make sure you are running dedicated graphics card instead of proccesor for UWSim (common error). Some modern nvidia cards on laptops require a bumblebee installation and run UWSim with optirun.
Anyway shaders are a graphic issue so if it was working before the update problem must be on graphic configuration.
Besides that are you using Groovy?, as far as I know latest versions of UWSim do not support Groovy provided that osgWorks version used in UWSim is not working on it. Did you fixed that? or are you using an earlier version?. Just wondering...

So it should be something about drivers. Do you know if any of that updates were related to graphic drivers?. I would go for checking 3d acceleration and graphic drivers something may have broken.
