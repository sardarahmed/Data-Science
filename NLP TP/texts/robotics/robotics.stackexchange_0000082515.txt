Q:

how I create the pointcloud topic in moveit in order to do the octomap?

Hello everybody.
i have been wondering how to really create the pointcloud topic in moveit.
I did This tutorial, but it only explains how to do once you have the topic done.
I tried to create a pointcloud topic using iai_kinect2 (due to the fact that im using a kinect v2. and even if i am able to create a point cloud, if i put the topic in the yaml file, and i run a simulation, any octomap is shown.
I was wondering if i have also a set any specific parameter or something in planningscene.
I have been working on that a few days in I'm feeling I am doing many rounds on the same topic.
Any help would be appreciated. Thank you

A:

I respond myself also.
It seems that was missing the pose of the kinect in the environment.
In order to solve this problem, i just added to the launch file a tf2 with the name required (it is shown in rviz, when you try to open a pointcloud2 trough the desired topis, then it says that the frame with the name ____ is missing).
Good luck to everybody!
