Q:

Error when using moveit alongside gazebo

When trying to execute a successfully planned path in gazebo the execution fails and the following warning appears:
[ WARN] [1503953317.867847912, 22.680000000]: Failed to validate trajectory: couldn't receive full current joint state within 1s

I am using rviz moveIt plug-in

A:

With the (lack of) information given, I can't say for sure. But, from the warning that you posted there's a timeout issue.Your model may not be publishing the joint states on the correct topic. From @gvdhoorn's comment on this answer, you can try making

sure that joint_state_publisher gathers the JointStates published on /move_group/fake_controller_joint_states and republishes them on /joint_states.

with
<node name="joint_state_publisher" pkg="joint_state_publisher" type="joint_state_publisher">
    <param name="/use_gui" value="false"/>
    <rosparam param="/source_list">[/move_group/fake_controller_joint_states]</rosparam>
</node>

You can always use a Google search of ROS Answers and the error which will give many results.
