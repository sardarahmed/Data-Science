Q:

const sensor_msgs::PointCloud2ConstPtr& cloud initialize

Hi
I have a function which takes a
const sensor_msgs::PointCloud2ConstPtr& input

as input. I currently have a sensor_msgs::PointCloud2 but i cant turn it into a pointer for some reason.
Is the sensor_msgs::PointCloud2ConstPtr are boost shared_ptr?
If so how do you initialize the pointer to an object that already exists?

A:

You should be able to use the Boost make_shared function to create a pointer to the existing cloud.
sensor_msgs::PointCloud2 p;

const sensor_msgs::PointCloud2ConstPtr& input = boost::make_shared<sensor_msgs::PointCloud2>(p);
