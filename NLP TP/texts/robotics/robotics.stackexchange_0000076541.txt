Q:

How to use the occupancy grid in the global planner?

Hey everybody,
I am trying to create a path planner, that plans reliable paths in SLAM maps.
Therefore I don't want to use the costmap, which doesn't work with probabilities anymore but the occupancy grid.
But I don't know how to access it in my global planner...
Can anybody help me?
Cheers,
Earthgrazer

A:

The simplest way would be to subscribe to the map topic (assuming that's where the SLAM node is publishing to) This would give you access to the nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid messages corresponding to the latest map. You'll probably also need to subscribe to the map_metadata topic as well, which will contain the nav_msgs/MapMetaData messages.
