Q:

Whither has the Roslisp API doc moved?

Scattered throughout the Roslisp tutorial documentation are links to some Roslisp API documenation, but those links all 404. Google's been no help in tracking it down. Does it still exist? Where?

A:

All documentation is on docs.ros.org for example roslisp is documented here: http://docs.ros.org/groovy/api/roslisp/html/
If you have links that are broken it is helpful to point to them so that they can be fixed.
