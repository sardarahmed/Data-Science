Q:

How to prevent twisting of cables

I am planning to create a motor turret described in this question. But to simplify the problem, I'm thinking of a wind turbine with a generator in the main head that can rotate freely through 360 degrees to face the wind. How would I prevent the power and sensor wires coming from the head and down the shaft from twisting? 

A:

What you're looking for is generally referred to as a slip ring. Here's a cheaper slip ring sold by Adafruit along with a video demonstrating how it works: http://www.adafruit.com/products/736. They sell hobbyist parts. I've used slip rings before to manufacture my own rotating LiDAR using a Hokuyo.
Here's another company that sells what seem to be industrial grade slip rings: http://www.moflon.com/. I found them by doing a quick Google search for "slip ring connector", which you can use to find many many more options.
As a final note, here's the video of the rotating LiDAR I built which uses a slip ring...you will see the slip ring in the first 30 seconds of the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PLcqhXVndI&list=UU0A5iVxngtVcHPjANH75z1A.
