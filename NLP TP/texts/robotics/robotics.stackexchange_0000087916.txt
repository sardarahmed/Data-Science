A:

You can take a look into object_recognition and find_object_2d. 
These projects might be of help too: tensorflow_object_detector,  yolo_object_detector, ros_people_object_detection_tensorflow

Hi, thank you for answering my question. Actually I had found the find_object_2d package, but the provided information actually is kind of confuses to me.....did you know any other better website to lean how to source the package?

for example, like I had source the OpenCV in my laptop, so do I  still need to source the vision-opencv package?

vision_opencv is for interfacing ROS with OpenCV and you should build it yourself only if you want to use OpenCV2.

The problem is that vision_opencv provides the cv_bridge package. The recent upgrade of the opencv3 package breaks the published cv_bridge package so you will need to rebuild cv_bridge properly. This answer may be of help.
