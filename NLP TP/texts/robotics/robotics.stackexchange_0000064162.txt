You should be able to install openni on Ubuntu 14.04 with ROS Indigo. Can you be more specific about why you can't install openni and the EXACT error message that you're encountering?

A:

The openni_kinect stack is deprecated, and is no longer supported or released (as per the openni_kinect wiki page )
Instead, you should be using the openni_launch package: http://wiki.ros.org/openni_launch
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-openni-launch
