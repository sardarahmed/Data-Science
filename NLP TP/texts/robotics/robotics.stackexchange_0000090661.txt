Q:

It's is possible to use SOEM to communicate directly to a AC Servo Drive using ROS?

I need to develop a cartesian robot of 5 DOF without using a PLC. The AC servo drive that I have can communicate via CANopen or EtherCAT (and other protocols too). Choosing to use EtherCAT now I can, in the future, use CoE theorically. But, being a total beginner in ROS, I need to know if I am in the right way or using ROS with one of these protocols is impossible to archive sucess in this project?
Using a industrial PC with ubuntu 18.04 LTS and ROS Melodic.
ps.: sorry for my bad english.

It's not ethercat, but for canopen, you could look at ros_canopen.

But checking the page of ROS-Industrial they say that SOEM is a open-source EtherCAT (https://github.com/mgruhler/soem). I'm wrong to believe it's possible to use EtherCAT to control servos with ROS?

I don't believe I commented on the state of ethercat support. I just wanted to make you aware of the canopen support.

Thank you! But one more question: can you indicate a good (or complete) tutorial to do that with CANopen?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-02-26:
No, I wouldn't know of any.
There are quite a few questions about ros_canopen on this site (ie: ROS Answers) though. Perhaps those can be of help.
Use Google to search for them (something like: ros_canopen site:answers.ros.org).

And if I choose to use Ethernet/IP, what you opinion about it? (Remember, I need to control servo drivers with a industrial PC)

A:

@Hyperion sorry for the very late answer.
Yes, you are totally on the right track with this.
You can implement CoE using SOEM, e.g. There is a catkinized version of SOEM released into melodic, which should allow you to call sudo apt install ros-melodic-soem.
But I recommend to check out the Usage section of the ReadMe to make sure you don't run into include problems with the non-conform package layout the SOEM originally has...

Thanks for the answer, I will try!!! But one more question: I found the ArmorBlock 1732 of Allen-Bradley that works as a sensor hub and operates over Ethernet/IP. You know anything about if is possible to connect the ROS directly with the device? I saw that Ethernet/IP package in ROS seems to be depreciated. You think is worth a try?

sorry, can't help with that...

Don't worry, thanks for the help.
