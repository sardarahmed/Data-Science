Q:

Is it possible to use MicroStrain IMU 3DM GX4-25 in Hector SLAM

I tried to use IMU 3dm Gx4 25 in Hector SLAM.
The package of IMU 3dm Gx4 comes from the website:
https://github.com/KumarRobotics/imu_3dm_gx4
However, I got a problem when I used Hector SLAM.
After using roswtf, it showed that there was no tf message.
Furthermore, the problem might be come from hector_imu_attitude_to_tf.

A:

As long as your sensor publishes sensor_msgs/Imu you can use it. Your Problem looks like you do not have transformation between robot-base and IMU sensor. Did you add it into urdf file (or urdf.xacro)? If not you should do it.
