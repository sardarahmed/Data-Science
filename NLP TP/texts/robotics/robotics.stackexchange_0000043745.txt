Q:

rosjava_core build error ':apache_xmlrpc_common:compile'

Hi!
I tried building rosjava_core as per [1], but it always gives me the same build error. I will present the steps I took to hopefully tell you enough to be able to help me.

I start out with a fresh install of Ubuntu 11.10 64-bit on vmware.
I install ROS electric (ros-electric-desktop-full) following the steps from [2].
I install the Android SDK (but I don't think this is of relevance for rosjava_core to build correctly).
I install gradle and mercurial via apt-get (sudo apt-get install mercurial gradle).
I install the Sun JDK 6u35 64-bit (because I read somewhere else that OpenJDK could turn out to be a problem if libraries are missing) and set it as my Java SDK. I also tried this step with OpenJDK as my SDK.
I follow the instructions on [3] to install the rest of the other software and initialize my workspace.
This is the step where it fails. When I execute "./gradlew install" [4], I get the following error message:

user@ubuntu:~/my_workspace/rosjava_core$ ./gradlew install

Building > :apache_xmlrpc_common:compileJava > Resolving dependencies ':apache:apache_xmlrpc_common:compileJava

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

What went wrong:
Could not resolve all dependencies for configuration ':apache_xmlrpc_common:compile'.

Could not resolve group:org.apache.commons, module:com.springsource.org.apache.commons.httpclient, version:3.1.0.
Required by:
ros.rosjava_core:apache_xmlrpc_common:0.0.0-SNAPSHOT
Could not GET 'http://robotbrains.hideho.org/nexus/content/groups/ros-public/org/apache/commons/com.springsource.org.apache.commons.httpclient/3.1.0/com.springsource.org.apache.commons.httpclient-3.1.0.pom'.
Could not resolve group:org.apache.ws.commons, module:ws-commons-util, version:1.0.1.

Try:
Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace. Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.

BUILD FAILED
Total time: 6 mins 25.964 secs

I would be very grateful if somebody could point out what I need to do it right to build rosjava_core. Cheers, Bernd

A:

The better solution is to use the "mavenCentral()" (similar to "mavenLocal()") method. This change will be applied everywhere soon.
