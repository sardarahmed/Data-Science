Q:

Saving changes to objects in gazebo_ros world file?

I'm working in ROS (Indigo, Ubuntu 14), starting gazebo 2.2.3 with
rosrun gazebo_ros gazebo

I go in and create a little corner of a room by dropping in a couple of cubes and scaling them:

I save the file as corner.world. Then later open it, and the scaling I did is gone:

I've now just got two cubes. Where did my walls go?

A:

From gazebo answers:

There were a few issues scaling shapes
and saving the world which have been
fixed in newer versions of Gazebo.
Since Gazebo 2 is no longer officially
supported, I suggest you change to the
latest long term support version,
Gazebo 7.

Unfortunately, Gazebo 2.N is what comes packaged with Indigo. It is indeed possible to go renegade and install more recent versions of Gazebo:

Those intrepid souls who want to follow those instructions, live it up!
One workaround is to build walls out of cubes.

Why is the default to install an unsupported version of gazebo with an actively supported version of ROS? Gazebo is up to version 7 now! #roswtf
