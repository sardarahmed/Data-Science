A:

I suspect most of them do (assuming support in the underlying device).
I know camera1394 does. That driver also supports changing focus via dynamic reconfiguration.

Jack, the question should've actually been whether any of the ROS drivers for USB camera's supports autofocus. After evaluating them all (http://www.ros.org/wiki/Sensors#Cameras), it seems that none of them does and we will now implement it for the uvc_camera driver.  D.
