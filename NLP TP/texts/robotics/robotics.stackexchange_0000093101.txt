Q:

roscpp dependency error

Platform: ROS Melodic on Debian Stretch IDE: QtCreator

Hello,
I strictly followed installation guide and package creating tutorial on a fresh install of Debian Stretch for Ros Melodic to install my environment. Then I created a package using catkin_create_pkg in a workspace that is tested to be valid. Then I followed IDE's wiki page steps to write a piece of C++ code to try if it is working but I got a roscpp dependency error from CMAKE Could not find a package configuration file provided by "roscpp" with any of the following names:
Afterwards I tried to do it with catkin tools on a separate workspace using catkin create pkg and followed the steps for it again but still the same error.
Here is my CMakeLists.txt
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)
 project(pkg_a)

find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
  roscpp
)

include_directories(
  ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS}
)

I have three lines in my .bashrc file for sourcing the packages.
source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash
source /home/<username>/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
source /home/<username>/pkg_ws/devel/setup.bash
#The last line added later on after trying to find a way with catkin tools

@Solved
If anybody has the same issue; I made it work through making the changes to QtCreator in the IDEs wiki page section 3. catkin tools but made it run through the 2. method (catkin_make)

Please always link to any tutorials/guides/howtos/documentation you are using.
We don't always know what you refer to.

Edit: also add the output of env | grep -i ros | sort and rospack find roscpp to your question text. Use the edit button/link for that.

which directory did you run catkin_create_pkg? Also, is that your entire CMakelists file? I didn't see where you declared your cpp executable or linked the catkin libraries

Managed to run CMake succesfully after creating a package using catkin tools but this time ros.h file couldn't be found.
Comment by prefpkg21 on 2019-08-26:
does the CMakelists portion of your original post reflect the current file in your package?

Actually yes, but the package created with catkin_create_pkg started working now. Thank you for the help
