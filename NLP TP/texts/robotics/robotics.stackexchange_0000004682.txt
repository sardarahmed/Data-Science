Q:

Is there an advantage to multiple magnetometers for heading computation

I'm building an autonomous sail boat (ripped out the guts of an RC sail boat and replaced with my own mainboard etc.)
The controller board I have can accommodate both an MPU9150 and an HMC5883. Is there any advantage is using both magnetometers for a tilt-compensated heading? I'm thinking that I could compute the unit vector with soft/hard iron offsets removed for both, and then average  the two vectors to get one slightly better one?
Not sure if it would yield a better result though.

A:

A brief google search turned up this paper on using multiple magnetometers.  Depending on how far out at sea you expect to deploy this sailboat, you may want to consider a fallback mode where if the 2 compasses diverge by a certain amount then you consider one of them to be malfunctioning (since the average would be very inaccurate).
