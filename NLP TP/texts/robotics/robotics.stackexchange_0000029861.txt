Q:

ROS Answers emails

Is there a way to get ROS Answers to send an email when a question is posted with a specific tag?
Update: Where is the tags listed in 'allow only selected tags' set?

We're testing a script to inject tags into the ontology.  Right now I've injected tags for all the packages in ros-diamondback-desktop.  I'm waiting for the dust to settle before I give it a more mammoth list of tags (probably every package, stack, and repo)

Also it is not possible to filter on a tag that does not exist. For example adding a tag 'iheart-ros-pkg' is forgotten because there are currently no posts that have that tag

The solution doesn't work if no tags are selected and it is set to only email posts with selected tags.

This looks like a duplicate of a previous question. How can I mark this as a duplicate of http://answers.ros.org/question/35/how-to-get-notified-of-new-questions-with-a ?

A:

Yes.  Go to your profile page and click 'subscriptions'.  Then choose "allow only selected tags" along with the frequency options.
"Selected tags" == "interesting tags" that shows up in your right-hand sidebar when normally viewing the site.
