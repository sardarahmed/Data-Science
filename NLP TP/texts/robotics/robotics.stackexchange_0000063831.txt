Q:

Waypoint Navigation: Simplified Local Planner

Hello,
I was wondering if anyone has written such a behaviour for a robot navigation or any hint on how to implement it.
1- The robot gets the waypoints from the global planner
2- Starting from the first waypoint, the robot rotates towards the next waypoint
3- The Robot moves on a straight line and stops at the next waypoint
4- The robot rotates towards the next waypoint
5- The Robot moves on a straight line and stops at the next waypoint
6- Goto 4
Assuming that there is enough distance between the waypoints.
Thanks
