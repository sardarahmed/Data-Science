Q:

Failed to load motion_planning_rviz_plugin.so

Hi All,
To visualize the path generated by OMPL, I follow this this tutorial.
Unluckly, when adding a Planning Display on rviz, I got:
[ERROR] [1336877297.396395409]: The plugin for class 'motiong_planning_rviz_plugin/Planning' failed to load.  Error: Failed to load library /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/arm_navigation/motion_planning_rviz_plugin/lib/libmotion_planning_rviz_plugin.so. Make sure that you are calling the PLUGINLIB_REGISTER_CLASS macro in the library code, and that names are consistent between this macro and your XML. Error string: Cannot load library: No manifest in /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/arm_navigation/motion_planning_rviz_plugin/lib/libmotion_planning_rviz_plugin.so: motiong_planning_rviz_plugin__Planning

How could I solve above errors?
Do you think a typo (extra 'g') on "... 'motiong_planning_rviz_plugin/Planning'..." contributes to the error?
I also wonder why the Planning Display on rviz subcribes motion_planning_msgs::KinematicPath instead of arm_navigation_msgs::DisplayTrajectory.
What do you think?
I am using ROS Fuerte, Ubuntu 11.10 64-bit and arm_navigation stack installed with
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-arm-navigation

Thank you.
\update: A ticket has been filed for this.

A:

The extra 'g' is definitely a problem. I wonder how it ended up in your RViz config. Usually, you should be able to load the plugin by clicking "Plugins" -> "Manage..." and checking both check boxes ("Loaded" and "Auto Load") next to "Motion Planning".
Maybe it helps if you delete your ~/.rviz/ config directory first.

Hi Martin, that typo is in motion_planning_rviz_plugin/plugin_description.xml; https://kforge.ros.org/armnavigation/armnavigation/file/1e25b730b303/motion_planning_rviz_plugin/plugin_description.xml, I have tried to correct it, but the problem remains, any ideas pls?

Good catch! You should file a bug here and edit your question to include a link to the bug report.

Martin, btw, I do not see a Plugins button in rviz, where is it? In my case, the motion_planning_rviz_plugin is already in DisplayType windows without any efforts, so I am not sure whether this is correct.

Yes, that is how it should be. Thanks for submitting the bug report!

Hi Martin, do you have any suggestions as workarounds for that please? Thanks.

You could copy the package to your home directory, fix it there and put it on your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.
