Q:

Cannot do make eclipse-project in an existing package

I have already created a beginner_tutorials package and now i want to install eclipse and created eclipse project files.
After following the instructions, when i do make eclipse-project there is an error stating make: *** No rule to make target 'eclipse-project'. Stop
This is the same question as this but i did not understand the solution.

A:

Solved : Just went through with the instructions again.
It says : if you are using catkin, you do not have the possibility to make eclipse-project. I went ahead with the instructions in 2.2 here
