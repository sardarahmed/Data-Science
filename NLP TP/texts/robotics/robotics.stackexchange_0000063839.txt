Q:

Ethernet stack for ROS

I have a micro controller with TCP/IP and Ethernet stack available, This is capable of sending the messages over TCP/IP. But is there any possibility with ROS to receive these message with a Linux PC running ROS.
A similar package to rosserial or something..?
thanks in advance.

A:

In fact, rosserial_server exists for this purpose. We use it regularly to send information from Windows programs to ROS (example use cases: Microsoft Kinect 2 SDKs, Thalmic Myo SDK). Another option is rosbridge.

See also rosserial_embedded_linux -- this is the client library for C/C++ devices that lack support for Boost.
