Q:

turtlebot_apps compilation error

Hi,
I am following the tutorial to setup the workstation for using the turtlebot.
When i compile the turtlebot_apps as in the final step of the tutorial, i get the below error.
mkdir -p build
  if [ ! -f smc_6_0_1.tgz.md5sum ]; then echo "Error: Couldn't find md5sum file smc_6_0_1.tgz.md5sum" && false; fi

Can someone let me know the way to solve this issue.
Thanks,
Karthik

A:

This looks like either the server at code.ros.org was down, or there's some sort of SSL problem with either the server or the SSL libraries on your machine.
If it's a server problem, trying again later may work. You may also be able to short-circuit the problem by doing the download manually, and moving the file into the appropriate directory.

I assume you're trying to build a specific package; that archive should end up in the build directory inside that package.
