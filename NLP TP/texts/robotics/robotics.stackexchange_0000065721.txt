Q:

launch roscore from launch file

I'm trying to make a launch file that plays back a bag file and launches some data processing nodes. The problem is that rosbag play fails if no master is running. Can I start this process from a launch file?

A:

roslaunch will automatically start a roscore if there isn't already one running.
