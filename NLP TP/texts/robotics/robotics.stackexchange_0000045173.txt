Q:

How to run Talker/Listener from rosjava_tutorial_pubsub

Hi all,
I am following the tutorial http://docs.rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/rosjava_core/html/getting_started.html#executing-nodes
I have rosjava_tutorial_pubsub. Now if I run "../gradlew installApp" I get successful build but I dont see any bin directory. And if I try to run Talker by command ./build/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub/bin/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub org.ros.rosjava_tutorial_pubsub.Talker
I get error that Data not found. I think this is because there is not bin directory in ./build/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub/ but I dont know why

A:

The documentation is a little outdated. Instead of:
./build/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub/bin/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub org.ros.rosjava_tutorial_pubsub.Talker

... you should run:
./build/install/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub/bin/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub org.ros.rosjava_tutorial_pubsub.Talker

(notice the missing install/).

Thanks. It works but if I create and build my own new package inside rosjava_core directory and put Talker.java inside src/main/java/org/ros/my_test/Talker.java and copied build.gradle from pubsub tutorial, it gives error:> Project with path ':rosjava' could not be found in root project 'my_test'

That's a different problem, so please open a new question and post a link to that question here. I'll answer there.
