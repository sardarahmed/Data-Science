Q:

ros-indigo-robot-upstart missing essential files

Hi!
I just installed the above mentioned package however it seems that its directory contains only a CMake file, templates and a few other useless files. The install  and uninstall scripts, although autocompleted when calling rosrun robot_upstart ..., are NOT present hence the package is completely useless.
Did I do something wrong or is this indeed a broken ROS package? If you clone the github repository you get all that you need.
Regards!

rosrun can only autocomplete things that are actually there. If I look at the CMakeLists.txt for robot_upstart in its indigo-devel branch, the install targets seem to be there:
file(GLOB SCRIPTS scripts/*)
install(PROGRAMS ${SCRIPTS} DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_BIN_DESTINATION})
install(DIRECTORY templates DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_SHARE_DESTINATION})

Could you perhaps be looking at the wrong directory? The package manifest and "CMake file, templates and a few other useless files" are installed in /opt/ros/indigo/share/robot_upstart, while the scripts should be in /opt/ros/indigo/lib/robot_upstart. The Python package robot_upstart should be in /opt/ros/indigo/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/robot_upstart.

Ah, yes, indeed I was looking in the wrong directory. Those things are in the lib folder of indigo's installation folder and also the Python package is there too. Thanks! PS: This still does not explain why rosrun was telling me that install and respectively uninstall could not be found.

You did not mention or include any error from rosrun in your original post; please include the exact command you're running and it's exact output and we'll try to help.

I forgot to use source on my .bashrc hence the changes in ROS' installation were not noticed and rosrun reported that "install" is not a known command. It's working now. :)
