Q:

Where is the log file in ROS 2.0

I install ROS 2.0 in my computer, and run the demo programs. But I can not find the log file.
Where is the log file in ROS 2.0?
I know the default position in ROS 1.0 is ~/.ros.

Thanks for your answer. Now if I want to log into a file, how should I do? I can not find any introduction for this.

For now (until that feature is being implemented) you can use "standard" features available on your system. E.g. pipe the output into a file.

en. en. I find the function through source code. Now, it can't log in the file through the ros2.
