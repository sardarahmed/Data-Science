Q:

How to program to generate robot URDF(Serial manipulator) when having stl file of each link with Python

I've tried :

to use obj2udf library(PyPI)  then It can generate 1 URDF per 1 STL(it doesn't work because I can't find how to program to change link name or add link and can't combine STL)
so now I have URDF of each link instead of a robot URDF.
to combine each urdf in pybullet and think it won't work when use as simulation.
additional :
after I have URDF I will try to work with pybullet.
I am working on window 10 with Visual studio code.
use miniconda.

so is there a way or some function of python that can generate robot URDF
reference code:
import os
import sys
from object2urdf import ObjectUrdfBuilder

# Build single URDFs
object_folder = "Base"

builder = ObjectUrdfBuilder(object_folder, urdf_prototype='_prototype_Base.urdf')
builder.build_urdf(filename="Base\Base.stl", force_overwrite=True, decompose_concave=True, force_decompose=False, center = 'mass')

A:

Thank you,Now I have found odio_urdf library that can generate urdf by programming in python like you code in  urdf file.
