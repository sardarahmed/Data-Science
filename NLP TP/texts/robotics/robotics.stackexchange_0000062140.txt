Q:

SICK LMS1xx in Husky (Hydro)

Hi, does anyone have any idea how to use SICK LMS100 laser scanner in Husky?
I have been trying to use the package provided in here - https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/LMS1xx - but could hardly make it. (error message I got : connection to device failed, changing of IP does not work)
Ubuntu 12.04.4 + Hydro.
Thanks!

Thanks Murilo. You were right, it was indeed IP problem. Someone else changed the IP in LMS while I was on my vacation last month. LMS now works nicely again. Thanks a lot!

I'm also using a Husky with LMS100 on 12.04 + Hydro. I forked the repo from clearpath and made very minor changes. Have you checked the IP configured on the LMS? Can you show your launch file?
