Q:

rosdep install doesn't find libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev

Hi all,
I'm developing my stacks in which I have a certain package that depends on gstreamer.
I need to install this libraries:

libgstreamer0.10-dev
libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev

I defined this dependencies both in manifest.xml and rosdep.yaml (is this correct?). However on some PCs, all of them with Ubuntu 11.10, rosdep-install fails with the following output:
.../RGBCamera$ rosdep install RGBCamera
Failed to find rosdep libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev for package RGBCamera on OS:ubuntu version:oneiric
rosdep install ERROR:
failed to install libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev

This is the content of manifest.xml
<package>
    <description brief="RGB Camera">
        This package contains the dirver for the RGB Camera
    </description>
    <rosdep name="libgstreamer0.10-dev"/>
    <rosdep name="libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev"/>
    <depend package="rtt"/>
    <depend package="ocl"/>
    <depend package="rtt_sensor_msgs"/>
</package>

This is the content of rosdep.yaml
libgstreamer0.10-dev:
  ubuntu:
    oneiric: 
      apt:
        packages: libgstreamer0.10-dev
libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev:
  ubuntu:
    oneiric: 
      apt:
        packages: libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev

What's the problem here?
Thanks!

A:

You should be using the key 'oneiric' not '11.10' in your rosdep.yaml  See REP 111 for specifics on OS identifiers.

@tfoote Thanks, I modified the rosdep.yaml as reported in the modified question. However it still doesn't work.

Where is your rosdep.yaml file in relation to your package and stack?
Comment by LucaGhera on 2012-03-15:
@tfoote the rosdep.yaml is in the package root, the same folder of the manifest.xml. stack.xml is in the upper level folder.
Comment by tfoote on 2012-03-19:
@LucaGhera it should be a peer of the stack.xml  rosdep only searchs inside a package path if that package is not in a stack.
