Q:

rqt_plot does not see backends

I have installed QWT and its' bindings for both python2 and python3. Moreover I have installed pyqtgraph but no one of them is available in settings. So I stuck to matplotlib which is extremely slow.
Did anyone meet this problem?
P.S. OS is Ubuntu 16.04, ROS Kinetic
