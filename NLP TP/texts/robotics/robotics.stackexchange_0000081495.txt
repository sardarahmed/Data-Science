Q:

start ur5 remotely

Dear Ros Users and UR Users,
is there a way to start UR5 remotely? My main purpose is to save energy on a mobile platform where UR5 is mounted on.
Thank you!

Can you be a bit more specific? Are you talking about shutting down / turning on the UR controller, or about the (various) ROS drivers?

I was searching a method to power on the arm when controller is already on. Actually, I found it possible through the UR Dashboard

Ok, good to hear.
Could I ask you to post a slightly more extensive answer (like: which URScript/Dashboard commands did you use) and then accept your own answer? That will mark the question as answered much more than if you close it.

A:

Universal Robot provides a Dashboard to manage these kind of commands (power on, power off, ...)
