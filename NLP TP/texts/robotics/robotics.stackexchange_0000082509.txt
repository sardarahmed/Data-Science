Q:

robot_localization and IMU selection

Dear all,
I am thinking to buy IMU to be used with robot_localization package. I understand that IMU must be in ENU mode. May I know which IMU support ENU mode and output reliable orientation information? Is microstrain 3DM-GX5-25 a good choice? But it is in NED. Can we use it as ENU via some kind of static transform?

A:

Are you working from source? Even if you get an NED IMU, it's easy enough to modify drivers to convert to ENU. I typically just invert the values for the Y and Z axes.
