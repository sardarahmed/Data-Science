Q:

op_behavior_selector node seems to be invalid

Hi all,
op_behavior_selector node seems to be invalid. I don't know why and how to solve it.

environment: autoware.ai.1.13 melodic
issueï¼šop_local_selected_trajectory topic publish the optimal path within a period of time after starting the op_behavior_selector node.After a while, the op_behavior_selector node seems to be invalid, no longer with the obstacle to update the path, while the op_trajectory_evaluator still evaluates the optimal path.In this case, launch the pure_pursuit node, the vehicle failed to avoid the obstacle and stopped in front of the obstacle.

A:

This is by design.
Lane change is disabled when local trajectory length is smaller than the distance to goal pose.
if you try longer global path, or shorted local trajectory (local planning distance). this will work as expected.
