Q:

ROS AMCL does not need odometry data?

I'm reading amcl document on ROS Wiki. In its subscribed topics there is not odometry topic, why? It works only with laser?
Subscribed Topics: (From ROS Wiki)
scan (sensor_msgs/LaserScan)
tf (tf/tfMessage)
initialpose (geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped)
map (nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid)
And my next question is how can I use amcl in Gazebo simulator for turtlebot? Any tutorial available?

A:

amcl receives the integrated odometry information over the tf topic between base_link and odom and then computes the correction between the odom frame and the map frame as the odometry accumulates drift. 
Frames are defined in REP 105
