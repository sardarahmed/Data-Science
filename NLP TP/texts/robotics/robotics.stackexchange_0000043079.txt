Q:

Installation of PR2 simulation

i followed the instruction from:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/pr2_simulator/Tutorials/StartingPR2Simulation
after making the full installation of ros fuerte
and i got this error:
lab116@ubuntu:~$ rosmake pr2_gazebo [rosmake ] rosmake starting...         
[ rosmake ] Packages requested are:
['pr2_gazebo']                        
[ rosmake ] Logging to directory

[ rosmake ] Expanded args

[ rosmake ] **WARNING: The following
args could not be parsed as stacks or**
packages: ['pr2_gazebo'] [ rosmake ]
**ERROR: **No arguments could be parsed into valid package or stack names.****

i tried to install the pr2_gazebo:
lab116@ubuntu:~$ rosdep  install pr2_gazebo

ERROR: Rosdep cannot find all required
resources to answer your query Missing
resource pr2_gazebo ROS path
[0]=/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros ROS path
[1]=/opt/ros/fuerte/share ROS path
[2]=/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks

How do i install this pkg?

A:

Don't do a manual installation. It seems like you already installed ros from debian packages, so just install the debian package for the pr2 simulation:
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-pr2-simulator

There's no rosmake nor rosdep installed required. Just start the simulation with:
roslaunch pr2_gazebo pr2_empty_world.launch
