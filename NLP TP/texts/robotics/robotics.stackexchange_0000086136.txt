Q:

Error: for frame [base_laser_link]: Fixed Frame[] does not exist

When I was fellowing the tutorial in http://wiki.ros.org/laser_pipeline/Tutorials/IntroductionToWorkingWithLaserScannerData, I got some problem with Visualizing Your Laser Scan. I played back the bag Mapping1.bag, laser is publishing on /base_scan. When I run rviz, I do not know what to fill in fixed frame. I tried a lot of frame, but still got the error.
