Q:

Nodelet service failed on symbol lookup

I am getting a symbol mapping error on a nodelet I am trying to create/call.  Thank you for taking time to look at this issue. Please note this is my own nodelet not the same as the zed_ros_wrapper which is not a nodelet.
Note the additional "/" in the so path. See "lib//" in error msg after : system lookup error. Is this the issue?
[ INFO] [1454774540.899541309]: Loading nodelet /camera/zed_ros_wrapper_nodelet of type zed_ros_wrapper/ZedWrapperNodelet to manager standalone_nodelet with the following remappings:

A:

According to the nm documentation, the U at the beginning of the line means that symbol is undefined.
_ZN15zed_ros_wrapper17ZedWrapperNodeletC1Ev  is a mangled C++ name, so I put it through c++filt to get the actual function name for the undefined symbol: zed_ros_wrapper::ZedWrapperNodelet::ZedWrapperNodelet()
It looks like you haven't implemented the no-argument constructor for your nodelet.
