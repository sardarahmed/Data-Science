Q:

Start ROS node as root

Hi
I have a Raspberry Pi with ROS running and I need to start two ROS nodes when the device starts. The problem is that one of the nodes must be started as root because one library needs this. I tried the start prefix in the roslaunch file but it didnâ€™t worked. Is there any easy way to start the node as root?!
Best regards
Harald
