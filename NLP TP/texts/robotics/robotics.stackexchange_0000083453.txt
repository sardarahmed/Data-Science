Q:

How to change the ROS_DISTRO variable?

I had hydro installed on my raspberry pi earlier, then i removed it to install kinetic, everything seemed to be fine except the ROS_DISTRO variable. I tried the .bashrc rile there was no mention of hydro so i tried logging in and out but still no luck i also tried the export ROS_DISTRO command that didnt work either. sorry if this is a easy answer im new to ros. any help you could give would be awesome!
Thanks for you reply, I looked through the .bashrc and the only thing there is source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash line.
`# ~/.bashrc: executed by bash(1) for non-login shells.

      *) return;;
esac

Did you copy-paste your .bashrc twice?
Comment by pacifickid9 on 2017-10-21:
yes i think i did. just fixed it!

A:

It's essentially just an environment variable, so an export ROS_DISTRO=... should work.
But: you shouldn't (need to) change it, as it's automatically set by the setup.bash scripts that are in the root of the ROS install directory.
It would be best if you can try to find out why that variable is being set (ie: by which file).
Looking through your .bashrc is indeed a good idea. Check for lines starting with source /opt/... or source /some/path/in/hour/home_dir. It could also be that you have a line already that sets the variable. Look for export ROS_DISTRO=....
Whatever you do, it's infinitely better to figure out where that variable is getting set than to try and change its value manually.

I had hydro installed on my raspberry pi earlier, then i removed it to install kinetic, everything seemed to be fine except the ROS_DISTRO variable.

Just to make sure:

what OS is this (Debian?)
you "had hydro" before, now Kinetic: Hydro and Kinetic do not have overlapping install targets: did you upgrade your OS for that?
how did you install ROS? Seeing as you have a RPi: from sources? Or .debs?

cat /etc/os-release gave me VERSION="8 (jessie)" and ID_LIKE=debian so im not sure which im running. maybe that is my problem. and i followed the process in this tutorial to install kinetic: http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Installing%20ROS%20Kinetic%20on%20the%20Raspberry%20Pi
Comment by pacifickid9 on 2017-10-21:
and i used this tutorial to install hydro http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Setting%20up%20Hydro%20on%20RaspberryPi does this help at all? i dont believe that i upgraded any OS
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-10-21:
So you build from sources both times? Did you reuse the same catkin_ws for that? And did you build everything in a 'clean' terminal (ie: your Hydro workspace was not sourced)?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-10-21:
Can you tell us what the value is of ROS_DISTRO in /opt/ros/kinetic/etc/catkin/profile.d/10.ros.sh?
It's set near the top of the file.
