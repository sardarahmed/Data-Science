Q:

Android_Core MasterChooser Java Invalid Syntax Error

I am using the basic masterchooser built into the android rosjava_core and I am struggling to connect the robot to my phone. I receive this error:
Caused by: java.net.URISyntaxException: Illegal character in authority at index 7: http://192.168.137.118 :51762/
I have set the ip in the master chooser as http://192.168.137.118:11311 and additionally have set the
ip in the android hosts file but it still does not work.  I am using the code from an open github repo that uses the base code https://github.com/ollide/rosjava_android_template
Any help is appreciated, thank you. The robot is using ROS jade.

I am unsure why this port is showing up if I am honest, I am not sure what part of the source code for the master chooser is adding that port into the url.

Hmm the URI contains both the protocol (http), the IP address or host, and the port; all of that is entered by the user manually in the master chooser.
Try using pubsub tutorial as an example.

A:

Caused by: java.net.URISyntaxException: Illegal character in authority at index 7: http://192.168.137.118 :51762/ --> there's a space between the address and the port; what about that?
