Run rosrun rqt_logger_level rqt_logger_level and play around with the different loggers and logger levels for rviz and see if that tells you anything.

Hey Jayess I am not seeing rviz listed when running  rosrun rqt_logger_level rqt_logger_level

The node name should be something along the lines of /rviz_1500579339612988311.

And nothing gets output to the terminal when you run rosrun rviz rviz?

As with all RViz questions: please tell us whether you're running Linux/ROS in a VM, which OS this is, whether you have drivers installed for your 3D hardware, etc, etc.
Please update your original question. Comments are not meant for that.

A:

If running apt install is all you did to install ROS and you haven't setup your environment things won't likely work right. Have you followed the installation tutorial?
