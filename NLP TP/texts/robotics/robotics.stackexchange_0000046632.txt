Q:

Problem Building camera_calibration_parsers - where is yaml-cpp/yaml.h?

Hi,
Updated my version of ROS - and I'm getting a build error in camera_calibration_parsers.
Anyone any idea where yaml.h is? as in the error message:
~/ros/image_common/camera_calibration_parsers/src/parse_yml.cpp:3:27: fatal error: yaml-cpp/yaml.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.

Most other packages are building without issue
Many Thanks
Mark
