Q:

rosbag playback speed

Hi all,
We have some sensor data that are saved as .csv files (data+timestamp) from a robot, which does not run ROS. To run some algorithms, I converted once such file into a ROS bag file using a python script.
After setting the /use_sim_time parameter and when playback this bag file with rosbag play --clock abc.bag, all the data seems to be flushed at once.
I need to know what determines the natural play speed of a bag file. I thought it is done using the header.stamp
Thank you in advance
CS

A:

In your Python script, I guess you were using Bag.write. Did you specify the t parameter and set it to the correct time stamp? As far as I know, that's the parameter that controls playback speed.
The system cannot use header.stamp for a simple reason: not every message has a stamp but rosbag needs time information. Also, the C++ rosbag library uses the raw (serialized) message data blobs to store them in the file. There is just no way to access the header without knowing the exact message definition.
