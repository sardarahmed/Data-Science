Q:

record kinect bag file, reconstruct disparity topic

Hi,
I have followed following tutorial [0] to record Kinect data efficiently. It reconstructs the /camera/depth_registered/points topic properly but I also need the topic /camera/depth_registered/disparity. Is it possible to reconstruct this topic from the raw topics, or do I have to record it explicitly?
Cheers,
Oier

A:

you can edit the launch file openni.launch by yourself, and remap the topic name you like
