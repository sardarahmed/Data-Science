Q:

openni_tracker displaying pointcloud and skeleton alignment?

I have openni_tracker working. However, I am not sure how I can visualize both point cloud from Kinect as well as the skeleton TF data.
I can visualize Kinect point cloud by setting fixed frame to /camera_link
And I can visualize TF skeleton data by setting fixed frame to /openni_depth_frame.
When I visualize TF data, there is no connection between point cloud related TF and skelecton related TF data. Am I doing something wrong?
How could I align these together?

A:

The easiest solution would be to launch the openni_launch with the camera argument set.  See the documentation at the bottom of this page.  So the following command
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch camera:=openni

will set the first word of all of the frames associated with your Kinect to be "openni" instead of "camera". This should merge your tf tree.

@jarvisschultz would you recommend openni_tracker for people detection?? Or do you know ay good stack that would acommplish people detection? Thanks

@ctguell if all you wanted to do was detect people, you could use openni_tracker, but it might be a bit overkill. If you still wanted to use a depth camera, maybe you could adapt openni_tracker a bit e.g. see the User_NewUser callback in the openni_tracker source.

As of 1.7, PCL now has pretty good people detection built in, if that's really what you want (as opposed to human pose estimation). Have a look at this tutorial: http://www.pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/ground_based_rgbd_people_detection.php
