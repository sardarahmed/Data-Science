Q:

How to write a tf publisher for laser scanning

Hey,
I got a question regarding the tf publisher. I try to visualize my Hokuyo laserdata in Rviz. I dont have a robot yet or something, the Hokuyo is just standing on the desk :)
So I wrote a little publisher for the Hokuyo to publish the laser data and now I want to visualize them in rviz. But for now Rviz is complaining about Global Status: Fixed Frame "Fixed frame...does not exist" and so on. So my approach is to write a publisher so I can just select my frame from the laserscanner from the dropdown menu in Rviz. But for now I cant just write a publisher using this tutorial TF Tutorials. I maybe just don't get or understand it :) But I hope someone of you can help me.

Just an answer by myself. There is no need to write a tf publisher just to view the laser data in rviz. Just start (in this case) the urg_node with rosrun urg_node urg_node _ip_address:="192.168.0.10" and start rviz with rosrun rviz rviz after this select in rviz as global frame /laser (or just type it in) than add a new display with laserscan and the topic /laser. here you go and watch your data.
