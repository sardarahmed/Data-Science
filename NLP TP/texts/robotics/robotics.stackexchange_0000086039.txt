Q:

catkin_make vs catkin_make_isolated

What are non catkin packages? Are all orocos-toolchain related packages non catkin? i.e if i make a package using orocos-toolchain libraries and ros,  than do i have to only use catkin_make_isolated --install command to build package ?
and also what is difference between isolated and non isolated workspace? I was looking at this page for this but couldn't get preoperly.

You should edit this question or break it into several different ones. You have at least four different questions here...

A:

What are non catkin packages?

Software that does not use the Catkin CMake infrastructure in its build scripts, but plain CMake or even something else.
As to the rest of your questions: these are all strictly OROCOS questions. You haven't tagged your question with orocos, so the OROCOS devs -- if any of them watch this forum -- may not be aware of your question.
I would recommend to follow @jayess' advice and split up your question into four separate ones and tag them appropriately.
Do please make sure that they haven't already been answered. I expect that especially the catkin ones have received quite some attention in the past already.
