Q:

Gmapping with V-REP

Hello,
I'm doing a course project whose goal is to build a SLAM simulation with ROS and V-REP.
I'm new to ROS and V-REP and I'd like some help from you guys.
Here is what I did:

I created a scene with a p3dx robot in V-REP.
I publish Twist message on ROS to control the motion of the robot in V-REP.
V-REP is publishing 3 frames to ROS:
"odom": the fixed world coordinate;
"base_link": the robot coordinate;
"laser": the laser sensor coordinate.
Also, V-REP is publishing laserScan data as well.
I run gmapping node, subscribing to the LaserScan data.
I run RVIZ and changed the fixed frame to /map, so that I can visualize the ongoing mapping while the robot moves in V-REP.

Here comes the question, I'm getting a error message for the global state in RVIZ:
"Fixed Frame [map] does not exist"
How should i fix this?
I assume that I need to define a new frame corresponding to "map" but how am I supposed to do it? Just create a new coordinate and add a tf between "map" and "odom"?

A:

Hi,
You will have to create a new frame called map. So that all your map data is attached to that transform frame.
Have you had a look at this ros tutorial?
It shows you how to add a frame in c++. If you are using Python look at this tutorial
Hope this helps!
