Q:

Dynamic reconfigure of costmaps

Hello everyone!
I have a mobile robot in Gazebo with defined dimensions, whose task is to pick-up tables and to transport them to other locations. I am using move_base for path planning and navigation. The robot is navigating properly when there is no load on him, but fails to avoid obstacles when there is a table on it. Obviously, it is because dimensions of tables are not taken into account of costmaps during navigation. The question is following: is there any possibility to dynamically reconfigure or recompute my costmaps during robot motion on move_base?
My first thought was to two parallel running move_base nodes each taking control after some command, but I am not sure if this is even possible, going to try it soon, but any other/better solutions are very appreciated!

A:

You can always increase the inflation layer in you costmap params config files. You can also use dynamic reconfigure to change the inflation value on the run.

Also you can change the value in your code and update the inflation parameter. This [question](http://answers.ros.org/question/12276/is-there-a-c-api-for-a-dynamic-reconfigure-client/) tackles that problem.

in addition to changing the inflation radius, you will likely want to change the robot radius / footprint in the general costmap namespace. https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/blob/melodic-devel/costmap_2d/cfg/Costmap2D.cfg#L20
