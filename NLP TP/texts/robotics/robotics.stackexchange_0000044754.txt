Q:

UWSim, Ubuntu 12.04, ros-fuerte installation problem

Hello,
I am trying to install UWSim in Ubuntu 12.04 with fuerte installed. I checked out the repository from here
svn checkout http://uji-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/underwater_simulation underwater_simulation

I then run:
rosdep install UWSim

The outcome of this is:
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
UWSim: No definition of [libopenscenegraph] for OS version [precise]

I have tried several things but nothing seems to work. I even installed libopenscenegraph (and dependencies) from the synaptic but nothing.
When I had a look at the rosdep.yaml file there was no reference to the precise distro (the latest was oneiric). Still despite the fact that I added it myself nothing changed. Any ideas on what is going on?
Thank you in advance for your reply.
P.S I also tried Ubuntu 10.04 and electric and it worked just fine. (The simulator is up and running) But I need 12.04 and fuerte.

A:

Hi, the rosdep rule for libopenscenegraph under precise was missing (we are still in oneiric). I've checked that someone just added it, so you shouldn't get this error now (after doing a 'rosdep update').
