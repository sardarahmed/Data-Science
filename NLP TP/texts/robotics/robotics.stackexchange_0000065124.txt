Q:

roslibjs connection refused

Hi, was going through the tutorial for rosibsjs and tried to create my own websocket connection to my robot. However while opening the connection on my chomre browser, I was given a net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSEDerror
Does anyone know what may be the cause?
Thanks

Can you post a code sample somewhere?

A:

Hey the problem was resolved. The issue was because the websocket was not started on the robot's end. Silly mistake on my part ^^"
