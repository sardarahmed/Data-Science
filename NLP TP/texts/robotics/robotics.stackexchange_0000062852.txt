Q:

perspective or projection matrix

Hey!
Is there any node/pkg that already implemented the mono camera perspective matrix calculation?
I have a mono camera mounted on a fixed place and I would like to get the projection matrix. I know the camera calibration node and I thought there is something similar for this task.

You will need some assumptions to compute the projection matrix from a mono camera, like some known calibration pattern. What are your assumptions ?

I'm going to do dhte calibration too. I know that I need the intrinsic parameters in order to get the correct perspective matrix. But is there any ready to use node for perspective matrix calculation if I supply the camera calibration files?

A:

Sounds like you want to use the image_geometry package. It contains convenience functionality for working with standard ROS camera models (initialized from a CameraInfo message). Specifically, the PinholeCameraModel::fullProjectionMatrix and PinholeCameraModel::projectPixelTo3dRay methods sound like what youÂ´re looking for. See also the associated tutorial for info on how to initialize things from a CameraInfo in a node.
