Q:

How to upgrade iRobot create_2 firmware to 3.2.6

The create_autonomy github readme indicates that the Create 2 (firmware >= 3.2.6). Been googling and contacted iRobot twice, still unable to figure how to upgrade firmware to 3.2.6. Any help in this matter will be deeply appreciated.

A:

I've contacted iRobot in the past and at the time firmware version 3.2.6 was considered old, containing a few bugs. But the known bugs are not critical and should not affect the operation of create_autonomy. They were reluctant to help me upgrade the firmware unless it was absolutely necessary. I believe it may involve them sending you a proprietary USB device to facilitate the upgrade. Have you confirmed that your robot has firmware version lower than 3.2.6? Chances are it is of equivalent version or greater if you purchased the robot within the last two years.

Thank you for the prompt reply. After some more googling, found references to a device called an OSMO, which apparently can be used to upgrade firmware. Have not found method to determine firmware version, would appreciate knowing how to do this, if you can help.

I think you can use a serial communication tool (like cutecom), open a connection with the robot, and send the reset signal (hex value 07). There should be some startup message with firmware verison if I remember correctly.
