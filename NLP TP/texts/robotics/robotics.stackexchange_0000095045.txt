Q:

HectorSLAM implementation on Melodic

Hi I am semi-new to ROS and am  trying to run the tutorial.launch file in hectorSLAM and Iâ€™ve hit a roadblock and keep getting an error when I try to run the tutorial.launch.
I cloned HectorSLAM for melodic from https://github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/hector_slam
I am running Ubuntu 18.04.4 and ROS melodic.
The launch file is located in ~/a_ws/src/hector_slam/hector_slam_launch/launch and I run:

administrator@administrator-OptiPlex-3010:~/a_ws/src/hector_slam/hector_slam_launch/launch$ roslaunch tutorial.launch

I then get the following error:
RLException: Invalid <arg> tag: hector_geotiff 
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/melodic/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/home/administrator/a_ws/src
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/melodic/share
Argxml is <arg default="$(find hector_geotiff)/maps" name="geotiff_map_file_path"/>
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

I have tried to launch the file multiple times and sometimes I get the error:
RLException: Invalid <arg> tag: hector_geotiff 
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/melodic/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/opt/ros/melodic/share
Argxml is <arg default="$(find hector_geotiff)/maps" name="geotiff_map_file_path"/>
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

I have set roscd as ~a_ws/devel and the HectorSLAM package has the hector_geotiff package in it
any help fixing this error would be greatly appreciated.

A:

Have you installed hector_geotiff with sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-hector-geotiff?
Do you have this folder: /opt/ros/melodic/share/hector_geotiff if you have already installed?
Have you tried to launch without changing roscd from ~ just typing roslaunch hector_slam_launch tutorial.launch?
