Q:

Problem on running TurtleBot

Hi All,
I am currently install ROS Kinetic and try to run  a robot on the Stage Simulator. I installed TurtleBot and run the following command:
roslaunch turtlebot_stage turtlebot_in_stage.launch
But I got this error:
while processing /opt/ros/kinetic/share/turtlebot_navigation/launch/includes/amcl.launch.xml:
Invalid roslaunch XML syntax: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: u'/opt/ros/kinetic/share/turtlebot_navigation/launch/includes/amcl.launch.xml'
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file
Can any body help me what I missed to do and how can I solve this issue!!!!!

Gotcha! use $roscd turtlebox_stage and then cd to launch, use $sudo gedit to edit the .launch file
