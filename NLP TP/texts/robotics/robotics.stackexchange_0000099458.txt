Q:

Does ros catkin build tool supports the target_compile_options

I am trying to generate the LLVM bitcode for the ROS package. Tried to used the target_compile_options in the CMakeList.txt but it not emitting the llvm bitcode.
Is this option supported or not in the catkin build tool.
Note : Also as per the http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/CMakeLists.txt the option is not supported. Just wanted to confirm regarding this.

A:

Catkin does not replace CMake.
Catkin only drives CMake (ie: starts it at the right moment).
So whatever the CMake version you use supports, you can use in CMakeLists.txt.
Catkin does not change anything there.

Note : Also as per the http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/CMakeLists.txt the option is not supported.

that page documents how the Catkin-contributed CMake macros should be used.
It does not say anything about whether or not certain CMake functionality is supported or not.
To make it extra clear: Catkin does not interpret nor execute your CMakeLists.txt. That's CMake's job. Catkin just starts CMake.
