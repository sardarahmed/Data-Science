Hi Maurizio,
You need active the "soft_yoystick" in the argument of the sim.launch, so do:
roslaunch simulated_quadrotor sim.launch dummy_joystick:=false soft_joystick:=true
(or change de defaults values)
CAUTION: You need the version 0.1.0 of the starmac pakage, so you don't make "$ hg update -r version-0.0.1" in the installation. After that, you'll be able see a joystick in your monitor. I hope that works!!
I think that the starmac package doesn't work directly in Gazebo. But I am not sure, sorry.
