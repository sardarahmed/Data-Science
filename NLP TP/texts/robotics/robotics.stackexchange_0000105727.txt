Q:

Best Protocol for Wireless "Instantaneous" Servo Control?

My goal is to have a servo that can be controlled by a mouse "instantaneously", aka as fast as a racing video game cursor or limited by the speed of the servo itself.
So far, I have tried Bluetooth Low Energe (BLE), and I can get about 150ms "in practice" because I can't set the connection interval with the library I am using ("In the Hand BLE" for .NET). However the theoretical limit seems to be 7.5ms (according to this article).
With that said my questions are these:

Is the theoretical 7.5ms speed for BLE "realistic" or am I better off using legacy Bluetooth or Wifi?
If neither, is there something else I should be using for quickly sending wireless signals to the microcontroller controlling the
servo? I.e. is this "solved" with some standard solution? I am using a Meadow F7 to receive the signal and a .NET core app to send it, but I can easily switch to Arduino / Pi / Python / whatever.

A:

This question is not specific enough to get accurate answers.
Wifi has no guaranteed latency, e.g. this post mentions as a typical wifi latency a 50 percentile less than 4,5 ms, but worst case up to 1 second. It depends on your application whether that is acceptable or not.
There exist solutions for deterministic wireless communication, e.g. IO-Link wireless solution offers low latency of 5ms and synchronization rates of 10 microseconds, for up to 40 nodes (sensors or actuators). But this obviously comes at a higher cost than a wifi router.
