Q:

Get the coordinates of skeleton data using NITE skeleton tracker

I am able to track skeletons with a kinect. After running the command roslaunch skeleton_markers markers.launch it opens the Nite Skeleton tracker and I am able to track the skeletons. I want to ask if there is a way for me to get the coordinate data of the each joint that I have been able to track and if there is a way I would like to ask how to do it.

Hey can you tell how you got skeletal tracking working? did you use nite 2 with libfreenect2?on ros indigo?

A:

The skeleton joints are published as a set of transform. You have to use a TransformListener object and then track the joint frame: head, neck, torso and so on...

@rastaxe Thank you for the answer. I tried following instruction from this link http://wiki.ros.org/tf/Tutorials/Introduction%20to%20tf  to understand how to use a transform but I am still not able to get it. I wanted to ask if you can explain  to me how to use a transform with skeleton_markers
