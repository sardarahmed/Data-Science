Q:

what is the difference between a voltage source and current source?

I know,this question is irrelevant.But,while working suddenly this question came through my head..my point is there should not be any difference between a voltage source and a current source.cause,these two are dependent on each other.if there is a  potential difference then,there will be a current flow...similarly,if there is a flow of current then there must be a voltage difference....isn't it?
please,make the topic clear.....

A:

You are correct in that they are related, via Ohm's law:
$$
V = IR \\
$$
The difference is in what gets regulated. A voltage source will keep supply voltage at a constant level by altering the current that is supplied. If the effective (Thevenin) resistance goes down, then the applied current must go up to keep the supplied voltage constant.
Similarly, if you rearrange Ohm's law to look at the supplied current:
$$
I = V/R \\
$$
You can see that, for a current source, if the effective resistance goes down, the applied voltage must also go down in order to keep the supplied current constant.
