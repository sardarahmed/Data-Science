Q:

P2OS Debian Release: Travis Build Failing

Still having issues with this whole packaging for release thing...
rosdistro: DEBUG: Load package.xml file from url "https://raw.github.com/ros-gbp/p2os-release/release/groovy/p2os_driver1.0.0/package.xml"
rosdistro: DEBUG: - failed (HTTP Error 404: Not Found), trying "https://raw.github.com/ros-gbp/p2os-release/release/groovy/p2os_driver1.0.0/package.xml"

rosdistro: DEBUG: Could not shallow clone repository "https://github.com/ros-gbp/p2os-release.git"

As is plainly seen, the p2os-release repository does not exist on ros-gdp... How do I go about packaging it with my repository? Do I need to contact someone to get it added to ros-gdp?

This is the change I am trying to merge with the groovy release.yaml:
  p2os:
    packages:
      p2os_driver:
      p2os_launch:
      p2os_teleop:
      p2os_urdf:   
    tags:
      release: release/groovy/{package}{upstream_version}
    url: https://github.com/ros-gbp/p2os-release.git
    version: 1.0.0

Is this correct?

A:

I had to set up a separate repository for the code. It wasn't going to work on someone else's repository. Stupid mistake I guess...
