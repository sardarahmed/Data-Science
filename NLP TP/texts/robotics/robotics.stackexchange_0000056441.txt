Q:

Recover from wstool init failure

I'm following the Installation/Source and ran the following command:
wstool init -j8 src hydro-desktop-wet.rosinstall

turtlesim failed to downloads so I stopped the command when running it again:
wstool init -j8 src hydro-desktop-full-wet.rosinstall

I get the following:
Error: There already is a workspace config file .rosinstall at "src". Use wstool install/modify.

How do I proceed?  I want to be able to run the command again, have it download what's missing (hopefully just turtlesim) and continue on.  This should be documented on the wiki.

A:

Same happened to me, run:

wstool update -j 4 -t src

and it will continue downloading. Hope it works!

I've seen this asked frequently enough that I added your solution to the source install wiki page: http://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Installation/Source

Thanks!  Can you also add a section on keeping a source install up to date?

Unfortunately, I don't have enough experience with source installations to write that documentation. @dirk-thomas @william or @kruset are probably better candidates for that.

@ahendrix it is covered here: http://answers.ros.org/question/109656/maintaining-a-ros-source-install-add-packages-update-release/?answer=110961#post-id-110961
@jkolb You commented on the answer above, and declined to fill out a wiki page. I would do it but we are in the middle of a rather big update to the ROS infrastructure. For now I don't have time to do it.

Ok; I will update the wiki based on those instructions.

Wiki updated.
