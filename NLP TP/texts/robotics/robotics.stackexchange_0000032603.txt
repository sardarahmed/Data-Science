Q:

Cache Access from Message_Filter

In the message_filter package, there is a cache function that allows you to store data for a temporary amount of time.  How would you access this cache properly?  I understand that the function in message_filter says for doing a callback but how would go and create this callback function for the cache.  I want to access different parts of the cache.

A:

I think you are looking for that function:
std::vector< MConstPtr > getInterval (const ros::Time &start, const ros::Time &end) const
The callback is for new messages. I guess it's just there because it is a filter.
