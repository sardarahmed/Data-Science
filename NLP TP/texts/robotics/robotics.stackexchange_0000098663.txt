Q:

What is the best way to synchronize messages?

I wrote a script with two subscribers. The general way to do this is of course
subN = rospy.Subscriber("topicN", TypeN,CallbackN)

so I have two callbacks: Callback1 for topic1 and Callback2 for topic2
However my objective is to use the information of  both these topics to generate (and publish) another message.
I am wondering how should I proceed to use both of these messages? Where should I put the code? In a third callback function? How can I synchronize receiving these two messages?

@Kansai: I'm trying to figure out what leads people to post new questions on topics already discussed on ROS Answers. There are many duplicates of your question (and of @Rufus answer).
Could you write a bit about how you approached posting here? Did you search before you posted? If so: how did you search? With which tools? If not: why not? If you did search, and did find previous Q&As: did those not answer your question? Could you describe why not?

A:

You can use a message_filter for this.  If you want to synchronize by time, you can use the TimeSynchronizer or ApproximateTimeSynchronizer.

Thanks! I found this http://wiki.ros.org/message_filters

Mmmm. I tried the example in the link and eventhough both topics are publishing (I checked this) the callback function is not being called. then I found this https://answers.ros.org/question/172676/solved-problem-with-ros-message-filters/
