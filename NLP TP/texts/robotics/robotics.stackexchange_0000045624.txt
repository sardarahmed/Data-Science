Q:

Is the Schunk powerball package working? Always get an error

Hi,
I am trying to get my powerball up and running with a Peak USB to Can module.
But when I want to start the modules, I always get this error:
initstring = PCAN:/dev/pcan32,500000
PCanDevice successfully opened on /dev/pcan32
Initializing pcan device ...
PcanDevice, init ok
[ INFO] [1352452510.964341600]: ...initializing powercubes not successful. error:         
Could not reset module 5, m5api error code: -207

Can someone tell me if this package is working or what I am doing wrong?

A:

The communication of the new SCHUNK Powerball LWA 4.6 arm is based on CANOpen. The old m5api (Schunk Motion Protocol 5) is not supported!
There is a very new canopen package ipa_canopen. I've got the test commands running (ipa_canopen_core/tools/move_device) - still need to configure the rospackage for the SCHUNK arm. Device IDs are 3/4 (Cube1) 5/6 (Cube2), 7/8 (Cube3) and 12 for the Gripper (using WSG-50). The ipa_canopen package only supports PCAN (PEAK CAN) devices at the moment (we use a pcan-usb-can adapter).
Hope this helps.

I was told that the ROS wrapper should be available in the next days.
