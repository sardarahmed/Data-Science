you can also edit the rplidar.launch file to change the topic name to suit your need.

@chrissunny94 It's not a good idea to edit other packages' source (including launch files). If/when the package is updated then the modified source is gone. @Delb's answer is correct, modify your own source, which is under your control.

A:

Have you changed the launch file / rplidar_node? It's normally set to publish on scan.
You can remap the topics with the tag <remap> in your launch file :
<remap from="base_scan" to="scan"/>
