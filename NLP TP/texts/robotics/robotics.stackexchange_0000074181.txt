Q:

3D Camera Selection

For an robotic application which requires 24/7 working in an indoor environment
picking up boxes ( after recognizing using the camera application),
loading the boxes,
drop them at the defined location.
I am looking for an industrial camera solution, initially I decided to go for Sick 3Vistor-T (TOF) before I start with this I want to be sure.
Any suggestions which will be an appropriate solution here in this case ?

Perhaps interesting: 3D Camera Survey on the ROS-Industrial blog.

A:

How large are your boxes? The resolution of the 3vistor is only 144 x 176 according to the data sheet so that it's rather for big objects. I'd prefer a structured light sensor, like the ensenso from IDS: http://www.ensenso.com/?lang=de. The resolution and accuracy is higher so that it imho fits better to your task.

How much this IDS sensor cost ?

This should be doable with the 3vistor. Price depends on your needed resolution (N10 or N30), price is similar to the Sick, just ask for a quote: https://en.ids-imaging.com/ensenso-stereo-3d-camera.html
