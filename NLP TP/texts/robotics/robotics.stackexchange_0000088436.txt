Q:

ros_android load plugins for move_base

concerning this tutorial: android_ndk_pluginlib
i set up my android robot with ros_android and everything is working so far including amcl.
But i cant get the plugins to work. The plugins i need are base_local_planner/TrajectoryPlannerROS costmap2d/inflationlayer
obstacle layer and  static_layer.
Usually i would load them by setting the according Parameters in the XML and YAML files like this:
- {name: static_layer, type: 'costmap_2d::StaticLayer'}
- {name: obstacle_layer, type: 'costmap_2d::ObstacleLayer'}
- {name: inflation_layer, type: 'costmap_2d::InflationLayer'}

but with ros_android i dont have that option.
To set the parameters i use:
        ParameterTree params = connectedNode.getParameterTree();
        params.set("move_base_node/global_costmap/plugins/name/inflation_layer", "costmap_2d/StaticLayer");

which doesn't seem to work.
In the android.mk file i have included
LOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES := libcostmap_2d libbase_local_planner libglobal_planner

any help would be very welcome.

Hi @manster2209,
I think I've answered that question in this post in ROS discourse. Please check out that answer; an example for the cross compiled navigation stack for Android is provided there.
Hope it helps!

Sure! Feel free to do so, or to open a new thread here in ROS answers (it may also help others that are facing the same problems). I regularly check for new questions if they are tagged with rosjava, android and / or related tags; I will respond as soon as possible.
