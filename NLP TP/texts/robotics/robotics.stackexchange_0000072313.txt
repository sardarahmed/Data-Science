Q:

Are there any real world rostest examples using parameters?

The last snippet at http://wiki.ros.org/rostest/Writing defines a parameter. However, I could not find any code I could test that show cases that this actually works.

A:

rostest basically uses roslaunch files (http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML). And in launch files you can specify parameters (http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML/param) as mentioned in your referenced wiki page.
I think you can safely assume that parameters from launch files get correctly set on the parameter server when you start them. Actually there are specifically tests which ensure such fundamental functionality doesn't regress (rostest launch file: https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/blob/indigo-devel/test/test_roslaunch/test/params_basic.test and the corresponding unit test: https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/blob/indigo-devel/test/test_roslaunch/test/params_basic.py) and they currently pass.

Thanks for your quick answer! I meanwhile identified launch-prefix to be the culprit: Nodes with a launch-prefix will attempt to connect to the default ros master (which might be running and lacking the parameters) instead of connecting to the custom ros master started by rostest,
