Q:

trouble building opencv on fc15

I'm trying to build desktop-full on an FC15 machine. After dealing with the boost/filesystem issues, opencv is giving me trouble now:

Any ideas?

What do you mean by "After dealing with the boost/filesystem issues"

A:

The solution was to add
#include <stddef.h>

above all the includes in modules/core/include/opencv2/core/core.hpp

There's a similar ticket at https://code.ros.org/trac/ros-pkg/ticket/5054

This shouldn't be necessary. I'd worry that solving this issue in that way would be masking the source problem. (Though I've no idea what the source problem would be)
