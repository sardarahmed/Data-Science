Q:

How can I publish commands to the UR10/UR5?

Using the arm_controller/command topic, how can I publish valid commands to the UR10/UR5? Is there a list of example commands to send.
I'm trying to follow https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot setup for controlling a univeral robot in gazebo. My goal is to move the UR arm in simulation using joint position commands published through the terminal window (rostopic pub /arm_controller/command trajectory_msgs/JointTrajectory). I'm able to launch the simulation following the repo's readme file. I'm not interested in using moveit or rviz to send commands.

I would suggest to add more information to your question: which driver are you using, how are you starting things, what configuration of the driver are you using, what is the type of arm_controller/command (we don't know), what is your goal (ie: pick-and-place, following a moving target, something else), etc, etc.
And link to whatever you refer to.
As-is, your question is too vague, and is hard to answer.

I've added more details, attached links, and specified what my goal once in the updated question

Please do not delete questions with answers.

A:

Refer to the folowing post: https://answers.ros.org/question/261081/cannot-create-trajectory-from-message-it-does-not-contain-the-expected-joints/
Answer deals with providing valid all joint names with the controller that the univeral robot manipulators use.
