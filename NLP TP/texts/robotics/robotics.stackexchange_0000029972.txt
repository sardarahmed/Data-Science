Q:

How do you remap a topic?

How to remap a topic name?

From a launch file?
From a bag file?

For example, I have a .bag file that publishes to a topic "foo" and I would like remap it to "bar", because another node expects the topic "bar".

A:

The remap tag lets you remap topics in launch files.

rosbag play is a node just like any other and its published topics can be remapped in the same way as any other node. For example, if I have a bag file publishing a laser scan on /base_scan, but I want it on /scan, I can do rosbag play my_bag.bag /base_scan:=/scan

I think it is also necessary for the previous and the new topic to publish message of the same type for remap to work.

Is it possible to do it on command line?
Comment by rfeistenauer on 2019-11-15:
rosbag play my_bag.bag /base_scan:=/scan should work

In case someone runs into the issue while running ROS2, just add the --remap flag before remapping.
Credit.
$ ros2 bag play my_bag2.db3 --remap /base_scan:=/scan
