Q:

ROSbridge in Hydro

Hi,
I have ROSbridge installed in fuerte. Now, since I have another package that needs to be run in Hydro,
I installed Hydro alongside with Fuerte.
The problem is, I used Labview-ROS toolkit by Clearpath and I know that it is not compatible with the
second version of ROSbridge in Hydro. So, how could I solve this with minimal effort. Redeveloping the program that
talks to the Rosbridge could take massive time, so I prefer to avoid this. =(
Would it be possible to rosbuild the ROSbridge version 1 in Hydro and keep on using Labview-ROS toolkit?
Worst case, I need to modify the client side to talk to the ROSbridge v2, but is it allow socket connection?
Thanks very much for any input.

Too keep the threads clean this seemed to be a duplicate of http://answers.ros.org/question/193909/rosbridge-v2-accept-socket-connection/. In terms of TCP, yes, rosbridge v2 does have a TCP version.

Sorry for the duplicate. I should have just editted the question. =)

A:

rosbridge v1 is deprecated and would not work on Hydro. Significant API changes occurred in Hydro preventing the Fuerte rosbridge v1 server to run in Hydro. The only viable solution is to re-implement the client-side program to use the new rosbridge v2 API calls.

I am still looking for the Rosbridge v2 documentation for socket connection. I may be able to build the client side. If you know where I can find it, please let me know. Thank you for the comment.
