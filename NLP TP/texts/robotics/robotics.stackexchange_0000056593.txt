Q:

source catkin_ws/src/setup.bash after each reboot?

Hi,
I use Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with ROS-groovy.
I followed the tutorial "InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment" on how to create a catkin workspace.
When I reboot my laptop I've to
source devel/setup.bash

to find packages in catkin_ws/src with the command
rospack find <package_name>

Clearly I'm doing something wrong or I'm misinformed.
I appreciate your help,
Matt

Sorry, I oversaw the "mark this answer as correct button" so I just voted it up. Now i fixed it.

A:

Could You be more specific on the system You're running, please?
In general case, after adding source path_to_your/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash to ~/.bashrc it should work automagically on each start-up or new terminal run. More on this topic: step 8
Another solution would be adding an alias for mentioned source call. Something like:
alias robot1_ws="source path_to_your/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash"
alias robot2_ws="source path_to_your/catkin_ws2/devel/setup.bash"
alias robot3_ws="source path_to_your/catkin_ws3/devel/setup.bash" 

in Your ~/.bash_aliases file. To source one of those workspaces You'd have only to type robot1_ws, robot2_ws or robot3_ws in the terminal.
