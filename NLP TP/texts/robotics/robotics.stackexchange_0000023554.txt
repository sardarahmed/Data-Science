Q:

How to install Gazebo to use along with ROS2 Humble Hawksbill on Ubuntu 22.04?

I have used ROS noetic before by installing the full desktop version which comes along with gazebo simulator and its plug-ins (gazebo_ros_pkgs) ready to use with ROS directly. Due to some requirements, I have to install ROS2 on Ubuntu 22.04 on a cloud/ virtual machine. I decided to move with ROS2 Humble Hawksbill because as per https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Releases.html, this release will be supported for a longer period of time compared to Foxy which will have its EOL next year. 
I followed all the installation instructions present on their official website and did the full install using sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop. Publisher/ subscriber, rviz, rqt etc. are working fine but I observed that gazebo did not come along with it.
I am having a tough time figuring out a way to install gazebo and make it work with ROS2 Humble Hawksbill on Ubuntu 22.04.
I tried going through https://classic.gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros2_installing&cat=connect_ros, https://gazebosim.org/docs/fortress/ros2_integration, and https://discourse.ros.org/t/ros-2-humble-hawksbill-released/25729 and observed that one website is saying something and another something else regarding ros2 and gazebo versions compatibility.
Any help in setting up gazebo (which version and how) in this scenario is highly appreciated.
Thanks in advance,
Dev

A:

Gazebo is part of desktop-full not the desktop variant.
You can use ros-humble-simulation as a convenient metapackage as well.
The metapackages are defined as variants in REP 2001 (Humble)
