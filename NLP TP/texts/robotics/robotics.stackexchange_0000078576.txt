Q:

Slow sync of ShadowRepo to Public

I've had several people lately ask when I'm going to release my package on Kinetic. I just realized that it's been a month and hasn't migrated from the Shadow Fixed to the Public one. How long does this migration usually take?

A:

It depends, and varies based on regressions and other considerations. Usually it happens once every couple of months. Normally if you start a discussion on the release section of discourse.ros.org you can get the ball moving sooner than normal:
https://discourse.ros.org/c/release
Looking at the status page:
http://repositories.ros.org/status_page/ros_kinetic_default.html?q=REGRESSION
There doesn't appear to be any regressions right now, so a sync should be possible.
