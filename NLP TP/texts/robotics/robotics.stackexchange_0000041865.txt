Q:

image_geometry Rectification -> remove black Pixels

Hi
I decided to do all Camera Stuff ith die image_geometry class provided by the opencv package.
Prior I rectified my camera image with:
getOptimalNewCameraMatrix
initUndistortRectifyMap
remap
This worked well, i could choose to show the black pixels at the edges or to cut an size the image so it only has valid pixels.
With image_geometry and the pinhole camera model class i don't see a way so rectify the image AND remove all regions with unvalid pixels.
Does someone know how?
THX

A:

It sounds like you just want to crop down the image to a certain Region of Interest.  This should be fairly straightforward to do by chaining together different pieces of the OpenCV library.
You probably already have an image with the Mat type.
You can then create a region of interest (ROI) using the () Operator
So, something like:
Mat myImage;
Mat croppedImage = myImage(Range(50,100), Range(50,100));

Or, you could use a "Rect"
Mat myImage;
Rect myROI = Rect(50,100,50,100);
Mat croppedImage = myImage(myROI);
