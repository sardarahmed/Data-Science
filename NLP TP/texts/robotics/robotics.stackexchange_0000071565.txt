Q:

pointcloud2 problem

I know that there are lots of question on his topic but after going through most of them i was not able to find solution for my problem

I am using stereo_image_proc for getting point cloud from stereo cam driver as i have provided below, i successfully gets both left and right camera output but i cant see pointcloud2 in rviz

I tried echoing the camera/point2 topic but the result seems weird[or is it ok ,I am new to these stuffs?]

is my output ok?if yes then what might be the reason i dont get pointcloud in rviz(I have tried rotating the window)

Edit: sorry after i again tried rotating i got the cloud but it seems weird

A:

The output is probably reasonable, as that is the array of uint8's that make up the images/point clouds. You can add the --noarr option to rostopic echo to get a more reasonable output.
