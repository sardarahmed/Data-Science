Q:

Convert geometry_ msgs/Pose to Point

Hey all!,
i got a Posestd::vector<geometry_msgs::Pose> waypoints and now i would like to transform it to geometry_msgs::Point.
I tried to convert it to Eigen and afterwards in Point. My first step would be something like:
std::vector<geometry_msgs::Pose> m;
m = waypoints;
Eigen::Affine3d e;
tf::poseMsgToEigen(m,e);

and i get an error: no matching function for call to poseMsgToEigen.
Do you have any suggestions ?
Greetings

A:

Hi Mutu,
A geometry_msgs::Pose actually contains a geometry_msgs::Point as you can read in the documentation.
to get the pose just type:
geometry_msgs::Point pt = waypoints[i].position;

for the index i that you want. Do note that you lose the orientation information that is also contained in the pose.
