Q:

Failed to create global_planner/GlobalPlanner

Hi, I have this error when trying to create a custom global planner.
[FATAL] [1577962056.484219920, 8.805000000]: Failed to create the test_planner/GlobalPlanner planner, are you sure it is properly registered and that the containing library is built? Exception: MultiLibraryClassLoader: Could not create object of class type test_planner::GlobalPlanner as no factory exists for it. Make sure that the library exists and was explicitly loaded through MultiLibraryClassLoader::loadLibrary()
I've followed the custom tutorial on the ros wiki exactly, and rospack outputs as expected. I'm running move_base in a custom environment, which runs fine with the normal move_base parameters, and with the carrot_planner and global_planner plugins.
<param name="base_global_planner" value="test_planner/GlobalPlanner"/> and other planner plugins - A star plugin and Relaxed a star - I've tried have all outputted the same error.
Does anyone know how to solve the error?
Thanks

This is the tutorial that I followed. I tried with the param value "global_planner/GlobalPlanner" as in the tutorial (PLUGINLIB_EXPORT_CLASS arguments and plugin description files were changed) but both versions don't work.

Yup, I am. Thanks for your help. I restarted the computer and the error is gone. Not too sure why that is but the planner is working as expected now.

Hi, have you solved this problem? I also meet it:(

A:

Are you launching on the same machine with the new package you've created on the path in the window you're launching in? I've found a simple source ~/.bashrc before you launch move_base sometimes solves problems.
