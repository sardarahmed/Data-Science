Q:

viso2 couldn't find mono_odometer node

I download viso2 and build using rosmake. There was no error.
However when I run it with following launch file.
<!-- example launch file for mono_odometer -->
<launch>
  <arg name="camera"/> <!-- camera must be set at launch -->
  <node name="image_proc" pkg="image_proc" type="image_proc" ns="$(arg camera)"/>
  <node name="mono_odometer" pkg="viso2_ros" type="mono_odometer" output="screen">
    <remap from="image" to="$(arg camera)/image_rect" />
    <param name="camera_height" value="0.5" /> <!-- cam is 0.5m above ground -->
    <param name="camera_pitch" value="0.0" /> <!-- cam is looking straight forward -->
  </node>
</launch>

It gave this error "ERROR: cannot launch node of type [viso2_ros/mono_odometer]: can't locate node [mono_odometer] in package [viso2_ros]"
How could I fix this problem ?

A:

First, check if the executable is there:
rosrun viso2_ros mono_odometer

This should give no error.
If the executable cannot be found it may be not compiled. If you are on a fuerte branch, use rosmake viso2_ros to compile the package. For the groovy branches, run catkin_make in your catkin workspace to compile the package.
Check if viso2_ros can be found by rospack: rospack find viso2_ros. If rospack cannot find the package, add the path to your environment variable ROS_PACKAGE_PATH or source the setup.bash of your <catkin_workspace>/devel directory.

There is no /bin/ folder after I run rosmake and viso2_ros was found by rospack find viso2_ros

Please post the full output of the command rosmake viso2_ros (e.g. via pastebin.com).

Which branch are you using? There seems to be a ROS_NOBUILD file in your viso2_ros which does not belong there. Note: if you are on the groovy or groovy-devel branch you have to use catkin instead of rospack to build the package.

Hmm....yes I'm on groovy, I'll try to use catkin then, Thank you very much

By the way, do you have any advice how to do this (use catkin to build a package) I don't have any experience doing this before

Please read http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment#Create_a_ROS_Workspace You'll have to put the viso2 repository in your catkin_ws/src directory.
