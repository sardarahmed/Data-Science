Q:

problem with rosmsg - tutorial

Greetings,
I am using the Indigo installation, with Ubuntu 14.04 in VirtualBox.
I am following the ROS tutorials and I am currently having problems with ros messages
I follow everything as described

Create a new message called Num.msg, under folder beginner_tutorials/msg.
Modify the CMakeLists.txt file as described.
Run catkin_make

Everything compiles beautifully. I then try to run
rosmsg show beginner_tutorials/Num

and I get a huge list of locations where ros was searching (unsuccesfully to locate the msg).
Then I run
rosmsg list

and I don't see my beginner_tutorials/Num in the list.
Am I missing something? How do I add my newly defined msg in the ros list of messages?
Thanks

A:

Did you source your workspace?
In your workspace there should be a devel directory containing a setup.bash try source setup.bash and then run your commands again.
Actually this setup.bash file tells ros where to look for messages, nodes, service, etc. and if you do not source it, it will not look in your workspace.

add that to your .bashrc file in your home folder so it will source everytime you open up a new terminal

that's a great idea

That is why it is stated in the tutorials :)

Indeed, even though the confusion comes from the fact that sourcing is not repeated in the rosmsg beginners tutorial. But, maybe this serves a purpose, now I know!
