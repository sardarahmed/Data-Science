Q:

Typical laser scanner noise values

I am building an application that executes graphSLAM using datasets recorded in a simulated environment. The dataset has been produced in MRPT using the GridMapNavSimul application. To simulate the laserScans one can issue the bearing and range error standard deviation of the range finder. 
Currently I am using a dataset recorded with range_noise = 0.30m, bearing_noise = 0.15deg. Am I exaggerating with these values? Could somebody provide me with typical values for these quantities? Do laser scanner manufacturers provide these values?
Thanks in advance,

A:

I think 0.3m noise is a bit exaggerated for a scanning laser rangefinder.
As you saw with the Hokuyo (which is one of the cheapest LIDARs you can get) they say that it is 0.03m range "error" (they do not explicitly state this is 2$\sigma$, but I have tested the noise profile myself and it is consistent with 2$\sigma$).
My experience with laser scanners is that the depth accuracy is very much a function of cost, while the angular accuracy is pretty small and is only a real problem when the lidar is used for around 10m+.
A URG04LX (\$1,300) that I've calibrated had range standard deviations that were  around $\sigma = 0.013m$ while a Velodyne HDL64E (>\$150,000) had around $\sigma=0.006m$. I can't remember the angular $\sigma$s but the data sheet says around 0.08 degrees (which I again assume is 3$\sigma$).
