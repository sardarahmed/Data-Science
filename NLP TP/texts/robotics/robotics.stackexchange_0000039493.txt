Q:

Running ROS in pure simulation

Hi,
I would assume ROS can run in pure simulation? I'm trying to build a SLAM map of simulated environment while navigating through it (with path planning and obstacle avoidance) using the simulated TurtleBot. However most of the TurtleBot tutorials assume you have the TurtleBot hardware.
FYI, I've already got the TurtleBot simulator working via:

roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_empty_world.launch

However I'm unsure how to:

calibrate the simulated TurtleBot
see the output of a simulated Kinect
see the output of SLAM (and ideally the particles in the particle filter)
see the output of the path planning
drive the robot around (or set way points)

FYI, I would of thought I could do (5) via

roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch

But it doesn't move the TurtleBot in the simulator - I assume its for the real hardware only?
Any ideas?

A:

If the simulation is working properly the answers to your questions should be:

You probably don't need this.

2-5. Exactly as in the real robot tutorials!
The commands you have posted for 5. work fine for me. Did you use the correct buttons in the focused terminal to control?
