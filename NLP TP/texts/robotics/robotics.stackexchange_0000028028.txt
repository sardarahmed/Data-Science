Q:

gazebo8 depends on libignition-math2 and libignition-math3, which conflict

I have installed gazebo 8 from the debs on Ubuntu 16.04. I'm getting an error that libignition-math2.so.2 is not found. When I try to install libignition-math2, apt tries to uninstall gazebo8 and the libignition-math3 libraries. I did try to install gazebo and ignition from source at one point, but I have already sudo make uninstall'ed those attempts. That stuff shouldn't affect what libraries the binary gazebo8 is trying to load though, right?

A:

The latest package should depend only on ignition-math3. Could you try uninstalling Gazebo and all dependencies which depend on ign-math, updating your database and installing again? Something like this:
sudo apt remove '.*gazebo.*' '.*sdformat.*' '.*ignition-.*'
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gazebo8

Let us know if the issue doesn't solve itself. Sorry for the trouble.

My specific problem (I think) was that there was a bunch of gazebo objects left in /usr/lib and other places from a bad source install. After I removed them, things worked again. Thanks for pointing me in the right direction though!
