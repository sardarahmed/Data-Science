Q:

cannot install at all (ubuntu 12.04 amd64)

So I've got a VM running Ubuntu 12.04.1 x86 on my laptop, and my desktop is running 12.04 amd64.
Installation on the VM went smooth.
No way of getting ROS Fuerte to install on the desktop though.
I updated the sources as per the installation tutorial, but when I get to the actual installation there are all sorts of unmet dependencies.
 sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-desktop-full

Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

Now I didn't do anything different on this machine, than I did on the VM.
So I can't understand where does all of this come from.
I hope somebody can help me.

as far as I can see, all the ROS sources are there.

Somehow I can't see my own answer.
Anyway: solution is to get rid of libboost 1.48.
ROS requires 1.46 and it can't be installed onto 1.48.

A:

Problem solved: I was using libboost 1.48.
ROS requires (hardwired dependencies) libboost 1.46.
So as apt-get was unable to resolve the conflict, it said it had unmet dependencies.
Solution: remove all 1.48 libboost packages, install ROS.

Why are groovy and hydro debians for Ubuntu 12.4 not compiled against boost 1.48? Ubuntu 12.4 comes both with boost 1.46 & 1.48, but 1.46 has some problems with c++11
