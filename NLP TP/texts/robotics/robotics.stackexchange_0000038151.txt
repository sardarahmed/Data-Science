Q:

turtlebot_simulator (no kinect data)

Hi,
when I run turtlebot simulation, there is no simulated Kinect. I'm sure that before some time it was working.
I'm using this command to run simulation:
roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_empty_world.launch
List of topics which are advertised:

/clock
/cmd_vel
/diagnostics
/diagnostics_agg
/gazebo/link_states
/gazebo/model_states
/gazebo/parameter_descriptions
/gazebo/parameter_updates
/gazebo/paused
/gazebo/set_link_state
/gazebo/set_model_state
/imu/data
/joint_states
/odom
/robot_pose_ekf/odom
/rosout
/rosout_agg
/scan
/tf
/turtlebot_node/sensor_state

During start-up there is just this info (from pointcloud_throttle, kinect_laser and kinect_laser_narrow nodes):

waitForService: Service [/openni_manager/load_nodelet] has not been advertised, waiting...

Thanks for any advice...

what version of turtlebot, turtlebot_simulator, and turtlebot_apps do you have installed?
Comment by John Hoare on 2012-02-23:
I have the latest installed from the repositories on ROS Electric on Ubuntu 11.10.
Comment by ZdenekM on 2012-02-23:
I have also installed latest from deb repos on ROS Electric and Ubuntu 11.04.

I pulled the latest from the package manager and everything is working correctly

A:

This is a bug in the gazebo.urdf.xacro file. The camera frame names were not correct and therefore the gazebo plugins couldn't initialize properly. It's fixed in 330:4253a4e5f257 . It's released in turtlebot 0.9.2
