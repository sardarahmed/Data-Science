Q:

actionlib tutorial inconsistency

The SimpleActionServer(ExecuteCallbackMethod) tutorial has a CMakeList.txt inconsistency for Catkin/Groovy.
At one place it says:

find_package(catkin REQUIRED
COMPONENTS actionlib_msgs) Note that
CMake needs to find_package only
actionlib_msgs (not message_generation
that is referenced implicitly by
actionlib_msgs).

Later it says:

find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS actionlib message_generation)

I assume the second one was not updated and the first example is correct. Please confirm.

You're right. The following should be correct. I updated the wiki. Thank you for reporting!
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS actionlib_msgs)
