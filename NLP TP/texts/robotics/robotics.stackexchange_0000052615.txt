Q:

ROS Installation on Fedora 19

I'm trying to install ROS Groovy on Fedora 19, following the instructions at wiki/groovy/Installation/Fedora. However, running the line

$ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro groovy -y

results in the following error:

ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
pcl: No definition of [libusb-1.0-dev] for OS version [schrödinger’s]

locate libusb- gives:

/usr/lib/libusb-0.1.so.4
/usr/lib/libusb-0.1.so.4.4.4
/usr/lib/libusb-1.0.so.0
/usr/lib/libusb-1.0.so.0.1.0
/usr/lib64/libusb-0.1.so.4
/usr/lib64/libusb-0.1.so.4.4.4
/usr/lib64/libusb-1.0.so.0
/usr/lib64/libusb-1.0.so.0.1.0

The problem was how to get the letter 'ö' readable in the yaml file because rosdep resolve is giving this error: ERROR: No definition of [libusb-1.0-dev] for OS version [schrödinger’s]. I solved this by changing the OS name in /etc/system-release to schrodinger and then editing the yaml file.

A:

You need to add rosdep rules for Fedora 19.  It's correctly detecting the OS correctly but the latest definition for libusb-1.0 is for spherical.  https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/blob/master/rosdep/base.yaml
How to submit changes is documented here: http://ros.org/doc/independent/api/rosdep/html/contributing_rules.html

You say that this doesn't work for you.  What did you do to try it? What errors did you get?

see above. basically, how can I get the 'ö' readable in the yaml file?

For the record, this is fixed in the latest release of rospkg: https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rospkg/pull/54
