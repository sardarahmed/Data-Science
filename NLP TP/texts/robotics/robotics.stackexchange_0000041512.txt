Q:

Cannot locate rosdep definition for [qt4]

I m trying to use Rgbdslam on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and ROS Fuerte however I am a beginner in ROS and I can't figure it out how to make that work.
I did tthe followings steps :

Installed  Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64bit version

Installed ROS Fuerte (sudo apt-get install ros-electric-fuerte-full)

echo "source /opt/ros/electric/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc

. ~/.bashrc

Installed QT Creator via Ubuntu Software Center

Setup RGBDSLAM again as per http://www.ros.org/wiki/rgbdslam

a. mkdir -p ~/ros
b. echo 'export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/ros:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
c. source ~/.bashrc
d. svn co http://alufr-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/rgbdslam_freiburg/rgbdslam
e. svn co https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/vslam/trunk/g2o ~/ros/g2o
f. rosdep install rgbdslam
And it failed directly :
alban:~/ros$ rosdep install rgbdslam
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
rgbdslam: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [qt4]

I suppose that I don't just have to install QT Creator, maybe I have to do some more stuff but I didn't success to find this information. Does anyone can help me ?
[ I ve tried also to install the advices following librairies :
"sudo apt-get install libglew1.5-dev libdevil-dev libsuitesparse-dev"
No problem
And when I type
alban:~/ros$ update-alternatives --display qmake

I get:
qmake - mode automatique
 le lien pointe actuellement sur /usr/bin/qmake-qt4
/usr/bin/qmake-qt4 - priorité 40
 lien secondaire qmake.1.gz : /usr/share/man/man1/qmake-qt4.1.gz
La « meilleure » version actuelle est « /usr/bin/qmake-qt4 ».

I tried to compile directly:

Did you installed Qt4 libraries? I do not know whether these gets installed as dependency packages for QT Creator! Check for correct version of Qt libraries.
Comment by Absy on 2012-06-20:
I think that I have installed QT4 libraries by doing this :
alban:~$ sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
libqt4-dev is already the newest version.
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgrad

A:

Probably, the rosdep definition for qt4 is not defined for fuerte yet. That's not a fatal error though. Just ignore the rosdep install step and continue with building the rgbdslam stack.
It seems to me that the stack hasn't been ported to Fuerte yet since the rosdep definition for qt4 is unknown. That means there is a certain chance that you will run into compile problems.
Edit: Running rgbdslam is not working because you got a build error. As I said, rgbdslam doesn't seem to be ported to Fuerte yet. I actually suggest using Electric for now. The reason for the actual error you see is that eigen is no ros package anymore but a system dependency. You can try removing the dependency on it from rgbdslam's manifest.xml file.
