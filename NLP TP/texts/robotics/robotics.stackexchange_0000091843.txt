Q:

Finding buffered frames in tf2_ros::Buffer (c++)

I am creating a post-processing utility where I read all the transforms from a .bag file into a tf2_ros::Buffer.
I would like to be able to ask the Buffer for all the frames it has cached.   I don't see any public member functions in the doccumentation that allow you to view cached frames.
What is the best way to access cached all the frames in a tf2_ros::Buffer?

I don't believe there is any support for that, but let's see if someone proves me wrong.

Edit: appears there are BufferCore::allFramesAsYAML() and BufferCore::_getFrameStrings(..). Would those suffice for what you are doing?

BufferCore::allFramesAsYAML() will probably do the trick.   I will report my findings after I do some more testing.

A:

There are two methods for introspecting the state of the bufffer.
allFramesAsString() and allFramesAsYaml(double)
