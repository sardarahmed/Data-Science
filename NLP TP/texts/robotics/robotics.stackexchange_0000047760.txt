Q:

Groovy unmet dependencies Ubuntu 12.04 Precise

I was trying to install groovy in ubuntu 12.04 and I have a problem with dependencies. I tried to install the dependencies separately and I had no success. I already visited the forum and tried this - answers.ros.org/question/52155/how-to-install-groovy-desktop-full-on-1204/ - but it's not working either. Any ideas?

$sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-desktop-full

E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
multiverse reps are allowed and the ros-latest.list's value is correct, with the precise repositories. So yes, I followed the steps of the installation, but it's not working

Didn't see those sentences at the end (hope the reformatting would make them clearer to others). What happens when you sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-ros-base?  If you're up for it, there's also http://www.howtoforge.com/checking-package-dependencies-with-apt-rdepends-on-debian-ubuntu

sorry for the delay, it install that package an dependencies but when I tried sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-desktop-full it continues with the same error message.
Comment by silgon on 2013-02-18:
tried "sudo apt-get update --fix-missing" , not working either
Comment by silgon on 2013-02-18:
when I do the command with aptitude install the error is
libfontconfig1-dev : Depends: libfontconfig1 (= 2.8.0-3ubuntu9.1) but 2.10.1-0ubuntu3 is to be installed

I had this when I accidentally had the 12.10 repo in ros-latest.list when I should have had the 12.04 "precise" source.  It went away after I edited ros-latest.list to ensure "precise", then sudo apt-get clean && sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-desktop-full.

has anyone found a solution to this issue?
Comment by SL Remy on 2013-04-30:
Yes. If the solution didn't work for you, post a new question so you can get help.

A:

Finally I used sudo aptitude to install it. Aptitude offers you a solution, you answer not, and after that it will offer you to downgrade a package, you select that option and voil√†! At least that worked for me.

This solution worked for me as well ! Thanks :)

This initially worked for me but I stumpled upon unmet dependencies later on. I am now using the fix described by rgm.
