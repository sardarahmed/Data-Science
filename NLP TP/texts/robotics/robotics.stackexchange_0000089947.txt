Q:

How to delete the default turtle that is created using turtlesim in ros?

How do I proceed to do that? I would like to use
rosservice call /kill " 'name_of_the_turtle' " 

Where do I find the name of the turtle?

A:

The turtlesim docs are not specific about the turtle name, but it looks like the turtle names are either their number, or turtle followed by the number (turtleN), so I'd start by trying both of those to see if either works.
