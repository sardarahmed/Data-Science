Q:

how to build the code for running rviz?

I am following the tutorials for Markers :sending basic shapes.
I am stuck at this step, where it says build the code using command
cd %TOP_DIR_YOUR_CATKIN_WORKSPACE%
catkin_make
Please help.

Please state more clearly what your Problem is.
Don't you understand what this means or is there a Problem with the build?

My workspace is catkin_ws
I use two commands
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
After that I use
rosrun using_markers basic _shapes
where using_markers is package name and i want to run basic_shapes. But I am getting error,
[WARN] Please create a subscriber to the marker

A:

This part of the tutorial means you need to use a terminal to navigate to the top level directory of your workspace then run catkin_make
For example if you have a workspace directory called my_project_ws inside your home directory you can open a terminal and type the following command to move to the workspace.
cd ~/my_project_ws

If you type the ls command (short for list) it will show the contents of this directory which should contain a src directory and possibly some other directories and files. Now you're in the right location you can build your package by typing:
catkin_make

Hope this clears this up for you.

Okay you've got the build working that's great. To keep these answers tidy can you please accept this answer and ask a new question for the warning you've just described. It gets confusing if more than one question get asked and answered in a single thread. Thanks.

Looking at the source code of the node. The message [WARN] Please create a subscriber to the marker isn't an error at all it's what the node is meant to do. try starting RVIZ and viewing the topic, that should show everything working.
