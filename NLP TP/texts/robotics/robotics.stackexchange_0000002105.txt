Q:

360 degree ultrasonic beacon sensor

Basically, I want to detect an ultrasonic beacon in a radius around the robot.
The beacon would have a separate ultrasonic emitter while the robot would have the spinning receiver.
Are there any existing ultrasonic sensors that would meet this use case or am I stuck hacking one together myself?
Is ultrasonic even the best choice? I was hoping that the beacon would be kept in a pocket, so I figured optical sensors were out.
Edit: The beacon and robot will both be mobile so fixed base stations are not an option.

A:

If you were to place 3 ultrasonic microphones/sensors in a triangle layout you should be able to determine the direction of the beacon based on the time difference the ping arrives at each sensor with some straightforward trigonometry. They'd all have to be facing in the same direction (probably upwards) and you may have to find some way to make them omnidirectional. The further apart you can space the sensors, the more accurate the calculation will be.
