Q:

What other equipment or hardwares I should buy along with raspberry pi

I am planning to build some primary level of project like home made robot, which I need to explore an image recognition and path recognition(using four wheels vehicle). So I am looking to buy a device like Raspberry pi. 
What other equipment or hardwares I should buy along with raspberry pi.
Which one is better Arduino or raspberry pi for robotics using AI. 

A:

First, it is important to understand the differences between the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi.  You can read more here and here.

The Arduino is a microcontroller.  It is a specialized board that handles low level, often repetitive tasks like reading a sensor or controlling a motor with a motor driver.  
The Raspberry Pi is a complete Linux computer that typically runs on the Raspbian OS.  While the Raspberry Pi has a set of GPIO ports that can interface with sensors and motor drivers, the Pi can also process higher level tasks.  The Pi is capable of running python and C/C++ libraries such as OpenCV and other AI frameworks.

Using the two boards in a project are not mutually exclusive!  You can use the Arduino for controlling motors and processing sensors while using the Raspberry Pi for your AI libraries and decision making steps.
