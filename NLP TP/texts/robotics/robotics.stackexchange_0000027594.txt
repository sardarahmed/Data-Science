Q:

Can’t download models in gazebo gui

I use gazebo 2.2.6 with ROS Indigo.
When I launch gazebo world I can’t see gazebo's model database. I go through this tutorial. In “Insert” tab I can see only models which I downloaded manually. Also I see the point “Connecting to model database” which doesn’t work. You can see on the picture. How I can activate download option?

A:

It might take a long time to connect to gazebo's model database. I waited for about ten minutes and it worked.
