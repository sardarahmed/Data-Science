Q:

Error when using catkin_make command

Hi,
I was going through this tutorial : http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/Tutorials/Markers%3A%20Basic%20Shapes
I went step by step through the tutorial. Everything went well until i tried executing the command: catkin_make
It gives me error:

The specified base path
"/home/rajesh/using_markers" contains
a package but "catkin_make" must be
invoked in the root of workspace

I don't know how to fix this error before proceeding with the tutorial. I appreciate any help.
Thanks and regards.
