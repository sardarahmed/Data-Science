Q:

rviz Plugin Tutorial crashes

I have checked out the hydro rviz  visualization tutorials and compiled them without modification.
While running rviz, if I try to add an Imu visualization type to the display, rviz crashes with the following error:
rviz: /build/buildd/ogre-1.7.4/OgreMain/src/OgreSceneManager.cpp:807: virtual Ogre::SceneNode* Ogre::SceneManager::createSceneNode(): Assertion `mSceneNodes.find(sn->getName()) == mSceneNodes.end()' failed.

Similarly, if I try to add a PlantFlag, I get a Segmentation fault (core dumped), with no additional info.
This only happens when I compile from source. It works fine when I run the pre-compiled binaries. Any thoughts as to why this might be occurring?

Without considering the actual error, are you sure that the you checked at the version of the tutorial that matches your install rviz verison? (correct branch)? Does you installed Ogre version match the one rviz is compiled with?

A:

I was trying to link against different OGRE versions, so getting rid of OGRE 1.8 fixed the problem.
