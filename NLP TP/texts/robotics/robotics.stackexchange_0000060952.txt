Q:

A 6 DOF robot arm URDF file

Dear all.
I just want to play a bit with Move it in Hydro. I have been seeking for URDF files that can be load it into moveit_setup_assistant However, I have found some files with the extension of .urdf.xacro and I can not simply load it with moveit_setup_assistant. Further on, I have tried to convert .urdf.xacro to .urdf with the following command: rosrun xacro xacro.py file.urdf.xacro -o file.urdf But without success, the file.urdf is empty.
I know I can start creating my own .urdf file, but at this moment I just want to play with move it.
I would like to ask if some wants to share a  6DOF urdf robot arm manipulator with end effector file 

In advance thank you very much.

Hi!
rosrun xacro xacro.py should work fine.
Please post the output of the command. Try the command by specifying the absolute path of the urdf.xacro file.
Even rosrun xacro xacro.py file.urdf.xacro > file.urdf should work.
If you want a urdf, you can find it under jaco_description/urdf/gazebo

Have a great day!

DEPRECATED IN HYDRO:
The  tag should be prepended with 'xacro' if that is the intended use
of it, such as <xacro:include ...>. Use the following script to fix incorrect
xacro includes:
sed -i 's/<include/<xacro:include/g' find . -iname *.xacro
Traceback (most recent call last):

thats the output of the command, the fact is that moveit_setup_assistant cant load the urdf file due to is invalid format.

Well, I could have load in moveit the urdf file from jacoROS, do you know a nice site where they explain how to create the links, joints and effector in kind of open CAD?

I think that error is because the urdf is outdated.
I am sorry, I know nothing about gazebo. Search for tutorials.
