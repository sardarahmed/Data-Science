Q:

Control motors drone

Hi,
I'm planning to control a drone via a ROS-framework through the Pixhawk flight controller. But I'm wondering if there are packages which will let me able to control the drones motors.
Thanks

A:

I've used the mavros package with the pixhawk and is quite nice. Lots of people use it and I believe that there also tutorials for it on the pixhawk site too.

I have seen something of it, but I wasn't sure if it is also possible for example move the drone 10 cm to the right without using gps

Yes, it supports waypoint navigation. Check out the link to the wiki that I posted.
