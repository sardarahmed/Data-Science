Q:

how to install bag_to_images

Hi,
I am very new to ROS and I am having a lot of trouble installing bag_to_images.
I have a rosbag file of a video I recorded from my robot and I need to convert it to a movie(avi or mpeg). I was hoping to use bag_to_images to do this.
Thank you for your help.

Please provide more information for your question: See http://www.ros.org/wiki/Support for more details.

A:

bag_to_images appears to be c-turtle specific, which may very well mean that it won't work on more-modern ROS.
Other than that, we're going to need more information. What kind of trouble are you having? What have you tried?
