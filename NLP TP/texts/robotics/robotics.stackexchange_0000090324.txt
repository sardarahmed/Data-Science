Q:

Is it possible to use turtlebot 2 with crystal?

Hello! I saw that there are not turtlebot debian packages for the crystal release. Is it possible to build it from source for crystal?

A:

It depends.
If you're using the ROS1 bridge to the navigation stack, 100% absolutely. If you're talking about navigation2, its still highly experimental and not really stable enough for a typical user to treat it like a black box solution.
