Q:

DRC IMU Link not publishing transform

We've noticed that  DRC sim 1.3 and earlier) have an IMU that is sending reasonable (yet understandably noisy) data, but there is no transform being published between the pelvis and the imu_link, so that data can't be used.  Currently , we are publishing a static transform every second or so between these, but we need to know (A) if this is reasonable, (B) if this will be fixed in 2.0, (C) why the imu_link is set to be a revolute joint in the model and not a fixed joint (goes back to (A)).

As of 2.0 thi swas fixed, but as of DRCSim 2.2, this is a problem.  The AtlasPlugin tacks "pelvis" on as the link of the IMU, but apparently, the urdf stills defines the imu as living on the imu_link, which is offset from the pelvis.  So now, the imu (if you believe it's from the pelvis) is simply wrong.

A:

Seems to be fixed in DRCSim 2.0
