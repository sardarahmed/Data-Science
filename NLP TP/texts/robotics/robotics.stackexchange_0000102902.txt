Q:

Recursive message definition in ROS2

Hi,
Is it possible to create a recursive message type in ROS2?  E.g.:
message Node.msg
int64 id
my_msgs/Node neighbors
This is currently causing compiler errors in ROS2 Humble for me but I was wondering if there was a flag or something I could use?
For more context, I'm working on writing a protobuf to ROS converter (which has generally been straightforward).  However protobuf allows recursive messages and message loops (e.g. message A references message B which references message A).  Figuring out a ROS equivalent to this if ROS doesn't allow recursive messages is going to be tricky!
Thanks!
-Jenny

No. It is not possible, sorry. I made the same question here:

Ah thanks!  I googled a bunch but didn't find that.  I wonder if pointing out that that solution isn't good for message loops would increase its likelihood of being added someday...
