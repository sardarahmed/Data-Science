hi @kemo007. Sorry i edited your question a little, to ensure it's more readable.
rosdep is not an installation tool, it basically checks for missing dependencies. To install from source, please follow this tutorial: http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace

@osilva thank you for editing. I already did this tutorial but I still got the same error. please any help

A:

Try this:
$ mkdir -p rgbdslam_ws/src
$ cd rgbdslam_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/felixendres/rgbdslam_v2.git
$ cd ..
$ catkin_make

If there are no errors when compiling, then source the package. If there are compiling errors, check the Issues in the repo to see how to solve them. If you still have issues please post another question with the error(s).
$ echo 'source ~/rgbdslam_ws/devel/setup.bash' >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc

To test:
$ roslaunch rgbdslam openni+rgbdslam.launch

With regards to rosdep error, please refer to this prior answer that explains how rosdep works: https://answers.ros.org/question/320734/cannot-locate-rosdep-definition/
Additional information:
I installed a fresh Kinetic copy to test this repo from source.
I found 4 errors due to missing dependencies, addressed with, you will need to do this to get compilation to work.
$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-libg2o
$ sudo apt install ros-kinetic-moveit-ros-perception
$ sudo apt-get install libdevil1c2 libdevil-dev
$ sudo apt install ros-kinetic-openni*

Tested the launch file and it works but there is a connection error but don't have time now to check what is causing it. The installation portion works :) There is a lot of info under Issues section of the repo, so please look at it.

I don't understand how could you get the same error if I didn't use rosdep in the instructions on purpose. Not possible the error is the same. Anyways, try a fresh install, looks you have broken dependencies. The package builds ok. What OS are you using? Ubuntu 16.04?
Comment by kemo007 on 2021-11-26:
@osilva, ubuntu 16.04, ROS Kinetic
Comment by osilva on 2021-11-26:
Start a fresh ROS installation, don't install anything else until you compile RGBDA package.
After ROS installation, install the dependencies first:
$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-libg2o
$ sudo apt install ros-kinetic-moveit-ros-perception
$ sudo apt-get install libdevil1c2 libdevil-dev
$ sudo apt install ros-kinetic-openni*

Then proceed with the installation instructions as per answer. If you encounter issue, pls post the error.
