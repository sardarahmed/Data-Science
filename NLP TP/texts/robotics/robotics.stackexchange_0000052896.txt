Q:

Package control_msgs was not found in the pkg-config search path

I am trying to install the dynamixel_controllers package in Groovy on a 12.04 system.
When 'rosmake'-ing the dynamixel nodes... I receive this error:
    Failed to invoke /opt/ros/groovy/bin/rospack cflags-only-I;--deps-only dynamixel_controllers Package control_msgs was not found in the pkg-config search path.  Perhaps you should add the directory containing 'control_msgs.pc'  to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable  No package 'control_msgs' found
Now, I have built the 'control_msgs' package and can roscd to "control_msgs". When looking at the pkg-config folder in /opt/ros/groovy/lib/pkgconfig" folder, I do not see a 'control_msgs.pc' file, like I believe I should.
Should there be one there?
If not, why wouldn't it have been built if in fact the 'control_msgs' package was made like it says it was...?
Any help is appreciated.

I have stumbled across this problem did you ever find a solution to it?

A:

I did yes... but it's been a very long time. I'm sorry that I forgot to come back and mark my solution!
It most likely had to do with a ROS_PACKAGE_PATH issue... but I'm sorry. I can't be sure.
