You first write that you're looking to install 32-bit software, then state that your processor is 64-bit. What is it that you actually want to do?

Please edit your question to include the full commands you ran and the complete error message. Also please make sure to use copy and paste not type out error messages as accurate reproduction is important for us to help you debug.

@gvdhoorn: Sorry if I wasn't clear. I have Ubuntu 18.04.2 which is 32 bit. But my raspberry pi has arm processor which is 64 bit.

@Robotic_arm: note @tfoote's answer: you have packages.ros.org/ubuntu, it's packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu. Note the ros after packages.ros.org there.

@gvdhoorn: yes thank you! I realized it as i was copy pasting the entire list of commands.

A:

You appear to have copy and pasted the wrong url from the tutorial.
The repository is at: http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu not http://packages.ros.org/ubuntu
