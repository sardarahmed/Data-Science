Q:

Is there a way to invalidate a Pose in rviz?

I often publish a Pose message to quickly and easily view things in rviz.  And I would like a way to programatically (through a message) tell rviz to delete the pose from view.
The scenario is that I have a robot which grabs objects on a table.  And I want to display the pose of the object in rviz.  I do several runs with different objects and positions.  So between runs I would like to clear the previous runs from view.  This is easy to do with rviz markers, but not with regular Pose messages.
I have tried publishing with a 0 time stamp and empty frame_id with no luck in deleting the frame.  I have observed tf frames becoming gray and disappearing, how is that done?
Can a new marker type be added to display axes?

A:

You could publish an arrow marker, instead.

Or a triplet of arrows as your axis.
