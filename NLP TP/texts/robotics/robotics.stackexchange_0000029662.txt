Q:

Error while installing ROS Base Install from SVN on Ubuntu (BeagleBoard)

I'm trying to install ROS from SVN on my BeagleBoard (with Ubuntu 10.04 on it) using instructions from Wiki. I previously installed the ROS-only version without problems. Now, as I wanted to install the kinect-stack, I wanted to "upgrade" to ros-base. But after executing
rosinstall ~/ros "http://packages.ros.org/cgi-bin/gen_rosinstall.py?rosdistro=cturtle&variant=base&overlay=no"

I got:
ERROR: woah, unknown installation method hg not installed, cannot create a hg vcs client

Any clues?

A:

Seems like you need to install mercurial.

Thanks, whatever it is, sudo apt-get install hgsvn seems to have solved my problem.
