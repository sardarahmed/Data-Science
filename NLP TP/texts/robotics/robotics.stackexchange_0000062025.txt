Q:

Clearing operation in costmap_2d explanation?

Can someone explain the following sentence or with an image maybe ?
A clearing operation, however, consists of raytracing through a grid from the origin of the sensor outwards for each observation reported.
Thank you !

A:

Sensor data gives you two things: Where an obstacle is and where an obstacle isn't. Imagine you have a single laser that starts at point A encounters an obstacle at point B.
The marking operation is putting a lethal value in the costmap at point B.
The clearing operation is taking all the points between A and B and marking them as free space.
The process of finding the line is often referred to as ray tracing, and is explained here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham's_line_algorithm
