Q:

collada files and axis center

Hi,
I'm trying to import a wheel collada file made in SketchUp but when I try to atach it to a joint the axis center is in one fo the edges of the wheel.
How can I set axis in the center of the wheel so It can rotate.
I've already done this with a cylinder instead of a wheel.
Thanks in advance

A:

This is just a workaround to the axes problem. Still I haven't figured out how to set the axes of the model correctly in the first place. (anyway draw the model in SketchUp assuming its axes coincide with your model axes)
After exporting it to collada format (.dae) you can use MeshLab to view the axes of your  model: "Render->Show Axis"
If the axes are not where you want them to be, by looking at MeshLab, change the axes of your model in Google SketchUp: changing it, is easy, because just only one axis is usually misaligned.
