Q:

Making a tiny robot by using a remote brain

I'd like to build a robot as small as possible and with as few "delicate" parts as possible (the bots will be bashing into each other).
I was wondering if it was possible to use a small chip that could receive bluetooth/IR/wifi commands to move the motors, and in turn, send back feedback based on sensors such as an accelerometer (to detect impact).
I can probably achieve something like this with the PiCy 

however this is slightly bigger than I'd like (due to the size of the Pi) and I'm not sure how long the Pi would last taking continuous impacts.
I'd therefore like to try to offset the brain (the Pi) to the side of the arena and just use a small chip to receive move commands, and send back data from the accelerometer.
Do you have any recommendations for such a chip? Wifi would be my choice but if it impacts the size I could try BT
Edit: After further research it seems an Arduino nano with a WiFi RedBack shield might do the job along with something like this for the motors: http://www.gravitech.us/2mwfecoadfor.html

I think I may have found the perfect controller for this project:

The Micro Magician will allow me to control 2 simple DC motors, detect impacts and crashes with the accelerometer AND receive move commands from the IR receiver! Pretty awesome for the size. 
The only piece left in the puzzle is sending back the data to the remote controller (accelerometer data). I'm not sure if I could attach an IR transmitter or maybe BT/Wifi? 
Edit: looks like this could do the job! http://www.dawnrobotics.co.uk/dagu-arduino-bluetooth-module/
Now to find small motors...
