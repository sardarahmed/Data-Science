Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Ros2 Stopwatch

Hi guys,
I want to implement a timer thats working like a stopwatch to check if my joy_node is continously sending messages.
Everytime it gets called the timer starts and if it doesnt get called again in a certain time I can start another event, for example to make sure the robot stops.
If the function gets called again (because the joy_node keeps sending messages) the timer just resets and the stop event doesnt get called.
Is there a timer function for doing this in ROS 2? (eloquent)
Sorry if the answer is obvious and I didnt find it.
Thanks in advance!

A:

This is commonly called a watchdog timer. I don't think that we have a specific timer to implement this.
I would also recommend that you look at the Deadline QoS documented here: https://design.ros2.org/articles/qos_deadline_liveliness_lifespan.html

Thank you!
I tried a bit with "Deadline" but ended up with a new question about how to use it properly.
