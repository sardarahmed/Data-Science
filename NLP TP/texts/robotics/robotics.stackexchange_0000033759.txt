Q:

What are ground_object_cloud and base_scan_marking?

Hi all,
Looking into the pr2 navigation configuration: costmap_common_params.yaml, we saw that there are 4 sources: tilt_scan, base_scan, base_scan_marking, ground_object_cloud.
We suffered from fantom obstacles when navigating. When removing the ground_object_cloud source the fantom disapeared.
What is this source for ? By the way, what is base_scan_marking for ?
