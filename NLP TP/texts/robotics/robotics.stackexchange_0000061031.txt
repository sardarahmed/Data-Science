Q:

Obeject recognition kitchen on Ubunto

Hello,
I am trying to install ORK on ubunto, but if I try to compile, I get the folliowing error
CMake Error at /opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:75 (find_package):
Could not find a package configuration file provided by
"household_objects_database" with any of the following names:
household_objects_databaseConfig.cmake
household_objects_database-config.cmake

Add the installation prefix of "household_objects_database" to
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "household_objects_database_DIR" to a directory
containing one of the above files.  If "household_objects_database"
provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
installed.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
tabletop/CMakeLists.txt:4 (find_package)
CMake Error: The following variables are used in this project, but they are set to NOTFOUND.
The package household_object_database is not found, but I have exactly used the instructions on
wg-perception.github.io/object_recognition_core/install.html#install
but I am wondering how I can fix this issue

A:

You're probably missing this package? https://github.com/ros-interactive-manipulation/household_objects_database
