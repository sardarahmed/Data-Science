Q:

System hardware information

Is there any package that provides information of the computer hardware?
I need to create some modules to check the available memory, cpu usage, disk health, etc.. from a C++ application.
I was wondering if this is something that has already been done.

Additionally, I intend to work on this, but have not had time as of yet.  Best case scenario would be something working by the end of June, or early July (2011) when I get time to work on it.  I intend to use lm_sensors and the nvidia tools for temperature and voltage monitoring.

This is a duplicate of: http://answers.ros.org/question/37/pr2_computer_monitor-with-lm_sensors  As far as I know, no one has done it yet.

Yes, but it sounds like something that every robot should check and that could be gathered an sent using the diagnostics package. Maybe someone has already done it.

Sounds like something you'd get from the underlying OS, not ROS.

A:

Try looking at the pr2_computer_monitor package, it might be a good starting point

Thanks, this might just be what I was looking for, I guess I didn't search the right keywords.
