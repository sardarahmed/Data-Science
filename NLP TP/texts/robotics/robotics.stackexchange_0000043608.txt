Q:

gazebo fuerte crashes after calling gazebo/delete_model service

Hi I was following the simulator_gazebo tutorial on ROS wiki when I encountered this problem. First of all I spawned a model using " rosrun gazebo spawn_model -param coffee_cup_description -gazebo -model coffee_cup -x 0 -z 2 " and then I deleted it using " rosservice call gazebo/delete_model '{model_name: coffee_cup}' ". After I called the delete_model command,gazebo crashed unexpectedly and gave the following:
[gazebo_gui-3] process has died [pid 3162, exit code 139, cmd /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/simulator_gazebo/gazebo/scripts/gui __name:=gazebo_gui __log:=/home/chengxiang/.ros/log/fba33798-f058-11e1-8139-0017c4794a79/gazebo_gui-3.log].
log file: /home/chengxiang/.ros/log/fba33798-f058-11e1-8139-0017c4794a79/gazebo_gui-3*.log
Other than this instance, gazebo also crashes unexpectedly sometimes when I was doing other stuffs like spawning models. Did any one of you encounter this issues before? Any advice will be appreciated. Thanks.

On a side note, my gazebo sometimes launches with a blackout screen, could this be related?

In addition, I am using Ubuntu 12.04.

Please file a bug report on gazebo trac, and include all details needed to reproduce the error, as well as any debugging information if available.  Thanks!

Hi Hsu. Actually the problem seem to disappear for now, after i installed the driver for my graphic card. So, i couldn't reproduce the errors to file the report. However, I will file a bug report if such problem occurs again. Thanks!
