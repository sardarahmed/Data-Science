Q:

stacks in ROS hydro; roswtf missing /opt/ros/hydro/stacks

Observations:

roswtf gives me an error stating that Not all paths in ROS_PACKAGE_PATH point to an existing directory; the missing one is /opt/ros/hydro/stacks;
I believe that the /opt/ros/hydro/stacks item in ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environment variable comes from the /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash script;
if I understand it correctly, there are no stacks in ROS hydro;
there already is an answer proposing to simply create the missing stacks directory;
There is a document that states that the /opt/ros/hydro/stacks directory is there for backwards compatibility with rosmake packages

Question:
Is there a bug in /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash or should have been the /opt/ros/hydro/stacks created during installation? Where to report that bug/how to find out what package is responsible for creation of such a directory?
The environment:
I am running ROS hydro on top of Ubuntu 12.04.3. My system contains an installation of ROS groovy too.

A:

Since users are still able to build dry packages and stacks the stacks folder under /opt/ros/hydro has not been removed. A user could still "install" dry stacks there manually.
The actual error message of roswtf will go away with the next release of it. It has been already changed in the source repository (https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/commit/935266512550e65502d47163b0ca0f4a8c4e3379). So you can just ignore the message until then.
