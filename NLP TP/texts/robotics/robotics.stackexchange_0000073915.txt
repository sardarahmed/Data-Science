Q:

How to not use laser data for navigation?

I'd like to prevent the local planner from using laser data, but I still want to publish it so that I can process it elsewhere.  How can I do that?

Can you show us your YAML files to see the parameters you use ?

A:

The easiest way to do that would be to set the occ_dist parameter of the local planner to zero (I assume you're using base_local_planner).  This won't add any extra cost for potential trajectories to enter nonzero cost cells.  I suppose you could even configure the local costmap to not have any layers, which would keep it empty.
I don't know your application, but you might find the robot will clip objects by doing something like this. The only way I see this working is if you update the global plan from navfn at a pretty high frequency.
I hope this helps!
