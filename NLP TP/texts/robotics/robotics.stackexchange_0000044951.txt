Q:

Turtlebot RaySensor race condition

Hi. When running turtlebot i keep getting a warning message
 Warning [RaySensor.cc:206] ranges not constructed yet (zero sized)

I understand from this website that it can be solved by moving a small part of the code upward. However, when I did a "locate" on the file RaySensor.cc, all the RaySensor.cc appears to be in the trash folder
chengxiang@ubuntu:~$ locate RaySensor.cc
/home/chengxiang/.local/share/Trash/files/gazebo-1.0.1/src/physics/bullet 
/BulletRaySensor.cc

/home/chengxiang/.local/share/Trash/files/gazebo-1.4.0.1/src/sensors/RaySensor.cc

May i know how can i find the file or is there another way of solving this issue?
I am using ROS fuerte with Ubuntu 12.04. Thank you in advance.

A:

I've applied the patch in Gazebo's fuerte branch.  Should be out in the next release.  Or you can try compiling simulator_gazebo from source.

Sorry. May I know how do I compile it from source? I used : rosws set simulator_gazebo --svn https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/simulator_gazebo/trunk to install it from source, am I doing it right? After I did that, error came out when I roslaunch turtlebot.(Please see update 1).

Hi. Can anyone tell me how exactly to compile simulator gazebo from source? I used svn co to checkout (https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/simulator_gazebo/tags/simulator_gazebo-1.6.16/) and rosmake it. However, it didn't work and gazebo can't start. Anyone can enlighten me?
