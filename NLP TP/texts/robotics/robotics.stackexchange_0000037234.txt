Q:

How do I install sensor_msgs package?

Hi, all.
I would like to use hokuyo_node in Gumstix with Ubuntu.
To this end, I installed ROS on Gumstix by native build.
The hokuyo_node needs 8 dependencies, so I downloaded sensor_msgs package which is one of the dependencies of hokuyo_node.
$ svn checkout https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/common_msgs/trunk/sensor_msgs
$ rospack profile
$ rosmake sensor_msgs
However, it shows "No makefile". So I created one dummy package using "roscreate-pkg" and copy Makefile to sensor_msgs from newly created dummy package.
However, it shows "no cmake_minimum_required" so I added following.
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.0)
Then, I do rosmake again, then it shows following.
Unknown CMake command "catkin_project"
Do you know why?
Note that, I installed ROS with very basics, so there is no sensor_msgs package in default.

A:

You shouldn't use the version from trunk unless you are involved in the development of the package. Which distribution did you install? Electric? Then use the following svn command to check out the complete stack common_msgs:
svn co https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/common_msgs/tags/electric/ common_msgs

Note that you are checking out the common_msgs stack, not just the sensor_msgs package. While some packages may work on their own, the stack is the ROS unit for release and install.

This works! Thanks very much.
