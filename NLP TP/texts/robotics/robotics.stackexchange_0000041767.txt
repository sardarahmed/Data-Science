Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Hector_gps

Hi,
I was trying to simulate a gps using the hector_gazebo_gps plugin, but something is not right.
I tested it by moving the robot 34 meters and used
http://www.whoi.edu/marine/ndsf/cgi-bin/NDSFutility.cgi?form=0&from=XY&to=LatLon
To figure the right values of lat and long and verify them in google earth.
But in the navsafix message published by the plugin I barely moved.
I cannot figure what's wrong.

Congratulations!! Can you post what you did as an answer to your question? And if the changes require a patch for a package could you share that as well?

I would post it but I don't know if the hector gps simulator as a problem or why was just using it wrong...

A:

I've solved the problem by making some modifications to the code using the geodesy package. Now the gps simulator works fine. I failed to discovered what I was doing wrong in the hector gps package
