I don't understanding your comment. Could you teach me again in detail ?

A:

The frame_id in the PointCloud2 header names the relevant tf frame of reference.
ROS handles transforms between coordinate frames using the tf package. That component is complex, not easily summarized here. Please consult the tf design documentation and the tf tutorials for more information.
