Q:

OSX Fuerte Install Python Error Msg

Following "http://www.ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Installation/OSX/Homebrew", installed "numpy nose" and running "cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/ros/fuerte -DSETUPTOOLS_DEB_LAYOUT=OFF":
CMake Warning at build/cmake/rosunit/rosunit-extras.cmake:17 (message):
add_pyunit() is deprecated.  For Python tests, use add_nostests() instead.
and further down:
CMake Error at /usr/local/Cellar/cmake/2.8.7/share/cmake/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:91 (MESSAGE):   Could NOT find wxWidgets (missing: wxWidgets_FOUND)
is it necessary to also install gdal? And if so from where?
Suggestions to fix?

Yes, I got the python warnings too ... they aren't an issue.

A:

Try these instructions ... I think the ones you are following are a little out dated. These worked for me.

Followed your instructions to 1.3.1 Layer 1 with Ok completion until running both Debian & non-Debian  DCMAKE commands-not sure which one. Same result "CMake error at rx/tools/CMakeLists.txt.wx-enhanced swig binary not found. Aborting"
Comment by Kevin on 2012-05-09:
OSX is not Debian (linux) so use the the not Debian option. Did you install swig??
Comment by RobotRoss on 2012-05-09:
I did not explicitly. Did that install get missed in the scripts? What package should I use?
Comment by Dan Lazewatsky on 2012-05-09:
It looks like ros/fuerte/swig-wx is broken (I don't know ruby, so I can't debug it): swig-wx.rb:4: syntax error, unexpected '-', expecting '<' or '
' or ';'
