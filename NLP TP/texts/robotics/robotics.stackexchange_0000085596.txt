hi, I'm trying to use usb_cam-test.launch in usb_cam package to read my web camera,  but it keeps returning error:

The main part of my answer was to run
ls -ltrh /dev/video*

What does this give? Please update your question with a copy and paste of the output from the terminal using the preformatted text (101010) button.

Ok, are the cameras turned on?

Please update your question when you have new information.

A:

From Ask Ubuntu:

To list all video devices picked up by the kernel
ls -ltrh /dev/video*

To list all devices attached to USB use lsusb ; to list all devices attached to PCI use lspci 

Once you identify which device is your webcam, start the usb_cam_node node with
roslaunch usb_cam usb_cam-test.launch video_device:=<your-device>

where <your-device> is your webcam.

Edit:
Try adding yourself to the user group
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER

Now, I found this by some googling.
