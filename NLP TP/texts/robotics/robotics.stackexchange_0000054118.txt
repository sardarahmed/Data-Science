Q:

How long does the wiki take to create package pages?

Currently waiting on several packages to be spidered for the wiki. For example, um6 and robot_upstart have both been in hydro/doc.yaml for almost three weeks with no wiki pages created. Have I not done something quite right?
Alternatively, if I just create the pages manually from the package template, will that create any problems down the road?
Thanks.

A:

The wiki pages are not automatically created.  You need to create the wiki pages manually (use the basic template) and the automatic header information will be filled in within 3 days of submitting the documentation job.
How to create a package wiki page can be found here: http://wiki.ros.org/PackageDocumentation

Okay, thanks! My recollection from the past is that pages were automatically created and then you went in and filled them in afterward. I must be muddled with something else, thanks.
