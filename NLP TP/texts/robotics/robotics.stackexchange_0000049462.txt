A:

We need to write a code which contains:

Visual recognition of the object (e.g. juice, book) that TurtleBot tries to recognize. This may be the most difficult part and I am still not sure which libraries are the most suitable. Perhaps RoboEarth detector?

Navigation implementation (not by rviz but directly from the code) which calls gmapping, acml, move_base, etc.

Main: the strategy designed by you (e.g. circulate the room according to a particular trajectory; when it sees the book then turns right, etc.) Alternatively you may try Explore stack.

Actually I am trying to do the same thing. Perhaps we can help each other :-)
