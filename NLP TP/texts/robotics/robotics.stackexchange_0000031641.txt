A:

Quaternions are a representation of orientation wikipedia
For advanced concepts there's an extensive reference written by Erik Dam
There's a good primer on the ogre website.
O.Khatib lectures (from Stanford) on introduction to robotics are freely available from the iTunes U store and can be accessed here. There is a part elaborating on rotation representations.
There's also a great tutorial at https://eater.net/quaternions

I encourage to learn the mathematical concept before going on. Wikipedia may serve for this purpose, as KoenBuys said.
