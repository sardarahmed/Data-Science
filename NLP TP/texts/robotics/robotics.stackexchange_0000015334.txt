Q:

Potentiometer as pressure sensor in linear actuator?

I'm trying to use a linear actuator (sample electric cylinder) for a soil penetration device. Originally, I thought of using a pressure sensor to know when/if I hit a rock. However, I am not seeing many linear actuators with integrated pressure sensors but they do come with potentiometers. So I am thinking, would it be possible to use the potentiometer as a rough way to know if I hit something?  
Basically, my program would check if its position does not change for a small time interval. If the position has not changed before it extends the maximum length, then the actuator must have hit something it cannot penetrate well.
Anyone have any ideas? 

A:

Yes, you'll see the position become fairly stable when you've hit a rock (assuming that your bot is heavy enough to stall your actuator).
Measuring current will also tell you if you've stalled/are stalling.  I have used a Pololu controller which apparently has current feedback over USB but I have not used that feature.  I suggest that you use something like this rather than building your own H-bridge and current sensor.  It will make it easy to experiment with different approaches.
