Q:

ROS to LCM or ROS to APRIL Integration?

Hello answers,
Is anybody working on a general way of interfacing ROS with LCM or APRIL? There are some tools there I'd like to use. Doing it myself won't be too painful, but I figured I'd ask before I got too far in.

I was right: it's not painful at all. If I get a chance, I'll write up a tutorial somewhere...

A:

Hi Mac, I am interested in a port of the APRIL tag toolkit to ROS, and was planning on doing it quick and easy using a rosjava wrapper without necessarily using LCM. If you've made some progress on interfacing LCM with ROS, do you think there might be a more generic way for me to set up a port?

Short answer: no. ROSJava is probably a better way. If this does get done, please please please do a release! I know of several interested people.
