Q:

Groovy installation pcl fail

I've been through about a million groovy installation problems (source install on Ubuntu 12.04 32bit). This one, in particular, stumped me because I don't exactly know what's going on between the build_isolated and install_isolated directories, or how/where built libraries are installed so packages dependent on them (in the course of the install) can find them. Here's the error with the tail end of a successful package build:

 Processing plain cmake package: 'pcl'

This did fix the above error, so it's the correct answer, but it left me with another error: /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lpcl_visualization. Just an FYI for anyone else that finds this post.
Comment by seanarm on 2013-02-08:
This post makes sense, but I can't find exactly where pcl_visualization is not being installed: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11874684/compiling-pcl-for-use-with-opencv
Comment by seanarm on 2013-02-08:
Another FYI, I circumvented the new error by excluding the particular example class that was breaking the build.
Comment by KruseT on 2013-02-08:
I would prefer you to comment on the other question, because that's where I'll send all others with the same problem.
