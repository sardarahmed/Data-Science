Q:

Create a map of a building with kinect only?

Hi,
I want to mount a Kinect on our Coppa Robot. I'm still new to ROS etc. so my question is: will it be "enough" to create a map of a building? If I understood it correctly, TurtleBot is doing that and a lot more using Kinect only? So I'd just have to use GMapping to create a map and later amcl to estimate the position? That's it? (sounds a bit too easy) ;)
Update: it is possible only if you have really good odometry. Without it you can forget it (amcl might still work but gmapping won't).

A:

You'll need the pointcloud_to_laserscan and slam_gmapping packages to accomplish this. You should have a look at turtlebot_navigation gmapping_demo.launch as a good example of how to accomplish what you want. You can find additional help in a number of questions on this board, including here.

Great, now I just need to wait for the kinect to arrive :)

I do believe so. I've never done it myself, but there's a lot of support for it on this forum.

Ok, thanks. So Kinect is enough to accomplish all of that?
