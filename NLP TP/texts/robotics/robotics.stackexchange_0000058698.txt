Q:

Use a catkin package that depends on a rosbuild package

Hi!
I want to use a rosbuild package as dependency of my catkin package. But I'm getting some some errors... seems that catkin doesn't recognize the rosbuild package. Is there a way I can include that rosbuild package without converting it to a catkin package?
Thanks in advance,
Lucas

A:

No, this is not possible. You can only depend on catkin packages in rosbuild ones, not the other way around. See also note here. There might be some very hacky ways doing it by using cmake, custom scripts and fixed paths or so, but the recommended way is converting all dependencies to catkin.

Well I think it should be the opposite, because catkin is more recent... So strange
So, if I create my catkin package as a rosbuild package, I will be able to include all the catkin packages as dependencies, right? Is it possible in ROS Hydro?

Yes, but as of Hydro you can not release a rosbuild package anymore.
