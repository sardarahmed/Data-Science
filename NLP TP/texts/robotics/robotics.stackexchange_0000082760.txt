Q:

How can I publish many ROIs in a detection node?

Hello I have simple object detection node that reads frames from the usb camera and performs face detection. I would like to publish all the detected bounding boxes. How can I publish many bounding boxes?  The number of detections is not static, as I have no priori knowledge of how many detections the detector will produce. I have a tracker node which will then subscribe to the detector topic and perform tracking.

A:

Barring the use of any (proposed) standard messages for vision, this could be done using lists/unbounded arrays of some simpler messages (such as geometry_msgs, perhaps four Point32 per bbox, or Polygons).

Edit: note that there are actually people_msgs that may be more appropriate for this, as they carry a bit more information than just bounding boxes. There are also quite some packages that implement either face or people tracking, such as cob_people_detection, face_detector and face_recognition. If nothing else, it might be good to take a look at how those packages publish their results and perhaps use a similar / the same method. cob_people_detection uses the cob_people_detection_msgs fi.
