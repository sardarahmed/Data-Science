Q:

Arduino with navigation stack

Is it possible to launch the robot_configuration.launch file with arduino for the Navigation Stack usage? If yes, how? Rosserial_arduino?
My arduino is used for all the UAV controls. I am unsure of what to add in the robot_configuration launch file. From my senior's report, they mentioned that there's no odom for UAV but navigation stack requires it for the local_planner. So, I hope to gather some guidance from here as I am quite confused.

A:

I think you got the spirit. By now the best way to use the navigation stack (which need lot of computacional resources) is by runing it on a computer and just passing command to the robot_base (which is commanded by the arduino).
So you should run rosserial on the arduino and make it subscribe the cmd_vel messages, also if you have wheel encoders or
other type of sensor you could plug it on arduino and publish its info to ros.
You should check http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials.
