Q:

Where do Fuerte deb files get installed?

Where are the contents of ROS Fuerte deb packages unpacked to?
I am trying to get ROS Fuerte running on an embedded x86 Linux distribution. For Diamondback and Electric I was able to simply copy /opt/ros/{diamondback,electric}/ over to my target, set some Python environment variables, and everything "Just Worked". With Fuerte I have seen mailing list messages suggesting that the deb install files are moving some of the ROS files to locations other than /opt/ros/fuerte/ but I can't seem to find exactly which files those are or where they are expected to be installed.
What I am really looking for is something similar to what I can find at packages.ubuntu.com, and when I click on list of files it shows me where all of the package contents are installed on the system. That would allow me to manually (or via a script) find all the files I need and copy them over to the target.
I tried looking through the Fuerte SIG notes but couldn't find the answer there. If there is a page that has this discussion a link would be appreciated so I can use Google better in the future. Thanks.
Update:
I had to copy /usr/lib/pymodules/python2.6/rospkg and /usr/bin/rosversion into a directory on my target OS $PATH. Also, I had to have parts of /usr/lib/python2.6/, especially /usr/lib/python2.6/lib-dynload, copied onto my target OS with $PYTHONPATH set to add those directories. Note that it is likely that not all the files in those directories are required, but I haven't gone through and parsed out the necessary subset, so this won't be as efficient space-wise as it could be.
After that I could run roscore (roslaunch) although I get a few warnings that seem safe to ignore since everything is connecting just fine over the network. Thanks for the answers.

A:

I believe that the files are still in the /opt/ros prefix.
This REP 122 details the new filesystem hierarchy.
I believe that the intent of this new layout is to allow users to install directly into the /usr prefix if desired.  Then all of the ROS files will map into /usr/bin, /usr/etc, /usr/lib, and so forth.
While it is possible to use a different prefix, as far as I know, files are still placed in the /opt/ros/fuerte prefix by default.
