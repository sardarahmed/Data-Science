A:

Hello,
I'm also new to RoS and mapping, I was using XtionPRO but it works in the same way like kinect sensor. I recommend You to use RTAB-Map (it support assembling robot equipment) package https://github.com/introlab/rtabmap and https://github.com/introlab/rtabmap_ros . I used it and it works well, the problem I met was transparent/absorbing surfaces but It's kinect IR problem, not package. Other package i found usable could be https://github.com/ccny-ros-pkg/ccny_rgbd_tools It's older than RTAB-Map and seems dead when RTAB-Map author is still active and helpful on forums ;)
I never used CCNY because i was trying to install it on kinetic and it's not compatible. 
RTAB-Map works 100% well on Ubuntu 14.04 and RoS Indigo, when using RoS Kinetic Kame i got little problems because sometimes after export package crashed, I'm not sure where is the problem because my laptop is little old Dell ;) Additionally there is a lot of tutorials and tips (from how to install RTAB-Map to how to configure Your own robot with equipment) https://github.com/introlab/rtabmap/wiki. After successful instalation i recommend You: https://github.com/introlab/rtabmap/wiki/Kinect-mapping . Also on http://wiki.ros.org/rtabmap_ros are a lot of informations.  
There is one more package that seems to be alive and effective: https://github.com/mp3guy/Kintinuous I was trying to use but it requires CUDA >= 7.0 which my laptop doesn't support.
Best regards.

Have you tried building from source?
First: https://github.com/introlab/rtabmap
Next: https://github.com/introlab/rtabmap_ros
Remember to delete: sudo apt-get remove ros-indigo-rtabmap.On github etc. packages are for "kinetic" remember to replace all "kinetic" to "indigo".

Found RTAB-Map built without its GUI library. Node rtabmapviz will not be built! That error means there is a problem with Qt or You didn't built rtabmap. You need to built rtabmap from git source and then build rtabmap_ros and put it in catkin.
