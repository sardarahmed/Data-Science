Q:

ros2 logging demo C++

I am trying to migrate code to ROS2 and I am stuck on logging.
From https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Concepts/Logging/ I got to the code example at https://github.com/ros2/demos/tree/master/logging_demo
My problem is that all the log calls use some unscoped get_logger(), or this->get_logger in one file. But I can't find where that is defined or what it is supposed to do. ( e.g. RCLCPP_INFO(get_logger(), "Publishing: '%s'", msg->data.c_str()); )
So 1) I don't get it myself atm 2) this is not a good practice for a demo that should clarify it.
Thanks in advance for help.

A:

Hello,
get_logger() is part of the API of rclcpp::Node see the documentation.
In the example is called  RCLCPP_INFO(get_logger(), ... or RCLCPP_INFO(this->get_logger(), ... because it's inside the class which extends the Node class. But if you want to use the logger outside a Node class you can use it in this way: RCLCPP_INFO(node->get_logger(), .... Or if you don't have an available node you can called it: `RCLCPP_ERROR(rclcpp::get_logger("string of the logger", ... )

Perfect answer, thank you.
I think it would really be worth clarifying in the tutorial.
