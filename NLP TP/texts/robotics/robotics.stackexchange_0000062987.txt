Q:

Publisher sleep forever using roslaunch

When I ran a simple publisher in the tutorial (http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingPublisherSubscriber%28c%2B%2B%29). I got a problem that if I ran it through launch file, the node will sleep forever. But if I ran it through rosrun [packagename] talker, it works fine. My launch file looks like this, can anyone help me?
<master auto="start"/>

<param name="use_sim_time" value="true"/>

<node pkg="hybridAstar" type="talker" name="talker" output="screen"/>

A:

The problem is
<param name="use_sim_time" value="true"/>

This means the uses simulation time published to /clock topic by e. g. Gazebo or a rosbag started by rosbag play --clock file.bag.
See this
http://wiki.ros.org/Clock
ans this
http://answers.ros.org/question/193820/time-stamp-ros_info/?comment=193890#comment-193890
for info about clock and simulation time
This means your node will not spin before any other node (gazebo/rosbag) is started and publishes to /clock topic
