Q:

allow_unknown parameter ignored

Hi there,
I want to avoid the global planner to plan its paths through the unknown because it is not working for my case. So as described here I set the paramter allow_unknown to false. So I created a yaml named global_planner.yaml file like this:
NavfnROS:
   allow_unknown: false
   default_tolerance: 5

In the launch file for the move_base node I added a line to load the parameters:
<node pkg="move_base" type="move_base" name="move_base" respawn="true">
   <rosparam file="$(find multi_robot_simulation)/config/global_planner.yaml" command="load" />
</node>

The parameter also shows up in the parameter server:
rosparam get /move_base/NavfnROS/allow_unknown 

returns false, as expected.
So, whats wrong here???
Thanks for any help!
Micha
UPDATE:
I just pulled the navigation package from github to do some tests with the code. I realized the parameter is read just fine! The path planner still plans its path through unknown! Why??

A:

I guess next time I should read the parameter description more carefully:

The same issue has been described here:

The parameter in question can be found here:

Is this solved then?

Yes, but I cannot accept my own answer.

To make this a bit more than a link-only answer: The parameter description for allow_unknown that is linked above says: "if you are using a layered costmap_2d costmap with a voxel or obstacle layer, you must also set the track_unknown_space param for that layer to be true..."
