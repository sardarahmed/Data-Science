Hello @ROS_LOVER,

Which ROS2 distribution is the best compatible to work on Jetson NX?

I think currently it's foxy that can be sustainable to your requirement.
For object detection, you need a darknet_ros I think it is available for foxy.

Hi @Ranjit Kathiriya,
Thank you for your answer.
I have found that Jetson NX SDK Jetpack only support to ubuntu 18.04 .
So I have to run new ROS2 version through Docker image create by Nvidia Developer.
Do you have any experience on this situation ?
If I want to choose some older ROS2 Distribution : Eloquent, Dashing , Crystal support directly Ubuntu 18.04?
Do you have any experience about using these distribution ?
Thanks

I think you have to try the hit-and-run approach over here. No! sorry I have not tried myself.
