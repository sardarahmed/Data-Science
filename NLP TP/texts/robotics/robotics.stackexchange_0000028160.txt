Q:

Ptr in function parameter[in]

Beginner Tutorial: Velodyne Sensor
public: virtual void Load(physics::ModelPtr _model, sdf::ElementPtr _sdf)
    {
      // Just output a message for now
      std::cerr << "\nThe velodyne plugin is attach to model[" <<
        _model->GetName() << "]\n";
    }

I am new to C++, i want to know more about the Ptr in function parameter[in], it can be seen everywhere.
Any gentle guide or hint would be appreciated.
Thanks for your kindness

A:

ModelPtr is a custom type declaration. Here, you can see the typedef and how ModelPtr is equivalent to boost::shared_ptr<Model>. In a nutshell, a ModelPtr is a shared pointer to a model object. Here's a quick tutorial about boost smart pointers.
An ElementPtr is also a custom type, another shared pointer to an sdf::Element. Here, you can see the typedef in SDFormat.
