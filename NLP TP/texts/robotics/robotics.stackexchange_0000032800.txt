Q:

no rviz interface in Ubuntu 11.04 (natty)

I have exactly the same problem as described in this question, i.e. the rviz interface does not show up if I start roscore and "rosrun rviz rviz".
I have installed the latest ros-diamondback-* packages from the official repository (version 1.4.1-s1308330112~natty). I tried several different window managers including GNOME, Unity, and KDE Plasma. I tried four different computers with Natty, and the most disturbing part is that it works on exactly one machine (with KDE), but for no apparent reason; it is the same hardware (HP Z800 workstation).
I have successfully run Gazebo with Ogre and glxgears, so there is no obvious problem with my 3D acceleration (NVIDIA). There are no helpful error messages in the logs. There are a few warnings and errors, but they show up on the working machine as well.

The error may not be useful to you but please post it anyway.  Also what's the output of 'dpkg -l ros-diamondback-visualization'

A:

The problem turned out to be the environment variable GDK_NATIVE_WINDOWS. I have set this variable in my .bashrc to circumvent problems with Eclipse (see http://blogs.gurulabs.com/dax/2009/10/what-gdk-native.html for a more in-depth explanation). Without this variable, the interface shows up just fine.
However, a colleague of mine has set the same variable and it causes no problems for him. He uses Ubuntu Lucid, though.
