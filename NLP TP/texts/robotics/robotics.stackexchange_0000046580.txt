Q:

rosinstall error: cannot import name get_vcs_client

Hi,
I've found out that the rosinstall in my robot is not working, basically it says the following:
$ rosinstall
ERROR Cannot find rosinstall libraries, check your installation. One frequent cause is that rosinstall 0.5 is still installed in /usr/local/lib. Check the rosinstall wiki for solutions.
cannot import name get_vcs_client

I don't have any rosinstall library in /usr/local/lib
I've reinstalled rosinstall
I've done #easy_install vcstools (with no change since they were already there)
Computer data
OS: Ubuntu Server 12.04
ROS: Fuerte 1.8.10

I've been googleing and the only page I've found with the same problem is this one. But It couldn't help.
Any ideas?
Thanks in advance!

A:

Hi, I had the same problem.
first, I updated the packages using
$ sudo apt-get update
then, I installed python-vcstools by
$ sudo apt-get install python-vcstools
I don't know what happened with 'python-vcstools', but the rosinstall works well now.
Hope it will work for you too! :)
Have a nice day!

Thank you, this worked! (I uninstalled everything first)
