Q:

catkin-cmake-isolated fails to build moveit_core

I'm trying to compile moveit_core with catkin_make_isolated but it failed because it could find a config file for fcl.
-- catkin 0.5.74
CMake Error at /opt/ros/groovy/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:72 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "fcl" with any of
  the following names:

    fclConfig.cmake
    fcl-config.cmake

I already installed fcl because fcl.pc is present in /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig.
Is there a way to use it instead of the cmake config file ?

A:

You need to make sure that fcl has installed one of the two .cmake files into the location and that it's on the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH correctly if you want to use a non standard location.

Finally, I added a cmake file base on FindPkgConfig.cmake to make it work.

@Fabien R Could you post your cmake file and where you placed it? I'm also facing the same problem as you are.

It seems that I copied the file to /opt/ros/groovy/share/fcl/cmake and renamed it as fcl-config.cmake.
But a cleaner way is to build fcl source as a package (with check_install for instance) and to use: find_package(PkgConfig)
pkg_check_modules(FCL fcl)
include_directories( ${FCL_INCLUDE_DIRS})
