Q:

Error in building hector_navigation

Good day to all.
I have encounter a few errors while building hector_navigation package.
https://github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/hector_navigation/tree/catkin
I'm using catkin workspace. During catkin_make, I encountered these errors:
CMake Error at /opt/ros/groovy/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:75 (find_package):
  Could not find a configuration file for package costmap_2d.

  Set costmap_2d_DIR to the directory containing a CMake configuration file
  for costmap_2d.  The file will have one of the following names:

    costmap_2dConfig.cmake

Anybody knows how to correct these? Thanks!

A:

Have you made sure to first install all required dependencies? Run a:
rosdep install --from-paths /path/to/your/catkin_ws/src --ignore-src

You might run into issues here as well, as you're running Groovy, which has long been EOL-ed (meaning that it might be that some pkgs that hector_navigation depends on are not available).

OK! I installed the dependencies after building this:
https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/tree/groovy-devel-catkinized (Got costmap_2D and nav_core)
and installed:
$ sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-pcl-conversions
The errors have been solved! Thanks!
