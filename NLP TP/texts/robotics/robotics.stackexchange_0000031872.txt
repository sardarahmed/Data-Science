Q:

Get started with gazebo

Hi all,
I just started to play with ROS and gazebo. I've went through the gazebo tutorial and wanted to move to pr2_gazebo tutorial. But now, I'm have problems of installing pr2_gazebo.
First, I checked out the pr2_simulator at (https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/stacks/pr2_simulator)
Then, I tried
"rosdep install pr2_gazebo",
but got a bunch of error messages (e.g., Failed to find stack for package [joint_trajectory_action]).
Where should I get those dependency packages? I appreciate any pointers to get me started with pr2 simulator.
Thanks!

I ended up with manually download all missing dependency packages, and it seems working now.
