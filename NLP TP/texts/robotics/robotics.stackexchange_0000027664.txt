Q:

How to solve ROS indigo PR2 kinect missing problem?

I run pr2 empty world on ROS Hydro works with kinect.
But I run pr2 empty world on ROS Indigo, the kinect is missing.
I can't see kinect topics and TF.
Even I try to download the latest PR2 description package on my own indigo workspace and compile success, the gazebo PR2 still can't show the kinect.
How to solve this problem?
Thank you very much!
