Q:

gzserver problem > dont open

Hello,
I'm using gazebo-1.9.6 and Ros-Hydro and when I try to run gzserver I've got this message error:
`Exception [Master.cc:50] Unable to start server[Address already in use]. There is probably another Gazebo process running.
Exception [Master.cc:50] Unable to start server[Address already in use]. There is probably another Gazebo process running.`
Anyone can help me with that?
Tkss

A:

Hi,
you have a gazebo server running already. If you cannot see it or don't know how to kill it it it's a background process, try restarting the PC.

Yeah, I've discovered how to kill it, just run ps on the terminal and after that kill (number of gzserver)
