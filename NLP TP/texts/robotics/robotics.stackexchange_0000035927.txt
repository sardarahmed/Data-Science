Q:

turtlebot_node/cmd_vel electric

Hi,
In electric the problem that some nodes publish or subscribe turtlebot_node/cmd_vel or cmd_vel is supposed to be solved, but when I do sudo service turtlebot start the turtlebot node keeps listening to turtlebot_node/cmd_vel instead of cmd_vel.
I've been reeding the code but I can't see where's the problem, there's no remap and where the listener is defined it doesn't have ~ in front, so it's supposed to listen to cmd_vel. Actually, if I ran a roscore and then rosrun turtlebot_node turtlebto_node.py it listens to the correct node. How can I fix it?
Thanks.

did you update your bashrc, are you actually running the electric code or are you still running diamondback. Try env | grep ROS to see what path you are actually running from.

A:

It sounds like your upstart scripts probably haven't been upgraded from diamondback to Electric. I suggest doing the following:
roscd turtlebot_bringup/upstart
sudo ./install.bash <iface>

where  is the name of your ethernet interface (usually wlan0 on most turtlebots).
