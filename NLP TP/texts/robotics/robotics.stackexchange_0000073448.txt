Q:

rospack package not found error

I created a package in catkin workspace and put a publisher.py node inside the src directory of package which worked fine. Then i added another node subscriber.py node and used catkin_make to build. Now when I try to run any of the nodes or find package i am getting above error. Am I missing any step ?
Thanks.

Am I missing any step ?

source /path/to/your/workspace/devel/setup.bash

perhaps?

Thanks it worked, Do I need to type it before running every node ?

No, not every node. Every bash session (or whatever shell you're running). But if you would want, you could add that line to your .bashrc. You'll get errors if that file doesn't exist though.
