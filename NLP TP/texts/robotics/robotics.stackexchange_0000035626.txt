Q:

roslaunch gscam

Hi,
is there any solution to launch gscam from launch file ?
gscam needs to be started directly from bin dir, else it throws errors.
I've found no working solution to changedir from roslauch.
Any idea ?
Thanks and cheers
Christian

Could you guys post your launch files showing how you set the environment variable. I am also having trouble figuring out how to launch gscam from a launch file .. Here is my launch file with the errors im getting..

Yep, I ended up using the  tags as well.

There's a way to set environment variables in your launch file. This is how i've always set the GSCAM_CONFIG environment variable.

I bet it's because roslaunch doesn't use your environment variables, I'm having similar problems with PYTHONPATH.  Did you find a solution?
Comment by John Hoare on 2011-11-14:
As have I, perhaps your GSCAM_CONFIG environment variable is not set to an absolute path?

Give us some details. What sort of errors? I'm pretty sure I've launched gscam automatically in the past...

A:

Use this line of code in your launch file. Set this right after  at the beginning of your launch file . 
Or instead of setting environment variables in the launch file, edit your bash file. So first in terminal  " gedit ~/.bashrc" then add this line somewhere near the bottom of the file "GSCAM_CONFIG="v4l2src device=/dev/video0 ! video/x-raw-rgb ! ffmpegcolorspace" . My web camera was set to video0. Now you should launch gscam without any problems.

You could use image view http://www.ros.org/wiki/image_view/cturtle in order to view the image but if you are looking for something more you might write up a new question regarding your intentions.
