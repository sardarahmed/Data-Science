Q:

Full coverage path planner

I have a differential robot, with a laser Hokuyo, and I want my robot to cover the whole part of a map.
I saw that there is some algorithms but I can't find a code. So have someone already implement such algorithms?
Thank you

Is it really hopeless?

hey @Moda im trying to work on the same algorithm, been really hard getting around it. have you had any progress/luck since the time u asked ur question here? Thanks!

Similar to http://answers.ros.org/question/174998/path-planning-for-sensortool-coverage/ (and a few others listed there)

A:

Do you have a map already or do you want to build a complete map of your environment? In the latter case, you could try the exploration module from: http://wiki.ros.org/nav2d
It completely explores an unknown environment and builds a map using 2D Laser-Scanner.

I already have the map. What I want is that the robot cover the complete map, it must go in every free space of the map.

Then you have to somehow define, which area of the map is covered when the robot moves within the map. But I don't know if something like this exists in ROS.

I concur. I don't know of any code that does this.
Comment by Moda on 2014-07-21:
There is lot of algorithms which deal about that specific issue, so I'm surprise that anybody tried to implement one of this algorithms
Comment by d on 2014-07-27:
is there a ROS package that supports autonomous map building?  for example, we can just place the robot in a room and it begins to build the map by itself vs. teleop control.

Re-exploring a known area was my initial use case for http://wiki.ros.org/frontier_exploration. You can use the client tool to set an exploration boundary in rviz. It can also be used to explore an unknown area with gmapping.

Paul,I find your package is a good job.I'm a newer to ROS and when I use your package I have some trouble that I can't build it.when I use the command catkin_make in the root of my own workspace there are some errors.It says "Could not find a configuration file for package costmap_2d and move_base_m
Comment by herodotus on 2014-09-16:
so can you tell me how to solve the question or how you build this package?Thank you.

So was anyone able to figure out how to cover the complete map and not just part of the map as done in exploration?
Comment by paulbovbel on 2015-02-22:
Please ask a new question instead of resurrecting a ~5 month old one. If you send frontier_exploration a goal with an empty polygon, it should perform an unbounded search.
Comment by gautam2410 on 2015-03-06:
The same question has been asked here so I am not posting a new question. Can you please explain how to give the goal with an empty polygon? By unbounded search do you mean the total map coverage?
