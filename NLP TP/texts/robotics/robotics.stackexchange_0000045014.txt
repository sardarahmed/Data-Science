Q:

Gazebo world from heightmap in Electric/Fuerte

I have built some contoured worlds in Gazebo using heightmaps but all on Diamondback.  In order to get some more advanced robot models, I had to upgrade to Electric but now all of my heightmap launch files crash.  I have gone through the tutorials again and still can't get a heightmap to build a world in Gazebo successfully still.  Also tried on a Fuerte build with same error.
Anyone successfully gotten a heightmap world in Electric/Fuerte Gazebo?  If so I would like to see your .world and launch file.
Thanks.

A:

I seem to remember that heightmap support was broken in electric but has been re-added in recent gazebo (1.0+) versions. There also is a tutorial on using height maps on the new gazebo wiki, so that might be worth a try.
An alternative approach I used in our hector_gazebo_worlds package is the use of a COLLADA terrain mesh generated using blender. This works both in electric and fuerte.

No luck with the heightmap tutorial.  Was able to use your hector package and the "rolling terrain" world looks great.  I have messed with COLLADA / Blender (creating mesh .dae from heightmap) but was eventually squashed by the learning curve.  Any way to simply sculpt an existing mesh in Blender?
