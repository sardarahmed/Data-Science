A:

Nothing stupid about this.

You don't install .bag files. They are essentially data files, which contain data you can use with other programs or tools.
So any place on your computer would be OK, as long as the tools/programs you'd like to use with the file can access it.

I save it in downloades.

that would be an OK place.
