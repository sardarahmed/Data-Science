Q:

My collision element is defaulting to a circle of 1 meter in rviz

My collision element is defaulting to a circle of 1 meter in rviz. I specify all collision elements for a box .4x.2 with wheels .05 length on either side of the .2 out .05 from the sides making it .4 x .4 total.
When I select the collision check box in the Robot Model tab in RVIZ it shows a circle of  1 meter radius.
