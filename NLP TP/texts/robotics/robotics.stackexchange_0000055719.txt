Q:

Best way to view RVIZ remotely

Hello,
I am trying to remotely control a Husky to do SLAM. I want to control the Husky using RVIZ, but am running into a problem with RVIZ lagging. I looked at the networking tutorial on the wiki, set the IP, HOSTNAME, and MASTER_URI, and have an SSH agent set up between the laptops. I can get rviz to open but it lags horribly. I tested the code locally on the husky to ensure that the problem  was not on the husky's end, and it ran fine. Is there a better way to run rviz remotely?
Thanks

A:

Do you mean RViz as a GUI lags? Then you might need a better graphics card. If the data shown lags, you need a better wifi or choose less/other/compressed topics
