Q:

Kalman filter model values or state space original value? Which values to use?

I am using L3GD20 and I am trying to implement a kalman filter for it on the stm32f3 discovery board. I have though a few questions about that:

After the filter gave me the values, do I have to make an average between them and those of the original model or should I use them as they are?
According to this document, we don't use the original state space vectors in the filter, so how could we have "correct" space state estimated values?

A:

To apply Kalman filter successfully, you need two requirements namely the system must be linear (i.e. both the motion and observation models) and the noise to be Gaussian with zero mean and some variance besides the models must be specified accurately. Kalman filter is a time domain recursive filter. Meeting these requirements, Kalman filter is one of the best filters to go, so you don't need to average the filtered data. This answers your first question.  For the second question, I didn't read the attached pdf, Kalman filter estimates your state vector. I don't understand what do you mean by saying "we don't use the original state space vectors"?
