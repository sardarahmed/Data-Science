Q:

Gazebo4 packages installed with rosdep

Hello everyone,
Short version: Is there any way I can install gazebo4_ros related packages (msgs, plugins, ros_control and ros) with rosdep? Thank you!
Long version
I want to use Gazebo 4 together with ROS Indigo. I has to manually install the gazebo4 and gazebo ROS related packages and it is working properly. However, I would like to know if there is any way to setup the package.xml of my package so that these packages are automatically installed with rosdep.
If I include
<build_depend>gazebo_ros</build_depend> 
<build_depend>gazebo_plugins</build_depend>

I get the following error when running rosdep:
 ros-indigo-gazebo-ros : Depends: gazebo2 but it is not going to be installed
                         Depends: libsdformat1 but it is not going to be installed

Which is expected because I already have Gazebo 4. And if I include
    <build_depend>gazebo4_ros</build_depend> 
    <build_depend>gazebo4_plugins</build_depend>

Then it fails because rosdep cannot find those packages.

A:

As gazebo is a system dependency, you would need to add it to the rosdep definitions, which are used to lookup the respective packages.
There is a how-to about contributing rosdep rules.
But I'm not sure how this would be handled by the maintainers, as it actually introduces depedency conflicts between different packages. This is out of my league ;-)
