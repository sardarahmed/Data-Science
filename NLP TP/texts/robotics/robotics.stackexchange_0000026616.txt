Q:

Robot-Plugin is Loaded again when spawning another Robot

Hi,
I recognized that every time I spawn more than one robot using gazebo_ros_pkgs the Plugins of the already spawned robots are reloaded (load is called again...).
Is this supposed to happen, or am I doing something wrong?
For a very small test I reduced my current launch file to this:
https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6104031
And start it with:
roslaunch my_bot_gazebo test.launch robot_name:=test1 robot_namespace:=test1 x:=10
roslaunch my_bot_gazebo test.launch robot_name:=test2 robot_namespace:=test2 x:=-10
I'm working with Gazebo1.9.5/ROS-Groovy

I know this might be not the best thread to post this, but the multi-instance problem is probably related to a namespace (topic name) in your robot URDF file. You will need to override this when adding more than one instance, either by overriding certain parameters in the call, or by creating slightly modified URDF files to override the namespace settings.

This happens with all of my robots even if I put the robotNamespace in the urdf explizitly and even with different urdfs(different robots all using different namespaces for their plugins).
btw: you can avoid the robotNamespace in the URDF-plugin part by using the -robot_namespace argument when calling spawn_model

A:

The Problem was related to a Bug in the SDFFormat's urdf parser
Seems like Plugin Elements referencing the robot itself had been copied to all other robots...
The Problem is fixed in the current release...
I will mark this question as solved...
