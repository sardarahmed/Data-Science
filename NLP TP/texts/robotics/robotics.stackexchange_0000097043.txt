A:

There are now install instructions for py3-ready here: https://github.com/osrf/py3-ready#install
In short: install Debian package dependencies matching the default version of python on your system.
Python 2 (Ubuntu Bionic, Debian Stretch, etc)
$ sudo apt-get install python-apt python-rosdep-modules python-catkin-pkg-modules
$ pip install py3-ready

Python 3 (Ubuntu Focal, Debian Buster, etc)
$ sudo apt-get install python3-apt python3-rosdep-modules python3-catkin-pkg-modules
$ pip install py3-ready
