Q:

Bandwith use of ros topic

Hi,
I'm going to run my ros system on multiple computers, connected only by a wifi link of (possibly) bad quality. However I want to use data from multiple usb web cams.
I'm wondering how ros distributes the various message on the network and if it makes a difference where roscore is located.
Example Scenario:
Machine 1:
  Node 1:
    outgoing topics:
      camera1/image_raw
      camera1/image_compressed

Machine 2:
  Node 2:
    outgoing topics:
      camera2/image_raw
      camera2/image_compressed

Machine 3:
  Node 3.1:
    incoming topics:
      camera1/image_raw
      camera2/image_raw
    outgoing topics:
      control/steering
      control/debug

  Node 3.1:
    incoming topics:
      camera1/image_raw
      control/steering

Which messages are actually send?

Do the camera*/image_compressed topics take up bandwith, even though they are never subscribed to?

is camera1/image_raw send twice over the network?

is camera2/image_raw also send to machine 1?

Does it matter whether roscore is started on machine 1 or machine 3?

A:

Each message is sent pairwise over a TCP connection, directly from the publisher to each subscriber.

Messages that are actually subscribed

No.

Yes. I believe there are ways to avoid that.

No.

Mostly not.

Re 3): You can use http://www.ros.org/wiki/topic_tools/relay on machine 3 to have a local node that republishes the incoming images, so that other local nodes can subscribe to that relay instead of the topic published by machine 1.
