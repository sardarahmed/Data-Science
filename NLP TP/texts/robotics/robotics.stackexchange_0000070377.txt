A:

AFAIK, there are four easy ways for you.
i. publish each of path
If your paths isn't too much, I suggest you set name for each of path and publish that.
ii. marker array
Follow the Javier's answer.
iii. polygon array
Install jsk_rviz_plugins and then you will can be visualize polygon array type on RViz.

iv. path array
Creating new display plugin for custom path array message like nav_msgs/Path[].
