Q:

OpenCV Error when running image_transport republish node

Hello,
I have an Ubuntu 11.10 and Ros electric.
I try to convert an Compressed image that comes from axis_camera to image, I have used :
rosrun image_transport republish compressed in:=/axis_camera _image_transport:=compressed raw out:=/axis_camera/image
And I got this error:
OpenCV Error: Null pointer (NULL array pointer is passed) in cvGetMat, file
/home/parisa/OpenCV-2.3.1/modules/core/src/array.cpp,
line 2382
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'cv::Exception'
what():/home/parisa/OpenCV-2.3.1/modules/core/src/array.cpp,line 2382:
error: (-27) NULL array pointer is passed in function cvGetMat
Aborted
Actually, there is no such file or directory in my laptop /home/parisa/OpenCV-2.3.1/modules/core/src/array.cpp
Anybody can help me?
Thank you

A:

I had a similiar problem while working on the android_core/android_camera_tutorial. It turned out that some malformed images were being published. I suggest looking into the axis_camera node and make sure that it's publishing good data.
