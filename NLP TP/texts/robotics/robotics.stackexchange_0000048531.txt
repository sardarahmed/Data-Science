Q:

add rosdep rule

Hi everyone,
because of this question, I would like to add a rosdep rule for octomap_mapping -> ros-fuerte-octomap-mapping. I went to the rosdep page and read the instructions on how to do it. I created a github account, read the instructions there, forked the directory, added it to my local github sources, used google to find out how to use git to get a local checkout of a github repository and browsed through the rosdep/base.yaml and releases/fuerte.yaml.
Now I am stuck because I don't know how to add the rule. The existing octomap rules in releases/fuerte.yaml are cryptic to me and the rules in base.yaml never reference a ros-fuerte-xxx package. I am a bit frustrated about the time lost at the entry barrier. Any suggestions how to get it done quickly?

A:

If octomap is in releases/fuerte.yaml make sure you have the line:
gbpdistro https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/raw/master/releases/fuerte.yaml fuerte

in your rosdep sources
And make sure to set ROS_DISTRO=fuerte
Such that you will get the following:
$ ROS_DISTRO=fuerte rosdep resolve octomap
#apt
ros-fuerte-octomap
