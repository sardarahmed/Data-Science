Q:

extract_images dropping frames

Dear All
I have noticed that when I used the extract_images in image_view pkg to extract images from a bag file, it drops frames.
Even if I set the "sec_per_frame" close to zero like 0.0000000000001 or modify the code that do not consider delay in line :
if(delay >= sec_per_frame_)
still the number of frames which is extracted is less than the actual recorded frames ?
I noticed this by extracting the header information directly from a bag file and find the number of frames in bag file is greater than number of frames from extract_images.
I appreciate your help.

This is worth reporting as a bug (if you haven't already):

A:

just to update. I ended up writing my own code based on the current extract_images. I remove the delay part and I saved all the images to the disk. The problem is with the way the delay is set and if the frame rate is too high it keeps dropping frames!
