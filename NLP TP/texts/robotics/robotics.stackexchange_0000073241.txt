Q:

Can't install ROS on Raspberry Pi 3

I'm following this tutorial on how to install ROS on an ARM device.
Part of the problem is that Ubuntu 14.04 is not an install option for Raspberry Pi 3. What they support is Ubuntu MATE (15.04). Any ideas of how to get around this?
The error:
$ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-ros-base
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 ros-indigo-ros-base : Depends: ros-indigo-actionlib but it is not going to be installed
                       Depends: ros-indigo-bond-core but it is not going to be installed
                       Depends: ros-indigo-class-loader but it is not going to be installed
                       Depends: ros-indigo-dynamic-reconfigure but it is not going to be installed
                       Depends: ros-indigo-nodelet-core but it is not going to be installed
                       Depends: ros-indigo-pluginlib but it is not going to be installed
                       Depends: ros-indigo-ros-core but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

If you get desperate, you could install ubuntu 14.04 within a chroot environment. http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingIndigoInChroot

A:

You can't install packages that are intended for 14.04 on a different version of Ubuntu. There will be version conflicts and missing dependencies.
There are already four other questions that address this issue. Perhaps one of their solutions will work for you?
