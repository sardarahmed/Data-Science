Welcome! What command did you run to get this error?

A:

Did you install the package you mentioned? If you want to install the package you mentioned, you can simply install it with the following command.
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-gazebo-ros

Also, when building packages from source, It is recommended to use the rosdep command. This command installs all the packages that the packages in your catkin workspace depend upon but are missing on your computer.
rosdep install --from-paths /path/to/your/catkin_ws/src --ignore-src -r -y
