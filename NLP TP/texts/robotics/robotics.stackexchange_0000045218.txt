Q:

TurtleBot Output Power

I would like to power an PhantomX arm from my recently purchased turtlebot but there is only one power output. In the wiring tutorial for the the turtlebot arm it shows a power board+ that has three outputs the presumably correspond to the three breakers in the turtlebot dashboard. I cannot find any information on building my own or purchasing a power board+. Do these exist? If not what would be the best way to go about powering the arm from the turtlebot?

A:

I don't believe the Powerboard+ was ever produced.
