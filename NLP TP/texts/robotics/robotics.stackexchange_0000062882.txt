Q:

NO cmd_vel on rqt graph

i want to navigate P3AT robot spawned in usarsim through teleop_twist_keyboard package (in ROS).
I have connected ros to usarsim using executive_usarsim package and spawned the P3AT robot in usarsim, but when i run teleop_twist_keyboard and presses keys to move the robot, nothing happens. please help me out.

cmd_vel is not published so its not on rqt_graph. try rostopic info cmd_vel to see topic publishers and subcribers

hello, @bvbdort . from rostopic info cmd_vel.
publisher: teleop_twist_keyboard

subscriber: None

since no one is subscriber.
i want executive_usarsim to be a subscriber.
here is the rqt graph obtained.

Are you sure that executive_usarsim is subscribing to cmd_vel topic? You may wanna view "All Nodes and Topics" in rqt_graph (Upper left drop down menu) or check it using rostopic list. Also, check your launch file if you are using remap to change topic names.

i am using usarsim_inf & it works fine.

A:

hi @sumant,
you executive_usarsim node is not subscribing to the /cmd_vel topic that's why it is not shown in you rqt_graph.
you can do following things to drive robot:-

Check, on which topic your executive_usarsim node is expected to receive twist message and remap the teleop_twist_keyboard from /cmd_vel to the identified topic.

Use usarsim_inf insted of executive_usarsim.
