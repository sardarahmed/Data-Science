Q:

jsk-ros-pkg "configuring incomplete" errors occured

After installing jsk_common, which included the install of jsk_recognition and jsk_libfreenect2, did a source ~/ros/hydro/devel/setup.bash, complied by executing catkin_make in the catkin work folder ~/ros/hyro. After considerable script activity, following error message appeared.
[roseus.cmake] compile installed package sound_play
-- Using these message generators: gencpp;geneus;genlisp;genpy
-- +++ processing catkin package: 'jsk_2014_06_pr2_drcbox'
-- ==> add_subdirectory(jsk-ros-pkg/jsk_demos/jsk_2014_06_pr2_drcbox)
-- +++ processing catkin package: 'jsk_rosjava_messages'
-- ==> add_subdirectory(jsk-ros-pkg/jsk_smart_apps/jsk_rosjava_messages)
-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
Invoking "cmake" failed.

No other error messages. Is there a log file to review for more detail?
openjdk-6-jre and openjdk-7-jre are installed

A:

What exactly did you do around "After considerable script activity`, in particular what was the last command you ran?
Also, many of jsk-* packages are actively maintained and available as DEB. Installable by apt-get install ros-hydro-jsk-common for example.

Hi. 1) Installed "jsk_common" with the command "wget -q -o /tmp/jsk.rosbuild https://...". as listed in the "github/jsk-ros-pkg/  jsk_common" README.md, 2) in "~/ros/hydro/" folder, catkin_make.
I'll try install jsk-common and jsk_recognition from DEB.

Just installed ros-hydro-jsk-common & jsk-recognition into hydro/opt/share, but there is no DEB "ros-hydro-jsk-freenect2" pkg, What package shud I install equivalent to the jsk-libfreenect2?
Comment by 130s on 2014-09-11:
jsk_freenect2 looks like not included in DEB yet. I asked on its dev repository.
