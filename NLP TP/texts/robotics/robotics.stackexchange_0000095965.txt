I believe you've run into the UpstreamPackages. The correct package name for rosbash would be: ros-noetic-rosbash, not rosbash. Same for Catkin: it's ros-noetic-catkin, not catkin.

Thank you very much for your reply.I tried it according to what you said, but it all shows the latest version.It didn't work.

I am also having the same problem, this didn't work. Are there any solutions rather then reinstalling?
Comment by ylh on 2020-05-26:
I am a novice, the principle of the error  is not clear, so I have no other solution.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2020-05-27:
@Aysusya : please post a new question if you haven't done so already. If it turns out your problem does indeed have the same cause as @ylh's, it'll be closed as a duplicate.
Please provide sufficient information in your question: which commands did you use to install rosbash? Verbatim copies of any error messages, etc.

A:

I solved it.I deleted all workspaces which be created before installing ros-noetic ,and uninstall ros-noetic ,then,reinstalled  the ros-noetic .Everything is working fine!
