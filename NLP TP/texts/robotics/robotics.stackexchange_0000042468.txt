Q:

Getting the position and the pose of robot using tf_listener

I'm trying to get position and orientation of the robot calculated by gmapping.
I used this question link text and tutorial
link text as a reference.
I can get the robot position using tf::Transform::getOrigin() which is /map -> /base_link transform.
However the robot angle obtained from tf::Transform::getRotation()::getAngle() is only from 0 to π.
To determine the angle of the robot from 0 to 2π, What should I do?

A:

Use tf::getYaw:
tf::getYaw(transform.getRotation());
