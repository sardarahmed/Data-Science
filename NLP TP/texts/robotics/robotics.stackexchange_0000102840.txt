Q:

What is the difference in how you assign these node parameters? (C++)

I have a node and I want assign 2 parameters from the Parameter Server. They are both strings:
nh.param("robot_frame", robotFrame, std::string("/base_link"));
nh.param<std::string>("world_frame", worldFrame, "/map");

When I compile, everything is OK. What I'm curious about is what is the underlying difference on how these 2 parameters are assigned? Or there is no difference at all?
Thanks!

A:

Both versions call the same templated method in nh. For the first version, the c++ compiler will guess the typename by looking at the types of the 2nd and 3rd arguments.
P.S. Unrelated to your question, but for years now, the ros convention is to not use a leading slash on a frame name.
