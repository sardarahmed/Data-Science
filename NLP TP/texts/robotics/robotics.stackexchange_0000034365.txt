Q:

pioneer2dx teleop in Gazebo

Dear all,
http://robotics.usc.edu/ros/category/stacks/p2os says that a working drivable urdf model of the Pioneer2dx for gazebo/rviz is released.
How can I teleoperate a pioneer robot in a Gazebo simulation?
I could visualize the pioneer robot both in gazebo and in rviz using,
roslaunch p2os_urdf pioneer3dx_urdf.launch
roslaunch p2os_urdf pioneer3dx.gazebo.launch
What should I do next?
By the way, after launching from above launch files, after few minutes, the robot automatically starts moving. Why is that?
Thank you in advance
CS

@Peshala : After those 2 commands, my robot did not move at all ! ......

A:

You could try the pr2_teleop package, or the erratic_teleop package. Both of these allow you to issue cmd_vel messages via the keyboard. The erratic_teleop node provides linear x and angular z commands, which are all that you need for the Pioneer.

Unfortunately, I could not recreate that error for you. Try using "rostopic echo /cmd_vel" and see if anything appears. Maybe you could also use rxgraph to check if anything is publishing to the wrong topics.

Thank you for your reply. However, as I mentioned, the robot starts moving automatically and it cant be controlled from key board.
