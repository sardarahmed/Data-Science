Q:

How to use source code from Arduino in ROS?

Hi everyone,
I am new with ROS and at the moment I am trying to use my sorce from the Arduino robot in ROS.
It is an Arduino robot 4WD that consits these modules : mega2560,Ethernet, motor driver, sensor shield. The functionality of te robot works fine.
I have already tried these hello world example from ros, which worked fine.
Can someone help me out?
I would appreciate for any help.
Thanks ,
Best regards Johan

Thx for the advice, It works fine. I worked through some of the tutorials and I realize that I always have to use these commands:

roscore
rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py
rostopic pub Roll std_msgs/ Empty --once.

Are there other ways to control the robot?

Trying reading up on ROS to help your understanding.  With rosserial, you can have publishers and subscribers on Arduino.  You can add sub that takes in data lets say cmd_vel and publish odometry data such as encoders.  Whenever you publish to cmd_vel  that data will be used by the Arduino.
