Q:

How does one update a ROS package with a different source and repo considering one does not have access to the old repo?

Pocketsphinx has a package for ROS which is no longer maintained and has not been updated in many years. Now, I am working on an updated version of ROS package of pocketshpinx for the parent organization, CMUSphinx.
The package can be found here: http://wiki.ros.org/pocketsphinx
The old repo is present here: https://github.com/mikeferguson/pocketsphinx
While the new one is here: https://github.com/Pankaj-Baranwal/pocketsphinx/

Then please close the question. And another advice: please write shorter titles on your questions :-)
