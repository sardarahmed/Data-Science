Q:

Autocomplete not working anymore

Hi. When I first installed ROS Groovy, most of its commands had autocomplete and I found it very useful.
For some reason, autocomplete of ros command arguments (topic, service, package and node names) is not working any more. Any ideas how to get it to work again?

Could you try a clean shell where you don't source specific files and set no environment variables and the just source /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash (assuming you use bash) and see if it works. (For me amd64/groovy updated today completion works).

What lines in the setup.bash script are responsible for tab completion? In some of my nodes, rosrun doesn't tab complete and I'd like to debug upwards from the root of the problem.

A:

Autocompletion is activated using setup.bash instead of setup.sh.

Thanks, that information helped.

Doesn't setup.bash just source the setup.sh file?
