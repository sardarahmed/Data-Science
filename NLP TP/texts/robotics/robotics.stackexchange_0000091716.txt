Q:

Posearray bigger on rviz

So I have a a list of poses that I use Posearray to publish to a topic. This works fine on rviz and I can see the arrows of each Pose. But I would like it to be easier to see, so making it bigger is needed. How can you make a Posearray arrow bigger?

A:

If you expand the poseArray item in the left hand panel in RVIZ you will see options to control the size of the chosen marker type. Arrow length in the case of arrows, or more options in the case of 3D arrows or axes.
