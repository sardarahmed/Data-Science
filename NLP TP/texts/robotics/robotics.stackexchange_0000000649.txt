Q:

Does RRT* guarantee asymptotic optimality for a minimum clearance cost metric?

The optimal sampling-based motion planning algorithm $\text{RRT}^*$ (described in this paper) has been shown to yield collision-free paths which converge to the optimal path as planning time increases. However, as far as I can see, the optimality proofs and experiments have assumed that the path cost metric is Euclidean distance in configuration space. Can $\text{RRT}^*$ also yield optimality properties for other path quality metrics, such as maximizing minimum clearance from obstacles throughout the path?
To define minimum clearance: for simplicity, we can consider a point robot moving about in Euclidean space. For any configuration $q$ that is in the collision-free configuration space, define a function $d(q)$ which returns the distance between the robot and the nearest C-obstacle. For a path $\sigma$, the minimum clearance $\text{min_clear}(\sigma)$ is the minimum value of $d(q)$ for all $q \in \sigma$. In optimal motion planning, one might wish to maximize minimum clearance from obstacles along a path. This would mean defining some cost metric $c(\sigma)$ such that $c$ increases as the minimum clearance decreases. One simple function would be $c(\sigma) = \exp(-\text{min_clear}(\sigma))$.
In the first paper introducing $\text{RRT}^*$, several assumptions are made about the path cost metric so that the proofs hold; one of the assumptions concerned additivity of the cost metric, which doesn't hold for the above minimum clearance metric. However, in the more recent journal article describing the algorithm, several of the prior assumptions weren't listed, and it seemed that the minimum clearance cost metric might also be optimized by the algorithm.
Does anyone know if the proofs for the optimality of $\text{RRT}^*$ can hold for a minimum clearance cost metric (perhaps not the one I gave above, but another which has the same minimum), or if experiments have been performed to support the algorithm's usefulness for such a metric?

A:

*Note, $a|b$ is the concatenation of paths $a$ and $b$. Then $c(\cdot)$ defined as the minimum clearance implies $c(a|b)=min(c(a),c(b))$
You refer to (in reference 1):

Theorem 11: (Additivity of the Cost Function.)
  For all
  $\sigma_1$,$\sigma_2$ $\in X_{free}$
  , the cost function c satisÔ¨Åes the following:
  $c(\sigma_1|\sigma_2) = c(\sigma_1) + c(\sigma_2)$

Which has become (in reference 3, Problem 2): 

The cost function is assumed to be monotonic, in the sense that
  for all $\sigma_1,\sigma_2\in\Sigma:c(\sigma_1)\leq c(\sigma_1|\sigma_2)$

Which is still not the case for minimum clearance distance. 
Update: Given the relaxed restriction on path costs, your suggested exp(-min_clearance) seems fine.
