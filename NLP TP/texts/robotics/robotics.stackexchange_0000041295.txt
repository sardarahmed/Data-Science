Q:

(sub)sample point cloud images rviz

Hi all,
I'm trying to do a simple GUI with Rviz and my kinect, I uncommented the line to use Rviz in kinect+rgbdslam.launch file:
<node pkg="rviz" type="rviz" name="rviz" args="-d $(find rgbdslam)/launch/rviz_config.vcg" respawn="false" output="log" > </node>

I was "playing" with the configuration of Rviz and when I tried to add a pointscloud2 image (like enable Blue or White Display in rviz_config.vcg), but my Rviz application is freezing and I have to kill it because I cant do anything more.
I think it's because /camera/rgb/points or /camera/depth/points are sending too much datas and that's why I would like to subsampling it, by taking one image on two or even more. Does that it make sens to anyone? and is there a tutorial about rviz_config file?
Thanks for your help, I didn't find anything on this subject.
Cheers
Brioche
PS: I'm using electric on ubuntu 11.04.

A:

In addition to throttling the topic as @Felix Endres suggested, you could use a VoxelGrid filter to reduce the number of points in each message.

There's a tutorial that gives an example of using a VoxelGrid for downsampling: http://www.ros.org/wiki/pcl_ros/Tutorials/VoxelGrid%20filtering

Thanks a lot, it's almost working perfectly. I'm now going to try to use octo_server.
