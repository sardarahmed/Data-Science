Q:

ROS FUERTE install

Hi everyone,
I'm having troubles when I try to install ROS FUERTE in Ubuntu 14.04. I already have installed ROS INDIGO and I need to install ROS FUERTE.
I follow the page's steps:

Setup source.list
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu precise main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'

Setup keys
wget http://packages.ros.org/ros.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -

Update

Result of the last is:
Doesn't exist available public key to ID
Imposible to get : http://ppa.launchpad.net/beineri/opt-qt541-trusty/ubuntu/dists/trusty/main/binary-amd64/Packages  404  Not Found
Imposible to get:  http://ppa.launchpad.net/beineri/opt-qt541-trusty/ubuntu/dists/trusty/main/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found
Finally when I try:
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-desktop-full
The result is:
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

A:

To start, ROS Fuerte is no longer supported. You should make a strong effort to use a newer version of ROS.
As described in the fuerte installation instructions, Fuerte was only supported on Ubuntu 10.04, 11.10 and 12.04. This means that the compiled binary packages for Fuerte will have dependencies that are specific to those versions of Ubuntu, and they won't work with newer Ubuntu versions.
It may be possible to build Fuerte from source on Ubuntu 14.04, but you will likely run into compatibility issues with some of the dependencies, since dependencies such as PCL have changed considerably between Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04.
