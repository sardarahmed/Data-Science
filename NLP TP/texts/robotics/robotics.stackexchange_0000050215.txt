Q:

Sudden break down of Kinect?

I was using rviz and roboearth when suddenly the image view went black.
The terminal of openni.launch showed a red sentence "depth image frame id does not match rgb image frame id".
I closed the terminal and opened a new one and then roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch but it said "No devices connected... waiting for devices to be connected".
I reboot the computer a few times, sudo apt-get install ros-electric-openni-kinect, but the problem persists.
Up till this morning the Kinect has been running normally. I really have no idea what happened. Is it due to auto-update? Anyone please help?
Turtlebot laptop: Ubuntu 10.04; ROS Electric
Workstation: Ubuntu 12.04; ROS Fuerte (I have another one in Ubuntu 10.04 and ROS Electric. I tried but the problem remains unsolved.)
The Kinect shows a flashing green light. But when I type lsusb, I saw only one device from Microsoft and one from Chronicity. Is it normal or not?

Remove USB and restart and connect back only when you do rviz. I had the same problem.

Thank you very much. I tried that but it still says No devices connected.

A:

Solved. Power supply problem from the iRobot Create base.
