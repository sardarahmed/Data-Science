Q:

can we change the topic name to something else other than chatter when publishing and subscribing messages?

I created a publisher in python and a listener in rosjava. I sent hello world under topic "chatter" from talker.py to listener.java. But when I changed the topic from "chatter" to  "uic", the publisher publishes the message but the listener doesnot receive anything. I can see the following in my terminal and see that the listener is still subscribing to the chatter topic even after i changed it in listener.java code.
INFO: Response<Success, Subscribed to [/chatter], []>
Jan 17, 2014 11:55:35 AM org.ros.internal.node.topic.DefaultSubscriber$1 onMasterRegistrationSuccess
INFO: Subscriber registered: Subscriber<Topic<TopicIdentifier, TopicDescription<std_msgs/String, 992ce8a1687cec8c8bd883ec73ca41d1>>>
Why is my listener still subscribing to topic chatter even after i changed it in the code?
I edited this line in the code where I changed chatter to uic:
Subscriber<std_msgs.String> subscriber =
connectedNode.newSubscriber("uic", std_msgs.String._TYPE);

A:

It looks like you've updated the code correctly.
Java is a compiled language; did you recompile your listener after you changed it?
