Q:

Gumstix, caspa camera and Ubuntu 11.04

Hi,
Is there any previous work done with this combination? Ubuntu on Gumstix is running (GNU/Linux 2.6.36 armv7l). Also would the ROS ucv_camera package be useful for camera access or maybe there are some other better options?
Thanks

A:

Ubuntu 11.04 can be made to work with Gumstix Caspa camera by using Angstrom kernel 2.6.34. I build rootfs /dev/sdb2 part of SD card by using rootstock utility following these instructions:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/gumros/ubuntu
And for /dev/sdb1 I used Caspa camera compatible set of uImage, u-boot and MLO. Make sure you have mt9v032.ko driver at /lib/modules/2.6.34/kernel/drivers/media/video folder.
Good third party webpage for overall info related gumstix
Usable command to check which modules you have installed in kernel is lsmod.
