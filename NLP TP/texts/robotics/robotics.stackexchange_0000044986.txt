Q:

Is there any workspace analysis tool in ROS for a robot arm?

I have a 7 DOF robot arm and i want to use it to do table top manipulations. so firstly i want to do a workspace analysis for the arm so that i can know how to place the table such that the arm can reach any point of the table. i've tried a brute-force way, that is, to increase each joint's rotation by a certain step and then use FK to get a position. but since my arm is of 7 DOF, this method is very very slow and the final result contains too many data for matlab to display. i also know that there is a monto-carlo based method, but don't know how to realize it. so i just wonder if there is any tool/package in ROS to do the workspace analysis. it would be even better to show the workspace in rviz.
Thanks.

A:

I'm not sure about the availability of what you request for ROS/rviz (hopefully someone else will shed light on this), but OpenRAVE offers functionality for this. It is pretty easy to convert a URDF based robot arm to the OpenRAVE format, so you could give that a shot. I covered the conversion process as part of a answer here.
See also the kinematicreachability OpenRAVE docs and the other database generators.
