Q:

Tutorial question 'Using rosmsg' error

Hello,
I have been going through the tutorials for the first time, but got stuck on the 'Using rosmsg' section.  The command is :  rosmsg show beginner_tutorials/Num, and the error is
Unable to load msg [beginner_tutorials/Num]: Cannot locate message [Num]: unknown package [beginner_tutorials] on search path [ ... 

I tried re-making the package and carefully reviewed the instructions.  I haven't had any other error until now.  Some further information:

the command: rossrv show beginner_tutorials/AddTwoInts gives a similar error.

I am sightly confused over the code section that says:

Also make sure you export the message runtime dependency.

catkin_package(

  ...
  CATKIN_DEPENDS message_runtime ...
  ...)

Am I supposed to just uncomment this line only?  I notice in the CMakeLists.txt there are a lot of other 'instructions', I have been ignoring them I assume this is correct?
-I am running Ubuntu 16.04 on VirtualBox, I haven't had any issues with it.
The forum won't let me upload files yet.  Thanks for your help.

Hey, were you able to resolve this? If not, can you please edit your question to add your full CMakeLists.txt?

Yes I was, thanks.

A:

I had to resource source devel/setup.bash from the catkin workspace and remake.
