Q:

Automating migration from fuerte to indigo

I'd like to automate(or semi-automate) this process http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/migrating_from_rosbuild
I'm surprised as there are no scripts available for this. Has someone tried it before?
I'm on the lookout for where was someone(or I might get) stuck while trying to achieve this.

A:

There are several tools for automating this procedure. On the page you originally linked they discuss the "catkinize" scripts.
Generally after using them, you still need to do a bit of manual editing, but they are a decent place to begin.

Thanks! I skimmed through the page and missed that section, heh.
