Q:

Turtlebot Gazebo Groovy

I have read that the turtlebot gazebo simulator was broken.  Is it still broken?  Any time frame for it to be fixed?  Does anyone have a turtlebot (or even an icreate) working with gazebo?
Thanks.

A:

Due to the fast development of Gazebo we haven't been able to implement a stable Turtlebot simulation for Groovy yet. We are currently targeting Hydro for that. If we get it working earlier, we will send a notification out on the TurtleBot SIG mailing list. Join it to stay up to date!
