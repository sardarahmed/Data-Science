Q:

Avoid long first start of gazebo

Hello everybody,
I want to do some automatic test with Gazebo on a cloud machine.
Probem is : first start of Gazebo is too long and make test fail
Is there a way to avoid this behavior ? (Is there a way of avoiding contact with model repository ?)
And also is there a way to know if Gazebo has already been launched ?

A:

You can manually install the model repository. Clone the repo into .gazebo/models.
