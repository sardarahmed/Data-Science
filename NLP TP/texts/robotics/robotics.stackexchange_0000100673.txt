Q:

ros2 bag record Regex

Hello,
I'm trying to record certain topics using ros2 bag record -a. The topics have different namespaces: /uuid21, /uuid22 and /uuid23. How do I select one namespace?
Thanks.

A:

Hi, I typically use a launch file with the following:
<node pkg="rosbag" type="record" name="rosbag_record_sensors" output="screen"
      args="--buffsize=0 
            -e '(.*)you_want_this(.*)|(.*)and_this(.*)'
            -x '(.*)you_dont_want_this(.*)|(.*)neither_that(.*)'"/>

Separation is done using |.
