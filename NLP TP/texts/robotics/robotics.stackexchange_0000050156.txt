Q:

Two "orocos kdl" packages

In /opt/ros/groovy/share there are two folders with near identical names: orocos_kdl and orocos-kdl.
orocos_kdl contains:
cmake and package.xml
orocos-kdl contains:
orocos-kdl-config.cmake
I'm not sure which I should use to install. I'm leaning towards orocos_kdl as it looks more like what I'd expect as I'm going through the catkin tutorials.
Any guidance is much appreciated.

What do you mean by "use to install"? What are you trying to do exactly?

A:

Both folders you see result from the same source package, being orocos_kdl The orocos-kdl folder is the result of some legacy installation method from before the ROS era, if you are using ROS you should use the orocos_kdl folder since this is the name of the package. This discrepancy will be solved in hydro.
