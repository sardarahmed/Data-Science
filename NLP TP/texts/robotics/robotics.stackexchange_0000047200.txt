Q:

roslib does not exist!

I am new to ros and am still following the tutorials. I was following "Writing a Simple Publisher and Subscriber (Python)", but when I try to compile the code it shows "ImportError: No module named roslib".
I have ensured that PYTHONPATH contains $ROS_ROOT/core/roslib/src. But when I go to the file system, $ROS_ROOT/core is there, but roslib and src do not exist.
System Information:
Using the fuerte Ubuntu VirtualBox Image.
N.B. ROS_ROOT is /opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros

A:

Actually the problem has been resolved now.
I was trying to run the talker.py code like you would normally run python codes. I realized later that you have to call make for it to run.
