Q:

Unable to build dependancy with package in stack

Hi and thanks for a great forum!
This is my first question, hope I have the correct tags and so forth.
So, I am trying to build a launch package connecting several packages. Building dependancies and launching nodes directly under the catkin_ws works fine but when I try to depend to "sicktoolbox_pls_wrapper" I receive:

Cmake Error at /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:83 (find_package):
Could not find a package configuration file provided by "sicktoolbox_pls_wrapper" with any of the following names:
sicktoolbox_pls_wrapperConfig.cmake
sicktoolbox_pls_wrapper-config.cmake

The package is found with roscd and rospack find, I can also run the nodes in sicktoolbox_pls_wrapper with rosrun. Could the fact that the package is found in a stack be the problem? I have also tried to build with the dependency directed to the stack without success.
Does anyone have an idea?
Thanks!

What do you mean by "inside a stack"? Where did you get this package from? My guess currently is that the package is a rosbuild package, whereas your package is a catkin package. You cannot depend from a catkin to a rosbuild package. You would need to migrate the sick package to catkin as well.

Spot on! Did not think about that, I will try to migrate it. Thanks!
The package was found here link text
I can prob look at the similar package (without PLS support) here link text?
Best regards!

A:

The problem was indeed that the package was rosbuild, after migrating it to catkin the package is found and can be called within the launch file.
