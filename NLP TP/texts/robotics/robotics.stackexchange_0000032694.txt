Q:

turtlebot with gyro but no kinect

I am trying to test out my set up. I just installed the gyro according to http://answers.ros.org/question/717/is-an-imu-required-to-run-turtlebot-stack. I want to verify its working correctly but when I run the calibration command

roslaunch turtlebot_calibration
calibrate.launch

I am getting error " Still waiting for imu ".
Also, I am still waiting for my kinect, when I run

roslaunch turtlebot_bringup robot.launch

I get "[/openni_camera] No devices connected.... waiting for devices to be connected"
also when I run the minimial.launch file I am getting this error as well...

respawning... IOError: [Errno 13]
Permission denied:
'/home/ros/.ros/log/a7cc963c-a446-11e0-a0ae-001d72a199a1/turtlebot_node-3.log'

**How can I test my gyro to make sure its working and get turtlebot working without kinect until I have it? Please include location of file to edit. **

eventhough the roslaunch is waiting for the kinect all the other software is still running and you can run robot.launch. It will just print to the screen leeting you know it's not there.

A:

okay. To answer my own question. I needed to edit permission..specifically of my Log folder. So I changed it to chmod -r 777 ~/.ros/log and I was able to get the minimal.launch file going.
After that I was able to get the calibration error to change from

waiting for IMU

to

[INFO] [WallTime: 1309587548.929387] Still waiting for scan

.. Which in my book right now means its working :D
So I think my question is answered.
