Q:

Ideas for communicate N systems that uses ROS. (Example inside)

Hi, this is the situation:
let supose we all live in a small town where everyone has an autonomous car using ROS.. :D
Now, we want to enable V2X communication in our vehicles (vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure) in order to stablish an intelligent transportation system, ITS.
questions are:
¿How to communicate N ROS systems between themselves in a intermitent wireless network?
¿How to communicate ROS systems through a Non-ROS System at Infrastructure*?
I know this is a very wide question, but I want to know if there is a proposed architecture for systems like this.
Thanks.
EDIT:
Non-ROS system could be, for example, a web server for traffic info or a intersection manager, etc.

A:

For multiple ROS systems there is multimaster, although I don't know the state of that package.
Communications through non-ROS systems is obviously dependent on the non-ROS system.

I've read about multimaster, but it is in current development. And the Non-ROS system could be a web server.

Everything custom, you'll have to implement. Web server could mean anything. For the client site there is http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosbridge You might be able to use that.
