A:

There is a generic way to convert messages in tf2.  Tutorials are here: http://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Tutorials/Migration/DataConversions#preview
Right now there are implementations for kdl, bullet, and geometry_msgs. A contribution of a tf2_eigen package would be appreciated. It would require the equivalent header file to this one for bullet https://github.com/ros/geometry_experimental/blob/indigo-devel/tf2_bullet/include/tf2_bullet/tf2_bullet.h
implementing methods toMsg, fromMsg and doTransform
