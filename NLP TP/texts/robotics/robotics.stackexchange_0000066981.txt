Q:

rospy tf waitForTransform not waiting

I keep getting lookup extrapolation errors when trying to use tf, even when using listener.waitForTransform. For example I get:
Exception: Lookup would require extrapolation into the future.  Requested time 1428875486.097693682 but the latest data is at time 1428875486.097676516, when looking up transform from frame [ugv0] to frame [image]
The difference in time is less than a millisecond, and even if my timeout duration is very long, I still get an extrapolation error. My code has:
tfl.waitForTransform('image',obj_name,timeStamp,rospy.Duration(10.0))
The tf call is in a callback on a topic that has data published to it at a very fast rate, approximately 360hz, and the relevant transforms are also all being published at ~360hz except for a static transform, which is at 10hz. I would attach the pdf of the view frames output, but I dont have enough points to attach files.
What is wrong?
