Q:

how to set up log level by package at startup?

Is there a way to configure the logging level associated to a package independently of the node or the executable it is located in?
For example. In ROS1 navigation stack I could develop a planner as a plugin that was loaded by move_base. I could in that case disable setup the log level of move_base to X and the log level of my planner to Y.
That was possible using the a configuration file such as the following:
log4j.logger.ros=INFO
log4j.logger.ros.roscpp.superdebug=WARN
log4j.logger.ros.move_base=INFO
log4j.logger.ros.myplanner=DEBUG

and referencing that file with the environament variable "ROSCONSOLE_CONFIG_FILE".
Is it possible to do something similar in ROS2? maybe passing some argument to the executable with ros nodes?
Note: Using --ros-args --log-level INFO  looks insufficent since looks like it cannot filter by package.

A:

I believe this will be supported in Galactic Geochelone.
From the (I guess pre) release notes (specifically here):

New features in this ROS 2 release
Ability to specify per-logger log levels
It is now possible to specify different logging levels for different loggers on the command line:
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker --ros-args --log-level WARN --log-level talker:=DEBUG

The above command sets a global log level of WARN, but sets the log level of the talker node messages to DEBUG. The --log-level command-line option can be passed an arbitrary number of times to set different log levels for each logger.

It's likely the same functionality will then also be exposed by launch_ros.
