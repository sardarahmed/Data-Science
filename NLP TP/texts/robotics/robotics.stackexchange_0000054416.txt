Q:

Hydro from Mac OS X Homebrew: sudo pip install -U empy fails

Hi Everyone!
I am trying to install the Hydro in Mac OS X Lion 10.8.4 (about to update it to 10.8.5). I am stuck at the following command:
ros_catkin_ws jasprit$ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro hydro -y
The error I get is in the terminal console text below:
Jasprits-MacBook-Pro:ros_catkin_ws jasprit$ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro hydro -y
executing command [sudo pip install -U empy]

It looks like the script is trying to fetch a file for installing Embedded Python and is not able to find a match. Has anyone come across this? Does anyone know a work around for this?
(I am a newbie and hence if my question doesnt provide enough information, please feel free to ask.)
Thanks in advance,
Jasprit

A:

I found a work around for this. I used "sudo easy_install empy" and Embedded Python was installed successfully. I was able to proceed with "rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro hydro -y" after that.

This should probably go in the installation page ... I got the same exact issue, thank you!
Comment by jensenb on 2013-11-12:
Thanks, that did the trick for me too. Any idea why pip fails?
Comment by jaspritsgill on 2013-11-12:
From what I understand, pip tries to fetch the Embedded Python (EmPy) from the page: https: //pypi.python.org/simple/empy/. It finds file empy-latest.tar.gz but doesnt find a match. Probably a poor code for version check, in one of the script files, that fails after new version of empy was launched.
Comment by jensenb on 2013-11-20:
I should correct my previous statement. The easy_install command completed successfully, but it built and installed an egg package, which apparently is supported by catkin.
