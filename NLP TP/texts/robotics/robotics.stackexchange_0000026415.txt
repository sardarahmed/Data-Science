Q:

How to set up a callback for contact event? ( ConnectContact() being deprecated )

Hi,
Is there a new way to set up a callback function in case of a contact, similar to the deprecated ConnectContact()? Or I have to add a ContactSensor to the model?
I am using Gazebo 1.8.0.
Thanks,
Andrei

You have to use the ContactManager, as seen in this example
