Q:

Message with array of data

Hello everyone,
I try to create a custom message containing an array of int8. Therefore I use the .msg-file
int8 len
int8[] data

and when I run colcon everything is fine. The resulting node publishes messages as shown above. When I run the node it immediately crashes without any warnings or errors. The node itself works fine when I use sensor_msgs::msg::Imu. Does anyone know how to fix this?
Regards
s0nc

Just to be sure - did you add this new message to your CMakeLists in rosidl_generate_interfaces(${PROJECT_NAME} ...) and rosidl_default_generators,  rosidl_default_runtime int the package.xml in build and exec dependencies?

I just included them as build_depend. It finally works. Thank you!
