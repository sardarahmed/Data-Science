Q:

Best Hokuyo LiDAR unit

Hi All,
I am looking into buying a Hokuyo LiDAR unit, but thought i would check with the community about what sensors are compatible with ROS and which have had issues.
Many of their sensors are found here: link
I am quite interested in the UST-05LN as it is cheap, IP65 and USB. Has anyone used this with ROS?
My application is outdoors in a forested environment in which i don't require more than 10 meters of depth.
Cheers.

How big of a space will you be working in, and will it be indoors or outdoors? My URG-04LX-UG01 works well in my apartment, but the minimum range means that it doesn't always see the walls in large rooms, and it needs a sunshade to operate reliably outdoors.

@ahendrix apologies i should have added my application. I am working in a forested environment (outdoors) where i don;t require more than 10 meters of data.

A:

Thanks for the advice on such an open ended questions.
Perhaps I shouldn't have been so specific to use a Hokuyo unit, but they do seem to be more available than SICK.
Some outcomes:

Hokuyo only have have three outdoor sensors: UTM-30LX, UTM-30LX-EW, UXM-30LX-EW.
SCIP2.2 and earlier range finders are well supported with URG
Hokuyo is well supported in ROS and tools on their site.
An evaluation of the benefits of Multi-Echo needs to be performed. Some results are shown here
