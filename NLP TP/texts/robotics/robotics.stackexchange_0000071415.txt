Q:

Pass arguments to rqt plugin in gdb

How I can pass arguments to a rqt plugin within gdb
% gdb python
(gdb) run $YOUR_RQT_GUI_HOMEDIR$/bin/rqt_gui
 :          (usual gdb usage)

With the code above I can start the rqt_plugin, but without arguments

A:

This is offtopic.
But anyways: you can pass commandline arguments (this is what your question is about, right?) to an executable in gdb using the --args option. I.e. gdb --args executablename arg1 arg2 arg3.

No, this is not possible.
For debugging a rqt_plugin I have to start "gdb python" than I am in GDB modus.
For starting the rqt_plugin I have to run the plugin like this: run $YOUR_RQT_GUI_HOMEDIR$/bin/rqt_gui
I can't start in this mode gdb --args exeName arg1 arg2 arg3
