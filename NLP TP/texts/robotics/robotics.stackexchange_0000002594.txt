Q:

24v dc to 12vdc converter

I have built a r/c car that runs on 2 30AH 12V DC deep cycle batteries. The motors are 24v motors that will each draw around 15A at full power. My  motor controller can handle this, as well as reclaiming braking energy. 
This is my way of saying that i have a 24v power system. Now my issue is that I want to run a 12v device on this 24v service. I do not want to have the hassle of another battery to maintain so i would like to power it off the main batteries. All the BECs and other converters that i have found only supply around 1 amp while the device i am looking at powering will take around 4-5A 12v DC. Does anyone know of a device that will do this.

A:

If you already have two separate 12V batteries then it makes no sense to convert 24V down to 12V which you already have. As the two of your batteries are coupled together to form 24V, just draw a wire from the place where the two batteries meet and you'll have 12V there (with respect to the ground).
If by some strange reason you really want to convert those 24V to 12V, take a look at some switch-mode power supplies (like LM2576, it can output 3A but there are better ones, you should have no problem finding them), they are more efficient than linear voltage regulators (like 7805) and can give higher output current.
