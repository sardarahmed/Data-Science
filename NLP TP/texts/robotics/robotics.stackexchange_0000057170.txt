Q:

Compiling new package causing roscore command not found

I'm trying to compile a new package with catkin_make_isolated but after visibly successful installation my I receive roscore and catkin_make, etc command not found. My only option is to reload from an earlier backup to restore my ROS.
The steps I'm following:

Installing roscopter on Hydro from here: ( https://github.com/epsilonorion/roscopter/wiki )

I place the roscore source in the /src library

compile mavlink with sudo python setup.py install

Run catkin_make:
 catkin_make_isolated --pkg <my_package_name> --install

Roscore is still working until I don't restart, after that command not found

The .bashrc does refer to the install_isolated/setup.bash, still no roscore or catkin_make, etc

Which OS are you running? Have you installed ROS from debs or from source?

Sorry, I just saw this comment. The issue already got resolved (see details below), but in case others would read this later here is the answer to your question:
OS: Raspbian Wheezy on a Raspberry Pi
ROS is compiled from source

A:

It seems there was/is an issue with the roscopter install instructions (https://github.com/epsilonorion/roscopter/wiki):
...

Navigate back to repo folder
Checkout mavlink using submodule (shown below), or create a symlink to an existing mavlink build.

Run command 'git submodule init'
Run command 'git submodule update'

To build mavlink, navigate to the "pymavlink" folder and run the command "sudo python setup.py install".

...
If you follow the above instructions word by word then the mavlink folder will be created in the roscopter folder causing the above issue.
You actually need to move the mavlink folder to roscopter/src and then compile it. It is strange that the compile did run through fine but resulted in ros setup files being changed, but in any way this seemed to solve it.
The instructions correctly should state:
...

Navigate back to repo folder
Navigate to src folder
Checkout mavlink using submodule (shown below), or create a symlink to an existing mavlink build.

...

You should probably file this as a bug against roscopter if you haven't yet.

Yes, I have already raised this question there too and now I'm asking them to update the instructions (see https://github.com/epsilonorion/roscopter/issues/2).
Thanks.
