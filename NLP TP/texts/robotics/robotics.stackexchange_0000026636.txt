Q:

From the debs Gazebo wants to remove ros-hydro-desktop-full

Hi folks.
The Gazebo ROS integration tutorial suggest to install ros-hydro-desktop-full. OK. And then, to install gazebo. But this last package suggest to remove the previous one.
Do we have to keep gazebo-prerelease?
Thx.

I guess the package ros-hydro-desktop-full package allready installed the Gazebo Version you are looking for! (The other Version is probably 1.86 or so without the new Ros-Integration...)
Comment by Arn-O on 2013-08-02:
Thx for the comment. I would have said gazebo is the 1.9.0 and the 1.9.5 ... according to my tries.

A:

There is a temporary lag in the release system, as soon as the next update to Hydro is released ros-hydro-desktop-full will pull gazebo, not gazebo-prerelease

The repository was just synced.  The new versions of ROS Hydro packages are built against the gazebo package no longer the gazebo-prerelease package.

Thx for the help.
