Q:

Turtlebot Simulator World not coming up properly

Hi All---
I have been new to ROS and Gazebo and have been trying to get the hands on the turtle bot in Gazebo simulator.
I am using Ubuntu 14.04 version and ROS--Indigo and I have followed this tutorial to bring up the Turtle bot in the world describe in the the same link. However, I am not able to get the same world; infact I am only getting a blank world. Moroever, I got the following warning
jashanvir@jashanvir-Dell-System-XPS-L502X:~$ roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch

Could any body provide the fix for the same?
One more thing I want to add is that I waited for 15 minutes so that the world come up but it doesn't.
Thanks.

A:

Quoting from the error message : "Unable to start server[bind: Address already in use]. There is probably another Gazebo process running."
You should kill any gazebo running first, before launching. Do not launch gazebo at all.
Just plainly execute this command
roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch

----.
I got the exact error message you got if I run a gazebo first before launching the turtlebot_gazebo. So I think that is the problem (as also stated in the error message)
----.
Alternatively, you can set different address , if you want to run 2 gazebo at the same time.
