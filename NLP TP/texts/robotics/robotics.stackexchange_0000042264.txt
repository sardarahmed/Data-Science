Q:

PR2 sensing question

HI,
I am using Fuerte on Ubuntu 12.04 and have some trouble figuring out how to implement color sensing on my code.
I want PR2 to distinguish a red block and a blue block but I can't find any relative code in the libraries. I found out that in the pick_and_place_manager.py, there is a call_tabletop_detection, which detects graspable objects by numbering them starting from zero relative to the distance of the block from the edge of the table.
Can anyone help me how I can make PR2 distinguish red block and blue block by any method?

A:

The graspable objects in the pick_and_place_manager contain the point clusters, which have RGB information.  These webpages will hopefully make it clear how to access that information:
https://kforge.ros.org/Sushi/trac/wiki/Perception/PointCloud2InPython
https://kforge.ros.org/Sushi/trac/wiki/Perception/PointCloud2MessageStructure
if you just take the average r and b values for the points in each object, you should be able to tell red from blue.
