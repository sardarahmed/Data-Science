Q:

(Solved)xacro: Traditional processing is deprecated?

Hello everyone.
I am trying to display a model in gazebo and
I get the following warning:

xacro: Traditional processing is deprecated. Switch to --inorder processing!
To check for compatibility of your document, use option --check-order.
For more infos, see http://wiki.ros.org/xacro#Processing_Order
xacro.py is deprecated; please use xacro instead
How can i solve this?

This sounds like an XY problem. Is there a larger problem you're trying to solve? The xacro warning is just a warning. It means the robot description is written using xacro, and the roslaunch for it is not passing the --inorder flag. If you have written the robot description and the launch file then follow the link in your answer for instructions on making the warning go away. Otherwise it can be safely ignored.

How do I get the launch file to pass the --inorder flag? Should I add a line of code to the launch file to run inorder?

Use the args attribute on the node tag http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML/node

A:

the solution is in the launch file:
< param name="robot_description" command="$(find xacro)/xacro --inorder $(arg model)" />
