Q:

Gazebo 4 Installation Help

I'm trying to install Gazebo 4.0 on a different computer alongside ROS Indigo. I already removed Gazebo 2.2.2 that came with ROS. I saw on the tutorial page that in order to make Gazebo 4 work with ROS, I need to first "Add the osrfoundation repository to your sources list.". Does anyone know exactly what that step entails (i.e. what terminal commands to run)? Thanks.

A:

You have the step-by-step instructions detailed in here.
In a nutshell:
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu `lsb_release -cs` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-latest.list'

wget http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gazebo4
