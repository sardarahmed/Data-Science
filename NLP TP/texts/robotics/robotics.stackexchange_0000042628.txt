Q:

Empty rosinstall file for electric generated at packages.ros.org

Does anyone notice that the link provided for donwloading the ros base is empty?
I just check the link http://www.ros.org/wiki/electric/Installation/Ubuntu/Source (ROS-Base -> Bare-Bones :  http://packages.ros.org/cgi-bin/gen_rosinstall.py?rosdistro=electric&variant=ros-base&overlay=no) and its empty. Any update for it?
Thank you

I'm the same issue following Fuerte source installation, it would seem that the file is broken again ...?
