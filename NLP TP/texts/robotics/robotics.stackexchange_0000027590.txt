Q:

Trouble setting up GZWeb

Hello all:
Installed gazebo2 (limited by ROS deployment), and was attempting to get gzweb up and running.
Running into the following when running ./deploy.sh -m
-- Generating done
-- Build files have been written to: /home/specter7/gzweb/build
Scanning dependencies of target gzcoarse
[100%] Building CXX object tools/CMakeFiles/gzcoarse.dir/gzcoarse.cc.o
Linking CXX executable gzcoarse
[100%] Built target gzcoarse
/usr/bin/env: node: No such file or directory
/usr/bin/env: node: No such file or directory
There are node-gyp build errors, exiting.

This binary file exists and has the permissions which permit it to be read.

A:

This looks like one of the questions in the troubleshooting section of the installation tutorial.
The suggested solution is to add a symlink from nodejs to node:
 sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
