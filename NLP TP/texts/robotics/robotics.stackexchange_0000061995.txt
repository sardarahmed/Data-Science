Q:

Delete duplicate point cloud of the same part

Hi;
I would to create a 3D map with Kinect, using PCL, I have two point cloud aligned and concatenated but their concatenation contains duplicate point cloud of the same part.
How  can I delete this duplication without losing data.
I really appreciate any kind of help !
Thanks.

A:

How aligned, and what are your constraints on the output? That really makes a big difference.
If you're willing to lose some representational accuracy, you can run the concatenated cloud through a VoxelGrid filter, which downsamples the cloud and leaves only one point for every x^3 size cube (leaf). This is essentially what the octomap will do, except that the output remains a point cloud.
If every point is perfectly aligned with every other, which is extremely unlikely, you can insert all the points into a Map, using the x,y,z tuple as the key, and remove any points that double up on one key.
