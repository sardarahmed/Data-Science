Q:

shared dynamic_reconfigure_servers in different nodes

Is it possible to have two different nodes with an dynamic_reconfigure::Server sharing the same "resource name" in the rosgraph context?
This would be interesting to share configurations between different nodes. If someone send a config update request, then both nodes would be configured simultaneusly.

Node1.cpp for process 1:
---
dynamic_reconfigure::Server server1(ros::NodeHandle("/shared/name"));
server1.setCallback(myP1Callback);
...

Node2.cpp for process 2:
---
dynamic_reconfigure::Server server2(ros::NodeHandle("/shared/name"));
server2.setCallback(myP2Callback);
...

A:

I don't think so.
They would both have to declare the same ROS service.

I had just tested it. It doesn't work. As you say they both shares a service named "set_update" (a point-to-point operation). One interesting point its that everything looks work,but only one receives the updates. In the end I'll have to use topics. I think this would be a desirable feature.
