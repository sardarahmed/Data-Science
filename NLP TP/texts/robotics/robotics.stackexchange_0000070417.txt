Q:

how to change the RPLIDAR frequency?

hi
i want to know how to change the LIDAR's frequency from 5.5 Hz to say 10 Hz . I know that it involves changing the PWM singal to the motors to increase its scan rate  but how do i do it ? like where is the setting in the source code ?
thanks in advance

Hi!
Were you able to find answer? I'm currently having the same issue.
Thanks!

A:

Hello,
The current Serial Module of the rplidar is not capable of generating PWM signals itself, therefore there is not an option to tweak in the source code, etc. But you need to use an external source to generate and feed the control signal to the device, e.g. an Arduino board, if you wish to modify the LIDAR's frequency.
You can find the devices PIN information in Section 3 of the devkit_manual.
and here you can read about how to work with PWM in Arduino.
Hope it helps.
