Q:

Jump to error using rosmake and Emacs

Hi all!
I'm just getting started working with ROS. My usual workflow is to edit code in Emacs, and compile from Emacs. Then I can jump to errors in the code by pressing C-x`. However, when using rosmake, this doesn't work.
What is the best way to integrate rosmake with Emacs? I tried installing rosemacs, but that mode seems to have no support for compiling, but rather browsing ros nodes, etc.

A:

I generally run M-x compile and replace the "make -k" in the minibuffer with:
 cd ../..; rosmake

From then on it will remember your last compile command, and C-x ` works as usual.
You need to use the right number of ".." references to reach the top of your package. Rosmake does not work from a subordinate directory.
I'd love to hear a more elegant solution, but that works OK for me.
