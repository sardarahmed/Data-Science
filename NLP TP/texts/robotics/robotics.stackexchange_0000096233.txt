Q:

specifying arrow direction

 Eigen::Isometry3d pose1 = Eigen::Isometry3d::Identity();
                            pose1.translation() = p0;
                            visual_tools_->publishArrow(pose1, rvt::GREEN);
                            visual_tools_->trigger();

I am using rviz_visulization tool to pulibish some markes like plane, line list in rviz. Here how do i specify the direction of arrow in above code i.e in ros_visual_tools library?

A:

You only set the translation, but not the rotation (or rather, you set it to identity = no rotation).
Check the example code on how to set the rotation of the pose...
