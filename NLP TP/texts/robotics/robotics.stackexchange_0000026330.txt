Q:

IMU noise cancelation in DRCsim 2.5

I looked at the noise added to the IMU of Atlas and I saw that the acceleration has a bias of +-0.1 m/s/s in all direction, and the noise distribution in Gauusian.
However, the orientation received from the IMU is filtered, with no bias and hardly any noise.
Is there a filter implemented in the calculation of the orientation?
Thanks,
Oded

A:

As noted in pull request #421, noise is added to acceleration and velocity data, but not to orientation data.  The provided orientation is extracted directly from the underlying physics engine.
