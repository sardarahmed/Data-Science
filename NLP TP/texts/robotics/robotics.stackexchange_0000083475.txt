Q:

Cannot insert or see models even though gazebo_model_path is set

I am having issues inserting custom models into gazebo. Here is my file structure:

lawnbot_ws

src

lawnbot_desription

models

grassplane

meshes
model.sdf and model.config

package.xml

Gazebo shows: /home/josiah/PycharmProjects/lawnbot_ws/src/lawnbot_description/models in the insert tab, however it does not show a drop down for actually inserting the grassplane model!
I also have the following line inserted in the package.xml file of the lawnbot_description package:

<gazebo_ros
gazebo_plugin_path="${prefix}/lib"
          gazebo_model_path="${prefix}/models" />

I do not understand what is wrong. I am calling:
roslaunch gazebo_ros empty_world.launch extra_gazebo_args:="--verbose"

in the terminal and the gazebo_model_path shows:
/home/josiah/PycharmProjects/lawnbot_ws/src/lawnbot_description/models

A:

I found the problem.
1st, I had a typo in the xml
HOWEVER,
More annoying was that I found that the:
/home/josiah/.gazebo/gui.ini file retained my old path name:
filenames=/home/josiah/PycharmProjects/lawnbot_ws/src/lawnbot_description/meshes
which should have been:
filenames=/home/josiah/PycharmProjects/lawnbot_ws/src/lawnbot_description/models
Why did it never update the pathname? We may never know. Very frustrating, however now I am able to insert custom models into any world I choose.

This is really a Gazebo-specific question.
Please ask those over at answers.gazebosim.org in the future. You'll have a much higher chance of getting good answers there.

Please, you can share you package.xml and CMakeLists.txt for I learning more about this configuration?
