Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: GET 501 error

Dear All,
opening my browser after launching rosecore I get the following:
" Error code 501.
Message: Unsupported method ('GET').
Error code explanation: 501 = Server does not support this operation. "
Everything has been setup following the various tutorials but I was not able to solve the problem.
I'm using Groovy.
I will appreciate any suggestions.
Thanks in advance.
Arnaldo
