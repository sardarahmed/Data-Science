Q:

diamondback launch problem

Greetings,
I am facing some problem with diamondback setup. I am not able to execute common tasks like launching a node with roslaunch. Following is an example of such problem:
/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/navigation_experimental/sbpl_lattice_planner/launch$ roslaunch  ./move_base_sbpl_fake_localization_2.5cm.launch 
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/opt/ros/diamondback/ros/bin/roslaunch", line 2, in <module>
        from ros import roslaunch
    ImportError: No module named ros

Earlier i faced no such difficulty. Any idea what could be the reason ??? Does it amounts to reinstallation?
Update1: Environment variables
 $ echo $ROS_ROOT
    /opt/ros/diamondback/ros
    $ echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH 
    /opt/ros/diamondback/stacks
    $ echo $PYTHONPATH 
 /opt/ros/diamondback/ros/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/opt/ros/diamondback/ros/core/roslib

rxgraph problem: may be related.
/opt/ros/diamondback/ros$ rxgraph
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/diamondback/ros/bin/rxgraph", line 34, in <module>
    import roslib; roslib.load_manifest('rxgraph')
ImportError: No module named roslib

I updated ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
/opt/ros/diamondback/ros/core/roslib$ echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH 
/opt/ros/diamondback/ros:/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks

but error persists.
thanks

@prince can you try rosversion ros ? does it work ?
Comment by prince on 2012-03-31:
No, ImportError: No module named roslib.stacks

@prince Now that leaves me clueless ! is your ROS PATH set ? ..... still, if I was you I may consider a fresh installation of ROS !
Comment by prince on 2012-03-31:
yes ROS PATH is set. I do not what caused the problem. I installed electric as well. electric is working fine but all diamondback package are not part of electric!

A:

It's probably just an environment setup problem.
What are $PYTHONPATH, $ROS_ROOT, and $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH set to?
UPDATE: I don't have a Diamondback installation here to try, but your $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH looks suspicious. On my Electric workspace, it is set to: /opt/ros/electric/stacks:/opt/ros/electric/ros (preceded by some other stuff).
Try appending ":/opt/ros/diamondback/ros" to yours.

edited original question.

Appending the path did not help. It is still giving same error
Comment by joq on 2012-03-31:
Maybe there is something wrong with your $PYTHONPATH, then.
Comment by prince on 2012-03-31:
What PYTHONPATH  shall point to? In my understanding, this tells where to look for python. What else?
Comment by tfoote on 2012-04-01:
Your python path needs to have roslib/src, typical setup scripts say: export PYTHONPATH=${ROS_ROOT}/core/roslib/src:${PYTHONPATH}
Comment by prince on 2012-04-02:
thanks a lot tfoote. it did work now. I was struggling with this for long time. I even installed diamondback a fresh but this problem persisted.
