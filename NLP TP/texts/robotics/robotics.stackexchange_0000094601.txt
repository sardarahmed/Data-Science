Q:

Unable to use rosrun

`$ rosrun turtlesim
Usage: rosrun [--prefix cmd] [--debug] PACKAGE EXECUTABLE [ARGS]
rosrun will locate PACKAGE and try to find
an executable named EXECUTABLE in the PACKAGE tree.
If it finds it, it will run it with ARGS.

I was also unable to use rosrun for locating executable in another package. Any suggestion on what could be the reason for this?

Hi,
Welcome to the community!
Your issue is that you've not included a node to run. The rosrun syntax is:
rosrun <package name> <executable name>

So you've gotten the package name correct with turtlesim, but you're missing the actual node itself you're trying to run. For this demo, what you're looking for is:
rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node

Happy ROSing

@stevemacenski: it's actually rosrun, not roslaunch ;)

Thanks for your answer.
I see in a video lecture that rosrun work as listing the executables in the package when run without node name. However, even after providing package and executable name, I am getting the error that package is not found.

If you have just the rosrun and turtlesim, and you tab complete it should give you the list, but that's not the same thing as running.
I don't know what video lecture you're referring to.
Are you sure you've actually built this package, installed it, or sourced the setup.sh file to get it in your environment paths?
