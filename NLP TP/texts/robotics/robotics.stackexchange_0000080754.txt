A:

If it's just one topic, you can throttle the topic to whatever frequency you want. It will be re-published to a topic of a different name, though. topic_tools/throttle

I need to control the frequency of 2 ROS topics, it is not possible with topic_tools/throttle?

You'll just need 2 throttle nodes, then.
