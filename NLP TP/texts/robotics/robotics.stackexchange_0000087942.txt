Q:

How to calculate the exact packet rate of HDL-64E S3D?

I'm using velodyne hdl-64e s3d with this driver (https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne), however, this driver only support up to S2.
Can anyone tell me how to calculate the exact packet rate of HDL-64E S3D?

It's 5780.

This looks like a cross-post of https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/175 . I'm a bit surprised that the packet rate isn't in the manual.

A:

It's 5780.

do you know how many points are generated per second for 64E_S3D?
