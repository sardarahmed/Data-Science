Q:

Completely disable logging outputs on screen

Hi,
I want to disable the ROS logging in the console completely, but still have the logging to the /rosout topic. I tried these two options:

Set output="log" in the launch file. This disables the output of Debug, Info and Warning messages but still, Error and Fatal messages are shown in the console.
Set the logger level to Fatal but this completely disables the /rosout topic, too.

Are there any other possibilities I could try out?
Thanks!

A:

Not a ROS specific solution but you could Pipe the Output to /dev/null, e.g.
rosrun your_package your_node > /dev/null

Ah yeah, that's indeed a solution. But I have another logging framework running that should still be able to log everything to the console.  Sorry, I missed this point.
