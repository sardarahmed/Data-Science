Q:

Issue building tf2_ros on OSX

==> make -j4 -l4 in '/Users/Yeison/ros_catkin_ws/build_isolated/tf2_ros'
Linking CXX shared library
/Users/Yeison/ros_catkin_ws/devel_isolated/tf2_ros/lib/libtf2_ros.dylib
Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:

I think the following patch is meant to address the issue:
https://github.com/ros/geometry-experimental/pull/6
I'll have to try and pull those changes in locally to test.
