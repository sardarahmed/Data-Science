Q:

ROS_ROOT Problem

Hi,
I accidentally tweaked something "export ROS_ROOT=$PWD:$ROS_ROOT" into several directories, into /diamondback and /unstable directories. Where should it be located? I mean a standard ROS_ROOT. BTW, I want to point to the diamondback instead of unstable. Hopefully someone could guide me..

Please don't put [SOLVED] in the title.  Also, don't mark every question as a community wiki, there is no reason for that.

A:

Finally this command "source /opt/ros/diamondback/setup.bash" saved me :-)

The check mark is below the thumbs up/thumbs down.  Here is an example: http://imgur.com/mqRSE  Please don't put SOLVED in the title of your post.  Thank you.

I've tried both, and for the check mark or tick, it was complaining "Sorry, you cannot accept or unaccept your own answer to your own question"

Please try again. Not the thumbs up, but the check mark. This question still shows up as "unanswered", wasting people's time.

Unfortunately, I could not tick my because it was complaining "Sorry, you cannot vote for your own post". I just wrote as [SOLVED] in the title, instead ..

There should be a check mark under the thumbs up/thumbs down.

How to mark it? is it by clicking thumbs up?

If the issue is solved, mark one (can be your own) of the answers "the-best-one", for the question not to appear unanswered any more, please. Glad you made it :).
