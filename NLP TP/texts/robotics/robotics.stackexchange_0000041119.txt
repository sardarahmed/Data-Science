Q:

What is this rosdep error?

Trying to get the dependencies for a camera with the following command:
mike@spinach:~/ros_workspace$ rosdep install prosilica_camera
And I get the following error:
ERROR: Rosdep cannot find all required resources to answer your query
Missing resource prosilica_camera
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/home/mike/ros_workspace
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/fuerte/share
ROS path [3]=/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks
What is wrong with my install?
I have run rosdep update.

What distribution are you using? In Electric, prosilica_camera was part of camera_drivers. In Fuerte, is belongs to a separate prosilica_driver stack.

go to src directory, where your package reside (don't step in to your package). And try to run this command from there. It should work.

A:

Specifically this error means that the package prosilica_camera is not in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.
rosdep is a tool for installing system dependencies for source packages.  It does not install the source for you.  You need to check that out from version control.  There are tools like rosinstall which are designed to help with that.  And if you're on Ubuntu usually you can use apt to install most packages, and skip compiling others code from source.
Please make sure to go through the ROS tutorials to understand the core ROS concepts.

Thanks.  I did follow the tutorial, but I think it glances over a simple concept I have no awareness of.  I entered roscd and then rosinstall prosilica_camera and received an error indicating I need to add the location of a ros distribution to this command.  I'm not sure how to do this.

Your rosinstall link is broken.
