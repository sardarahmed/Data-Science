Q:

leg_detector and kinect

Hey,
I am trying to run a leg_detector2 package from here:
http://code.google.com/p/wu-robotics/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fpeople2
Has anyone had success to run it with kinect? I think that it should not be the problem. I successfully remapped kinect's laser scan to base_scan. But now I don't now how to read or visualize detected legs or any data produced by leg_detector.
I would really appreciate if anybody has any tips.
Thank you.

A:

I successfully run it with some minor adjustments.
First you have to edit your launch file and add to start openni, pointcloud_to_laser_scan and remap kinects laser scan from scan to base_scan.
To properly show the data in rviz I modified all .cpp and .py files to change fixed_frame from odom_combined to camera_depth_frame. Maybe you won't have to do that if you actually use odom_combined.
In the end don't forget to rosmake it.
Now you should be able to show leg detection in rviz by adding MARKER.
