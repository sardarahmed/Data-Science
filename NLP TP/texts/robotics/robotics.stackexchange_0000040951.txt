Q:

dynamixel_motor stack on Fuerte in Ubuntu 12.04

Hi all,
I've just performed a fresh installation of Ubuntu 12.04.
After installing ROS Fuerte (following the installation instructions), I tried to install the dynamixel_motor stack.
I can't seem to find it.
On the website (http://ros.org/wiki/dynamixel_motor), it says it should be possible to run:
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-dynamixel-motor
However, when I try to do so, I get the "Unable to locate package ros-fuerte-dynamixel-motor" message.
Does such stack exist in the Ubuntu package repo, or should I checkout the code from the svn?
Thanks a lot guys!
Murilo
