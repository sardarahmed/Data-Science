Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: tum_ardrone

When I compile tum_ardrone in Linux Mint 14 on my ASUS 64b laptop, after applying all the fixes specified in --answers.ros.org/question/89181/rosmake-tum_ardrone/--,
drone_autopilot & drone_gui compile sucessfully but drone_stateestimation does not. I can sucessfully fly my drone and control it with my keypad using drone_gui. I am using ROS groovy.
The error messages from the unsucessful "rosmake tum_ardrone" are as follows:

A:

Have you installed and compiled TooN on your computer?
Install TooN :  git clone git clone git://github.com/edrosten/TooN.git
This will create a TooN directory wherever you cloned it to. Navigate to the TooN directory and type :
./configure
make
make install
