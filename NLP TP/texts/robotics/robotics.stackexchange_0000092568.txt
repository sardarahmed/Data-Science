Q:

Defining joint bounds for moveit

I was trying to use getActiveJointModelsBounds() from Moveit. I am assuming Moveit get the bound values from some urdf/xacro files. If I create a new robot model and define its joint using urdf, can Moveit automatically detect the upper bound and lower bound just by reading the urdf file?

yes.
In normal MoveIt configuration packages the planning_context.launch file will also load a joint_limits.yaml file from the config directory which allows you / your users to override those limits (here).
So if has_position_limits is true in that file, the position limit from the urdf will not be used (or: will be overridden by the value in that .yaml file).
