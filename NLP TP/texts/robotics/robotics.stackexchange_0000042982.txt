Q:

No connection to WG household_object_database

I'm following the guide on the wiki. I have installed the database on my desktop, which works fine. However, on the robot I would like to access the database remotely.
I launch with
$ roslaunch household_objects_database objects_database_remote_client.launch
which seems fine. However, when calling one of the remapped services, I get return code 3. I've tried both ping grasp.willowgarage.com and telnet grasp.willowgarage.com 15432 which also work fine, so I guess it's not a network problem.
The same error occurs on both the robot and my desktop.
The issue is very similar (i.e. identical) to this one.
UPDATE: I tried it from my home network as well, and there is still no connection, and still replies with error code 3. I'm surprised no one knows how to fix this.

Hi,
for the issues like this I'd normally drop an email to Matei (http://www.willowgarage.com/pages/people/matei-ciocarlie) to restart the server at Willow.

marking this as the right answer, and hope it will not result in Matei getting spammed

oh, and obviously I did indeed write to Matei, and he did fix it

Unfortunately, we are likely to discontinue support for this, as it proved to be a bit of a headache to keep the ROS wrapper up on this side...

I encourage everybody to set up their local server, it is really not that complicated and the tutorial in the household_objects_database package provides step-by-step instructions.
