Q:

how to use eband_local_planner with navigation?

Hello,
I installed eband_local_planner  package by sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-eband-local-planner . But when i try to use it with navigation ,the "base_local_planner " param of   move_base  does not changed   when i  launch the corresponding launch  file.And  in the terminal , no error  occurred！！！
In the move_base node ,i set
<rosparam file="$(find rbx1_nav)/config/fake/eband_planner_params.yaml" command="load" />  and
<param name="base_local_planer" value="eband_local_planner/EBandPlannerROS" />
when using rospack plugins --attrib=plugin nav_core,it shows me that  eband_local_planner   is  one of  the plugins of nav_core, and when i use roscd   eband_local_planner,i also can find  it   in  "/opt/ros/indigo/share/eband_local_planner".
how  should  i do to  configure eband_local_planner with   navigation  correctively  ?  Thanks   a lot ^-^

Thanks all,  i find  why  this happen .  Spelling mistake ： param name="base_local_planer"   ,should be param name="base_local_planner".
