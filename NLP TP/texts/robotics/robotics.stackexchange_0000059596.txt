Q:

Does the navigation stack require a map

I would like to mess around with the ROS navigation stack with a custom robot that I've built. I'm trying to figure out if it can be used to navigate in a previously unknown environment. The tutorial for setting up a robot to use the nav stack states that a map is not required. But this page on map building says that it does requires a static map. Aren't these statements contradictory? Which is true?

Any luck on this?

A:

If you want to drive around on a map you need one (and usually can build one). However, to just somehow drive around for testing you can configure the global costmap the same like the local costmap or just use an empty map. Obviously global planning will only be as good as what you provide it with data, but we've used this setup to quickly test navigation controllers on our robots successfully.
