Q:

[PCL_tutorial] No tf data.Fixed Frame camera_depth_frame does not exist

I followed this tutorial 4.1 (http://wiki.ros.org/pcl/Tutorials) and ran these with kinect v2
$ rosrun my_pcl_tutorial example input:=/narrow_stereo_textured/points2
$ rosrun rviz rviz
After that I selected  camera_depth_frame for the Fixed Frame  and select output for the PointCloud2 topic.
But I could not see anything and rviz said "No tf data.Fixed Frame camera_depth_frame does not exist"
How can I get downsampled images? thank you.

A:

I have not gone through the tutorials bt can you run rosrun tf view_frames command and see if Frame camera_depth_frame exists in the tf tree. If not then your program is not able to publish the tf data.
