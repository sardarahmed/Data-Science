Q:

How to get last frame's pose relative to base frame

I'm wondering if tf is capable of providing the pose (position and orientation) of the last frame in the tree relative to the base frame in the same tree? Also, does tf use Denavit Hartenberg to establish the forward kinematic tree?

A:

I'm not sure what you mean with 'the last'. With a lot of tf trees, there is not 1 last link.
As for getting the pose of the link relative to the base_link, that's what tf listeners are for. The tutorials:

tf listener C++
tf listener Python
tf2 listener C++
tf2 listener Python
