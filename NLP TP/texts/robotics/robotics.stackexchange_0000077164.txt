A:

If you are really on ROS Hydro (and not on Indigo, Jade or Kinetic), then this should work, but you need to be careful with the translation of ROS package names (ie: sick_tim) to Debian package names (ie: .deb).
Try:
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-sick-tim

Note: _ in ROS package names gets changed into - in Debian package names.
