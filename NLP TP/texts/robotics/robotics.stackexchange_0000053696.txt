Q:

pi_face_tracker problem

Hi
i have installed your package. i am trying to use it ,but i haven't succeeded.
firstly i run cheese because without it nothing works. then i run the two commands .
from the first one
i get a : [ WARN] [1377289686.323464310]: Reconfigure callback failed with exception unable to allocate buffers.
the other one works fine . so i get a  : [INFO] [WallTime: 1377289898.645841] Starting pi_face_tracker.
the problem is that when i type
rostopic echo /whatever gets published
then nothing appears on my screen, not even my
/camera/image_raw.
the cheese program works fine .
what should i do
edit: i just saw the with my laptops camera it works fine. with my msi star cam clip it does not.
and when i run the first command i get

A:

Since the pi_face_tracker package works with your laptop camera, it sounds like your msi star cam clip is not supported by the uvc_cam driver.  You might try the camera_umd driver instead as follows.  I see you are using ROS Fuerte so you can install the camera_umd package using the commands:
$ sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-camera-umd
$ rospack profile

I have added a suitable launch file for this driver to the pi_face_tracker package.  To get the update run the commands:
$ roscd pi_vision
$ svn update
$ rospack profile

You can now try this launch file with your msi camera which is probably /dev/video1 on your laptop.  Assuming the camera is plugged in to a USB port, run the command:
$ roslaunch pi_face_tracker camera_node.launch device:=/dev/video1

Then test to see if you have an image by running the command:
$ rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/image_raw

If you do not see an image, it is possible you camera is not uvc-compatible.  If you do see an image, you can try pi_face_tracker.  Ctrl-C out of the image_view process then run:
$ roslaunch pi_face_tracker face_tracker_uvc_cam.launch

hi
thanks for the answer,
it worked half way,
i get an image from my web cam but it just 'green' noise.
so my camera is not uvc?

It sounds like that might be true but I am not a Linux video expert.  I've had good luck with Logitech cameras and a Philips camera but have not tried other brands.

ok , in 3-4 days i will be able to test it with a kinect
and i hope that it will be able to give me the exact location (xyz) of the face
via the /target_point .
