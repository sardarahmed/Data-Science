Q:

rosserial error when publishing IMU data

I get the following error when I try to use an Arduino to publish data from an IMU:
balto@T510:~$ rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyUSB0

    genpy.message.DeserializationError: unpack requires a string argument of length 72

Any ideas what would cause this error?  Thank you in advanced.

A:

The message was too large for to published.  Created my own message just like the imu message but without the covariance matrices.

hello Tony,
I am facing exactly the same problem. But I could not fix it in Fuerte any suggestion?
did you used the same rawimu.h used in hector slam so i can use it directly?
