Q:

How to install object_manipulation package for ros hydro on ubuntu 13.10

I am trying to install object_manipulation package for ros hydro (which I installed from source) on ubuntu 13.10.  To do that I downloaded the source of package from github link and tried to run following command in the downloaded folder:
sudo /opt/ros/hydro/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install --install-space /opt/ros/hydro
However I am getting following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/opt/ros/hydro/bin/catkin_make_isolated", line 12, in 
from catkin.builder import build_workspace_isolated
ImportError: No module named catkin.builder

A:

I did source the bash file before running catkin_make_isolated.
Update: I realized when I use sudo, previous source command does not have any effect. Therefore I switched to root. Issued the source command and then used
catkin_make_isolated --install --install-space /opt/ros/hydro . But now I am getting following error:
Could not find source space : None
I get the same error when I install it as a non root user without using sudo by changing the path to a local path in home folder.
