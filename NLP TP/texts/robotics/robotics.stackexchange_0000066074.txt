Q:

turtlebot position fluctuates

Dear All,
Please have look on this video:
http://youtu.be/MiTcy0rHY78
I'm running turtlebot gazebo simulator, but as you see the pose of robot has lots of error and fluctuates
I have run the following:
1)roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch
2)roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo gmapping_demo.launch
3)roslaunch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_navigation.launch
4)roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo amcl_demo.launch
The position of the robot in gazebo is fixed, but the localized position in rviz is fluctuating between several points.
what should I change to make the position of the robot stable?
Many thanks and regards.

A:

You are running multiple localization demos simultaneously. AMCL and gmapping should not be used simultaneously.
The oscillation you are seeing is a race condition between the two publishing their computed results.
It looks like you're following this tutorial
Make sure to follow the instructions "To be sure that all will run as expected, kill all you launched in the previous section"
