Q:

rospy.loginfo on remote machine

When I launched a package on a remote machine, the rospy.loginfo messages of that package do not show up on my local machine that is running the roscore and initiated the roslaunch. Is there some modification to the rospy.loginfo that needs to be done to get it to send the log to the local machine?

Exactly. @mdturner32: what you see in the console is only output printed by the processes that were started in that console. You'll need to use different tools (such as rqt_console mentioned by @ahendrix) for everything else.

Sorry for the very late response. But just wanted to update and say thanks, I did use rqt_console and it worked for me great. Appreciate the advice
