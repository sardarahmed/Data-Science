A:

I wrote one recently. A separate Convert class does the work, and a minimal node and nodelet instantiate it. For several reasons, I find it convenient to have both.

Thanks a lot that's very illustrative, just one more question, the onInit method is kind of the same as: int main()?

It is not like main.  It should return quickly.  It will be called when the nodelet has been created to allow you to setup operations.

@tfoote makes an important point. Don't think of onInit() as main(), it's really just the constructor, which should return immediately.
