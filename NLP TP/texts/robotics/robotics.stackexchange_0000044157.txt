Q:

How to generate semantic map which can visualize by visualisation_canvas?

I followed KnowRob documentation.
I want to generate semantic map OWL by adding objects one by one.
Where is the semantic map format doc which can visualize by visualisation_canvas?
And what's the simplest way to generate semantic map package to include my own semantic  map OWL?
Thank you~

< simplest way to generate semantic map package to include my own semantic map OWL?> Do I have to create semantic map package to add my own semantic map?! I think it is not necessary cause just want to add owls but not to add new functionality for existing package ?! Do I have missing understand?

I use "register_ros_package(ias_semantic_map)." to import. So I need to create a package for semantic map.

A:

I think the simplest way is using the Semantic Map Editor:

Yes, it's described in the second answer to your question and described on the very same Wiki page as the interactive semantic map editor.

What do you mean with "by programming"? Of course, you could also just create owl-files manually or using a script... the map editor is just facilitate the map building...

I want to use programming language to send data as semantic map editor's input to generate my own semantic map OWL. Or is there any other convenient way to generate semantic map OWL? Thank you~
