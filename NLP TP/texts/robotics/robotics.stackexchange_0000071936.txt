Q:

Dependencies for Hector_Slam

Hi! I'm trying to install hector_slam on a Raspberry Pi 2 (it has ROS Indigo Comm). I would follow the steps listed but I do not know what other dependencies to add it because at the end of catkin_make I have an error. How do I know what dependencies will be needed?
Can I install ROS Indigo Desktop on RPi 2? Thank you!
$ cd ros_catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/hector_slam.git
$ sudo apt-get install *******WHAT DEPENDENCIES WILL BE NEEDED?*******
$ cd ..
$ catkin_make
$ source devel/setup.bash

A:

What @mig says. Also, if you installed ROS from .debs on your RPi2 you can just run
   sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-hector-slam

for installing precompiled binaries.
