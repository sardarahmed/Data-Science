Q:

Rendering collada .dae mesh gives transparent surfaces

I'm not able to figure out why the rendering does not consider hidden surfaces. Any suggestions on how I can get it fixed?
Thanks!

The normals on your mesh may be incorrect. You can recalculate them in blender.

A:

Yes.. You were right nkoenig. The normals were flipped. I corrected it using blender. It works fine now. Thanks a lot!
