Q:

failed to install pkg-config

Hi i'm new to ros and have been trying to install the player ros package from http://www.ros.org/wiki/player. When I run rosmake player it complains that pkg-config isn't installed. I then tried to run rosdep install player but it fails to install pkg-config.

A:

You are missing the stack erratic_robot which contains rosdep.yaml which defines how to install pkg-config.
You need to checkout all of erratic_robot or copy the rosdep.yaml file into the player directory and make sure it's not within a stack, as it appears to be in your file layout.
