Q:

How to run a different roscore in different robots?

Hi,
I have two robots and I want to run a roscore for each one of the robots. But, I also need to exchange pose information between the robots. Therefore, there are topics from robot 1 that I need to publish on the robot 2 and topics from the robot 2 that I wanto to subscribe from the robot 1 (and the contrary).
There are any solution for that? Can anyone help me?
Many thanks in advance

Hey,
You will want to run a single roscore that both robots use. The instructions on running ROS multiple machines should be a good place to start looking into this: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/MultipleMachines
It is very easy to do once you can get an ssh connection between the robots.
Hope that helps
Henry
