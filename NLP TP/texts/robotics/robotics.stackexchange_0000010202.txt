Q:

The 3 key components of a robot are controller, servo, and reducer. Can someone give us an "official" explanation of what they do respectively?

I've googled a lot but wasn't able to find official definitions of these 3 parts. Maybe the explanations of servo and controller are good enough, but I'm still trying to look for a more "official" one.
Any ideas?

A:

Your question is premised on a misunderstanding of what a robot is composed of, but you are close.
A robot is an agent that is capable of sensing, thinking, and acting. The sense-think-act (or sense-plan-act) paradigm has historical significance in behaviour based robotics, and you can read about it in Ronald Arkin's book Behavior-Based Robotics.
The two of the three components that you mention in your question fall neatly into the categories of sensing, thinking, and acting. Sensing components, as the name suggests, gather data from sensors about the environment (internal or external). Common sensors include accelerometers, gyroscopes, cameras, radar, lidar, etc.. Thinking is implemented in a computing environment, small robots will use a micro-controller to facilitate this. On the computer, algorithms, controllers (the control theory type), artificial intelligence (and so on) process the sensor data as input and determine a desired output objective. Acting components, which include servo motors as you mentioned, are responsible for interacting with, or actuating in, the environment.
With this brief description, hopefully you better understand what a robot is at an abstract level, which should inform you as to what the physical components are for at a high-level. I will again point you to Arkin's book. The Springer Handbook of Robotics is another good resource that will certainly answer your questions.
