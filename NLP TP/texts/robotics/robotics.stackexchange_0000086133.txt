Q:

RQT command does not display plugins after clean install

Hello, I am working with Ubuntu 16.04 and ros kinetic. I am trying to experiment with Ros QT for designing an interface for my project. I haven't been able to get the rqt command to display the plugins that I have installed.
I am a ROS newbie, so it is plausible that I made a mistake with how I installed rqt, but what I did was that I started with a clean install of Ubuntu 16.04, I followed the instructions listed here: http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu and here http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment to verify ROS was installed correctly.
I then ran the commands
$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-rqt ros-kinetic-rqt-common-plugins

$ sudo apt-get update

$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

as instructed here http://wiki.ros.org/rqt/UserGuide/Install/Groovy
When I run the command
$rqt

I only get a blank window with no text.
I tried to verify that I had plugins installed by running
$ rqt --list-plugins

and I do get a populated list, and I can run the 'rqt_image_view' plugin directly from the command line.
My question is why do I not see any options to run plugins from the rqt window? Any insight or advice would be greatly appreciated.

A:

On my 16.04 I see menus on the Ubuntu's top panel, not on rqt's window (I think the default appearance changed sometimes between 14.04 and 16.04?).
Seems like you can change that setting on Ubuntu's level, see this example.

This could very well be the cause here.
