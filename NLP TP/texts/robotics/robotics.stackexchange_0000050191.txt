Q:

how to use mavlink?

hi there,
i have ardupilot hexacopter equipped with pandaboard running ros.
so i installed this mavlink-ros-pkg to control my copter via ros from here http://qgroundcontrol.org/dev/mavlink_ros_robot_operation_system_integration_tutorial. mavlink compiled fine and by running rosrun mavlink_ros mavlink_ros_serial -p /dev/ttyACM0 it publishes some data to rostopic. but now i am not sure how to use this node to control my copter?
i did find this message documentation here: https://pixhawk.ethz.ch/mavlink/ but i don`t know how to use them with ros so that my ardu gets this messages. could anyone explain, please?
i would be very happy if i could send a command like "start" through the terminal and the hexacopter starts and holds position at 3m for example.
or is there any teleop-stack ready? this would be very great.
thanks!
