Q:

Accesing MASTER_API using roscpp

Hello,
I'm trying to use some functions of the MASTER_API with C/C++ but I'm not finding any references to that. I've already seen a lot of times the pythin code to do that but I'd like to know if there's a C/C++ code to access and use it. I've already know too that we can use XMLRPC, but I have no ideia how to implement that.
Any help will be appreciated!
Thanks!!

A:

I'm guessing you want various methods from the roscpp API.
