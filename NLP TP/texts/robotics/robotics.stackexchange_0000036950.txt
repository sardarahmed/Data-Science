Q:

Rviz doesn't recieve kinect streams from turtlebot

I'm trying to do SLAM-mapping using a Turtlebot. The kinect works, but RVIZ doesn't recieve any data from it. I have the following errors:
error 1 (in dashboard):

Camera Info for rgb stream has subscribers, but stream has stopped.
Any ideas?

A:

Apparently I messed around with rviz settings too much. After I set fixed_frame to /base_link and target Frame to  in .Global Options, everything worked as expected. You can set the options in the rviz window or in .rviz/config and .rviz/display_config.
