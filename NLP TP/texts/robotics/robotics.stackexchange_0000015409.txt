Q:

Source of seminal papers in robotics

Is there a database or website that has collected the seminal papers in different disciplines of robotics like machine learning, AI, mobile robots, etc.
By seminal I mean papers that made a path-breaking impact on the theoretical side, for example, proved a theorem that captivated and inspired a large number of derivative works. So, I am mainly looking for high-impact papers that made fundamental contributions in mathematical modeling, algorithm design etc. and not so much on the hardware application side of it because in that respect videos of Boston dynamics or festo robotics are the better sources of inspiration.
I know some seminal papers like:-

Latombe's planning book
Khatib's potential field method
SLAM paper
Kalman's derivation of his filter
DP paper by Berketsas

But similar seminal papers are missing in say robotic formation control etc.
So my question has someone collected papers that rigorously and mathematically showed some big result in robotics.

A:

Nathan Ratliff has documented some very nice papers in Control Theory and Motion Optimization. You can access them here and here, resp. 
Particularly related to decision making problems, you might want to check Geoff Hollinger and Gaurav Sukhatme's course. The have a good list of readings in a logical flow. In general robotics, you may want to look at Pieter Abbeel's readings list for CS287. 
Asides for that, one of the first papers my advisor recommended me was that Alberto Rodriguez on Effector Form Design. It is a beautiful paper with very appealing and seemingly useful mathematical formulation. To put his work into perspective, I think his thesis is worth a read (50 pages or so). 
I think generally, papers which get like Best Paper Awards in top robotics conferences have sound theoretical grounds. Also, most graduate level courses incorporate good reading material and often these courses are openly accessible.
