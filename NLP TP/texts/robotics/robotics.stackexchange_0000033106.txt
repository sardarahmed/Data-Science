Q:

Struggling with rosjava and android tutorials

I finally got the code installed, and built some how,, I even got the PubSubTutorial to download to my Samsung S but code keeps crashing at new WebServer.

  public NodeServer(BindAddress bindAddress, AdvertiseAddress advertiseAddress) {
    InetSocketAddress address = bindAddress.toInetSocketAddress();
    server = new WebServer(address.getPort(), address.getAddress());
    this.advertiseAddress = advertiseAddress;
    this.advertiseAddress.setPortCallable(new Callable() {
      @Override
      public Integer call() throws Exception {
        return server.getPort();
      }
    });
    startLatch = new CountDownLatch(1);
  }

Any ideas?
Do I need to have a ROScore running on the phone, cant I just run a node on the phone and the Core/Master on my PC?
