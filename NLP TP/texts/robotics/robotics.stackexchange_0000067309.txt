Q:

See what package code is trying to be compiled in Jenkins

Is it possible to see what code is trying to be compiled for a recently released package in Jenkins? This is a comment from another question but I thought that this deserves its own thread, and that it is relevant for other people because, for instance, someone might have uploaded code from the wrong repository branch, etc.

A:

You can find the information by foing through the following steps:

go to the package wiki page, e.g. http://wiki.ros.org/roscpp
go to the Jenkins sourcedeb job (link on the right side), e.g. http://jenkins.ros.org/job/ros-indigo-roscpp_sourcedeb/
go to the console output of the latest build, e.g. http://jenkins.ros.org/job/ros-indigo-roscpp_sourcedeb/15/console
in the beginning of the log you will find the branch from where the code is pulled:

Note: checking out 'debian/ros-indigo-roscpp_1.11.12-0_saucy'.

at the end of the log you will find a reference to the release / GBP repository

gbp-clone https://github.com/ros-gbp/ros_comm-release.git
The README In the release repository will state the exact version tag as well as the upstream repository where the code for that branch is coming from, e.g. https://github.com/ros-gbp/ros_comm-release/blob/master/README.md
As a shortcut you can always look at the ROS distribution file (https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/blob/b2b035245c25243d44e03da8130510952a1143e8/indigo/distribution.yaml#L6898) but that information might have changes recently so you might not see the correct information for the last build there.

Thanks! According to the ROS distribution file, it is using the correct branch of my repository. However, where does it show which branch is used within http://jenkins.ros.org/job/ros-indigo-handle-detector_binarydeb_saucy_amd64/8/console?
Comment by Dirk Thomas on 2015-04-30:
The binary job builds the code from the sourcedeb (which you can download from the apt-repo). If you want to know about the upstream code go to the corresponding source job (http://jenkins.ros.org/job/ros-indigo-handle-detector_sourcedeb/) and follow my comments from the answer.
