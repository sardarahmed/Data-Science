Q:

irobot create package/stack

HI
I have a irobot create and BAM so that I can connect my laptop to irobot create via bluetooth.
I browsed software on ROS site and find a few packages/stacks that are for irobot Create. But they are all for some kind of modified Create (such as add-on camera, laser range finer, etc).
Is there any package that is purely for the barebone irobot Create that I can try?
Any recommendations.
Thank you.
Jack

Check out: http://wiki.ros.org/irobot_create_2_1
For the iRobot Create 2, I'm actually working on a barebones here: https://github.com/lucbettaieb/create_2_drivers
