A:

There's no reason you cannot. I don't know if anyone is running it on QNX right now, but I know some people are planning on doing it. There are not existing tutorials or pre-built binaries if that's what you're asking for.

I was pretty sure that people are going to running ROS2 on QNX but would be interested if someone actually does already :)
