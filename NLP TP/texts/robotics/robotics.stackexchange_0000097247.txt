Q:

how does bloom works for any plateform

If i release my custom ros package using bloom software release tool which i build in ubuntu local pc with intel processor. How is it possible that this package also runs on other plateforms where i install that package with apt install ros-package ? Also how is it possible that given ros package runs on any plateform without cross compilation?

A:

bloom just puts the source code version you release into a release repository. from there it is fetched from a build server which builds the binaries for the different platforms. Whatever you build locally is completely independent...

It means if i release the ros package or even any software using bloom and the binaries will work in any platform like raspberry pi, jetson nano etc?

well, no. They need to compile successfully for that arch.
I think (but might be mistaken) by default it builds for the following architectures:

amd64
i386 (prior to lunar, this has been dropped as Ubuntu itself isn't shipping i386 binaries anymore)
armhf / arm32
arm64

See REP-3 for additional information.
