Q:

What is a control loop?

I've seen with drones that the norm of programming them is to create three loops,  for each axis, but I'm not quite sure what a control loop is when the code must run in a sequential manner. 
Programmatically,  what IS a control loop? 

A:

A control loop is:

Get a reference
Get a feedback
"Decide what to do" given the reference and feedback
Perform an action (or not) based on the decision.

This process continuously repeats. 
Generally, if you have multiple control loops on one controller, you perform each step in turn for each control loop - get all references, get all feedbacks, run the actual control algorithm to generate the control signal, then write the control signal as appropriate.
