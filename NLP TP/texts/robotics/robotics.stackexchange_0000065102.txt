Q:

openni_camera number of topics is huge

Hi all,
I'm using openni and openni2 packages. They work fine but there's lot of topics out there! Is there a way to reduce the number of topics?

A:

I haven't looked at openni(1)_launch in a while, but at least in openni2_launch, a lot of those topics should be:

internal, meaning they are needed for the internal processing (http://wiki.ros.org/rgbd_launch) pipeline (raw_image->...->pointcloud)

lazy, meaning they are only published if someone is subscribing to them, and not taking up cycles otherwise

Depending on what data you're interested in, you can force-disable certain components of the rgbd_launch pipeline here (https://github.com/ros-drivers/openni2_launch/blob/indigo-devel/launch/openni2.launch#L40).

Good answers.  openni_launch is much the same in regards to having the ability to force-disable certain components.
