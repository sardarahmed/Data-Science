Q:

Problem of running "rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node"

Hey guys, I am new to ros and try to learn it by going through the beginner tutorial. However, when I tried typing the code "rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node" provided in "Understandingnodes" part of the tutorial, the turtlesim window just flicked and then disappeared. I got the error message:
[ INFO] [1390367521.100598911]: Starting turtlesim with node name /turtlesim
[ INFO] [1390367521.107999703]: Spawning turtle [turtle1] at x=[5.544445], y=[5.544445], theta=[0.000000]
/opt/ros/hydro/lib/turtlesim/turtlesim_node: symbol lookup *****error: /opt/ros/hydro/lib/libroscpp.so: undefined symbol: _ZN3ros6HeaderC1Ev*****

I simply cannot do anything with the turtle since I can't see the window at all. Do you guys have any idea or suggestion? Thanks.

A:

Just a couple of minutes ago I also had some weird symbol lookup errors, too (After pulling some updates with the update manager).
sudo apt-get install -f

and
sudo apt-get autoremove

together with erasing build dirs and rebuilding in my workspace by (in the catkin_ws folder:)
rm -r devel
rm -r build
catkin_make

solved the issue....
