Q:

package terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::logic_error'

this question might be better suited for px4 forums, but no one replies there.
When I try to launch a particular node/module on jetson TX2, it terminates and shows this error
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::logic_error'
  what():  basic_string::_M_construct null not valid
[local_planner_node-2] process has died [pid 20132, exit code -6, cmd /home/user/catkin_ws/devel/lib/local_planner/local_planner_node __name:=local_planner_node __log:=/home/user/.ros/log/80e889fe-d9b5-11eb-8fd5-48b02d0f174f/local_planner_node-2.log].
log file: /home/user/.ros/log/80e889fe-d9b5-11eb-8fd5-48b02d0f174f/local_planner_node-2*.log

the same package with the same launch file works on my intel laptop, both have the same ros melodic installed, and both have ubuntu 18.04 installed. (laptop 18.04.5, Jetson 18.04.3).
Log files, and terminal outputs can be seen here.
Any help is appreciated, thanks.

A:

It was a wrong version of Cmake. During rebuilding of package i found that, i get this error
CMake Warning (dev) at /home/user/cmake-install/share/cmake-3.18/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:273 (message):   The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (PCL_APPS)   does not match the name of the calling package (PCL).  This can lead to   problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables   (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern. Call Stack (most recent call first):   /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/cmake/pcl/PCLConfig.cmake:911 (find_package_handle_standard_args)   CMakeLists.txt:24 (find_package) This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

launch file had a lot of find module lines in it, which caused it to pass a null to string values. causing this error.

launch file had a lot of find module lines in it,

this sentence confuses me quite a bit, as $(find ..) in a .launch file does not use CMake.
Neither does CMake use roslaunch.
Comment by rosnroll on 2021-07-04:
I am very new to all this, i am trying to make sense of it all.
I replaced the find package lines with absolute values in .launch files, so the std::logic disappeared during launch.
But they reappear, when i change the ROS_MASTER_URI, or when i have this node be a part of complete system.
I rebuild the workspace using default version of CMake, then the find package warnings during build disappeared, but the overall behavior is still same.
