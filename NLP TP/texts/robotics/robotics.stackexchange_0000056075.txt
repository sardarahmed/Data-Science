Q:

Global Costmap only publishing once to a subscriber?

Hello.
I'm using the amcl_demo.launch file to localize to a static map, and gather costmap data of the environment. When I try to subscribe to the global_costmap/costmap topic, it only publishes once, and will not update the value. The same effect is seen when using rostopic echo. Rviz can update the global costmap display, so I don't know what the issue is. Thanks.

A:

You also need to subscribe to costmap_updates.
Edit: I have uploaded an example of how to combine the topics here: https://github.com/DLu/navigation/commit/92b5a4f2a2c6788bd1d7616c21694b1e49c548c0

I would like to have more info. I'm trying to subscribe to costmap_updates but I obtain: Is /clock being published?
Also in Rviz the global costmap won't update
