If you're using default ports for video_web_server, then 9090 is for socket streams (can't connect via browser) and 8080 is http for the page you're looking for (http://localhost:8080)

A:

I don't think you can just connect your browser to a websocket server, you need a program that talks the websocket protocol. The server doesn't serve a http page, but wants to upgrade the connection to ws. A Javascript program running in a browser could be used to connect using websocket, see http://wiki.ros.org/roslibjs/Tutorials/BasicRosFunctionality
Edit:
There is no ROS webbrowser, you can use a standard webbrowser. The Websocket Server is running under ROS. From the roslibjs Tutorial page: Running the Example starts with starting the Server and publishing messages, but the last 5 lines say: You can open the html file in a local webbrowser (open file) on the same machine, or you could setup a webserver (for html files) and serve this html-file to a webbrowser on a remote machine.
I haven't used rosbride yet, just a C++ websocket library in a system that had nothing to do with ROS.
