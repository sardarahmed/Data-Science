Q:

Rate limiting in Gazebo 1.0

I have been using earlier releases of gazebo with some success.  I'm currently experimenting with the 1.0 -RC3 version of gazebo to be included with fuerte, but I'm having trouble with rate limiting.
In the earlier versions placing the <updateRate> tag with a negative number would lock the simulation to real time.   A bit of investigation into the new system shows that adding an update rate to the ode like this:
<ode update_rate="1.0">

should limit the frame rate.  Despite experimenting with the values my rather simple simulation is still running at many times real time.
Any suggestions?

A:

It's an attribute under , see the SDF documentation for Physics elements, for example, the empty world in gazebo is rate limited to 1000Hz with 1ms time step size, so effectively should track real-time.
