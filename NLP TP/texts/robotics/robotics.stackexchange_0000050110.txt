Q:

repository is announced but not listed

Hi!
I sent a message to announce a repository(called "dlut-ros-pkg ") via mailing list three days ago.
The "dlut-ros-pkg" repository is available at:
https://github.com/ZhuangYanDLUT/dlut-ros-pkg.git.
However,there is no message on the mailing list,and my repository isn't added to the indexer.
Is there anyone who can tell me why? Did I do something wrong when indexing my repository for Documentation Generation?

A:

For ros-users, I'm not sure why your e-mail isn't sent but have you sent from the address you registered?
For package listing, you need to follow certain steps here, not just sending an e-mail.

Update) Did you by any chance try to send e-mails from the website of nabble.com? If so that doesn't work. See this thread.

I use the Github's e-mail.Or should I use another email?The address I registered? Do you mean the Github's address or the ros-users's address?

ros-users mailinglist & github repository have nothing in common. When you send an e-mail to ros-users, try using the address you registered here.

And for pkg listing, I don't see your dlut-ros-pkg in pul requests. Are you sure you did 6. Create Your Own *-ros-pkg Repository in the link you sent?
Comment by sven_007 on 2013-04-07:
Yes,I did 6. Create Your Own *-ros-pkg Repository.I will do it once more to check if I do something wrong.

How can I see the repositories in pull requests?And must I subscribe to the ros-users before I send the message?Must I use the email address which I use to subscribe to the ros-users?

How long will it take to have my pull request serviced?

Please consider opening new questions. Asking too many in comment area isn't appropriate especially because this area isn't as visible to other people as questions.
