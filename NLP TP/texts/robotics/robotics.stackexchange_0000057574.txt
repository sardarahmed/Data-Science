Q:

Always errors when launch the navigation

There are some serious errors when I start the navigation on turtlebot, but I have no idea how to solve that:
/opt/ros/hydro/lib/move_base/move_base: symbol lookup error: /opt/ros/hydro/lib/libcostmap_2d.so: undefined symbol: _ZN3ros7console5printEPNS0_10FilterBaseEPvNS0_6levels5LevelEPKciS7_S7_z
[move_base-15] process has died [pid 28518, exit code 127, cmd /opt/ros/hydro/lib/move_base/move_base cmd_vel:=navigation_velocity_smoother/raw_cmd_vel odom:=odom __name:=move_base __log:=/home/turtlebot/.ros/log/eef369be-a079-11e3-844d-0008cacd6165/move_base-15.log].log file: /home/turtlebot/.ros/log/eef369be-a079-11e3-844d-0008cacd6165/move_base-15*.log

Those errors are happened in a 32-bit ubuntu, but no errors in 64-bit ubuntu, why?

A:

I would check that your system is fully up-to-date by running sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get dist-upgrade.
If that doesn't help, I would take a look at this similar question: http://answers.ros.org/question/123421/hydro-kinect-ubuntu-1204-library-issue/
