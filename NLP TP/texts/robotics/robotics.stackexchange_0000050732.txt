Q:

Move_base: cannot cancel while executing recovery behavior

Hi all, I'm using move_base action client to send goals to my robot and cancel if necessary. It works fine, but I have realized that cancelGoal doesn't work while executing recovery behavior. That is, if I call cancelGoal or cancelAllGoals, the subsequent call to waitForResult doesn't return until all recovery fails. I have tried to disable recovery behavior with:

rosrun dynamic_reconfigure dynparam set move_base recovery_behavior_enabled false

Again, this doesn't returns until recovery fails (more than 2 minutes!). I suppose move_base gets somehow blocked when running recovery behavior and don't even attend reconfigure requests.
Btw, I'm using hydro-devel code navigation stack, but experienced the same with groovy package installation.
Thanks

Hello from 2016, Is this problem solved ?

Unfortunately no. A PR would be more than welcome

Alright, it may takes a while to learn the nav stack from under the hood T_T.
If i can archive it, i will do that PR.  :D
