Q:

Will beginners books on ROS Indigo still be worthwhile when using Jade?

Hello!
I am planning on learning ROS from scratch, and consider my options on how to best get started. I found this book tutorial which teaches ROS Indigo, which i think looks promising. However, I find it logical to learn ROS Jade, since it's out now, and I would mainly be using it for simulations with Gazebo.
Are the basics of Jade and Indigo similar enough that reading a book on Indigo will be practical when working with Jade?
Thanks in advance!

Yes.
In fact, Indigo and Jade are as far as I can see completely identical at that level (you can always check the Jade migration guide). AGITR doesn't use any really complex components (such as navigation or MoveIt) which are more likely to change between ROS releases.
You'll have to replace jade wherever you read indigo (in paths, etc), but other than that you should be able to use the book without issue.

Allright! That was what I was hoping for. Thanks!

You should also bear in mind that Indigo has long term support, so will be around as a supported version longer than Jade will be. Also depending on what robot/robots you use ROS with Indigo might make more sense as they may not have transitioned to Jade.

@nickw, you are entirely right. However, I am currently only intending to learn ROS, and I have no restraints regarding versions etc., so I think I will try out Jade at this point.
