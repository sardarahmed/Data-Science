Q:

Moveit! tutorials on ROS Melodic

Hi, I am trying to install Moveit! on new ROS distro (Melodic).
I think I've done it successfully, but now I am trying to follow the tutorials to get started with moveit!
I am in Getting Started but in the step "Build your Catkin Workspace" with the instructions
cd ~/ws_moveit/src
rosdep install -y --from-paths . --ignore-src --rosdistro kinetic

I get this:
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
panda_moveit_config: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [franka_description]

Does anybody know how to solve this?

Edit: Thank you very much! I've completed Getting Started with no errors.
Still, I'm not able to launch moveit! quickstart (Moveit! Quickstart in RViz)
When launch it with tutorial instrcution I get:
Resource not found: franka_description
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/melodic/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/home/joao/ws_moveit/src/moveit_tutorials
ROS path [2]=/home/joao/ws_moveit/src/panda_moveit_config
ROS path [3]=/opt/ros/melo

Which seems strange to me, because I think I've just git -cloned franka_description package.

I've created an issue to track this:
https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_tutorials/issues/235
A pull request with a work around would be very welcomed, especially in time for World MoveIt! Day

A:

panda_moveit_config: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [franka_description]

The issue here is that while MoveIt itself has seen a first release into Melodic, the panda_moveit_config package has not been (see status_page/compare_kinetic_melodic.html?q=panda, notice how there is no version number listed in the Melodic column).
As those packages are a requirement of the tutorial packages that you've git cloned into your workspace, rosdep will try to install them and fail (seeing as they're not released yet).
What you could try is see whether git clone-ing those pkgs to your Catkin workspace and building them from source works. Note though, no guarantee this will work, as the tutorials have not been released for Melodic yet.
The packages that would be needed are:

panda_moveit_config
franka_description in frankaemika/franka_ros

Note: while panda_moveit_config is a simple, no-compilation needed configuration package, the packages in franka_ros are packages that contain a lot more. You might want to CATKIN_IGNORE or delete all the packages other than franka_description after you've git cloned the franka_ros repository.
After you've added those packages, re-run the rosdep command and it should succeed.
Note again: no guarantee this will work, as the tutorials have not been released for Melodic yet.
And note also: if there are more dependencies of the MoveIt tutorials that aren't available in ROS Melodic, then just getting the Panda pkgs doesn't resolve the issue of course.

Edit: also just noticed this:

rosdep install -y --from-paths . --ignore-src --rosdistro kinetic

Since you are on ROS Melodic, you obviously should specify --rosdistro melodic here, not kinetic.

Edit2:

When launch it with tutorial instrcution I get:

Resource not found: franka_description

ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/melodic/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/home/joao/ws_moveit/src/moveit_tutorials
ROS path [2]=/home/joao/ws_moveit/src/panda_moveit_config
ROS path [3]=/opt/ros/melo

Which seems strange to me, because I think I've just git -cloned franka_description package.

That is slightly strange.
Did you delete all pkgs except franka_description from the franka_ros package?
Did you source your devel/setup.bash after building the workspace?
