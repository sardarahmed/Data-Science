Q:

openni_tracker fails on 12.04

http://answers.ros.org/question/42654/openninite-incompatible-in-fuerteprecise/
According to above, this should been fixed with 1.5.4.0 according to @tfoote but I am still seeing it on Fuerte/Groovy on 12.04.
[ERROR]: Find user generator failed: This operation is invalid!

And I tried the workaround proposed by @pgorczak in there but it no longer works.
Has anyone found another workaround or know how to fix it? Thanks!

A:

For me the workaround worked. It was sufficient to install the linux version of NITE-dev v1.5.2.21 and the error disappeared.

If you take a look at http://www.openni.org/openni-sdk/openni-sdk-history-2/, there are 3 different things. I installed "OpenNI SDK v1.5.4.0", am I supposed to install just "NiTE v1.5.2.21" or all three?

I was installing the wrong thing. Installing "NITE v1.5.2.21" made it work. (It is the last one at that link) Just ran "sudo ./uninstall.sh" and "sudo ./install.sh". Thanks!

@rastaxe could you take a look at my new question http://answers.ros.org/question/55827/openni_tracker-displaying-pointcloud-and-skeleton-alignment/ Thanks!

Hi, I am facing the same problem and have installed NiTE v1.5.2.21 but it still shows the same error for me. I am using ROS Groovy with Ubuntu 12.04. Any help would be appreciated.

In my experience, this method works only on 32 bit, have you a 64 bit? In this case, you have to try openni2_tracker.
