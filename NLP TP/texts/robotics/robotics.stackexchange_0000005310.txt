Q:

Interfacing high-resolution image sensors with ARM Board

I'm working on a project requiring HD (Stereo) Video Processing. Most of High Resolution (5MP+) Sensors use MIPI-CSI interface. 
I managed to get a board with an Exynos5 SoC. The SoC Itself has 2 MIPI-CSI2 interfaces, the problem is that the pins to those interfaces are not exposed and It's (almost) impossible to reach them. So I decided to use the USB3.0 Buses.
The problem is when I get to Significant bandwidth (~5.36 Gibibits/s per sensor), I don't think USB3.0 will work out. Bandwidth = Colordepth*ColorChannels*PixelCount*FPS but this could be solved with a Compressed stream (via a coprocessor)
I was thinking that Cypress' CYUSB306X chip was a good candidate for the job, but one of the problems is that I can't do BGA Soldering by hand nor have been able to find a BGA Soldering Service in Switzerland.
Any Ideas on other interfaces I could implement or other coprocessors with MIPI-CSI2 Interface?
Just a final remark, space and weight are important as this is supposed to be mounted on a drone.

A:

I would like to suggest you to use Beaglebone Black , it is smaller than size compared to Raspberry pie. It is just the size of a credit card. And has a faster processor of 1 GHz and has an inbuilt 3D graphics Accelerator. There is already a Cape Board for BBB that supports HD Video sensors. 
Update :
And if you want to use OpenCL then I would suggest you to take a look at PowerVR SGX540 GPU boards such as MIPSÂ® Creator CI20 and Pandaboard ES which support OpenCL but again for the size would be larger than BBB.
Other Possible Boards:

Arndale Octa Board
ODROID-XU3
Samsung Chromebook
