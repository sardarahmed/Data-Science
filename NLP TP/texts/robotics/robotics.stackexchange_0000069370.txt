Q:

How to run this package (RHex simulation with Gazebo)

Hi everybody!
I'm trying to simulate a RHex robot (RHex)
image description http://kodlab.seas.upenn.edu/uploads/RHex/rhex.jpg
I've found this package in github (CE216) from mugenZebra but I don't know how to run it.
I just launched the world with: gazebo model_push.world
But I don't know how to run any script inside the folder, and I don't see any launch fileâ€¦
Thanks a lot!
Jorge

A:

It looks like this is not a ROS package, but intended for direct use with Gazebo. See the Gazebo write_plugin tutorial for an explanation of how that works.
