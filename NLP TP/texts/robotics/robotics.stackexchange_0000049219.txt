Q:

problem initializing required resources for rgbdslam

Hi every one, I am trying to install rgbdslam in ubuntu 12.10 and groovy ros. I tried to set the "ROS_PACKAGE_PATH" and I am getting this error: "Missing resource rgbdslam_freiburg"
I have downloaded rgbdslam which is now in "/home/rgbdslam"
can anyone please help me to solve this issue.
thanks

A:

Having ros packages in /home/ is not how it's meant to be, they should be somewhere in a subdirectory of your home folder, e.g. under /home//ros
I suggest you follow these instructions for installing rgbdslam
