Q:

How to pass Authentication from ipvs.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de?

I follow roboearth doc.
I have already created an account sam.
I can login on website.
But I failed to login in terminal:
  sam@sam:~/code/ros/cram$ svn info http://ipvs.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/roboearth/repos/public/tags/latest
  Authentication realm: <http://ipvs.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de:80> RoboEarth Repository (BV)
  Password for 'sam': 
  Authentication realm: <http://ipvs.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de:80> RoboEarth Repository (BV)
  Username: sam
  Password for 'sam': 
  Authentication realm: <http://ipvs.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de:80> RoboEarth Repository (BV)
  Username: sam
  Password for 'sam': 
  svn: OPTIONS of 'http://ipvs.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/roboearth/repos/public/tags/latest': authorization failed: Could not authenticate to server: rejected Basic challenge (http://ipvs.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de)
  sam@sam:~/code/ros/cram$ 

How to solve it?
Thank you~

A:

If you look closely, you'll notice that you are using http instead of https in the URL. Try $ svn info https://ipvs.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/roboearth/repos/public/tags/latest.
