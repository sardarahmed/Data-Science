Q:

cannot use custom message

I have written a custom message file.
I have done the necessary modifications in CMakeLists.txt.  and I have run catkin build
So now when I do rosmsg list I can clearly see my custom message
roscustom_test/TheObject

also when I do this:  rosmsg show TheObject I can clearly see
[roscustom_test/TheObject]
....components

However when I try to use it from a script.py I do
from roscustom_test.msg import TheObject

I get
from roscustom_test.msg import TheObject 
Import Error: No module named roscustom_test.msg 

What am I doing wrong here?

A:

Never mind. I found out that after catkin build I should source devel/setup.bash again
