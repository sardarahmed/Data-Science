Q:

Controller spawner couldn't find the expected controller_manager ros interface

I am using Ubuntu 14.04, ROS jade and GAZEBO 5.0
I followed step by step the tutorial of ROS Control in GAZEBO, http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_control&cat=connect_ros. when I execute the command line "roslaunch rrbot_control rrbot_control.launch"
nothing happens and I am not able to control the rrbot robot. Also I see this warning: Controller spawner couldn't find the expected controller_manager ros interface. I am sure that I added the plugin libgazebo_ros_control.so as they said in the tutorial. Any help would be greatly appriciated. Thanks

I think there is a problem with Jade and ros_control with Gazebo if you install it from packages (see this link : http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_installing). I use ros indigo with gazebo6.

Thanks for your feedback. You're right the package gazebo_ros_control hasn't been released yet. But how can I proceed now??

You can install ros indigo (that's what I did when I found there was no gazebo_ros_control released for ros Jade)

Thanks for your suggestion @Brosseau

Thanks so much for your help. Finally I turned it out by building this package (gazebo_ros_control) from source
