Q:

Status of Bullet's soft-body dynamics integration

I was wondering how far the integration efforts of Bullet's soft-body dynamics into Gazebo have come? This task seems to have disappeared from the Roadmap, but I was unable to find anything related in any current Gazebo source code.

A:

We are in the process of implementing many features in Gazebo. Bullet's soft-body dynamics are on our minds, though there is not yet a feature request for it on the Gazebo issue tracker. Please feel free to submit one and vote for it.
As a side note, we are actively working to implement deformable body physics using the DART physics engine. Currently we have added some sdf parameters and are working with the DART developers on the implementation.

Thanks for the update, I'll keep an eye on the development also of DART.

Any update on Gazebo's ability to simulate deformable objects?

There has been some work done with DART soft body, though it hasn't been merged into any release branches yet. Also we need to implement rendering of deformable bodies. There's also a general feature request about soft body support.
