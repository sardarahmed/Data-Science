Q:

Error when using Roboteq Controller ROS2 driver

I have roboteq Controller for brushless DC Motor.  I would like to use the driver abd the controller with ROS2 humble. I was  using this fork https://github.com/DoanNguyenTrong/roboteq_controller_ros/tree/galactic-devel to build it with ROS2 humble but got error in ./controller_driver/src/roboteq_controller_ros/roboteq_controller/include/roboteq_controller/roboteq_controller_node.h in line 26 #include "nav_msgs/msg/odometry.hpp". So can not find the header for the nav_msgs. But when just comment the line it works. So my question is do we need the header or how to fix it if need it?
Thanks

A:

the error you are getting is because humble has different dependencies.
I wrote a ROS2 foxy driver last year that I recently added humble dependencies to. Might work with your MC.
check out the humble branch of
https://github.com/CJdev99/roboteq_ros2_driver/tree/humble-dev
Haven't tested with hardware but you can give it a go.
