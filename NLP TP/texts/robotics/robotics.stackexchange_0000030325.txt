Q:

PCLVisualizer point cloud ID

Hi,
first the code, than the question:
while (!viewer.wasStopped()) {
[...get coordinates...]
if (counter = true) {
    viewer.removePointCloud("1");
    viewer.addPointCloud(point_cloud, "2");
    counter = false;
}else {
    viewer.removePointCloud("2");
    viewer.addPointCloud(point_cloud, "1");
    counter = 1;
}
viewer.spinOnce();

Here the question: If I run this programm, I get "[addPointCloud] A PointCloud with id <2> already exists! Please choose a different id and retry".
So my question is, if there is any possibility to free the old point cloud ID and write a new point cloud to the previous, now free, ID?
Thanks for the help.

A:

Are you sure you did not want to write
if (counter == true) {
     ... code goes here
}

In your code snippet, you accidentally used the assignment operator in C++ and the expression always evaluates to true. Fixing that should resolve matters.
