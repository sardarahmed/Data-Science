Q:

"multiple definition of `main'" error

I have 2 nodes/files(one node for each file) in my package. It's like in talker and listener tutorial. However, after adding a new one (second node/file), I received an error of "multiple definition of `main'". I've check all the braces, they are well-placed.
What could be the possible culprits?

I've just updated the question.

Could you be more clear? You added a second what?

A:

I just forgot to change the node name in the "rosbuild_add_executable" parameter in the CMakeList.txt. I only added the different name for both of them, but not the node name.
