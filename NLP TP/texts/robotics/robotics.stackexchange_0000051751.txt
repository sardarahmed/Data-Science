Q:

CMake search path

ROS installation somehow sets CMake the search path to point to favor ROS packages in /opt/ros.
I want find_package(PCL) to choose the version in /usr/lib rather than /opt/ros/groovy
(The ROS version is missing all of the Grabber stuff)
How can I prevent this behavior? Is there some environment variable I need to set?

A:

CMake uses the environment variable CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH to specify the search path for all find_*() commands.

What variable or file does ROS modify when it gets installed, which adds it to the front of the search path? CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH is unset on my machine.

When you source the setup.bash/sh these environment variables will be set.
