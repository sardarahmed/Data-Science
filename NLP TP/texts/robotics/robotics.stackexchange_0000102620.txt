Q:

AprilTags not detected when close to camera

Hello,
I can detect AprilTags that are "far" from the camera, ie. small on the image and even a little blur, but the detection fails when the tags are close to the camera and when the image is clean and neat, what is counter-intuitive.
Is this expected ?
How can I detect the tags at all scales ?
NB1: Interestingly, if I increase the "quad-decimate" param form default 1.0 to e.g. 16.0 (to reduce the image resolution), I can detect the "close" tag but not the "far" one (seems logical to not detect the small).
NB2: I use the VISP C++ lib directly, not the ROS apriltag packages, and images with 640x360 images

A:

Maybe you can get your anwser by reading through the  paper, where the implementation is explained. Maybe one explanation is, that during the quad detection process only close enough lines are considered.

Robustness to occlusions and
segmentation errors is handled by
adjusting the “close enough”
threshold: by making the threshold
large, significant gaps around the
edges can be handled. Our threshold
for “close enough” is twice the length
of the line plus five additional
pixels. This is a large threshold
which leads to a low false negative
rate, but also results in a high false
positive rate.

That would explain why reducing the resolution helps detecting the closer tag.
