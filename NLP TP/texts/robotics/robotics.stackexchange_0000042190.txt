Q:

navigate in hector map

hi,
I get a nav_msgs/ OccupancyGrid and can view it in rivz, all works fine.
But i have no idea if there is any package or node to navigate with that map.
I am using hector_mapping and a hokulu_laser to get the map.
Are there any packages or so in ros where this is already implemented or do you have a link to a tutorial about that topic and is there anywhere a detailed explanaishon about the OccupancyGrid ?

A:

I suggest you look here. I don't imagine that navigation with an Occupancy Grid Map will be any different based on its orgin. An occupancy grid map is a map of fixed size containing

An occupancy grid map represents the
map as a field of random variables
arranged in an evenly spaced grid.
Each random variable is a binary and
corresponds to the occupancy of the
location it covers.

~ Probabilistic Robotics definition.
This means that the Occupancy of a space is a binary comparision (1 = occupied, 0 = empty). Hope this was helpful! Just try the navigation stack with your map.
