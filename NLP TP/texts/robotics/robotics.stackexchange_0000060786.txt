Q:

How to call functions defined in an external C file from a ROS package?

Hi,
I have a C file(cluster.c) and a header file(cluster.h) which are not a part of any ROS package. I want to call functions in that C file from my already existing ROS package's source file(detect.cpp). Note that "cluster.c" is just a collection of some C functions without a main(). So, it can't be compiled separately.
I thought of  creating a library out of "cluster.c" and "cluster.h" and link that library to my ROS package? How do I do this? What changes should I make to my existing package's CMakeLists.txt and package.xml?
This may be a silly and repeated question as I found similar questions being answered.  As I am very new to ROS I couldn't understand much from those answers. If someone could explain me in simple terms, it would be great.
Thanks,
Raj

A:

Just add those files as header files like #include<filename.h> or #include<filename.c>  in your source files in ros package.
Then you can call those functions from the source file.
