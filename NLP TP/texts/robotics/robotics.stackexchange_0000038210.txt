Q:

can't access std_srvs

The turtlesim node offers a service called "/reset" that allows me to reset the position of the turtle. The type of message accepted by the "/reset" service is of type
std_srvs.Empty

I tried to do,
import std_srvs
from std_srvs.srv import Empty

but it didn't work. I kept getting error messages saying std_srvs couldn't be found. I then tried adding 'std_srvs' as one of the dependencies in the manifest file of the package. Now the node was able to access std_srvs but not 'Empty'. Finally I had to do,
roscp std_srvs Empty mypackage/srv

and then rosmake and finally it worked.
Could someone please tell me, why I wasn't able to access std_srv.Empty before copying it to the srv folder in my package?
Thanks

A:

You must include the following before importing any ROS packages:
import roslib; roslib.load_manifest('package_name') 

EDIT:
You must also have the packages that you want to use in your manifest.xml.
Here's an example... If your package is called "beginner_tutorials", you would put the following in your node:
import roslib; roslib.load_manifest('beginner_tutorials') 

If your node uses the std_srvs package, your manifest.xml file must contain the following line:
<depend package="std_srvs" />

I got those errors I mentioned earlier in spite of having that line which you have mentioned. But did you mean to say I should have had the line "import roslib; roslib.load_manifest('std_srvs')"? I don't suppose so..
