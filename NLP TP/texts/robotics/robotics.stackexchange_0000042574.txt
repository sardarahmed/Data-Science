Q:

rosmake: error: no such option: --rosdep-install

Hi,
I found there's something wrong with the installation of openni_kinect as I followed this website:http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_kinect.
But when I typed rosmake openni_kinect --rosdep-install in the terminal of Ubuntu12.04, it displays rosmake: error: no such option: --rosdep-install. I have already checked on the internet, the answer seems to be http://answers.ros.org/question/38291/no-such-option-rosdep-install/.
I have tried but it still doesn't work!!!Looking for help!!!!
Thank you so much!
Lili

A:

it seems that I should call rosdep install and rosmake seperately in fuerte:
After I type
rosdep install openni_kinect
rosmake openni_kinect
rather than
rosmake openni_kinect --rosdep-install
in the terminal.
It finally works!!!

This is correct. The rosmake --rosdep-install option is no longer available in Fuerte. Use an explicit rosdep install command, instead.
