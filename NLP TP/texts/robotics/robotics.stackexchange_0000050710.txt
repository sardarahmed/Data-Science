Q:

Mesh model for PR2

Is there any way to get the mesh model for PR2?
Can I find it in some packages or from other sources.
Thanks~

Were you able to create the mesh model?

A:

You can find collada and STL meshes of different parts of PR2 model here. If you need PR2 as one single mesh, you can use one of these xacro models and convert it to a collada mesh using urdf to collada tool. You will loose the joints though and also I am not sure how far it will work out.
