Q:

Running a raspberry pi(wiring pi) node with roslaunch

I am having trouble to run a node present in /ros_workspace/devel/lib/blink where blink is the package and this directory contains the blink executable, this executable is ran with root permission, I dont understand the work around with roslaunch with such files.
How can I run this with one roslaunch with other nodes in the bot.
Please let me know any other info that maybe needed to solve this.
thank you.

A:

Did you source the workspace?
Normally, the source call is made in ~/.bashrc, but you can also just use it from the command line.
For ROS kinetic:
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash

and, in your case, assuming that your catkin workspace is actually ~/ros_workspace:
source ~/ros_workspace/devel/setup.bash

Then you should be able to do
roslaunch blink blink

how can I make the launch automatically ask for root access and automatically run as root, as  wiringpi cpp requires root access.

That's a common problem with wiringpi and ROS. You will have to go through the hassle of setting permissions on /dev/mem and /dev/gpiomem.  I suggest considering alternatives like pigpio or RPi.gpio where the permissions are already setup.
