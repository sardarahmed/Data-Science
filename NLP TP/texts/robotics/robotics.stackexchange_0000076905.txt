Q:

How to use depthimage_to_laserscan package to create map?

I am running rosrun depthimage_to_laserscan depthimage_to_laserscan and the scan topic is published and when I rosbag record -o /scan /tf the scan topic is not been recorded and the map is not created. I am new to ros and also read thewiki page bit didn't understand how to do that any suggestion. I want to make a 2D map to implement localization.

Really? A bump after ~20 minutes? This is not a (slow)chat ..

A:

Download the gmapping package sudo apt-get install ros-[version]-gmapping. Then I would suggest launching both nodes using a launch file like so:
<launch>

    <!--- Depth image to laser scan -->
    <node pkg="depthimage_to_laserscan" type="depthimage_to_laserscan" name="depthimage_to_laserscan" >
        <param name="scan_height" value="3"/> 
        <param name="output_frame_id" value="base_link"/>
        <remap from="image" to="camera/depth/image_rect_color" />
    </node>

    <!-- Maping Node -->
    <node pkg="gmapping" type="slam_gmapping" name="gmapping_node" output="screen" >
        <remap from="odom" to="your/odom/topic" />
    </node>

</launch>
