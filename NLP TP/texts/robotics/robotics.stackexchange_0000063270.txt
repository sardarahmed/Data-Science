Q:

How to make Graphical User interfaces in ROS?

Can anybody please let me know how to make a graphical user interfaces in ROS? I have heard about qt and rqt. But there is so less documentation available about these. I have also heard rqt_gui. I have to make a user interface for a mobile robot. I was considering using an android app for that. But, if a user interface can be easily built using ROS tools then I think it would be a better option.
Can somebody please help?
Thanks

A:

I suggest you look at the rqt/Tutorials on the wiki.
There is not a standard way to do things on android.
Another option is to use a web interface for which Robot Web Tools is a recommended approach.

Thanks for that. I have looked up at rqt. I would use the WYSIWYG offered by Qt Creator to create the design of the GUI.
