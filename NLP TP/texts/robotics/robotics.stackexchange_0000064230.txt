Q:

calling an available package(APIs) from another package

Hello All,
I am working on kuka youbot. I have to use API functions for operating the base of youbot. To do this, I need to create a user application based on the ROS package which calls the youbot API functions from the Library/package of those APIs.
Dose anyone knows how do I do this procedure? Any ideas or tutorial links would be helpful.
