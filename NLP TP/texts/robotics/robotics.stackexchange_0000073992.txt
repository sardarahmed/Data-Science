Q:

Is it possible to reuse the tf::TransformBroadcaster

It is simple as mentioned above. Is it possible to reuse the object br for multiple transforms having different parent and child frames
static tf::TransformBroadcaster br;
        br.sendTransform( tf::StampedTransform(tf, ros::Time::now(), "frame_1", "frame_2") );
        br.sendTransform( tf::StampedTransform(tf, ros::Time::now(), "frame_2", "frame_3") );

The question popped reading the tutorial here.
Furthermore where should I start looking when the terminal erros me nan_input for the send transform, assuming the quaternion is fine, a normalized unit quaternion.
tf::Quaternion q_f2tof3(rot[3], rot[4], rot[5], qw);
tf::Transform(q_f2tof3, tf::Vector3(0,0,0))

A:

Yes, it's fine to reuse the TransformBroadcaster to send multiple different transforms, irrespective of their relationship. Based on your above content you may want to send them simultaneously using a vector of transforms.
A nan_input almost always means an unnormalized quaternion. The other option is that you're passing in a nan value to the vector. But based on the above snippet that does not look possible and as such I'd suggest checking your normalization logic.
