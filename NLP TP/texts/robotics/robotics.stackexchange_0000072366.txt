Q:

Problem making ros gazbeo module with velodyne_pointcloud

Hi,
I am using ROS jade and I needed velodyne package for my module. So I used the tutorial describe in http://answers.ros.org/question/226594/how-do-i-build-ros-vlp16-velodyne-driver-for-indigo-using-catkin/
and built velodyne package for ROS Jade.
After that when I do catkin_make
I get following errors:
-- Using these message generators: gencpp;geneus;genlisp;genpy
CMake Error at /opt/ros/jade/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:75 (find_package):
Could not find a package configuration file provided by
"velodyne_pointcloud" with any of the following names:
velodyne_pointcloudConfig.cmake
velodyne_pointcloud-config.cmake

Add the installation prefix of "velodyne_pointcloud" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
or set "velodyne_pointcloud_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
files.  If "velodyne_pointcloud" provides a separate development package or
SDK, be sure it has been installed.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
azcar_sim/CMakeLists.txt:7 (find_package)
-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

make: *** [cmake_check_build_system] Error 1
I don't know how to fix that. Can somebody help me?
Thanks.
Rahul

A:

Okay, so I realized that my module and velodyne package that I had downloaded from git were in different catkin workspace. I resolved it by downloading and making velodyne package in same catkin workspace.
Thanks.
