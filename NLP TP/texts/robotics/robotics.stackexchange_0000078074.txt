Q:

How to publish Image and IMU data from Android device?

Hi,
First of all, i'm a newbie in ROS. I was going through the following tutorial:
http://wiki.ros.org/roslibjs/Tutorials/Publishing%20video%20and%20IMU%20data%20with%20roslibjs
I kind of understood what is going on in this program. But, i don't know how to run it. I would be grateful if someone lends me a hand to get through this problem.
Thanks in advance !

A:

It's not really "a program" (in the traditional sense), but a html page with an embedded javascript.

But, i don't know how to run it.

You'd need to set up the rosbridge_suite infrastructure on the ROS side and then load the web page into a browser on the Android device. The Android device should be able to reach the rosbridge node (ie: be able to network with the ROS PC).

Thanks for your reply. So, should i run "roscore" and "roslaunch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket.launch" command  in my computer to receive the data from android device ?

roscore will be run automatically for you by roslaunch if you don't do it yourself, but basically: yes.

i opened the html file in my Android Phone and opened the console in it. Then i ran "roscore" and "roslaunch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket.launch" in my laptop. But, nothing happens.

First: I think the order should be the other way around: first roslaunch rosbridge, then open the web page.
Second: the tutorial states:

make it accessible via a webserver running on the server that is running the rosbridge [..]

Did you do that?

Also: what did you expect to happen? The JS only causes the phone to publish IMU and sensor_msgs/Image msgs. If you don't subscribe to those, you won't see anything.

You can start a 'simple web server' on your ROS pc by running:
python -m SimpleHTTPServer

in the directory containing the html file.
