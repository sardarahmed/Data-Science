A:

It's conceptually the same as in Python, just syntactically different. Include your message headers and parse the data using a [c++ subscriber](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingPublisherSubscriber(c%2B%2B).

The answer from @curranw is correct... a PointCloud2 message is just like any other message. Subscribe to the data and work with it. However I will point out that it seems a huge majority of people working with C++ and point clouds tend to use PCL and pcl_ros
