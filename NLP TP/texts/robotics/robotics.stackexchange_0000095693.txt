Q:

ROS GUI for Android

Has anyone developed a ROS GUI for android devices?
I want to make a GUI to control a mobile robot depending on ROS packages through android devices. I think I should send ROS messages via WIFI network.
I found that some people used QT Creator but there wasn't any clear document.
Does anyone have any advices?
