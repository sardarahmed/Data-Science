Q:

The "add_rostest" macro is not being recognized

I am trying to create my rostests for catkin, and I've been following the instructions here: www.ros.org/wiki/catkin/migrating_from_rosbuild.
My CMakelists.txt file includes these two lines:
add_executable(guiTest EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL src/test/guiTest.cpp)
add_rostest(test/guiTest.test)

However, upon running catkin_make, I get this error:
CMake Error at au_uav_ros/CMakeLists.txt:81 (add_rostest):
  Unknown CMake command "add_rostest".

Why isn't it recognizing add_rostest?  My "rospack list" command shows that I have: rostest /opt/ros/groovy/share/rostest.  Should I just try re-installing the rostest package?

A:

The answer had to do with linking libraries.  I had to add:
target_link_libraries(guiTest ${catkin_LIBRARIES})

to my CMakesList, and then the test node was found.  I don't remember this step being mentioned though for the original rosbuild rostests.
