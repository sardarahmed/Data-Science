Q:

FLIR PTU initialization error

Hi,
I'm trying to get a FLIR pan and tilt unit (PTU) to run. I've cloned the following repo's:
https://github.com/wjwwood/serial.git
https://github.com/ros-drivers/flir_ptu.git

My username has been added to the dialup group. I've checked that the device is on and connected (dmesg | grep tty). I made sure the baud rate is correct. I tried launching it with the delivered launch file:
roslaunch flir_ptu_driver ptu.launch

But unfortunately I get:

I can't figure out what else I could try from here to get it to run. Has anyone got any suggestions or has anyone had the same issue?

A:

The /dev/ttyUSB0 port belongs to the group dialout so you need to add the user to that group as follows:
sudo adduser $USER dialout

Like I mentioned in my description my username has already been added to the dialup group

Just making sure: you have logged out and logged in after adding yourself to the group? What is the output of ls -al /dev/ttyUSB0 and groups?
