Q:

seting the initial pose in navigation not using "2D Pose Estimate" tool in rviz

Dear All,
I am using the navigation pkg for Kuka youbot. My question is whether there is another way to set initial and goal poses of robot in the map except using 2D Pose Estimate" tool in rviz?
Thank you for your help and suggestions.

A:

All that rviz does is publish a message, which you can do from anywhere. initialpose (geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped)
