Q:

[gazebo-2] process has died [pid 25662, exit code -11]

Hi all,
I want to run the simulation http://www.ros.org/wiki/simulator_gazebo/Tutorials/StartingGazebo,but it gives me error message as follows. seems it is a GUI rendering problem? Is it related to graphic drivers? I am using a Lenovo t410 notebook with Ubuntu 10.04.
The gazebo-2 process died but the log file is empty. The exit code sometimes will be 255.

@tianb03 : Hi, can you check your /tmp folder for a gazebo folder. Try deleting it and then running the simulation.

A:

You can see this question for some information regarding graphics drivers. Additionally, many Lenovo computers come with Optimus (two graphics cards). This does not play well with Ubuntu. Consider disabling one card.
