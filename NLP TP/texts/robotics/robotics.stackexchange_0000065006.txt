Q:

Question about creating a package tutorial

I'm currently learning how to use ros right now and going through the tutorials and I'm on this one
http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage
Everything works fine until I get to step 5.1 when it comes to First Order Dependencies
I use catkin_create_pkg beginner_tutorials std_msgs rospy roscpp

However when I try the next command rospack depends1 beginner_tutorials, it doesn't work.
Here's is the long from my terminal
angelo@angelo-Satellite-S55t-B:~/catkin_ws/src$ catkin_create_pkg beginner_tutorials std_msgs rospy roscpp
Created file beginner_tutorials/CMakeLists.txt
Created file beginner_tutorials/package.xml
Created folder beginner_tutorials/include/beginner_tutorials
Created folder beginner_tutorials/src
Successfully created files in /home/angelo/catkin_ws/src/beginner_tutorials. Please adjust the values in package.xml.
angelo@angelo-Satellite-S55t-B:~/catkin_ws/src$ rospack depends1 beginner_tutorials
[rospack] Error: no such package beginner_tutorials

I should be getting this instead, but I'm not
std_msgs
rospy
roscpp

I'm currently using ROS Indigo and Ubuntu 14.04. I also realize there is a bug that's reported in the tutorial, but I believe the bug was referring to a segmentation fault.
What should I do next?

A:

It seems that the tutorials missed a crucial step. Before you are able to use your ROS package you need to build the workspace and also source the generated setup file. This will especially add you source folder to the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.
I have updated the tutorial: http://wiki.ros.org/action/diff/ROS/Tutorials/catkin/CreatingPackage?action=diff&rev1=25&rev2=26
Please try it with the newly added step: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage#ROS.2BAC8-Tutorials.2BAC8-catkin.2BAC8-CreatingPackage.Building_a_catkin_workspace_and_sourcing_the_setup_file
