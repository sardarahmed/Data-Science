Q:

rosrun not finding executable

I am at the "Writing a Simple Publisher and Subscriber (C++)" step in the tutorial and catkin_make works and i can manually run both talker and listener correctly from ~/code/catkin_ws/devel/lib/beginner_tutorials/ where the binaries are. The issue is that rosrun can't find them:
$ rosrun beginner_tutorials talker                       
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named talker below /home/exuvo/code/catkin_ws/build/beginner_tutorials/catkin_generated/stamps/beginner_tutorials

I do not understand why it's not looking in the correct place as the ros path looks correct to me.
$ echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH                                 
/home/exuvo/code/catkin_ws:/opt/ros/groovy/share:/opt/ros/groovy/stacks

Any ideas what I am doing wrong?

A:

Usually $ rospack profile helps. As I understand it crawls through the directories in ROS_PACKAGE_PATH and updates the list of available packages.
P.S. How did you initialize the catkin workspace? The path looks truncated, i.e. it should be /home/exuvo/code/catkin_ws/src with src at the end, at least on my system it is like this. Just in case here is the tutorial.

My code is in ~/code/catkin_ws/src/beginner_tutorials as it should and the symlink to catkins toplevel CMakeLists exists in src. When i run catkin_make in ~/code/catkin_ws it creates the build and devel folders and find search gave me the path to the working executables.
Comment by Boris on 2013-04-09:
So, have you tried rospack profile?
Comment by exuvo on 2013-04-09:
I edited the main post with the output, rosrun still not working. Should i somehow exclude the build folder? Do I need to run something more than catkin_make for rosrun to find things?
Comment by exuvo on 2013-04-09:
I found the error! I had missed the last line in the link you gave "source devel/setup.bash". I was only sourcing the global and adding the ros path manually. I thought you meant "catkin_init_workspace" when you wrote initialize workspace which i had done.
Comment by Boris on 2013-04-09:
Great! One question though - did you initialize catkin workspace in catkin_ws/src or somewhere else? Maybe that is the effect of not sourcing devel/setup.bash, however, catkin_generated shouldn't be anywhere in catkin_ws/src, but in the catkin_ws/build.
Comment by exuvo on 2013-04-10:
I believe I initialized the catkin workspace in catkin_ws/src. All catkin_generated folders are under catkin_ws/build, I must have confused you somewhere. Thanks for the help.
