As you can see from the error message printed, message_to_tf doesn't use ROS parameters for the topic, but expects a single argument on the command line.
The <topic> bit in the error message is something you have to provide.
In a .launch file, you can do that with the args attribute of the node element:
<node name="odom_to_tf" pkg="message_to_tf" type="message_to_tf" args="<topic>">
</node>

Be sure to replace <topic> with the actual name of the topic of course.
