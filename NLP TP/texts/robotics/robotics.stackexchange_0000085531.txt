Q:

Is it possible to change PID parameters of 6 motors silmutaneously(in a single launch file)?)

Hi everyone, i'm trying to control a 6 dof robot arms using 6 dynamixel motors(MX series). The only way i know to tune PID parameters is to launch dynamixel_workbench_single_manager. However, i may only tune the parameters one by another and cause a time-waste. So i'm searching a way to tune multi-motors parameters. Is it possible or where can i find the source to realize this.

Can you be more specific ? Like do you want to share the same configuration with all your motors ? It looks like you have to create a launch file to define all your parameters.

A:

Hello :)
Thank you for your inquiry about dynamixel_workbench.
You can change parameters of multi-dynamixels using SyncWrite function.
If you look at line 56 in torque control example, 'Goal_Current' parameter are added to syncwrite handler. You can change it as 'P_Gain' or 'D_Gain' and write gain to the dynamixels by syncWrite function simultaneously.(line 152 in same example)
Best regards
Darby

Well this launch isn't doing what you want ?

Thanks a lot :)) However, i have just encountered another error. When i launch the torque_control file, after the model and id popped out, the process died immediately. How come?? :(

What are you launching exactly ? torque_control.cpp or torque_control.launch ?
Comment by ryan on 2018-03-02:
torque_control.launch exactly.

Well since it's just a simple launcher for the torque node it means that you might have a problem with your parameters, check with ls /dev/input if your devices are well connected.
