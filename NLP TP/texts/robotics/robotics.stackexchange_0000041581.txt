Q:

UWSim install error - not installing osgocean

I'm trying to install UWSim
http://www.irs.uji.es/uwsim/wiki/index.php?title=Installing_UWSim
It installs the first 16 packages, but encounters an error when installing osgocean. The message is

Good. Anyway, the error seems more related to write permisions under the opt/ folder. You should probably create a ros workspace somewhere under your home folder (http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment#Create_a_ROS_Workspace)
