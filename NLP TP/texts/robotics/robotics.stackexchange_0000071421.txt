A:

It sounds like your Debain ROS installation is in a broken state. I believe roslaunch is telling you that xacro failed to create the SDF file. This is likely due to using an old version of xacro. I recommend updating your install:
$ sudo apt-get install --only-upgrade ros-indigo-xacro 

If that doesn't work, you may need to update your entire set of ROS packages. The best way I know of for this (please correct me if I am wrong here):
$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

That will upgrade all of your out of date packages (ROS and otherwise), and remove any old and conflicting packages.

Still no luck. The roslaunch command still gets stuck.
