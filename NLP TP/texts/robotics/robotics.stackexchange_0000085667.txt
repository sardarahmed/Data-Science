Q:

roslaunch for ros 2 composition packages

I was going trough the composition packages in ROS 2 which I found to be similar to the ros nodelets concepts.In ROS 1 we use launch files to start a particular nodelet.Will there be similar concept for  future ROS 2 releases? Or should we create a seperate executable like the manual_composition.cpp file for every components we have created in ROS 2 ??
Thanks for your help.

A:

You should be able to use something like roslaunch to run your nodes in ROS 2 without making a file like manual_composition.cpp each time. In the same demo is api_composition.cpp which loads nodes dynamically from a ROS service call:
https://github.com/ros2/demos/blob/master/composition/src/api_composition.cpp
We'll have something similar to that, but exactly what and how it works is still under consideration. If you're interested see this design document:
https://github.com/ros2/design/pull/163
Which is still not finished yet, but already covers some of what you're asking about in the "calling conventions" section.
Also, see this which is a more "aspirational" demo of how node composition might work:
