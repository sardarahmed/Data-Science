Q:

ROS implementation of Behavior Trees?

Hello,
I have run through the tutorials for both SMACH and teer.  I am wondering if anyone has implemented a ROS package based on behavior trees as used in some AI game software?
Thanks!
patrick

A:

I have just discovered this package
which has its own implementation of behavior trees.
I haven't tried yet, but It might be what you are looking for.

Recently did my own searching, and also came across https://github.com/almc/behavior_trees as an implementation from this paper: http://www.csc.kth.se/~almc/pdf/unified_bt_framework.pdf

I actually found a stable behavior tree implementation here: https://github.com/miccol/ROS-Behavior-Tree . I first started first using the almc implementation, but the miccol one has the concept of "halt" that allows an action to be preempted.

I ended up writing my own Python implementation called pi_trees which includes ROS wrappers for actions, topics and services.
