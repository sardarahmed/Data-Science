Q:

Creating 2d grid from laser scans

Is there a way to create an OccupancyGrid without using the 2D SLAM libraries? I have a turtlebot firing laser scans while rotating - the lasers collide into the rooms walls.  I want to create an OccupancyGrid showing where there are empty spaces and obstacles.
