Q:

ros-jade-graph-msgs missing in jade?

It seems that the graph_msgs package was removed from ROS Jade.
The package was previously called "ros-indigo-graph-msgs"
Was it renamed or replaced with some other package?
Thanks

A:

It looks like the author just hasn't released the package for Jade yet. So far, only 520 packages have been released for Jade, so there are quite a few to come, I'm sure.

But you could always just clone the indigo branch of the repo and build it under Jade yourself for now.
