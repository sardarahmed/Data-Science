Q:

navigation stack SendingSimpleGoals Tutorial

Hi all,
I am trying to run on our differential drive robot with the navigation stack.I am using cturtle 1.2.4.the tf transform in my setup is map->odom->base_link->base_laser.However When i am giving the initial pose using rviz to make the robot to be on map the odom frame is not moving with respect to the base_link.It is staying at the same place as before.However the laser frame is transforming properly.I am not able to give the goal to the robot.When i used sending goals through code the following error is showing
"The base failed to move forward 1 meter for some reason".As far as i understand the localization is working fine.So where I am going wrong?Thanking you

So you are using the code from http://www.ros.org/wiki/navigation/Tutorials/SendingSimpleGoals to send goals?

no we have build the robot ourselves and also written the drivers.The drivers are working fine because we are able to  operate it using joystick.

Is this a custom robot or are you using an existing driver to provide access to the robot itself (such as p2os or rosaria)?

A:

With your updates to the question the error you are getting says that the move base action failed.  Do you have 1 meter of free space in front of the robot?  Try it with a smaller distance defined.
