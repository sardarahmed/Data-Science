Q:

colcon build failed for soss-ros1 in soss

I followed steps in https://github.com/osrf/soss to run the demo for understanding of SOSS. I have installed both ROS Crystal and Melodic. However, colcon build  failed for building soss-ros1 . I attach the logs. I am unsure what those error messages mean. Can you please help to take a look? Thanks.

This code block was moved to the following github gist:

A:

After changing from gcc/g++-5 to gcc/g++-7, I can build soss-ros1-test, i.e.
sudo update-alternatives --config gcc
sudo update-alternatives --config g++

followed by choosing gcc/g++-7.
However, running
soss src/soss-ros1/examples/hello_ros.yaml 

failed. I will ask question about it in a separate thread.
