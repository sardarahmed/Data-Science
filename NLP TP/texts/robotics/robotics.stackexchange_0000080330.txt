Q:

Is topic communcation zero-copy if running multiple nodelets standalone? (instead of a manager)

I am confused by the Nodelet Docs regarding the two possibilities to run a nodelet (1.4 Basic Usage). Apparently, one can either

launch one nodelet manager and load multiple nodelets into this manager or
launch multiple standalone nodelets in different nodes.

Is the communication between nodelets still zero-copy, if I launch
them as standalone nodelets?

A:

No, the Data will be copied in this case. Zero copy publish/subscribe ist only possible if both nodelets Run in the Same process, i.e. in one node...

thanks for the answer. but what is the purpose then of standalone nodelets? as far as I understood, the big advantage of nodelets over nodes is the zero-copy transport..

The advantage of standalone nodelets, is that you program the nodelet but can still run your module as a node. This maybe interesting for debugging porpuses...
You only get the zero-copy transport capability when the nodelets are started on the same nodelet_manager process.
