Q:

Simulator for a robot with a laser scanner for begineers

Hi,
I'm new in ROS and I just recently finished the beginner tutorial level using ROS Indigo. I want to know if there is a robot simulator where I can set two robots with a laser scanner in each one for beginners level? because I wanted to use PR2 simulator but it only works for Groovy or early versions of ROS.
Best,
