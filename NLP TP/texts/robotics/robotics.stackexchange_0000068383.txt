I don't think I've seen support for this added to the velodyne driver, and I haven't even seen any documentation from Velodyne about how to enable it. You may have to add this support yourself.

I think dual return was defined here? is it true?
Dual return have been defined in rawdata.h --->    http://docs.ros.org/indigo/api/velodyne_pointcloud
program line
00063   static const int VLP16_FIRINGS_PER_BLOCK = 2;  // dual return

A:

After connecting to VLP16, connect to the web server at http://192.168.1.201/ and you will find settings to change many hardware settings. There you can change the return mode.
