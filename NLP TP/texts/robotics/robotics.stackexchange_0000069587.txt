Q:

Is it possible to plot coraviance matrices in rxplot?

Morning all,
I am trying to plot a few msgs on rxplot, which works perfectly fine for 1D. But when I try plotting the covariance matrix given in the message type geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped, nothing is plotted on the screen but my terminal is filled with the covariance values over time, along with the error message: "value was not numeric" . My command looks as follows:
rxplot /< namespace >/ < msg > /pose/covariance
Is there something I have missed? Is it even possible to plot variables of multiple dimensions? I would further like to be able to declare which elements of the matrix to plot (only diagonal values) if it is possible.
Thank you for your help.

A:

You cannot plot a multi-dimentional value on a timeline. You can probably plot a single value from the matrix.
