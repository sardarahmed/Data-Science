A:

From this:

E: The repository 'http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu jammy Release' does not have a Release file.

it looks like you're trying to use the ROS 1 package repositories on Ubuntu Jammy.
The ROS 2 package repository would be http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu (note the ros2 in the URL).
ROS 1 does not support Ubuntu Jammy, so the apt error is correct: there is no release file it can download.
