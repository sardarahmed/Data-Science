Q:

How do visual obstructions impact the ability to localize using LIDAR?

If a street is extremely crowded to an extent that the terrain is not visible from the point of view of the LIDAR (e.g. in google's self driving car), can it still manage to localize itself and continue to operate? I recall Sebastian Thrun saying that Google's car cannot navigate through snow filled roads since the onboard LIDAR cannot map the terrain beneath the snow (e.g. here).
[Edit : Based on the comments] Clarifying the context, here "not visible" means there is an obstacle between the LIDAR and the terrain

A:

The snow problem you're referring to seems to that the car can no longer tell where the edge of the road is.
Even in heavy traffic, a good driver still maintains enough space from the car in front that plenty of road is visible, and the side of the road identifiable from LiDAR. This is not common practice, but I imagine autonomous cars would be programmed to do so. In that case, plenty of road is always visible for the car.
Google's car seems to have no problems in heavy traffic.
