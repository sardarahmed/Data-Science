Q:

Running Gazebo and ROS on a remote instance

First off, let me say that I know that similar questions have been asked before, but I have been unable to find any answers that actually solve my problem.
I am trying to run Gazebo and the associated gazebo_ros package on a headless OpenStack instance, and using the gzweb software to access it through a browser. I do not need gzclient to be running on this instance at all. When I run the following command:
roslaunch gazebo_ros empty_world.launch

it gives me the following error:

Error [RenderEngine.cc:680] Unable to
create glx visual

Warning [RenderEngine.cc:88] Unable to create
X window. Rendering will be disabled

Other similar questions (such as here and here) suggest using DISPLAY=:0, but when I add this into the command as follows:
DISPLAY=:0 roslaunch gazebo_ros empty_world.launch

it gives me a different error:

Error [RenderEngine.cc:665] Can't open
display: :0

Warning [RenderEngine.cc:88] Unable to create
X window. Rendering will be disabled

I have also tried setting
<arg name="gui" default="false"/> 
<arg name="headless" default="true"/>

in the empty_world.launch file, but no luck. I'm pulling my hair out here trying to get this thing working. Any advice would be hugely appreciated.

A:

I am not an expert on Gazebo, or openstack, but I have seen some similar stuff before. Perhaps the X11 configuration is not set up properly. You are running openstack headless. Does it have an X window server installed/properly configured? Ultimately that is what will enable you to access the GUI over the network.

Yeah, I think it's an X11 server problem, not a Gazebo problem. Will move to a more appropriate question forum.
