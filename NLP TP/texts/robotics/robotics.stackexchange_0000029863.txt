Q:

ROS for industrial networks

Has anyone used ROS to directly talk to devices over some of the more common industrial networks, like DeviceNet, ControlNet, or Profibus.  I know that there is some support within ROS for EtherCat, but it appears to be limited to the PR-2 servo drives.  I would really like to use ROS to directly read/write networked digital and analog IO.

A:

I'm not aware of any existing integration with your listed networks.  The usual method to do this sort of integration would be to write a driver node which would form a bridge.
There are examples of connecting to other IP based networks with YARP and  Orocos.
There are lots of other drivers which provide interfaces to other, non IP based, transports.
