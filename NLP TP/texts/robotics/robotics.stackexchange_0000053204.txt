Q:

config file does not exist for rviz

Hi,
I am new to ROS and trying to work with rviz. When I run rviz using following command
rosrun rviz rviz

I get following error prompt (on a window)

Config file does not exist

/home/abc/.rviz/display_config does not exist!

Can any one help me please? Thanks.

A:

In ROS Fuerte and earlier, this message is normal to come up the first time you launch RViz.
After RViz has come up, select File / Save Config and it should disappear next time run RViz.
