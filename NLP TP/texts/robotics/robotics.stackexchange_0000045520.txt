Q:

rosdep stack dependencies

I am trying to use rosdep to install the dependencies to a package on ROS fuerte, and I am getting an error. Perhaps someone could help me out.
Suppose I have a stack foo which depends on stack bar, with manifest:
<stack>
  <description brief="foo"> foo </description>
  <depend stack="bar" />
</stack>

Suppose I don't have ros-fuerte-bar installed on my system. Will
$ rosdep install foo

prompt me to install ros-fuerte-bar? Or is it just supposed to produce an error and fail?

A:

rosdep will not install any stack dependencies, only real system dependencies.
If you do not have your stack bar released, you cannot release foo because debian package generation requires all stack dependencies to also be available as debian packages. Also, it will add ros-fuerte-bar to ros-fuerte-foo's package dependencies so when you install foo from debian packages, bar will also be installed by apt-get.
