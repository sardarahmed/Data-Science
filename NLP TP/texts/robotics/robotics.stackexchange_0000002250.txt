Q:

Finding inverse kinematics algorithm for a specific manipulator

I need to find a way to solve invrese kinematics for Comau SMART-3 robot. Could you give me a few hints where to start looking? I have no idea about robotics and I couldn't find an algorithm for this specific robot.

A:

To expand on Ugo's answer, some libraries that implement these general IK algorithms:

OpenRave
ROS MoveIt!
Matlab Robotics Toolkit
Orocos

For people just starting out with kinematics, I highly suggest using one of these powerful libraries.
