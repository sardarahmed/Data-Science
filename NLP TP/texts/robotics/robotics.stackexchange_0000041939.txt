Q:

How to localize pr2 on gazebo?

I followed Faking Sensor Info in Simulation.
I run
  roslaunch pr2_gazebo pr2_empty_world.launch
  roslaunch pr2_teleop teleop_keyboard.launch
  rosrun fake_localization fake_localization
  rostopic echo amcl_pose

It doesn't show any result.
How to solve it?
Thank you~

A:

The odometry frame for the PR2 is not odom but odom_combined. You need to set the corresponding parameter for fake_localization. For instance, the following launch file should work:
<launch>
  <node name="fake_localizaton" type="fake_localization" pkg="fake_localization">
    <rosparam>
      odom_frame_id: odom_combined
      base_frame_id: base_footprint
    </rosparam>
  </node>
</launch>
