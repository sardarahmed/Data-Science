How to publish an array of strings?

operation=['addition','subtraction','multiplication','division']
I want to publish each element in the array from one node and subscribe those elements by other node. What should be the proper python syntax for publishing and subscribing ?

I was able to publish simple data such as integers, but when I tried for arrays, ros was giving some error. How can we publish it properly?

" ros was giving some error. "  It would be easier if you'd tell exactly(!) which error is returned. And do you want to publish an array or "each element in the array"?
