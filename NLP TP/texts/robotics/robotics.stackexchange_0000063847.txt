Q:

how to use diff_drive_controller

I have installed ros_control, ros_controllers, and diff_drive_controller under ROS indigo. however, I am having issues getting the diff_drive_controller node to rosrun.
normally i can tab complete the node executable (e.g rosrun joy joy_node). however, diff drive does not allow autocomplete, and doesn't seem to have an executable. perhaps I have missed something that needs to be set up, but i've read the wiki page a few times and haven't found anything outstanding that would seem to break the install.

A:

diff_drive_controller is not a node, it is a controller_manager plugin. In order to use it, there should be a ros node with a controller_manager managing your robot's resources. There are out-of-the-box plugins for doing this in Gazebo (see the gazebo_ros_control package), while if you want to have this running on real hardware you'll need to expose your robot to ros_control first.
You can find a high-level overview of ros_control in the ROSCON 2014 program. It's the second talk here.

hi Adolfo,
how is the diff_drive_controller interface with the ros_control? is there some place more clarity can be gained regarding this?
