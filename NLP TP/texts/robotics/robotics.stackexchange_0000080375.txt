Q:

how to use spawn_urdf_model service

Hi everyone
Currently I am trying to spawn a robot by calling spawn_urdf_model service. But, now matter what I did with it, it always failed to call the service. I think the problem is that I do not know how to assign value to model_xml field of gazebo_msgs::spawnmodel srv.
Does anyone know how to use this service? Especially, could anyone offer me some examples about how to use this service.
Thank you very much

A:

The model_xml field should contain the contents of a URDF file. It's a string, so read the contents of a URDF file into a string and assign it to the model_xml field.
