Q:

Simulating projectiles in gazebo

I would like to simulate a projectile that shoots out from the ends of my pr2's arm in gazebo.
Is this possible? Are there existing code that does this or are similar I can take a look at?

@mugetsu Nice idea, I have simulated a pendulum in gazebo and played around with the 'g' !! which gave various trajectories :-) . A projectile should be very much possible !

This should probably be asked at http://answers.gazebosim.org/questions/
