Q:

The order of collision1~2 objects from contact sensor

From contact sensor, we can get contact objects (gazebo::physics::Contact).
The contact object includes followings.
std::string     collision1
    Name of the first collision object.
 
std::string     collision2
    Name of the second collision object.

How does Gazebo decide the order ?
And, how about following?
Assumption:
(1) There is a contact between link_1 and link_2, 
(2) link_1 has contact sensor.

Among the resulted contact objects from sensor, if the objects' elements are like following,
 (1) collision1 specifies link_1
 (2) collision2 specifies link_2

wrench(i).body_1_force in those objects are forces from link_2 to link_1.
Am I right?
The '1,2' things make me really confused. I really need help.
Thanks.

A:

The order of reported collisions is non-deterministic.
The wrenches reported by a contact sensor are the forces between the two links in contact.
