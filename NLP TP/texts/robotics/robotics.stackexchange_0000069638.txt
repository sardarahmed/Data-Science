Q:

No transform from baselink to world

I am trying to use tum_simulator to map an environment following the example of hector_slam. I added the sensors which are included in hector_slam. And I added the mapping and visualization nodes from hector_slam to tum_simulator launch files. But in rviz, I get the following errors,
Global Status: Fixed Frame [world] does not exist
Robot Model: No transform from [ardrone_base_bottomcam], [ardrone_base_frontcam], [base_link],  [bottom_link], [front_link], [sonar_link] to [world]
Map: No transform from [map] to [world]
Camera: No Image received
tf: No transform from [ardrone_base_bottomcam], [ardrone_base_frontcam], [base_footprint], [base_stabilized], [base_link],  [bottom_link], [front_link],  [nav], [sonar_link] to [world]
How do I solve this problem?
How do I add the missing transform?

A:

hector_slam should broadcast the world -> odom transform, and the robot's driver (or gazebo in this case) should broadcast odom -> base_link, thus providing a chain from world to base_link. The world frame may not show up immediately before hector_slam has received any data. To see what's going on in rviz, change the global frame to something that exists like odom or base_link.
