Q:

Robot doesn't fall straight

Hello.
I'm trying to simulate the behavior of my humanoid robot.
However, though all inertia are set correctly, my robot doesn't fall down straight and it can't stand still.

I have no idea what is going on.
How to fix this strange behavior and to make my robot fallen down straight?
I'm using gazebo 7.9.0 and ROS lunar.
my urdf is: https://github.com/Y-modify/yamax/blob/develop/src/yamax_description/robots/yamax.urdf
.launch file: https://github.com/Y-modify/yamax/blob/develop/src/yamax_gazebo/launch/world.launch

A:

It looks like there might be some parameters not well set. I recommend you visually introspect your model to detect what's wrong:

Right-click it and choose View -> Center of Mass - the way it wobbles in the end suggests the center of mass may be hanging under the ground
View -> Inertia - the pink inertia boxes should be close to the size of each link
View -> Collisions - the orange collisions should also be close to the link sizes
On the top menu, choose View -> Contacts - the blue dots will show you when things are in contact

Hope that helps spot the errors!
