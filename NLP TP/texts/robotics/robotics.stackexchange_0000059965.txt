Q:

Install ros-hydro-rqt failed

system: ubuntu 12.04 LTS
ROS version 1.9.54
I try to install ros-hydro-rqt, but failed.
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-rqt
Failed to fetch http:packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu/pool/main/r/ros-hydro-rqt/ros-hydro-rqt_0.2.13-0precise-20140130-2154-+0000_amd64.deb  Something wicked happened resolving 'packages.ros.org:http' (-5 - No address associated with hostname)
E: Unable to fetch some archives, maybe run apt-get update or try with --fix-missing?

A:

Failed to fetch http:packages.ros.org

If this is really a copy/paste, then it would seem the two forward slashes (ie: "//") are missing from the URL. The correct URL is:
http://packages.ros.org

Perhaps check and make sure that your sources.list or ros-latest.list contains the correct URL?

Edit: apparently the URL was missing the forward slashes due to not being able to post URLs.
Either this is then a transient network error, or something is wrong with the cached APT data. Try doing:
sudo apt-get clean
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-rqt

This might clear things up.

Ok, well, are you able to do a 'ping packages.ros.org' on the machine where you are getting the error?

Internate is in good condition, ping time is within 30 ms.

I checked this directory: the coorsponding file has update to
http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu/pool/main/r/ros-hydro-rqt/ros-hydro-rqt_0.2.14-0precise-20140311-2004-+0000_amd64.deb
So the system cannnot find it.
But how can I fix this problem?

I'm not sure what could be happening here, but you might want to do a 'sudo apt-get clean', followed by a 'sudo apt-get update'. Then see if you can install your package using 'sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-rqt'.
