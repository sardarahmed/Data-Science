Q:

How to build only a few packages from a repository, instead of all?

In my case I am trying to use the Universal Robots package and the robotiq grippers package. These two packages I am installing them from source into my catkin workspace. But, these packages are very wide in the sense that I only need the description from one of the arms and a specific gripper. I want to avoid excessive computing when I run catkin build command tool. I am pretty new to ROS, so is this recommendable or should I install the full package?
Thank you!

A:

You'll need to make sure to not remove any part of the repository you cloned which is used by the package(s) you are interested in, but other than that you should be able to either:

remove the directories containing the packages you're not interested in, or
place a CATKIN_IGNORE file in those directories

Both will cause the packages to no longer be built, nor found by any ROS tool. Not even in the src space of your workspace.
And a quick comment:

where you write "package", you most of the time seem to actually be referring to the repository. Repositories contain packages. A collection of packages is not also called "a package".

only build things from source if you really have to.
The "issue" you are running into is one of the reasons why from-source builds should be avoided.
