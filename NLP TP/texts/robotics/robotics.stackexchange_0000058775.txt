Q:

Can't Install ros-hydro-desktop-full from USB stick

Trying to setup a USB stick with ROS for a student.  Get to the following command and I get this error:
ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-desktop-full
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
ros-hydro-desktop-full : Depends: ros-hydro-desktop but it is not going to be installed
Depends: ros-hydro-mobile but it is not going to be installed
Depends: ros-hydro-perception but it is not going to be installed
Depends: ros-hydro-simulators but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
ubuntu@ubuntu:~$
Am using UBUNTU 12.04 Live and UNETBOOTIN loader.
Was wondering how to proceed to fix it?
Thanks
