Q:

JSON format for geometry_msgs/PoseStamped

Hi,
I want to publish a JSON message type using PoseStamped through rosbridge, I tried searching online but there wasn't any information about it. So, how do I go about doing it?

A:

The structure of geometry_msgs/PoseStamped is documented here: http://ros.org/doc/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/PoseStamped.html
A PoseStamped message in JSON would therefore look as follows:
{ 
    header: { 
        seq: <int>, 
        stamp:  {
            secs: <int>,
            nsecs: <int>
        },
        frame_id: <string>
    },
    pose: {
        position: {
            x: <float>,
            y: <float>,
            z: <float>
        },
        orientation: {
            x: <float>,
            y: <float>,
            z: <float>,
            w: <float>
        }
    }
}

The entire JSON message that you would send to rosbridge to publish the message would be:
{
    receiver: "/topic",
    type: "geometry_msgs/PoseStamped",
    msg: { ...as above... }
}

Cheers,
Jon
