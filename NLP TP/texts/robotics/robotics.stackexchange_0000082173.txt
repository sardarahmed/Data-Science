Hello.
I gonna to use RQT main window with plugins written by myself. I wonder if it is possible to remove menu bar from RQT main window without recompiling or not?

A:

Try these options out:
 -f, --freeze-layout   freeze the layout of the GUI (prevent 
                       rearranging
                        widgets, disable undock/redock)

-l, --lock-perspective
                        lock the GUI to the used perspective
                        (hide menu bar
                        and close buttons of plugins)

(Though when I try rqt -l now with the latest kinetic, lunar, and kinetic-devel qt_gui_core I still see File and Help. That must be a regression, I took a screenshot a few months ago where File and Help are gone)
This is in the kinetic-devel branch of qt_gui_core:
-ht, --hide-title     hide the title label, the icon, 
                        and the help button
                        (combine with -l and -f to 
                        eliminate the entire title
                        bar and reclaim the space)

It hides the title bars of individual plugins.
If you clone https://github.com/ros-visualization/qt_gui_core.git into your catkin_ws it will overlay the system installed qt_gui_core.
