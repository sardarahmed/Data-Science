Q:

Keyboard shortcuts for setting view angle

Are there any keyboard shortcuts for quickly switching the camera view to +/- X/Y/Z. There are times when I want to view a model orthogonally from the top down along the Z-axis, and it can literally take minutes of scrolling, and even then it doesn't seem completely possible with the mouse.
Also, is there any way to make a glyph show up indicating the origination of the axis?

A:

Both these features are currently being implemented and should be available from Gazebo 6.
Orthogonal views
World origin indicator
If you have more feature requests, feel free to create issues for them on Gazebo's Bitbucket repository ;)
