Q:

Installing ROS on Mavericks - "rviz: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [urdfdom]"

Good day,
I was installing ros based on the following steps:
https://gist.github.com/mikepurvis/9837958
The very last step, I seemed to get this error
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro indigo -y
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
rviz: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [urdfdom]

Can I know how I might be able to resolve this?

A:

There's no rosdep rule for urdfdom on Mac OS. This shouldn't be a problem, you can ignore this error and go on with the installation.
To ignore the error use:
rosdep install -r --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro indigo -y

(if you're using indigo). Note the -r option that tells rosdep to ignore errors.
