Q:

Melodic - HardwareInterface - Freezes when commanding non Zero cmd

Hi,
the Problem I encounter is that my HardwareInterface Node/Program freezes when I order commands trough Teleop_Twist_Keyboard or else.  The Process jumps above 100% (of single core, enough resources left) and just freezes. If I dont order any command, the base controller outputs Zero, it works fine. Data from the encoders comes in, no problem. But when I command something (value doesnt matter) it just freezes. Is there some known behaviour in the ros_control controllers that might cause this or any other idea whats going wrong here?
HW Interface is based on link text cyborg-x1
Any help would be appreciated thanks.

A:

Solved the Problem by brute force logging, it was my "ParityBit" generating loop. "^=" works well with zero, but not with Double into Int.
