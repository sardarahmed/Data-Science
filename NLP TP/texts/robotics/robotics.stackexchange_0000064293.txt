Q:

Jenkins Build Errors

Hello,
I recently released a new version of a meta-package using the updated bloom 0.5.13 version. Since the update the souredeb Jenkins job has been repeatedly failing.
Here are the errors being displayed in the Jenkins console output:
ï»¿
dpkg-source: error: syntax error in ros-indigo-multisense-3.3.7/debian/control at line 10: block lacks the 'Package' field
dpkg-buildpackage: error: dpkg-source -i -I --before-build ros-indigo-multisense-3.3.7 gave error exit status 25
debuild: fatal error at line 1350:
dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -d -us -uc -i -I -S failed
gbp:error: debuild -i -I returned 29
gbp:error: Couldn't run 'debuild -i -I -S -uc -us --lintian-opts --suppress-tags newer-standards-version'
Usage: include_folder.py [options]

The full console output can be found here:
http://jenkins.ros.org/job/ros-indigo-multisense_sourcedeb/93/console
Here is the relese repository:
https://github.com/carnegieroboticsllc/multisense_ros-release
Can anyone confirm these error are not caused by a incorrect package configuration? Also is there any documentation on the build process Jenkins is using to create the package debians?
Thanks,
Matt Alvarado

A:

That sounds like the bloom bug https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/bloom/pull/329
You need to update to the latest release of bloom 0.5.14 and rerelease your package.
(If it is not yet available in the public repos give it some hours.)
