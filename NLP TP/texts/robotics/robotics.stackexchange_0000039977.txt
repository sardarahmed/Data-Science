Q:

gazebo urdf tutorial robots not visible

Hello, I am virtualizing in virtual box a copy of ubuntu 11.10 for a robotics class. I have ros electric installed. I have 3d acceleration enabled.
My problem is whenever I load a model from the urdf tutorials into gazebo, such as the visual robot, it is not rendered. Either nothing is rendered or only the root link is rendered. 
Simple objects such as the tables or primitives are rendered.

Please be more specific when asking a question, i.e. reference models you are having trouble with.  In general, if you would like to dynamically simulate things in gazebo, you need to add physical properties (e.g. inertial elements), see http://ros.org/wiki/urdf/Tutorials/Adding%20Physical%20and%

One of the models was called visual, which was my reference. its the end result of the building a visual robot model in urdf from scratch. its in the urdf_tutorial package with the model name 05-visual.urdf.  Do all links need physical properties to be visible or only the main link?

all links.

A:

The models in the URDF tutorials are not meant for Gazebo, only RViz.
