A:

Go to the end of the file and you'll see the answer to all your questions (question 1 is a generalization of question 2, not sure what you're looking for ... the robot also has force torque sensors in the ankles and wrists but those aren't available in the release version  yet. The iRobot and Sandia hands have tactile and other sensors as well but those aren't implemented yet).
