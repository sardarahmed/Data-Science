Q:

RVIZ not showing PointCloud2

Hi,
I have an issue using RVIZ when I try to visualize my data coming from Kinect using the following:
$ roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch
$ rosrun rviz rviz
C:\fakepath\Screenshot-13.png
nothing shows up, the only thing that is shown is the sensor_msgs/Image topics (little image frame in the right), why is that happening? I get no errors, but I can't see anything.
Thanks

Which version of rviz are you running, Electric, Fuerte, Diamondback? Are you sure the point cloud is within the viewing area of the display?

Isn't there some nodelet you need to convert opennI data to PointCloud2?

A:

It looks like the 3D viewing window in rviz isn't working properly, or the pointcloud isn't within your field of view.
I would try rotating the view to see if your pointcloud is somewhere else, and I would check that your graphics drivers are installed properly. See: http://ros.org/wiki/rviz/Troubleshooting
Note that rviz has fairly high graphics requirements, and doesn't usually work when run on an integrated chipset or within a virtual machine.
