Q:

Is it okay to have different version of ROS in the remote pc and the turtleblot pc?

For example I have ros-melodic on remote pc and
ros-kinetic on turtlebot pc.

We're all here to help, but this specific question has come up at least 10 times in the past 2 years. A quick Google (different ROS versions site:answers.ros.org) returns at least 1700 results for me.
Please try to use the search, ROS Answers is not a slow chat forum.

A:

There may be some issues between versions but I've had success using three different versions of ROS at once (Hydro, Indigo, and Kinetic) and I had to do some work arounds (mainly for Hydro, which is pretty old) but everything worked pretty well. Other, than a "you should be ok, but there may be issues" I don't think there's too much that can be said except for try it out and see what happens.
