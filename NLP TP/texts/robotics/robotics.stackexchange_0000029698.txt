Q:

image_view cannot be run in diamondback

Hi,
I was trying to run the image_view node, but it was not successful..it is the package and its binary but cannot be run. I was actually following "http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_camera" to invoke "rosrun image_view image_view image_view image:=/camera/rgb/image_color". Unfortunately, the output I obtained is "[rospack] couldn't find package [image_view]
" . The node is already there in fact as I navigate, I could find in "/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/image_pipeline/image_view/bin$"
Any ideas??

Please see: http://www.ros.org/wiki/Support#Guidelines_for_mailing_list_messages. In particular be sure to copy and paste your commandline and the output you get (how do you know it was "not successful"?)

A:

I've just successfully found the solution. I've run this command: "source /opt/ros/diamondback/setup.bash" :-). To be precise run as recommended in the ROS wiki:
echo "source /opt/ros/cturtle/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
. ~/.bashrc

Yes joq, it's true.

That will work until the next time you login or create a new terminal window. For a permanent fix, add it to the end of your ~/.bashrc, as recommended in the install instructions.
