Q:

Insert model in world file

Hey,
I have a .world file in which I have added the models.
<include>
      <uri>model://simple_mobile_manipulator</uri>
      <pose>0 0 0 0 0 0</pose>
    </include>

This model is present in the models folder in .gazebo folder in home.
How to insert a model which is present in some other folder?

A:

You can set your GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH environment variable to include another directory containing models.
