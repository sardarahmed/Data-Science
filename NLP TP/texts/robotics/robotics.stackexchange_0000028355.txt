Q:

How does gazebo load a urdf file WITHOUT Ros?

I want to use gazebo load my robot model (a urdf file),but do not want to install ros.
Is there any kind of tool to make my urdf file be load by gazebo?
Is there any way to do this ? Is there any document example or tutorials about this?
Please help. Thanks.

A:

You can use the command line. Here a MWE:
# Download the URDF and convert it to SDF
$ wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/fsuarez6/f8503449ce747668e30a742289c26e58/raw/132506b4fa03879d4309ff9014c16d9df6e5f740/rrbot.xacro.urdf
$ gz sdf --print rrbot.xacro.urdf > rrbot.sdf
# Start gazebo
$ gazebo
# Open another terminal, and spawn the model
$ gz model --spawn-file=rrbot.sdf --model-name=rrbot

Tested on Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial):
$ gazebo --version

Update
Thanks to @nkoenig comment, you can spawn directly URDF models. Here a MWE:
# Download the URDF
$ wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/fsuarez6/f8503449ce747668e30a742289c26e58/raw/132506b4fa03879d4309ff9014c16d9df6e5f740/rrbot.xacro.urdf
# Start gazebo
$ gazebo
# Open another terminal, and spawn the model
$ gz model --spawn-file=rrbot.xacro.urdf --model-name=rrbot

Gazebo uses libsdformat, which can read both SDF and URDF files.
