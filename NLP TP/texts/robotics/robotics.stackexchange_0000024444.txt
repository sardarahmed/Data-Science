ROS buildfarm - Debian Buster Binary Job Failure (noetic)

I recently made a release of image_transport_plugins in ROS noetic, but the noetic debian binary builds have started failing afterwards.
Looking at the logs, the issue seems to be apt coming from an invocation of apt-get install ... catkin on the BuildFarm, but I can't quite figure out why catkin is getting installed rather than ros-noetic-catkin.
All logs have the following problem:
01:20:43 Invoking 'apt-get install -q -y -o Debug::pkgProblemResolver=yes apt-src catkin debhelper image-transport-tools libcv-bridge-dev libdynamic-reconfigure-config-init-mutex-dev libgmock-dev libgtest-dev libimage-transport-dev libogg-dev librosbag-dev libstd-msgs-dev libtheora-dev pluginlib-dev python3-cv-bridge python3-dynamic-reconfigure python3-rosbag python3-std-msgs ros-message-generation ros-std-msgs'

Does anyone know, or have come across similar issues?

A:

Looking at the ros/rosdistro PR which included this release, the bloom version used was 0.10.7 which is quite old compared to the current 0.11.2 version from the time of the release PR.
I have not been able to determine what is causing this with older bloom versions on current distributions but using the current version of bloom to re-run bloom-release ...  resolves it.
