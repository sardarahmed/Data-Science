Q:

3d vision sensor

hi
I have question about ZED and ZR300:
1- can we use these sensor as Kinect like using depthimage-to-laserscan pkg  and provide 2d data for mapping.
2- If we cant use it like Kinect, I can get 2d Lidar to work with but for avoiding obstacle I think its a must 3d vision sensor please correct me if I am wrong.
3- now if we can use it like Kinect, I have a question now can we build the map autonomously and at the same time avoid obstacle.
I only used Kinect and autonomous navigation on premade map. that's why I am asking these question.
thanks for your time.

Hey,
I can only answer question 1 and only about the ZED Cam: The ZED Cam gives you as output principally:

two stereo images
a depth image
the camera pose

(according to the ZED ROS wrapper doc)
So I see no reason why it should not be possible to use the mentioned depthimage-to-laserscan pkg.
