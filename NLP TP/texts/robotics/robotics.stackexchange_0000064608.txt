Q:

Multiple CameraInfoManagers in same node?

It seems like this ought to be possible (https://github.com/ros-industrial/human_tracker/blob/master/packages/aravis_camera_driver/src/nodes/basler_multi_node.cpp shows an example though there is a lot going on)- but when I try to do it the set_camera_info topics are colliding:
 Tried to advertise a service that is already advertised in this node [/set_camera_info]

Should the name parameter passed into CameraInfoManager(nh, "foo") be putting the /set_camera_info into /foo/set_camera_info ?
This is Indigo with Ubuntu 14.04.

A:

If you have two cameras in your driver both cameras should publish to separate topics, e. g.
/stereo_camera/left/image_raw
/stereo_camera/left/camera_info
/stereo_camera/right/image_raw
/stereo_camera/right/camera_info

Now you can have 2 camera info managers in the same driver node for both cameras; but the 2 camera info managers should be remapped to separate topic, identical with the camera namepaces
E. g.
first camera info manager for left camera
/stereo_camera/left/set_camera_info

second camera info manager for right camera
/stereo_camera/right/set_camera_info
