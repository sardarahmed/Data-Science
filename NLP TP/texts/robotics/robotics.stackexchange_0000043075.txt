Q:

Building Android App Chooser with ROSJava

Is it currently possible to build android_app_chooser from source on fuerte?
Does it use the current build of ROSJava or does it need the JNI-based Java client library?
Should we just wait until the new version of ROSJava is a bit more stable?

A:

Build from source on Fuerte is to my knowledge untested, however the electric built apps are known to work with Fuerte systems. android_app_chooser uses the ROSJava implementation and uses a ROS script to set itself up automatically. If you want to build it or create your own android app, you should follow the tutorials at: http://www.ros.org/wiki/ApplicationsPlatform/Clients/Android. However, you should not need to do this if you want to use the applications without modification as you can simply download them from the android market.
