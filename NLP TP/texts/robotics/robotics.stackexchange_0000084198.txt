Q:

How can I use Qt5 with ROS kinetic?

Hi guys, I am a beginner with ROS and I want to do GUI for control my robotic arm. I think that I can use Qt5 in ROS without any plugins or changing some settings in QtCreator. I want to test a simple GUI with "Hello world" button but I have no idea how to do CMakeLists.txt and package.xml for my package. Can you show me how should I do CMakeLists.txt and package.xml? Thank you
Here is my package's path:
catkin_ws/src/gui

gui.cpp
CMakeLists.txt
package.xml

I have no idea if it works but here is my idea of simple "Hello world button" program
gui.cpp:
#include <QApplication>
#include <QPushButton>
#include <ros/ros.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv){
   ros::init(argc, argv, "gui");
   ros::NodeHandle nh;
   QApplication app (argc, argv);

   QPushButton button ("Hello world !");
   button.show();

  return app.exec();
}

You can use roscreate-qt-pkg, it is very easy.
