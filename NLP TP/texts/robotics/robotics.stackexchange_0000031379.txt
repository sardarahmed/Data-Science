Q:

Stage: Orientation of the robot

Hi,
I am working on a simple program using stage simulation where I want to find the present position of the robot in the format of (x , y , theta ).
I am not able to understand how to convert the orientation into a understandable format of theta.
How do I go about from this data
x: -10.6492617064
y: 7.43208867907
z: 0.0
orientation:
x: 0.0
y: 0.0
z: 0.210458934126
w: 0.977602698977
Is there a function or formula that I can convert orientation data into theta.

A:

If you're working in python, it's as simple as using this method found in transformations.py:
import tf 
from tf.transformations import euler_from_quaternion
...
(roll,pitch,yaw) = euler_from_quaternion(quaternion)

In C++ it's just tf::getYaw(quaternion). See here
