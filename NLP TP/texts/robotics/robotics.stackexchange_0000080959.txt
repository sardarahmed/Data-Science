A:

Yes: create a small wrapper bash script that does roscd <package> first, then runs python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000.
Easiest is to add this to a package, then use regular node type=".." pkg=".." name=".." syntax to start it.
Personally I try to keep any ROS-isms out of such files, by passing the output of $(find package) (an absolute path) as the first argument to the script (and then do a cd $x (where x is the correct argument nr) in the script, but make sure to take ROS args into account).
