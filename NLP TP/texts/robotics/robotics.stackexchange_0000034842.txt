Q:

roboearth, can't do rosmake. Other image recognition options?

Hi to everyone!
I follow the steps to install roboearth: http://www.ros.org/wiki/roboearth
I'm working with diamondback, not with electric, so I change some things and I install changing the 1rst sentence to:
rosinstall ~/ros /opt/ros/diamondback 'http://www.ros.org/wiki/roboearth?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=roboearth.rosinstall'
At the end of the installation it says this:
Now, type 'source /home/albert/ros/setup.bash' to set up your environment.
Add that to the bottom of your ~/.bashrc to set it up every time.
If you are not using bash please see http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosinstall/NonBashShells
I do what it's said, actually I added this setup.bash to my .bashrc. The question is: is it possible to have two diferent sources in your basharc? One would be source /home/albert/ros/setup.bashsource /home/albert/ros/setup.bash and the otherone would be source /opt/ros/diamondback/setup.bash.
After that I install the knowrob and ias_common as said in the tutorial but changing electric to diamondback. No problem.
When I try to do the rosmake roboearth it happends an error:
[rosbuild] Building package re_ontology
Failed to invoke /opt/ros/diamondback/ros/bin/rospack deps-manifests re_ontology
[rospack] couldn't find dependency [gazebo] of [re_ontology]
[rospack] missing dependency
CMake Error at /opt/ros/diamondback/ros/core/rosbuild/public.cmake:113 (message):
Failed to invoke rospack to get compile flags for package 're_ontology'.
Look above for errors from rospack itself.  Aborting.  Please fix the
broken dependency!

Call Stack (most recent call first):
/opt/ros/diamondback/ros/core/rosbuild/public.cmake:183 (rosbuild_invoke_rospack)
CMakeLists.txt:4 (rosbuild_init)
I try to install gazebo from http://www.ros.org/wiki/gazebo doing:
svn co http://www.ros.org/wiki/gazebo
rosmake --rosdep-install
but it happends an other error:
[rosbuild] Building package gazebo
Failed to invoke /opt/ros/diamondback/ros/bin/rospack deps-manifests gazebo
[rospack] couldn't find dependency [gazebo_msgs] of [gazebo]
[rospack] missing dependency

Call Stack (most recent call first):
/opt/ros/diamondback/ros/core/rosbuild/public.cmake:183 (rosbuild_invoke_rospack)
CMakeLists.txt:5 (rosbuild_init)
After that I think i need gazebo_msgs, I do it from here: http://www.ros.org/wiki/gazebo_msgs and I get this error:
[rosbuild] Building package gazebo
Failed to invoke /opt/ros/diamondback/ros/bin/rospack deps-manifests gazebo
[rospack] couldn't find dependency [common_rosdeps] of [gazebo]
[rospack] missing dependency

Call Stack (most recent call first):
/opt/ros/diamondback/ros/core/rosbuild/public.cmake:183 (rosbuild_invoke_rospack)
CMakeLists.txt:5 (rosbuild_init)
At this point I've tried to install this common_rosdeps from: http://www.ros.org/wiki/common_rosdeps but I can not do it. I run this comand:
hg co http://www.ros.org/wiki/common_rosdeps and get this answer:
abort: There is no Mercurial repository here (.hg not found)!
What do I need to do to get roboearth installed? I really want to do image recognision with this software.
Thanks!
