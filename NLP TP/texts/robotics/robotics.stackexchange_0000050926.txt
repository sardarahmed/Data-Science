Q:

integrating qt interface and ros code

Hi all, I am very new in ROS ans qt.I have an ros code that move the robot with a fixed velocity. Now I want to move it with a parametric velocity and assign the velocity input via an interface developed by qt. I have written the code(c++)and developped the interface but I do not know how to integrate them. Thanks for your replies

A:

One way to integrate your Qt-based GUI and ROS is to use qt_ros package. Work on its tutorial to get an idea how it works. In a nutshell, that pkg provides an interface component qnode where you can pass ROS values to Qt and vice versa.
