Q:

[turtle_pointer-6] process has died when running tf tutorial

I tried to follow the tutorial from here :
http://www.ros.org/wiki/tf/Tutorials/Introduction%20to%20tf

But there's some error and a process died. This is the full message :

How to solve this problem? Thanks~

A:

There's probably a configuration problem. In any case, in order to follow with the tutorial, you can spawn the process that dies by hand:
rosrun turtle_tf turtle_tf_listener
Despite the aparition of the bizzarre 3rd turtle in the corner, the working nodes still being 3 :).

Interestingly, I just got the bizzare corner turtle, this didn't spawn the 2nd needed follower turtle.
ERROR] [1620796305.295081927]: "turtle2" passed to lookupTransform argument target_frame does not exist.
This is the error that I seem to get.
Comment by Fanon on 2023-03-18:
yep, that is what I am getting to this day-stationary corner turtle, but not the needed follower turtle
