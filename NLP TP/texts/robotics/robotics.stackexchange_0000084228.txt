Q:

ROS industrial for IRB-360

Hi there,
newbie here, scoping a project where I am hoping to control a IRB-360 with a control and vision system on ROS. I am also working with an IRC5 controller.
I am just wondering if the current ABB ROS package supports the control of the IRB-360 or robots where a specific moveit package?
Thanks,
Brian.

A:

I'm pretty certain the driver (abb_driver) will not have any difficulty with the IRB 360 (everything is done in joint space), but there is currently no (built-in) support for parallel kinematics in ROS (at least not in the default KDL interfaces, custom IK solvers can do anything). This means no support in urdf/xacro, nor in MoveIt.
The current accepted work-around is to model the kinematics as a "stick on a ball joint" and have a specialised node do the IK/FK for you. This was done for the Blue WorkForce Ragnar Robot (code: blueworkforce/ROSRagnarEDU) and the Yaskawa Motoman MPP3H.
This setup could work for the IRB 360, but I haven't seen it done yet, so I can't be certain.

Note: when I write: no support for parallel kinematics, I mean that it's impossible to have a joint with > 1 parent. So initialisation of FK/IK components from the urdf is difficult. There are some tricks that can be used to at least get visualisation going though.

Sir, could I command joint velocity with ABB robot in ROS? For example, we can use URScript to control the joint velocity of Universal Robot for real-time control. However, I can barely find info on the real-time joint velocity tracking performance on the other robot.

Please ask this as a separate question. Apart from the fact that you want to use an ABB, I don't see any connecting to the Q&A that you posted your comment on.

Thank you for your quick response as always. I have posted my question in the following link and I wonder if you may give me some suggestions? Thank you.
