Q:

JointEffortController only show command topic

Hi all,
I am using gazebo RRBot Example with ros_control, as the follow tutorial:
[http://gazebosim.org/tutorials/?tut=ros_control]
the rrbot has two joints, joint1 and joint2.
I changed joint2 controller from effort_controllers/JointPositionController to effort_controllers/JointEffortController
when I run it, I found the joint2 only have one /rrbot/joint2_effort_controller/command topic, that was different from joint1.
I want to know is it was ok?
