Q:

Missing inertia for hokuyo model

Hi,
I just modeled our heterogeneous multi-robot swarm in gazebo.
Some of them are equipped with the hokuyo sensor form your supported models folder.
I mentioned, that the  section is missing, which is awe full if you have robots in the size of such a sensor.
In the WWW I just found rough guesses for the URG04-LX sensor, but it would be nice to have a model which has the exact inertia, so that we can model our upcoming multi-robot experiments.
Additional, I think it is very sloppy in gazebo to set the initial values of inertia to <1 1 1>, <0 0 0> would be better from my point of view.
Can someone support such a inertia model?
Kind regards

A:

You can submit a pull request change a model via the gazebo_model repository. Contributions are always welcome.
There is also a tutorial.
If you want to suggest a change to the default inertia value, please make a pull request to sdformat.
