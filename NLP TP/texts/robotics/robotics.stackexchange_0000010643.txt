Q:

Qi Battery Pack

I am trying to build a bot that is "always on". I will be using a qi platform and am looking for a battery that charges through Qi. I've found several batteries that can charge your phone through Qi, but I am looking for one that charges itself through Qi. Any clue where I can find one like that? As a second question, do you think such an idea would work? Any foreseeable problems?

A:

What you are looking for is a Qi receiver, that will allow you to transfer energy from a charging station to your robot. Charging a battery will be a separate task. Adafruit has a module capable of providing 5V and 500mA. Or you can go for a complete wireless power bank with USB output. This will also give you 5V that you can use to power up your robot.
