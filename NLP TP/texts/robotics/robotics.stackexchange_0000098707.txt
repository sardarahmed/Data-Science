Q:

Inconsistent time discrepancy synchronize

I'm trying to make a node which subscribes both rgb image and point cloud from asus xtion pro live. It seems like there is inconsistent time discrepancy between these two and synchronizing does not work well in this situation. Does anybody know how to deal with this kind of issue?

A:

Hello, you need to use buffers in order to synchronize asynchronous nodes, this is provided by ros (python, C++) so you do not need to code it, have a look at message_filters.
