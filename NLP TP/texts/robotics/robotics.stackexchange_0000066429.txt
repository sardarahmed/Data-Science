Q:

How to Monitor the data transfer

Hi everyone,
I would like to know how to monitor all the data transfer between ros.
There are two computers connected by using same roscore master. I want to measure the amount of data transfering every second or in a period.
Thanks

A:

If you are interested in a special topic you can use rostopic bw
rostopic bw --help
Usage: rostopic bw /topic

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -w WINDOW, --window=WINDOW
                        window size, in # of messages, for calculating rate

Unfortunately it does only support a single topic, so you may need multiple calls into it for monitoring more than one topic.
Also a nice tool for monitoring your network interfaces useage and additional  information is bmon. However, this will not explizitly so you the ROS-part of your network load:
sudo apt-get install bmon
bmon
