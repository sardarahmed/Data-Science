Q:

robot_upstart with root permission

Hi,
My question is: when the .launch file is launched by using robot_upstart set up, does it have root access? I have not tested yet because my package it not ready. Our project uses a headless robot, and there is a package that would use the PRU of the Beaglebone. At the moment, we need to do rosrun from root, in order for this package to work. If the answer is no, could you please suggest some solution to us?
Best regards,
Nhan Nguyen
