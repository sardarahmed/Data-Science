Q:

what to include?

Hi all,i'm very new in ROS so sorry if my question is silly..
i've read the tutorials on ros,now i'm triyng to control the turtlesim to make a square (an exercise) so i'm doing:
#include <turtlesim/Pose.h>
#include <turtlesim/Velocity.h>

to use their topic,but when i make it it says that pose.h does not exist:what's the problem?
i'm in the beginner_tutorials package,maybe is that it doesn't find pose.h in this package?if so, how can i include pose.h from its package?
thanks all

Thanks the both of you

A:

You also have to make sure that you add:
<depend package="turtlesim" />

to your package's manifest.xml.

@DimitriProsser I removed the reference to geometry_msgs from this answer, there's a separate simpler Pose and Velocity for turtlesim

Ah, my mistake. Thanks for the correction.
