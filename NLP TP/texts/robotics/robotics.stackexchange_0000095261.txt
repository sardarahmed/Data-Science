This is very limited information.
How is composed your package? Is it a python or cmake package? Does it install an executable named talker ? if yes to what location ?
Please consider profiding more information and relevant bits of code like your CMakeLists or setup.py/cfg

Did you source the setup file generated by the colcon build command? e.g. install/setup.bash

Getting the same error, followed the tutorial step by step, using Python package on Windows. When I run ros2 run my_package my_node I get Package 'my_package' not found
Comment by sabin on 2021-02-02:
The issue was that I called install/local_setup.bat (as indicated in the tutorial). Calling '.\install\setup.ps1' fixies the issue.

Everytime you build a package, always remember to do (from your ROS2 workspace): source install/setup.bash and source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash

@fabbro, why do I need to source two setup.bash files? i.e.,
source install/setup.bash and source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash

A:

In my case I was running colcon build form inside the src directory in my workspace.
Like this:
~/ros2_ws/src$ colcon build 

Running colcon build in the workspace root solved the issue:
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build
source install/setup.bash

and finally
ros2 run [package_name] [executable_name]
