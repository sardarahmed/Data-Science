Q:

ROSJava .launch files and parameters

I am wondering how to put a ROSJava node within a launch file.  I also want to pass parameters to the ROSJava program, just like in C++ and Python nodes.  I cannot find documentation on this problem (at least not a simple copy/paste solution).  There is some code in this question
<node pkg="rosjava_bootstrap" type="run.py" args="bumperCar org.lejos.ros.nodes.bumpercar.BumperCarControl" name="BumperCarControl" />

but this does not work for me, as I have no file named run.py within the rosjava_bootstrap package.  I installed ROSJava within the past two months, so my ROSJava version should be up-to-date.

A:

The run.py script hasn't been used in a long time. You'll need to use the Gradle installApp task (see documentation) and then configure your launch file to execute the generated binary/script. This will hopefully become easier in the future.
