Q:

ROS and gazebo for tum_simulator

Hi,
I wanted to know what is the minimum version of ROS with which tum_simulator ( for A.R. drone ) can work with ?
The website mentions ROS fuerte but there are videos on youtube that claim to use ROS-indigo with tum_simulator.
I have seen this question and it suggests to use  this github package  for ROS-kinetic.
However, it is unclear whether this github source has all functionalities as tum_simulator has.
I am currently using Ubuntu 16.04 and ROS-kinetic.
Could someone kindly help ?
Thanks!

A:

At the top of the package's README, it says

tum_simulator ported to Kinetic.
Tested on Ubuntu 16.04.1, ROS Kinetic and using Gazebo 7.

so presumably it will work on Ubuntu 16.04.1 with ROS Kinetic and Gazebo 7. I know that people are using it as a replacement (update) for the tum_simulator package.

Does it contain all the functionalities then ? ( Since it is not on the official ROS wiki page for tum_simulator )

I can only go off of what the README says. You can ask the maintainer.
