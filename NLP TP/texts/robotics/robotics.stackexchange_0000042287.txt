Q:

simulate marker on stage

I am trying to simulate multi-robot behavior os stageros. I want my robots to be conveyed a message when they reach a marker(anytype fiducial or bar code). player-stage which has support both for markers and fiducials( http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/doc/Stage-3.2.1/group__model__camera.html , http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/doc/Stage-3.2.1/group__model__fiducial.html).  I guess camera is absent in stageros.
So ar_pose marker won't work(http://www.ros.org/wiki/ar_pose) on stageros. So can i get any other marker to be simulated in stage to achieve the desired task or alternatively can Gazebo simulate multi-robots with camera and markers?

@iceman Do you plan to use blobfinder proxy ?

I've used it with player/stage before:http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/doc/Player-cvs/player/group__playerc__proxy__blobfinder.html ..but, I can't find any support for camera or makers in stageros..i can't find any gazebo code either. have you used multiple robots with cameras in simulation?

@iceman stageros doesn't support camera, markers or multiple robots - if you plan to work with such, I would suggest that you better stick to Player/Stage or alternatively use the stage executables in ROS (obviously without the ROS nodes - stage is the executable, stageros is the wrapper to ROS).

A:

In case it is still truly an open question, I have used multiple robots (each with a camera) in stage.
The patch is currently still posted on code.ros.org, but the true home for the issue is over on github.
I cannot yet speak to use of the blobfinder in ros, but the cmvision package seems to provide the same functionality that was present in player/stage. Sadly the package maybe orphaned (based on these instructions).
Looks like opencv may be the path forward tutorial-on-opencv-simpleblobdetector.. also check out the question on answers.ros
