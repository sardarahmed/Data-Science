Q:

Navigation using real time generate map without a known map

I know this should be possible but at the point of using AMCL. I don`t know what to do as AMCL does not have a tutorial with no known map.
Right now in the robot configuration.launch

**A map generated, and current laser scan data can be seen in the rviz.
Then I follows navigation tutorial to write configuration for navigation stack
**
the other yaml file are all the same except that
at global_costmap_params.yaml
static_map is set to false
amcl_diff.launch is similiar to the one found in
drh-robotics-ros - Revision 108: /trunk/ros/ardros/launch
But I got problem for the last part move_base.launch
map server is need to run navigation stack which operates on the known map
This part specific ask a known map for processing where as I need it to use the /map generated by slam_gmapping. And I`ll need it to be real time.
I know I have to change 
to a real time map generated by slam_gmapping. But I dont know how to do it as there wasnt much info out of here amcl/Tutorials
Does any one knows how to do it? How to modify the last move_base.launch to read real time map data?

A:

AMCL is meant for localization only (based on a known map) and will not work with a non-static map. SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) methods are meant for the task you're looking at. Options for that are gmapping and (shameless plug :) ) hector_mapping.
I suppose you could look into hacking AMCL to work with a map generated online by some other approach, but for that other approach to be able to generate a consistent map you need localization. And that's the chicken-egg problem of SLAM ;)
