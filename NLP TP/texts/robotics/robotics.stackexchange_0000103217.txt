Q:

nav2-smac-planner package not available on foxy

I'm trying to install the nav2-smac-planner package on Foxy but apt install can't find it. Is it not available?
Here seem to indicate it's available on Foxy both source and debian.

Thank you in advance

nav2_smac_planner is available for humble but not for foxy i believe.
Foxy have a smac_planner package without (SmacPlannerHybrid, SmacPlannerLattice).

that's what I thought but in the github page of navigation2 in the build status table it looks like it should be available for foxy
