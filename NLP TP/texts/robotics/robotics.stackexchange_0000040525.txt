Q:

problem with geometry_msgs.Twist on Android

After looking at the VirtualJoystickView.java in the Honeycomb example I tried to do similar thing on Gingerbread, however I was getting NullPointerException when trying to access currentVelocityCommand variable which is of type geometry_msgs.Twist.
Looking at the code of Twist.java it turns it's an interface. To implement Twist I also need to implement Vector3, and I'm now stuck with toRawMessage() method.
This is probably the wrong path and surely I'm missing something obvious.

A:

Turned out I was on the wrong path. Everything is in the documentation. All I had to do was just use the MessageFactory and create the message of the Twist type. Everything works as expected now.

You should use the convenience methods like Publisher.newMessage() where possible.

Hi Artjom, I am also having the same null pointer exception problem you had when using Twist. In fact, the null pointer exception occurs even with the sample code "android_tutorial_teleop" provided with android_core. Do you mind letting me know what you did to solve the problem successfully? Thanks.
