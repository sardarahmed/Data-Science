Q:

should i ignore warnings

Should i ignore all the warnings while building some project in ros and only remove the errors? For example while building a project i get below yellow colourd warnings:
-- Found gmock sources under '/usr/src/gmock': gmock will be built
CMake Warning (dev) at /usr/src/gmock/CMakeLists.txt:40 (project):
  Policy CMP0048 is not set: project() command manages VERSION variables.
  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0048" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy
  command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  The following variable(s) would be set to empty:

    PROJECT_VERSION
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
    
    CMake Warning (dev) at /usr/src/gtest/CMakeLists.txt:42 (project):
      Policy CMP0048 is not set: project() command manages VERSION variables.
      Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0048" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy
      command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  The following variable(s) would be set to empty:

    PROJECT_VERSION
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

Will not this type of warnings create bug latter?

A:

Warnings are usually there for a reason. You should not just ignore them outright. They usually can mean that you're doing something that might be a problem. They will help you write cleaner code.
This is really a more general topic than ROS so I'd suggest that you look at external resources. Here are a few resources I found quickly:
