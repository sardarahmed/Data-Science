Q:

rosrun rqt_graph rqt_graph (Import error: no module named rospkg)(Is this is related to anaconda?)

Problem started when i executed rosrun as mentioned in question, then i installed rospkg using command

sudo apt-get install python-rospkg

and rospkg got installed in /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rospkg , but after that import error still showing. I am using anaconda too on my laptop and python2.7 is default for anaconda. One interesting point i got here that i have installed rospkg in python2.7 but when i am importing rospkg in python3.4, it is working.

Please add anaconda to the title and tags since the problem is very likely related to that.

What are the permissions on  /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rospkg ?
Comment by NEO on 2016-09-08:
default for all user

I've had a case where I was not able to read some of the directories in dist-packages so when I did an import of that module, python was unable to do so. This is the reason why I was asking about the permissions.

I also notice that on my machine, python2 and python2.7 somehow do different things.... So python -c "import rospkg" works, but python2.7 -c "import rospkg" does not... (just in case this isn't weird enough!)

A:

This error occurs because only Python packages in /opt are added to PYTHONPATH environment. I'm reading about python-rospkg and I found that this package is installed in /usr. You only have to type "export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages"  and this line will be add in your .bashrc file.  In my case, that was the solution that fix the error.
