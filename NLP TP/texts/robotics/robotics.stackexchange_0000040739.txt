Q:

Roscpp Publisher not publishing all messages

I have a node that is publishing a lot of messages (approximately 135 per second). It should be publishing more. Every time I publish a message, I print out a debug line, and the number of debug lines exceeds the number of messages received. The messages received have sequential header.seq numbers.
This is using a roscpp node on one computer. The publishing takes place in a callback.
Why would some of the messages not get published?

If there are sequential numbers my guess would be that some queue in the publisher overruns. Do you see any messages when you switch the loggers to DEBUG?

How big are your buffers (subscriber and publisher)?

A:

Both of you are right. I only had the queue size set to one, which is seemingly obvious.
In my defense, I checked the constructor for the roscpp Publisher and didn't see a queue size parameter. It's in advertise. D'oh.
