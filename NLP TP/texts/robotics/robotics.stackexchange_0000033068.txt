Q:

distinguishing between openni_tracker broadcasts based on which user's information is being sent

I am making a node that receives transforms from openni_tracker. Is there a way to make my node distinguish between transforms being sent for User 1, User 2, etc...?

If editing the ROS source code is a bad idea, do you have any other suggestions for solving this problem?

I am running the latest version of diamondback. How do I even install electric-turtle? When I went to the installation page, diamondback was the only option it gave me.

"Anyways, I am running the latest version of ROS" By which you mean latest diamondback version?  latest electric-turtle version? latest unstable trunk head version?

If you wanted mainting the change as ROS got updated, you'd have to: 1) be certain that your change doesn't cause unforeseen consequences 1) continually make sure it worked with future versions.  2) be ok with your software only working with your custom verson of ROS

Also, what kind of maintenance problems would there be? It seems like it would be a pretty small change, but I guess I do not know what the effects of it would be.

The lines that my version is missing have no pertinence to this question. It was just something that I noticed while looking at Bemfica's answer. Anyways, I am running the latest version of ROS.

It would generally be a bad idea because it would be a maintenance nightmare for you. It would probably be much easier/better to just upgrade to the latest version of ROS since tfoote suggested it has the feature you're looking for.

Would editing the openni_tracker.cpp file to send an index with each transform to specify which user's data is being sent be fine? Or is it a bad idea to edit ROS code? I know that it is supposed to be read-only.

I tried to improve your title, but not sure if I interpreted you correctly. Please look at it and correct it if necessary.
