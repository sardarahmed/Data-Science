Q:

Error:cannot launch node [octomap_server/octomap_server_node]

Hello
I am trying to convert my point cloud data into map using octomap. I am newbie in this, so i would like to know what I am doing wrong.
To create map these are steps I followed:

rosbag info<mypoint_cloudbagfile> : OUTPUT: gives all the required information appropriately

rosbag play <mypoint_cloudbagfile> 

Created my own Package

Inside launch folder added this data: https://github.com/OctoMap/octomap_mapping/blob/master/octomap_server/launch/octomap_mapping.launch

Updated Package.xml with required dependencies

Updated CmakeLists.txt like this:
 cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)
 project(octomap_server)

 set(PACKAGE_DEPENDENCIES
   roscpp
   rospy
   std_msgs
   pcl_ros
   pcl_conversions
   visualization_msgs
   nav_msgs
   octomap_ros
   octomap_msgs
   #dynamic_reconfigure
   nodelet
   sensor_msgs
 )

 find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS ${PACKAGE_DEPENDENCIES})

 find_package(PCL REQUIRED QUIET COMPONENTS common sample_consensus io segmentation filters)

 find_package(octomap REQUIRED)

 include_directories(
  include
  $(catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS)
     $(PCL_INCLUDE_DIRS)
  $(OCTOMAP_INCLUDE_DIRS)
    )
    catkin_package(
      INCLUDE_DIRS include
      LIBRARIES ${PROJECT_NAME}
   CATKIN_DEPENDS ${PACKAGE_DEPENDENCIES}
   DEPENDS octomap PCL
 )

 set(LINK_LIBS
     ${OCTOMAP_LIBRARIES}
        ${catkin_LIBRARIES}
     ${PCL_LIBRARIES}
 )

ran launch file :
 roslaunch octomap_server octomap_mapping.launch

It runs but gives this error:
OUTPUT: ERROR: cannot launch node of type [octomap_server/octomap_server_node]: can't locate node [octomap_server_node] in package [octomap_server]

P.S.: I have already installed octomap_mapping using
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-octomap_mapping

Please tell me why this error occurs and how can I repair it to proceed in creating a map.
There are some solutions I tried:

run rosrun octomap_server octomap_server_node to check node

I got this output:
Couldn't find executable named octomap_server_node below /home/ubuntu/catkin/src/octomap_server

Source the bash file using:
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

Thank You!

Welcome. I edited your question to make it more readable. In the future, please format any terminal output/source code/etc. using the 101010 button to make it more readable.

Thanx a lot.

Are modifying the package.xml and CMakeLists.txt of the package that you downloaded? If so, why? Also, did you run catkin_make from the root for your workspace? I don't see that step listed.

A:

This question pops up quite regularly and the solution is usually the same, source the setup.bash file:
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

Where catkin_ws is your catkin workspace. You can always Google the error to find a solution before posting a question:

Using Google to search ROS Answers is a good suggestion.
My suggestion: add site:answers.ros.org to the query. That will limit results to just this site.
Comment by jayess on 2017-09-05:
Good call. I updated the query to limit results to this site.
Comment by Eyshika on 2017-09-05:
@Jayess : I have already done that. My workspace bash file is already sourced. I googled the answer for this error and couldn't get the correct solution. that's why i thought of posting new question since it might be issue in Octomap_maping.
