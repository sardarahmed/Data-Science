Q:

vslam algorithmic basis

Hi all!
Regarding the vslam stack of ROS (http://www.ros.org/wiki/vslam), does anybody know what algorithms it uses for feature extraction, matching and so on? Is there any paper(s) I can read to understand how it works? I couldn't find anything related to these issues in the documentation of the stack.
Thanks!

A:

I know that it uses SBA (Sparse Bundle Adjustment).
It uses g2o to optimize BA as much as possible.
Here is a great introduction to vslam.
