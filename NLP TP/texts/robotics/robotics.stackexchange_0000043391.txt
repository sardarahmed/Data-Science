Q:

Start a node from python code - rospy equivalence rosrun - rosgui qt

Hallo,
I'm writing a plugin for my rosgui in python. At the moment I'm trying to write an "pressed-button" action which starts a rosnode. I's there a python-command equivalent to "rosrun pkg node" or the launch-command "?
Unfortunately  I couldn't find something in the documentations yet.
Thanks for Help.

A:

You can use the roslaunch api for python (ref):
import roslaunch

package = 'rqt_gui'
executable = 'rqt_gui'
node = roslaunch.core.Node(package, executable)

launch = roslaunch.scriptapi.ROSLaunch()
launch.start()

process = launch.launch(node)
print(process.is_alive())
process.stop()
