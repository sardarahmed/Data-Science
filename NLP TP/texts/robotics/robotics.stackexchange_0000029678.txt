Q:

Kinect install problems

Hi,
I'm following the install instructions for kinect located here:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/ni#Setup_and_installation
But when I do, I get the following error at this step:
/opt/ros/cturtle/ros/core/roscpp$ rosinstall ~/ni /opt/ros/unstable 'http://www.ros.org/wiki/ni?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=ni.rosinstall'
rosinstall: command not found
I installed cturtle on linux 10.10 using the "base" installation, and ran the given command to set my environment.  Most of ros functionality seems to be working.
Does anybody know what the problem might be?
Thank you for your time,
Andy

A:

I don't think rosinstall comes with the debs. See rosinstall for how to get the rosinstall tool.
