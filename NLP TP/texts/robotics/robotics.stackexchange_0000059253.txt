Q:

Collada to URDF Conversion

Hello everyone,
I want to load a collada file with kinematics and joints of a robot into V-Rep, which only supports URDF for kinematics.
I found the collada_parser which seems to be able to convert a collada file to URDF, but I have no idea how to convert or use it. Is it even possible to export the kinematics this way?
Thanks for your help,
Daniel

try:

hey, thank you for the answer, but I want to convert the other way round: collada to urdf.

What's wrong with @Bastbeat's answer? Anyway collada_urdf package provides conversion in both ways. http://wiki.ros.org/collada_urdf#collada_to_urdf_command-line_tool

@curi_ROS Please open a new question thread instead of asking a question in a comment section. That's not how this forum works and to the worst your question won't get attention it might need.
