Q:

is there any distance measuring sensor in gazebo?

I m beginner in gazebo and robotics .is there any sensor in gazebo by which i find the distance of object ,i used Hokuyo laser range finders which is given in  tutorial http://gazebosim.org/wiki/Tutorials/1.3/control_robot/mobile_base_laser .as far i understood it send a broad laser so it detect any object in that area(circumference ) ,but how can i know in which direction obstacle is present and how can i navigate my robot to avoid obstacle .

A:

If you take a look into the hokuyo model's SDF you can see, that the laser takes 640 samples (<samples>640</samples>). With the resolution (<resolution>1</resolution>)  and the min angle and max angle (<min_angle>-2.26889</min_angle>, <max_angle>2.268899</max_angle>) you have everything you need.
Then for example in a plugin go through the samples (for this you should take a look in the control model tutorial) and check the distances:
If sample 0 detects a low range then you know, that from your sensor direction in the angle of -2.26889 there is an object.
Edit: perhaps its easier to connect a simple ray sensor to your mobile robot. Then you can control things like angle and samples without editing the hokuyo model.

Hey. I am also doing the same work of obstacle avoidance but when i did it with polaris_ranger_model this control model tutorial is not working . Polaris dont stop. Can you plz suggest how will i do it with polaris ranger model so that it should stop when it detects the object. Thanks!
