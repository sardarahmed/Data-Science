Q:

ubuntu 16.04 Kinetic update. no rule to make target libvtkproj

Hi,
I had my code working. Today I installed the update recommended by Ubuntu which contained some ros-kinetik packages (to be hones I did not checked all of them)
Now, I have a compilation problem.
[ 85%] Built target ar_navigation_generate_messages_cpp
make[2]: *** No rule to make target '/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libvtkproj4-6.2.so.6.2.0', needed by 'some_path/ar_navigation/qr_saver'.  Stop.
CMakeFiles/Makefile2:10243: recipe for target 'some_path/ar_navigation/CMakeFiles/qr_saver.dir/all' failed
make[1]: *** [some_path/ar_navigation/CMakeFiles/qr_saver.dir/all] Error 2
Makefile:138: recipe for target 'all' failed
make: *** [all] Error 2

The file is there, I don't know what is happening...
Anyone experiencing the same problem?
thanks

Glad you were able to work around this problem, but I do want to point out that this is probably not the right solution. This is a new issue that was introduced just a few weeks ago that has already been reported in several places. Hopefully a fix will be coming soon. Relevant bug reports:

https://github.com/ros-perception/perception_pcl/issues/318
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/vtk6/+bug/1573234

Fix for issue mentioned above is now released. See my comment to this answer below.

A:

You shouldn't just create a symlink. Instead, you can do one of the following while we wait for this to be fixed:

Clone perception_pcl into your workspace, or:

Pin the OSRF version of libvtk6.2 on apt by creating a file called /etc/apt/preferences.d/ros-pin with the following content:
  Package: *
  Pin: origin packages.ros.org
  Pin-Priority: 1000

UPDATE As mentioned on this ROS discourse thread, an update to the ROS Kinetic packages that depend on VTK was just released to the package repositories. Users should be able to unpin any pinned packages (e.g. delete file created above), and then run apt-get update/upgrade to install the latest packages, and this error should disappear.

@jarvisschultz I ran 'apt-get update/upgrade' and 'sudo apt-get dist-upgrade', deleted the devel and build folder, but I still get the same error: 'make[2]: *** No rule to make target '/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libvtkproj4-6.2.so.6.2.0', needed by...' In the link you mentioned it says recompile any binaries which are compiled against vtk or pcl. Is that done by deleting the devel and build folder or is there anything else that commonly needs to be rebuilt? Do I need to rebuild pcl for example? Thanks!

@dschimpf Please see my comment thread on this question. Updated versions of the ROS packages that depend on PCL have been released (you shouldn't need to rebuild PCL or perception-pcl or any other packages). Just because you ran an update/upgrade doesn't necessarily mean you have all updated packages installed. For example, you could have other conflicting packages causing things to be held back. If you can confirm that you have all versions mentioned in that thread installed, then something else is going on.
