Q:

rosinstall_generator fails on OS X Maverick

Hi,
I have recently tried to install ROS hydro on OS X with HomeBrew but the rosinstall_generator fails with:
(links looking like that , because had no enough karma to publish a link :))

rosinstall_generator desktop_full
--rosdistro hydro --deps --wet-only --tar > hydro-desktop-full-wet.rosinstall
Traceback (most recent call last):

<urlopen error [Errno 8] nodename nor
servname provided, or not known>
(http: // ros.org / rosdistro / hydro-cache . yaml . gz)>

The problem is that it can't resolve the url: http: // ros . org / rosdistro / hydro-cache.yaml.gz.
I believe the rewrite rules are missing from the ros server, as http: // www . ros . org / rosdistro / hydro-cache.yaml.gz is reachable and http: // ros . org / rosdistro / hydro-cache.yaml.gz is not.
Any help would be appreciated,
Thanks,
Csongor

A:

I can not reproduce this problem, it works just fine on OS X over here. And the cache without www is also reachable. Maybe it was a temporary problem. You could also try pip install -U rosinstall_generator, but I don't see how that should make much of a difference if the URL reachability is indeed the issue. Please double check that the URL is not reachable for you: wget http://ros.org/rosdistro/hydro-cache.yaml.gz.

Thanks.That is right, now it works. Might have been a temporary issue.

Hello, I'm struggling with the same problem.
To double check I tried "wget..." as suggested above, and I get a message "-bash: wget: command not found"

OSX doesn't have wget installed by default. You can use curl instead or install wget through homebrew: brew install wget

@ahendrix thanks for your comment. I did directly paste it in the browser URL bar and I couldn't access it. however, i put a "www" between "http://" and "ros.", and I could download the cache.
It seems to be impossible to do so using rosintall_generator for me. Any ideas about a workaround?

Well, it turns out that the URL was not accessible from a secure wi-fi space even with access to it. I tried again after getting home from work and it runs fine.
Strange.
Thank you nevertheless.

Are you certain you have the latest version of rosinstall_generator? I have version 0.1.9 on linux; the same version should work on OSX. You should be able to get your rosinstall_generator version with python -c 'import rosinstall_generator; print rosinstall_generator.version'
