Q:

bloom; RuntimeError: Two packages have different version numbers (but it is false)

I'm trying to release a meta package using boom with the following command:
bloom-release --rosdistro indigo --track indigo summit_xl_common

And after a lot of questions it gives me the following error:
==> git-bloom-import-upstream /tmp/tmpUJpJvY/upstream-indigo-1.0.0.tar.gz  --release-version 1.0.0 --replace
Creating upstream branch.
Importing archive into upstream branch...

<== Error running command '['/usr/bin/git-bloom-import-upstream', '/tmp/tmpUJpJvY/upstream-indigo-1.0.0.tar.gz', '--release-version', '1.0.0', '--replace']'
Release failed, exiting.

It says that summit_xl_common and summit_xl_localization have different version numbers, but it is false, you can check here that it is version 1.0.0 (same as summit_xl_common).
Why does it occur? How should I fix it?
Thanks

Can you please post the full log, maybe in a gist.github.com? The logs are stored in ~/.bloom_logs.

A:

I've finally managed to publish the release, it was a problem with the package.xml version pushed with that tag, I deleted it and creted it again and it works.
Thanks.
