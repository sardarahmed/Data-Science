Q:

How to call onSaveImage() function in rviz with a constant rate?

Hi all,
I find out that I can save an image by choosing File->Save Image in rviz.
What if I want to save images automatically with a constant rate? Anybody knows how to do this?

A:

You should write a node which subscribes to the image stream and saves the images.  Use the rate command so that it runs at a constant rate.
Or use Rosbag to save the image stream, although you won't get a constant stream then.

Thanks for your answer, but I also want to record other sensor messages in a video. Like the point cloud and marker arrays.

Then just use a screen recorder program like RecordMyDesktop

I have tried both glc-capture and RecordMyDesktop. glc-capture gives very good result but if I convert the .glc file to .avi file, the color changes and it looks blurry. With RecordMyDesktop the color is not good from the beginning.
