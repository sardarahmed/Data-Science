Q:

How does ROS build system work?

Hi,
I have been using ROS for quite sometime and have installed many packages of my own and from the sources available. But i would like to know how the building happens. What rosmake actually does? cmake followed by make? Why is manifest.xml very important. I might have missed a tutorial if available on this. Could someone point to it if available or give some detail about the building process here.
Thanks,
Karthik

A:

Rosmake basically calls make recursively.  This answer talks about the difference between rosmake and make: http://answers.ros.org/question/10614/rosmake-vs-make
In rosbuild the Makefile invokes CMake, and uses rospack to get the package information from the manifest.xml files.
And you should read about the manifest.xml on the wiki
