Q:

Calculating Mass Inertia Matrix in Joint Space

Hi,
I am doing simulation of Baxter Robot. Hence I need to calculate Mass Inertia Matrix in Joint Space. I have Baxter URDF files. I see here that  Mass Inertia Matrix in Joint Space is defined in following way-

However I am not sure, whether it is possible to get this matrix directly by using URDF file.

A:

One option is to create a robot model from KDLKinematics based on the URDF. This package can compute the Jacobian and mass matrix using the following functions from here: jacobian() and inertia(). You would have to change the end_link when calling the KDLKinematics() function for calculating jacobian() and inertia() for different chains.

Perfect. This is what I was  looking for. One quick question, by looking at cart_inertia function, I am confused. The Joint Space matrix defined above looks like cartesian space matrix. Isn't it?
