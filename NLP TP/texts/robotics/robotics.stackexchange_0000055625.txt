Q:

capturing camera in electric and groovy

Hi,
I need to change my code for capturing images from electric to groovy and find that CvBridge has gone. Finding http://answers.ros.org/question/9765/how-to-convert-cvmat-to-sensor_msgsimageptr/?answer=14282#post-id-14282 and http://answers.ros.org/question/60279/sensor_msgscvbridgecvtoimgmsg-in-groovy/ they seem to offer a solution but also raises questions about the use of some variables that are just used without visible declaration. My current code:
sensor_msgs::CvBridge cvbridge; image = cvbridge.imgMsgToCv(msgs_im, "bgr8");.
Can somebody give an explanation ?
Thank you

My point is that in the first answer in that link i and ci are being used without explanation. That makes it for me hard to understand how it exactly happens. If you can tell me, I'd appreciate it.

A:

Your second link would seem to answer your own question ... have you tried it? What didn't work?
