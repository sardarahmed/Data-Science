Question related to the teb local planner tutorial

Hi everyone,
I have encounter some problem during the tutorial in the teb_local_planner tutorial (http://wiki.ros.org/teb_local_planner/Tutorials/Following%20the%20Global%20Plan%20%28Via-Points%29), in part 2 Optimization with via-point, I was trying to find the  global_plan_viapoint_sep in the rqt_reconfigure panel, and I cannot find this section. Did I miss something in previous tutorial which leaded to this issue?

A:

Hi samping,
you are not seeing the parameter since the current version on the official ROS repositories (indigo+jade) is 0.3.1.
The path following feature was introduced in Version 0.4 (as noted in the to the API description here or in the tutorial).
You can check the current version status here (indigo) or here (jade). The third rectangle corresponds to the status for the public repository.
It often takes a couple of weeks until new packages are being synchronized in ROS.
However, you can either checkout the code from github and compile it by yourself, or you can install the pre-released version of the package from the shadow-fixed repository.
