Q:

Gazebo not running on ROS Kinetic and Ubuntu 16.04

I am trying to run Gazebo on a virtual machine with ROS Kinetic and Ubuntu 16.04.
However, I ran into the following error. I searched it online. Some says to change SIGINT to INT. It still doesn't work. Could anyone help me with this?
VMware: vmw_ioctl_command error Invalid argument. Aborted (core dumped) /opt/ros/kinetic/lib/gazebo_ros/gazebo: 46: kill: invalid signal number or name: SIGINT

A:

I think this may be similar to the error I was getting, which was related to accelerated 3d graphics in VMware Workstation. You could try doing what I did:
add the following to ~/.bashrc
export SVGA_VGPU10=0

Or maybe try disabling 'Accelerate 3D graphics' inside the vm settings.

Adding the command line to the bash file did resolve my issue. But disable the "Accelerate 3D graphics" did. Thanks!

Glad to hear it worked.  I should have mentioned that if you use that .bashrc change, you would need to start gazebo from the terminal and not start it from the gui in order for the option to be applied.

I did start the Gazebo from terminal after adding that command in the .bashrc. For some reason, it did not resolve the issue on my computer.

export SVGA_VGPU10=0
Worked for me w/ ROS kinetic/gazebo 7 in VMware workstation 14 (Ubuntu 16.04). Went from 5-6 FPS w/ 3-D graphics disabled to 60+ FPS w/ 3-D graphics enabled.

just disabling 'Accelerate 3D graphics' inside the vm settings worked for me, thanks.
