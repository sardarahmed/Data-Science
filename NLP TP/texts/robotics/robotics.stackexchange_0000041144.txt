Q:

RGBDSlam + localization

Hello all,
Is there a way to add a 2D map (where I will show the position of my robot) in the GUI run by roslaunch rgbdslam kinect+rgbdslam.launch.
Actually I just would like to reconfigure the windows of RGBDSlam GUI ,but I dont know I should do it.
Does someone have any ideas? Because it's a common wanted GUI, I think it's exist and I don't want to redevelop something already developed.
Thanks a lot
Cheers
PS: I'm using ros electric on ubuntu 11.04

A:

You could regularly create a volumetric 3D map in octomap_server out of the point clouds from RGBD-SLAM. octomap_server can create a downprojected 2D map for you which you can then display in RViz together with the 3D map and your robot.

I've tried to install octo_server as shown on the rgbdslam wiki page but I've this error message: Unable to locate package ros-electric-octomap-mapping
Unable to locate package ros-electric-octomap-visualization
I think it's because I've just upgraded my ubuntu but I don't know what to do...
