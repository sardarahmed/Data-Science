Q:

where did turtle_tf_sensor.launch go?

In the tf tutorial page:
uisng time stamped datatypes with tf
the first line says to run a launch file that does not exist in diamondback.
roslaunch turtle_tf turtle_tf_sensor.launch
I would be really nice to see this example.  Any ideas where it has gone?

A:

It moved to the geometry_tutorials stack.  You need to install that stack.  If you're using debs you will need ros-diamondback-geometry-tutorials

Is this still the case?  I can't seem to find the launch files for the mentioned tf::MessageFilter tutorial, or the Debugging tf tutorial right before it (start_debug_demo.launch), but maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.

@rlinsalata I'm also wondering where start_debug_demo.launch is hiding.

I can't find start_debug_demo.launch either
