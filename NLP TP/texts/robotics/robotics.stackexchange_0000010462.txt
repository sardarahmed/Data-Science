Q:

Name of the linkage (or carriage) in video

I am trying to find the name (nomenclature) of the linkage (or carriage) that is being driven by the dual linear servo (actuator) arrangement in the following Youtube videos:

Servo Basic Concepts
YouTube - 4 X Linear Servo Application

The linkage (carriage) appears to be able to rotate about a 180 degree arc.
What is this metal linkage (or carriage) system called? 

A:

The video shows 2 linear actuators driving a universal joint through ball and socket joints.
