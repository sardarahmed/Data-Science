Q:

Change base_link position

How do we change the base_link coordinate centre on autoware? Is there a default one that it automatically uses? If so where is it positioned?

Can you expand on what you mean by "change the base_link coordinate centre"?

A:

In Autoware coordinate system, base_link is defined at the center of rear wheels as follows.

You need to set the relative transform between base_link to velodyne on Setup tab.
