Q:

What is subpixel matching precision for stereo?

Hello,
I'm trying to figure out what the subpixel stereo matching precision is in stereo_image_proc (that is, how many pixels/subpixels of disparity can the stereo matching algorithm resolve). I looked at the code a bit, and I think it's 1/4-pixel, but I've also heard it's 1/8-pixel. Do you which it is (or maybe a different value altogether)? Thanks!

A:

I am pretty sure it's 1/16th pixel. In disparity.cpp of stereo_image_proc it says so explicitly:
// OpenCV uses 16 disparities per pixel
