Q:

Controlling Camera Rotations Using PCLVisualizer

PCLVISUALIZER.CAMERA_ QUESTIONS ...
Given: camera_ with values clip:0,0, focal:0,0,0, pos:0,0,0, view:0,0,0 ....
Rotate camera_ to point in the direction: (1, .75, -2)....
Rotate the camera to aim to the left (x direction) 45 degrees relative to its current setting.
What are the formulas for PCLVisualizer.camera_ rotations?
Is there a relationship between quaternions and these four attributes?
What do each of these settings represent?
Right now I have crude approximations of ways to rotate the camera and translate it, but I have not figured out how to aim the camera based on a direction vector. Help would be tremendous...

A:

This should probably be asked on the pcl-users mailing list; it's very active, you'll probably get a quick response.
