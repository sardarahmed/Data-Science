Q:

Question about turtlebot _robot.launch

Hi all, in robot.launch, I'm confused in a sentence: ".../robots/$(arg base)_$(arg stacks)$(arg 3d_sensor).urdf.xacro'" />". Can anyone give me a detailed explanation of this sentence? Thanks!

A:

As you know, arg means an argument. As @dornhege also say, you have to choose a base of turtlebot model create, kobuki or roomba. You can check some urdf.xacro files in /turtlebot_description/robots.

create_circles_asus_xtion_pro.urdf.xacro
create_circles_kinect.urdf.xacro
kobuki_hexagons_asus_xtion_pro.urdf.xacro
kobuki_hexagons_kinect.urdf.xacro
roomba_circles_asus_xtion_pro.urdf.xacro
roomba_circles_kinect.urdf.xacro

$(arg base)_$(arg stacks)_$(arg 3d_sensor).urdf.xacro

You will understand the meaning if you look at above description.
