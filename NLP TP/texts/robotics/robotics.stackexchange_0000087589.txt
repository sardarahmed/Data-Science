Q:

get odometry from hector_slam

hi ,
i'm trying to improve the odometry of my robot , i'm using wheel encoders and i'm wondering if i can combine it with odometry provided from laser_scan_matcher since the robot have a hokuyo laser sensor ?  and by the way what do you think it's better to get odometry from laser scan  between laser_scan matcher and hector_slam ?
thanks  in advance for your answer .

You can use robot_localization to fuse the odometries
