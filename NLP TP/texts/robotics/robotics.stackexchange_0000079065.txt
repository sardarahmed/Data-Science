Q:

Runtime Error with Image Transport in Eclipse IDE

Hi guys,
I have configured the Eclipse as my IDE and I am having no problems during compile time for my ROS packages. Once I run or enter the Debug mode, if there is an image_transport object use, it will immediately cause runtime error showing this error message:

[rospack] Error: package 'image_transport' not found
[librospack]: error while executing command
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'pluginlib::ClassLoaderException'
what():  Unable to find package: image_transport

When I try to run the same node outside the Eclipse environment I have no such problems.
Do you have any idea what might be causing this?
Thank you!

A:

You need to have your .bashrc environment properly sourced. As stated in the documentation, you should load your .bashrc environment with Eclipse, by launching it from the command line via $ bash -i -c "eclipse" . For convenience, you can also set this automatically by changing the Exec= line in your eclipse.desktop launcher.
For example, I did
$ vim ~/.local/share/applications/eclipse.desktop`

For example, my eclipse.desktop file contains this:
Exec=bash -i -c /MY_PATH_TO_ECLIPSE/eclipse

Then, you may drag this eclipse.desktop file to the side bar.
