Q:

How to connect gazebo turtlebot and running in RViz?

I have a plan to start working on gazebo for simulation turtlebot first and then use the turtlebot simulator in RViz.
How to connect it?
I appreciate any help and pointers in any direction.
Thanks. :

Need robot state publisher and joint state publisher. Don't have example code on this computer to share.

I recommend looking going through the simulation track of http://learn.turtlebot.com/
There are also simulation tutorials here: http://wiki.ros.org/action/show/Robots/TurtleBot
