Q:

roslaunch: [ ] is neither a launch file in package [ ] nor is [ ] a launch file name

I am trying to use a package that someone else made. I placed it inside the src folder, then I ran catkin_make in the catkin_ws folder. The output was:
Base path: /home/gabriel/catkin_ws
Source space: /home/gabriel/catkin_ws/src
Build space: /home/gabriel/catkin_ws/build
Devel space: /home/gabriel/catkin_ws/devel
Install space: /home/gabriel/catkin_ws/install
####
#### Running command: "make cmake_check_build_system" in "/home/gabriel/catkin_ws/build"
####
####
#### Running command: "make -j4 -l4" in "/home/gabriel/catkin_ws/build"
####
[ 25%] Built target odom_sim_2
[ 50%] [ 75%] Built target tb_tf_can2
[100%] Built target fake_localiza2
Built target sendToGoalManually2

Then I tried to launch one of the launch files included: roslaunch tb_tables tb_tables.launch and I get the following message:
[tb_tables.launch] is neither a launch file in package [tb_tables] nor is [tb_tables] a launch file name

Would anyone be kind enough to point out my mistakes? I just started with ROS and I am not sure why it ain't working :( Thanks in advance.
EDIT:
-Does the file actually exists?
Yes, the file is in the launch folder.
-Did you source the setup.bash file?
Do you mean source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash ? Yes, I did.
-What does rospack find tb_tables output?
[rospack] Error: stack/package tb_tables not found
After using source /home/gabriel/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash I can find it with rospack find.
Now it works, Thank you very much.

I've got the same problem for days but the answer is the same, could you tell me if you found the answer please?
Comment by jayess on 2018-01-26:
@alonzo98 why don't you ask a new question and reference this one? The question is almost four years old after all...

A:

Without any further information or poitners to the source of that package it is hard to tell what is going on. Does the file tb_tables.launch actually exist? Did you source the setup.bash file?
What does rospack find tb_tables output?
If that gives an error, try  executing source /home/gabriel/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash and then try the roslaunch again.
Be sure to checkout the catkin tutorials, in particular this one, in order to know how to work with catkin and workspaces: http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/using_a_workspace

I've run into the same problem, but for some reason when I try to source the files, I get the message "no such file or directory," even though I've already clicked through every file in the path I'm using to make sure it's there. Is there any reason this would happen?
Comment by demmeln on 2014-04-17:
what is the source command you are trying to execute exactly?
