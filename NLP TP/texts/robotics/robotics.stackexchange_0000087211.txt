Q:

moveit_commander_cmdline.py Error

Hey,
I was going through the Moveit tutorials here: Moveit Commander Scripting and when I tried launching rosrun moveit_commander moveit_commander_cmdline.py, I am getting the following error:
kashyap@kashyap-Lenovo-ideapad-320-15IKB:~$ rosrun moveit_commander moveit_commander_cmdline.py
Failed to import pyassimp, see https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/86 for more info

    self._psi = _moveit_planning_scene_interface.PlanningSceneInterface()
Boost.Python.ArgumentError: Python argument types in
    PlanningSceneInterface.__init__(PlanningSceneInterface)
did not match C++ signature:
    __init__(_object*, std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >)

Could anyone guide me as to what this error means? Thanks

This is a known problem, and there is already a PR to fix it: ros-planning/moveit#929.
