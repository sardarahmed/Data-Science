Q:

UTM-30LX not detected on /dev/ttyACM(*) by Ubuntu

I am trying to connect my UTM-30LX to ubuntu 16.04 running ROS kinetic using the urg_node. I have installed URG and I am following this tutorial http://wiki.ros.org/hokuyo_node/Tutorials/UsingTheHokuyoNode
(for the Hokuyo_node as I could not find a tutorial for the urg_node). All I have done so far is connect the lidar to my computer through USB and power it. I see no mention on Hokuyos website of linux drivers. Whenever I type ls -l /dev/ttyACM0 ubuntu spits out ls: cannot access '/dev/ttyACM0': No such file or directory. I have run various commands and I've realised that ubuntu is not detecting the UTM-30LX at all, It registers no change on /dev whenever the usb is connected

A:

There is a trick I do when debugging USB connected devices. I save the output of lsusb -vvv to a file with the device connected and without the device connected. Then diff the two files to see the details of the device, if there is no difference then the USB device is not registered by the OS at all. The process is:
With the device unplugged:
lsusb -vvv > unconnected.txt

Then plug the device in and run:
lsusb -vvv > connected.txt
diff unconnected.txt connected.txt

Hope this helps.
