And what have you tried yourself that didn't work?
Comment by matt27110 on 2017-02-12:
I tried to install the package from the indigo branch, before that I ran sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-ardrone-autonomy
Comment by matt27110 on 2017-02-12:
The catkin_make didn't work
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-02-12:
But the apt-get did?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-02-12:
Are you on an ARM platform by any chance?
Comment by matt27110 on 2017-02-12:
The apt-get command works well ans i'm using Intel processor
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-02-12:
So .. the package would then be installed, would it not?
After having sourced /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash, it should be available.
What is the output of rospack find ardrone_autonomy?
Comment by matt27110 on 2017-02-12:
/opt/ros/kinetic/share/ardrone_autonomy
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-02-12:
That would seem to indicate that the package is installed.
At this point I'm slightly confused about your question.
Comment by matt27110 on 2017-02-12:
but in this package there's no CMakeList.txt
Comment by matt27110 on 2017-02-12:
I confused myself xD
I was trying to use an indigo package called ardrone_autonomy from this link : https://github.com/AutonomyLab/ardrone_autonomy , I was wrong
Comment by matt27110 on 2017-02-12:
Finally I downloaded the package with apt-get and this package is located at : /opt/ros/kinetic/share/ardrone_autonomy. I copied/pasted it in catkin_ws/src and I would like to run catkin_make but there's no CMakeList

I get E: Unable to locate package ros-kinetic-ardrone-autonomy when I use   sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-ardrone-autonomy, help please

A:

That github link and the package you install using apt-get are one and the same.
If you install something using apt-get, you don't need to build it with catkin_make anymore.
What would be the point of distributing binaries otherwise?

Edit:

Ahhhh I thought they were different because in the link the ROS version is indigo and mine is kinetic. Thx !!

The Kinetic version is released from the indigo-devel branch. See wiki/ardrone_autonomy.
If you ever do need to build a package from source, what you did is not the way to go about it. See #q252478 for a general description of the process.
