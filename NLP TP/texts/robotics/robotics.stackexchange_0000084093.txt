Q:

catkin work space initializing

I installed ROS version Lunar on ubuntu 16.04 . I was trying to initializing the catkin work space that this error appeared :
Could neither symlink nor copy file "/opt/ros/lunar/share/catkin/cmake/toplevel.cmake" to "/opt/ros/lunar/catkin_ws/src/CMakeLists.txt":
- [Errno 13] Permission denied
- [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/opt/ros/lunar/catkin_ws/src/CMakeLists.txt'negar

what should I do???
I prefer not to reinstall it and when I use sudo, It's not work
I also create directory in $HOME , but :
negar@negar:/home/ros_working/catkin_ws/src$ catkin_init_workspace
Could neither symlink nor copy file "/opt/ros/lunar/share/catkin/cmake/toplevel.cmake" to "/home/ros_working/catkin_ws/src/CMakeLists.txt":

[Errno 13] Permission denied: '/home/ros_working/catkin_ws/src/CMakeLists.txt'

And when I use sudo :  sudo: catkin_init_workspace: command not found

not try to make your Catkin workspace in a non-world-writable location. /opt/ros/lunar/catkin_ws is a location only writable by root (or users with similar permissions).
Try to create your workspace in your $HOME directory.

Edit: please add how you created your workspace (ie: the /home/ros_working/catkin_ws directory).
Also include the output of ls -al /home/ros_working/catkin_ws in your update.

And when I use sudo , sudo: catkin_init_workspace: command not found

never use sudo with ROS. It is hardly ever really necessary, and there are almost always other ways to achieve what you want to do.
It's certainly not needed to be able to create, init and build a workspace.

Thanks but It's ok to do that ?? to build it in another directory ?? no problem will occur ?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-11-27:
I would say it's best practice to not build in /opt/ros/...
Comment by NegarL on 2017-11-27:
I made my catkin work space in $HOME but I still have the problem !

You did not include the output of ls -al /home/ros_working/catkin_ws in your update.
