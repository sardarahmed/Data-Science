Q:

Getting and logging current *weather conditions* in ROS

Is it possible in ROS to record current weather conditions from a website or weather-indicator in Ubuntu?
I would like to record current atmosphere temperature, humidity, etc for some experiments.
Thanks.

google "waether api with c++ wrapper" , your question is not ROS specific.

A:

I'm not aware of a ROS node which does this already.
It shouldn't be too hard to writea node like this in python if you can find a python library which can query the current weather information.
