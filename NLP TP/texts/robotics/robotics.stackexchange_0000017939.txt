Q:

Hand eye calibration of robot arm using a 2D camera and marker of known size

If my understanding is correct, one flavor of hand eye calibration requires the following pairs of data for different robot arm positions:

The transform from the robot base to the robot hand.
The transform from the marker to the robot camera.

By transform, I mean the 4x4 homogeneous matrix that contains both rotation and translation information.
The part I am stuck on is getting the transform from the marker to the robot camera, which is a 2D camera. The marker can be checkerboard, or Aruco, etc. for which opencv can give you the pose of the marker with respect to the camera.
The question I have is fundamental: Is it even possible to get the pose of the camera from images of a marker of known size? Won't there be a scale ambiguity specifically in the z direction of the camera? Is this z ambiguity resolved by using a marker of known size? Finally, if this scale ambiguity is always there, is it possible to do hand eye calibration using a 2D camera and a marker of known size?

A:

Is it even possible to get the pose of the camera from images of a marker of known size? 
-> Yes. From the camera image that is containing a calibration board, you can estimate a 3 by 3 homography matrix H. Then, if you know a camera intrinsic parameters then you can inversely recover the scale known transformation matrix using the intrinsic and homography H. Here is a good reference for this (have a look at 3.1 Closed-form solution). Translation scale will be unknown when the board size is unknown.
Won't there be a scale ambiguity specifically in the z direction of the camera?
-> Not at all if the camera intrinsic and board size is known. 
Is this z ambiguity resolved by using a marker of known size?
-> Yes 
Finally, if this scale ambiguity is always there, is it possible to do hand eye calibration using a 2D camera and a marker of known size?
-> As your statement "scale ambiguity is always there" is not necessary, the calibration is fairly simple now with the scale known transformations above. You just need to find a robot base to the board transformation and hand to eye transformation.  
You have 12 unknowns and each constraint will give you 3 equations. 4 different set data will be enough for a closed-form solution. What you need to solve is
$${^RT_{E_i}}{^ET_{C}}{^{C_i}T_{B}}={^RT_{B}} $$
where R is robot base, E is end-effector, C is a camera, B is the board coordinate. 
Refers to the following paper for a detailed solution.
