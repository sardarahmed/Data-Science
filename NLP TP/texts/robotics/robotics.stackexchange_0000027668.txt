Q:

Is there a way to start Gazebo with a smaller window size?

Whenever I launch Gazebo from the command line, it isn't in fullscreen mode but the window is maximized and takes up the whole screen. Is there a way I can launch gazebo with a smaller window that doesn't take up the entire screen?

A:

Open Gazebo, resize and reposition the window the way you want it to look when you open it, then on the top menu, choose:
File -> Save Configuration
The next time you open Gazebo, it will open that way ;)
Behind the scenes, Gazebo is updating the ~/.gazebo/gui.ini file with geometry information like this:
[geometry]
width=1330
height=865
x=1148
y=418

You can also change these values manually if you'd like.
