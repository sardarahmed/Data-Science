Q:

How do I install rosjava hydro on ubuntu 14.04?

I am new to linux and to ROS, however when I try and run sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-catkin ros-hydro-ros python-wstool
all I get is:
Reading package lists... Done
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-hydro-catkin
E: Unable to locate package ros-hyrdo-ros
How do I resolve this?

A:

Check the target distibutions for ROS Hydro (http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0003.html#hydro-medusa-aug-2013), 14.04 is not supported.
