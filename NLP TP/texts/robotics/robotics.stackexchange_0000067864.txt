Q:

Build errors installing knowrob

Hi,
So I follow instructions reported here to install knowrob http://cram-project.org/installation
After I run catkin_make I get the following error
Gradling tasks for json_prolog
Gradling tasks for knowrob_srdl
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

Where:
Build file '/home/rohan/Peretec_work/workspace/ros_kb/src/stacks/knowrob/json_prolog/build.gradle' line: 41
What went wrong:
A problem occurred evaluating root project 'json_prolog'.

I have installed rosjava and I am using ros-indigo on ubuntu 14.04.

A:

Yeah, Gradle is very fragile and constantly complains about weird stuff. Usually it complains after rosjava updates, so if you recently updated your Indigo packages that might have been the cause. I usually remove the ~/.gradle directory (the one in your home) and sometimes also the build and devel in my workspace and recompile everything and that helps. Otherwise, from the information you provided it's hard to say anything else, you'd need to tell us how exactly you're installing KnowRob, your workspace setup etc... Maybe @moritz has a better idea.
