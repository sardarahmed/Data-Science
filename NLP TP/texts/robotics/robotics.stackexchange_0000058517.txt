Q:

Creating a ROS msg

Has anyone tried this tutorial of ROS for creating messages in order to communicate with the nodes.
I am using ubuntu 12.04 ver and ROS Hydro for this.
The error what i am getting is that i am not able to catkin_make it. It gives some error regarding the make file already installed in ros directory of linux in the folder and i am not able to generate the source file or anything.
Any feedback regarding this is welcomed...
thnks

Please edit also your question posting your CMakeLists.txt.

A:

It looks like the ros setup script has not been previosuly executed:

$ source /opt/ros/XXX/setup.bash

where xxx is the ros distro name, ie: hydro, jade, etc...
