Q:

how to solve the frame ID setting warning?

Do you have any idea ** to correct the following warning setting?
[WARN] [1340092854.777455509]: Message from [/hokuyo] has a non-fully-qualified 

frame_id [laser]. Resolved locally to [/laser].  This is will likely not work in multi-robot systems.  This message will only print once.

Set the frame_id to /laser and the warnings will go away.

Although I agree that this solution will work for single robot settings, I think a better and more robust solution is given here: https://code.ros.org/trac/ros-pkg/ticket/5511
