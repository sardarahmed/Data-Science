Q:

Stiffness of a leg link

I'm trying to simulate a rhex-robot that has this kind of legs:
My question is how can I set (in the urdf file) the stiffnes of the leg_link.  I know how to set kp and kd (contact stiffness and damping parametres), but they are referred to a JOINT, and I want set the stiffness of a specific LINK. I've been able to simulate the robot, but the legs behave as if they were rigid. I would like them to behave like this:

(when the leg touches the ground, the circunference "deforms")
How can I do that?

I know that with SDF you can set kp and kd for a link too. Maybe you can check this world as an example, more specifically model_5_soft_contact.

A:

We can't simulate a flexible link. You can approximate this leg using a series of links connected by hinge joints.
