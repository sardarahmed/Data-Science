Q:

Autoware Mission Planning, Client has wrong datatype version: datatype/md5sum

When I try to launch mission planning node for San Francisco data launch files, I end up getting this error:
Error: Client [/rivz_1563460306167327804] wants topic /local_trajectories to have datatype/md5sum [visualization_msgs/MarkerArray/d155b9ce5188fbaf89745847fd5882d7], but our version has [autoware_msgs/LaneArray/23abb100bdfa4ee58530bb628c974c2a]. Dropping connection.

Does anybody know what the problem is?
Thank you

A:

It means they were compiled with different versions of the message files. When the message files are compiled they make a MD5 hash in case those message definitions change to make sure they're able to be decoded correctly by the receiver. You need to have both programs using the right set of definitions installed.
Edit: More info, sorry I scanned over the types and missed the fact they are literally different messages.
Ok, so what you're trying to do here is expose a topic of type autoware_msgs/LaneArray on the topic /local_trajectories. You've created the data vis plugin for local_trajectories to have type MarkerArray, which is not LaneArray. Your issue is that you have the wrong messages being broadcast on that topic. You need to create the correct plugin visualization to see the LaneArray (does autoware provide?)

Thanks for the quick response!
Would you mind giving me some insight into the steps involved to do this?

See update in answer, you're publishing the wrong message type on that topic to be visualized as a MarkerArray.
