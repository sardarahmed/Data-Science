Q:

Turtlebot, is it open source hardware?

Is the Turtlebot open source hardware ? Or, can I get into serious legal mess if I tinker with the design ? What sort of license is there for the Turtlebot ?
UPDATE
@Ryan I am using this logo for my robot ! :-)

LOL !!! ... well ! ... it is too late to make amends now .... ;-) Jokes apart, I was looking for an amicable translation of the word turtle (for obvious reasons) I went to 'Tortuga' which is Spanish, but the French had a nice sing to it ! To-r-tu-e ! .... 'Kachuabot' would seem rather Desi ! ;-)
