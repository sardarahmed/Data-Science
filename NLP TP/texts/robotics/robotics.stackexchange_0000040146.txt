Q:

Is rxplot no longer rosrun-able in Fuerte?

In Electric and earlier it was possible to do
rosrun rxtools rxplot

.. more importantly, this means that in launch files I could do
<node pkg="rxtools" type="rxplot" name="my_plot" args="/some/topic" />

and so on. It looks like this is no longer possible in Fuerte; only rxconsole and rxloggerlevel seem to be rosrun-able now.
So is this intentional? If not I'll file a ticket. If so could someone suggest a workaround to allow rxplot to be launched from a launch file?

Looks like a bug to me.
There seem to be several problems with the rx stack in Fuerte. Please file a ticket, I hope we can get them fixed quickly.
