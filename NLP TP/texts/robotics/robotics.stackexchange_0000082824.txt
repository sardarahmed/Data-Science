A:

You can follow along with this tutorial: http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Arduino%20IDE%20Setup. Make sure to install your sketch into the <sketchbook>/libraries folder using
ros rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py <sketchbook>/libraries/

where <sketchbook> is the path to your sketchbook.

I did it @jayess but ı got such an error : `
make_libraries.py generates the Arduino rosserial library files.  It
requires the location of your Arduino sketchbook/libraries folder.
rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py <output_path>
`
