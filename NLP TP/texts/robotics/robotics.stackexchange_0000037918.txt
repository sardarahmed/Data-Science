Q:

Unable to locate package ros-cturtle-pr2

Dear All.
While I try to develop the demo of following website, I meet a problem in the first step.
http://www.ros.org/wiki/pr2_simulator/Tutorials/SimpleGraspingDemo
sudo apt-get install ros-cturtle-pr2all
Then I got the following information:
administrator@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install ros-cturtle-pr2
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-cturtle-pr2
I am using ubuntu 11.04.64 bit electric ros.
I install the
sudo apt-get install ros-electric-pr2-desktop
and
sudo apt-get install ros-electric-desktop-full
That is no problem.
IS there some change of the package?
How to develop this demo in PR2 simulator?
Best regards.
Zhenli

Hi,
I don't think there is a "pr2all" package in electric. "ros-cturtle-pr2all" means you are looking for a cturtle package but actually you are using electric.
Maybe you can try installing the ros-electric-pr2-tabletop-manipulation-apps package and follow these tutorials: http://www.ros.org/wiki/pr2_pick_and_place.
Best,
Juergen
