Q:

Rotate camera display to show x+ axis instead of z+

Hi everyone,
I have a standard camera display with a calibrated camera info file and it's displaying everything correctly, but instead of looking up the z-axis I would like to look into the direction of the positive x-axis.
My guess would be to create an extra frame (like this?) and rotate it or something like that?
Does anyone have any pointers for me? Thanks a lot!

Are you doing this to be compatible with the look_at_pose package?
Do you mean, you have a robot model and you want to rotate the camera in the robot model? Or, you want to change the frame that the camera data gets reported in?

A:

You could broadcast a tf from C++ (or python), but it's easier to use a static_transform_publisher http://wiki.ros.org/tf#static_transform_publisher
For your transform xyz would be 0 0 0, and then 0 1.570796 0 for yaw pitch roll (or play with the numbers until it comes out right).
