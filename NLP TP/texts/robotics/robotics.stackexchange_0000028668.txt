Q:

Real Time Timer stops after using world_control message

C:\fakepath\img.png I am using ~/world_control for controlling simulation using multi_sim_step.
I used world_msg.set_multi_step(1000) to set sim time. As soon as I set this, SimTime is updating but RealTime don't change in Gazebo

A:

I realize this can be confusing, but the real time indicator shows the wall time elapsed while the simulation was playing. However, when you're stepping the simulation, it is technically paused (note how you can see the play button). That's why real time is not elapsing and the real time factor is zero.

Thanks. Is there any way to step simulation without affecting real time factor and real time using transport api? or we can't do this while Gazebo stepping?

I think you should be able to keep track of wall time inside your program/plugin that's doing the stepping.

Sure. Thanks.
