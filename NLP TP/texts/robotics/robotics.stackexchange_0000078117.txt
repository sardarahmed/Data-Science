Q:

I cannot convert xacro file to urdf

Hello,
I have an issue about broadcasting some links at tf for which I have asked here. Someone commented that he solved my issue from converting the xacro file to a urdf one. How can I do that?
I have searched for the issue in questions like here and here and when I type:
rosrun xacro xacro.py rover_ws/src/labrob/labrob_description/urdf/labrob.urdf

or
rosrun xacro xacro.py 'rover_ws/src/labrob/labrob_description/urdf/labrob.urdf'

I get an error like the following:
xacro: Traditional processing is deprecated. Switch to --inorder processing!
To check for compatibility of your document, use option --check-order.
For more infos, see http://wiki.ros.org/xacro#Processing_Order
No such file or directory: rover_ws/src/labrob/labrob_description/urdf/labrob.urdf
XacroException('No such file or directory: rover_ws/src/labrob/labrob_description/urdf/labrob.urdf',)

The directory is the correct one I am writting here, I don't know what I am doing wrong.
Could you please help me?
Thanks for your answers and time in advance,
Chris
PS: I am in ROS Kinetic

Thank you the command worked with the absolute path...if you would like add this as an answer to accept it...Your suggestion at my other question didn't work though with the converted urdf...I still get a wrong tree.
