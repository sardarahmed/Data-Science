I have a turtlebot which has a create base. I did not do any calibration for my bot as mentioned in the link..

Can you tell me how to built your map without using calibration ? as my irobot create dosen't contain this part http://store.iheartengineering.com/ihe-0200-0000-fa00.html

@shade:- you bought the full turtle bot with (power/sensor gyro board )..or only icreate robot ?

Since u dont have the gyroscope sensor, wat exact set of readings are you missing??

A:

Considering the comments I guess by "without calibration" you mean to say that you don't have an IMU?
In that case, try hector_mapping. It doesn't require odometry and might work for you.

@dornhege :  Does that technique works without "board/sensor gyro board".. can perform mapping task with the normal icreate robot base ?
Comment by dornhege on 2013-02-01:
Yes, it doesn't require odometry in principle. Just a laser or similar. How good it works only with a kinect and thus very limited data is another question.
