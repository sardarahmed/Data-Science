Q:

Imu data about xsens_driver

when i got the sensor_msgs::Imu data by adding listener to the topic, but before i use the imu data, how could i judge the imu.linear_acceleration or imu.angular_velocity is valid or available. i saw the imu.linear_acceleration.x default value is -1f, so it dosen't have a easy way(or flag) to judge if i could use the data,  right ?

A:

-1 means invalid. See the documentation here: http://docs.ros.org/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/Imu.html

I mean it's a float or double, so i can't judge if it's invalid by "==", is there a common way, like imu.isValid or imu.linear_acceleration.isValid. Thanks.
BTW, linear_acceleration.x, y, z could be -1f, not defualt.
