Q:

Is there any docker containers for ROS?

Is there any docker containers for ROS? I googled but didn't find anything.
If there is no containers what is the best way to start building one and share with you guys?
Thanks!

Its not that hard to set up ROS in a docker container. The problem is that it doesn't work very well, due to networking issues: ROS and Docker clash over how they want to do networking. A long, detailed analysis is here: https://github.com/opencog/docker/tree/master/indigo  (about half-way down).

I've made a basic Dockerfile which installs ROS hydro on top of the ubuntu precise image:

You can remove the vnc stuff if you don't want to be able to see GUI apps. I'm still working out how to handle networking, for instance exposing the right ports for ROS publishers.

So... have you been successful figuring out how to expose the dynamic node ports?
