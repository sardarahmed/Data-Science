Q:

PR2 base controller algorithm

Hi!
I am using the PR2 base controller algorithm for another robotic platform. So far, the algorithm works perfectly for me, but I would like to know whether there is any documentation about how it works, how it calculates wheel angles and velocities and whether it can be used for an arbitrary number of wheels.
Thanks in advance!

Hi Gazkune,
This is very interesting! Could you please send me a pointer to some movies of your platform. I can put together a brief technical report for you on how everything works on the PR2 but it won't be until a couple of weeks at the earliest if that's ok with you.
