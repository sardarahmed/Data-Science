Q:

c++ Library for trajectory correction

I have a trajectory of a quadcopter in 3D. Out of all the poses in the trajectory, I want to correct one of the poses. I then want to adapt the rest of the poses based on the newly corrected pose. I understand that this is a common problem in robotics and there would be a number of solutions. I want a tried and tested c++ library that does this as I want to integrate this feature in my system but not spend time on building it myself. What are the possible c++ libraries I can use?  

A:

You can use ceres-solver library which is nonlinear optimization framework implemented for problems like pose optimization and/or bundle adjustment. It supports ICP , bundle adjustment , pose graph optimization and other techniques which is relative to your problem. I think you should glance at it first.
