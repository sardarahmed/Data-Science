Q:

Rospack failed to build

Hi,
I am trying to make a system-wide installation in OpenSUSE to be used by different users. As such I have installed ROS in /opt/ros. I managed to install ROS with no problems and even compiled some additional packages in the system-wide installation.
I was now trying to compile some user packages in the user home folder. I did the following:

Created a folder "mystacks" in the user folder;
Used roscreate-pkg to create the package in a folder inside the "mystacks" folder;
Added "mystacks" full path to ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.

The problem now is that when I run rosmake with my package name I get "Rospack failed to build". Even running "rosmake --help" results in the same error!
Since I am building this package in the user folder, it should not be a permissions problem, and ROS does not have a problem finding the package. Any ideas?
Thanks in advanced,
Hugo Costelha

A:

It can be a permissions problem.
rosmake will recursively build dependencies and thus also go into the /opt/ros directory for building.
If you have packages prebuilt there manually that you know are built properly, you can touch ROS_NOBUILD to prevent compilation.

Ok. I have been taking a look at the Ubuntu packages, and see that there is a ROS_NOBUILD in every package folder in order to prevent just that. I see also that I can simply run make, which will not make any dependecies (don't know if there are other implications in running make instead of rosmake)
