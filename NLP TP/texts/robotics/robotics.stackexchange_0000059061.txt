Q:

Issue with running gscam node

Hi,
I have ROS Hydro, I am trying to run gscam node, I have exported the GSCAM_CONFIG but upon running the gscam node I get this error, which seems to be a linking error but I don't know how to resolve it.
rosrun gscam gscam

/opt/ros/hydro/lib/gscam/gscam: symbol lookup error: /opt/ros/hydro/lib/libgscam.so: undefined symbol: _ZN3ros7console5printEPNS0_10FilterBaseEPvNS0_6levels5LevelERKSt18basic_stringstreamIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEPKciSE_

Any idea how can I fix it.
Thanks.

A:

That looks like one of the ABI problems that's still lurking in ROS when package versions aren't aligned properly.
Try upgrading to all of the latest packages by running:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
