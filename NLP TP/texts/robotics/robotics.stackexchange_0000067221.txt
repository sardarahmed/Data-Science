A:

That package has not been released in Indigo. I first checked this by running apt-cache search barrett-hand and saw no results. Then I navigated to this link: http://www.ros.org/debbuild/indigo.html?q=barret_hand and verified that it has not been built for Indigo. As a side note, it is available on Hydro: http://www.ros.org/debbuild/hydro.html?q=barrett_hand
This means you need to install the package from source. Clone the repository to your workspace's src/ directory, and then run catkin_make in the root of your workspace to try and build the package. According to the package's documentation, you also need to have the pcan_python package installed.

I think you've already created a workspace, if not, see this. Then download the package:link text. and expand it to :~/catkin_ws/src, then: $ cd catkin_ws; $ catkin_make.

but I find that this package has no indigo level...

I'm guessing it will build fine on the hydro branch.

[bhand_controller.launch] is neither a launch file in package [bhand_controller] nor is [bhand_controller] a launch file name

Are you sure that you have properly sourced the workspace that the barrett-hand package was built in?

oh! i didn't. thanks it's working now.
And, i have another doubt, Can i control the barrett hand by writing a python script and move it to the position i give in the python script?
