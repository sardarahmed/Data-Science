A:

I would recommend reviewing tickets on the repository: https://github.com/hakuturu583/gps_rviz_plugin/issues and if you can't find one related to your situation open one there. It could be that there needs to be better documentation, or you could be hitting a bug.
That repository looks to have been last updated 5 years ago, and things many have changed in that time that needs updates.

Thank you for your appropriate response.
And sorry for the delay in replying.
I was able to solve this issue.
I left out sending base station information to Ubuntu.
./str2str -in ntrip://rtk2go.com:2101/[MountPoint] -out serial://ttyACM0:230400

However, I get a lot of other errors.
If you know of a solution, we would appreciate it if you could answer our questions as well.
