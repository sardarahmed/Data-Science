Q:

"ImportError: No module named deserialize" when launching ur5_bringup.launch

When I attempt to run the command roslaunch ur_bringup ur5_bringup.launch robot_ip:=172.22.22.2, I get the following output:
... logging to /home/rkeatin3/.ros/log/5d470f28-5de0-11e4-aa81-fc4dd43d9838/roslaunch-dscl-rosstation-02-13666.log

I've been unable to find any posts with the same answer. I checked the roslaunch log file, but it doesn't have any more useful information. Any ideas?
Edit: I'm using hydro, installed from debs.

ROS version, driver version, from source, from debs, etc (I know some of it is visible in your console copy/paste, but still).
Comment by rkeatin3 on 2014-10-27:
I'm not sure what you mean by driver version, but all of my packages should be up-to-date.

A:

I can't give you any solution right now, but I've created an issue at the universal_robot repository. See universal_robot/issues/134.

Edit: just proxying for the Github issue:
this is a known issue with the currently released (v1.0.3) Hydro debs and will be fixed in the next release. The hydro-devel branch already contains the fix, so if you build the universal_robot repository from source, things should start working again for you.
Alternatively, you could temporarily add the ur_driver directory to your $PYTHONPATH:
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/opt/ros/hydro/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ur_driver/

after sourcing your setup.bash (don't forget to remove this once fixed debs have been released).
