Q:

rosserial_arduino with arduino IDE 0022

I have a arduIMU v3 and strictly have to use arduino IDE 0023 and below.
When I tried to compile the rosserial_arduino example for HelloWorld using the Arduino IDE 0022, the following error occur:
In file included from /home/user/sketchbook/libraries/ros_lib/ros.h:39:0,
from HelloWorld.cpp:6:
/home/user/sketchbook/libraries/ros_lib/ArduinoHardware.h:41:38: fatal error: Wprogram.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.
I have check that Wprogram.h is in my /usr/share/arduino/hardware/arduino/cores/arduino
I am not sure whats the problem, will appreciate the help.

A:

Just realize is the cap case different.
For those using Arduino IDE 0023 and below please take note:
Edit the ArduinoHardware.h header file supplied with the ros_lib,
change
#include "Wprogram.h"
to
#include "WProgram.h"
