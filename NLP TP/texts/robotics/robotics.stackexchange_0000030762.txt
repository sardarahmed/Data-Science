Q:

Ladybug Camera Driver

Is there a Point Grey Ladybug camera around?
I am aware that the "pan" command from the IEEE1394 protocol can be used to access the individual cameras but when moving at high velocities there will be a large displacement between the images grabbed. It is necessary to command the camera to grab all the images first before transferring them.

I am using the Camera1394 driver for Ladybug camera. How are you changing the pan for different frames runtime

A:

I am not aware of any reports of using the Ladybug with camera1394. It is not included in the list of cameras tested.
That driver currently does not support the IIDC Pan feature. A patch to support it should be simple, and could be officially supported in the next release, if you need it.

according to the commit log in the camera1394 stack, this was added recently. Also someone called jep says he tested it on ladybug3 (which is what I have). I'd really like to get in touch with him. Also joq it'd be great if you could give a more updated answer to the question. thanks

For the record: after discussion it appears that the Ladybug 3 differs too much from the IIDC standard ton include in the basic 1394 driver. Brice is developing a device specific fork to handle that device. https://github.com/ros-drivers/camera1394/issues/17 is the issue.
