See also "/home/jeff/dev/myros1/build/CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log".
See also "/home/jeff/dev/myros1/build/CMakeFiles/CMakeError.log".
Invoking "cmake" failed

A:

The lines,
<build_depend>roscpp</build_depend>
<run_depend>roscpp</run_depend>

belong in the package.xml file. The way you include roscpp in your CMakeLists.txt file is with the following:
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
  roscpp
)

Look at the ROS wiki pages on CMakeLists.txt and package.xml for more guidelines.
If you still need more help it would be useful to post your CMakeLists.txt and package.xml files so that we can see what is wrong with them.

this is my txt:
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)
project(exam1)
Find catkin macros and libraries
##if COMPONENTS list like
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS roscpp)
is used, also find other catkin packages
##find_package(catkin REQUIRED)
System dependencies are found with CMak

Did you also remove the lines <build_depend>roscpp</build_depend> and <run_depend>roscpp</run_depend> from CMakeLists.txt, and put them in package.xml?
