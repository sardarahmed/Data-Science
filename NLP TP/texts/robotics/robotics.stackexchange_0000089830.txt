I think you should try to get the dependencies and compiling the drivers as mentioned in this tutorial first. and also try
$ rosmake camera_calibration
before running the camera calibration node

A:

It seems the page you referring to has a typo. The node is actually called cameracalibrator.py. Also you added spaces in the ROS parameter assignment and the topic namespace, so pay attention.
The command should be:
rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --size 8x6 --square 0.025 image:=/image_raw

The easiest way to avoid such problems is to type in everything yourself (do not copy/paste) and use bash-completion by pressing Tab. ROS command-line tools have pretty good completion support for most of parameters. In case of rosrun the completion is very helpful for package names (first parameter) and node names (second parameter); note, however, to make this to work for your own nodes the script should be actually marked as executable on the file system with, e.g. chmod a+x <script name>

From a quick glance the command used on the link you've provided is also wrong: again there are spaces where they shouldn't be. Make sure that parameter assignment has no spaces, i.e. exactly like this image:=/image_raw. Also make sure that the topic exists with rostopic info /image_raw
