Q:

Can't launch Gazebo

Hi!
I just finished installing ros full desktop package and gazebo but when I run gazebo in terminal it simply doesn't launch. I'm going crazy since I can't find anyone else with this problem. I'm running it on a desktop with dedicated graphics. Does anyone have an idea of how to solve the problem?
Thanks!
EDIT: I'm using jade and gazebo5, btw
EDIT2: When I run gazebo --verbose it gives me:

EDIT3: I noticed I have several gazebos in /usr/share folder. Gazebo3 and Gazebo5.4 and when I run this command:
export GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH=/usr/share/gazebo-5.0:/usr/share/gazebo_models:${GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH}

I am able to run gazebo but I have to do it every single time I open the terminal. Is there any way to make it permanent?

A:

To make that permanent you could add it to the bottom of your .bashrc file in your home folder (gedit ~/.bashrc). Everything in that file is ran when you open a new terminal.
