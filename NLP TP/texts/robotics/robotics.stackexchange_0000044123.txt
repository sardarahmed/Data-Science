Q:

roomba package for irobot create , compatible or not?

Hi,
I have installed ROS and studying the tutorials now. I have a Roomba from 4 o 5 years ago and it is the first generation roomba, probabaly the 400 serie.
I am thinking of  trying some roomba related stacks/package. I found this
http://www.ros.org/wiki/Robots/Roomba
which seems the best choice for my purpose.
It seems this package is for the roomba 500 series. I am not sure if it works with my old roomba 400 series. Also I have iRobot create from 3 years ago. Will this roomba package works for Create as well.
Anyone has first hand experience using the abovementioned Roomba package?
Thank you
Jack

A:

Well, I´m trying to do the same, I´ve a Roomba Discovery, Arduino Mega, HS-SR04 x 4 and an XBOX360 Kinect. Putting tougher the hardware on top of a netboox Eee 1005PE running with Ubuntu 64bit with tourltebot 1 ROS (I hope).
The idea is to use ROS for images / audio  navigation processing, well experiment a little on what is possible to do.. the hardware would work as following:

The roomba is interface via SCI port, the Arduino will manage he ultrasonic sensors that perform better then laser sensors on dark rooms.
Kinect stack for Audio / Video.
Idea is to combine both above for the navigation stack.

if will pass the phase one here describe.. and it is a little difficult.. will post the results.. The first problem I´ve is that I don´t like to run ubuntu on virtual box on my mac.. I would use the mac to develop / modify the nodes but so far no big progress.
I´ll keep you inform and maybe, if somebody else will replay to this discussion would be nice.
Regards,
Sandro
