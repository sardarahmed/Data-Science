Q:

simulator for a cartesian(gantry) robot

I wanna simulate a cartesian(gantry) robot in a simulator and solve the forward and reverse kinematics.  Is it possible with Gazebo or MOVEIT? which one and how? Or if you suggest any free software
thanks in advance

A:

Yes, obviously a cartesian robot can be simulated in Gazebo.
Typically, a cartesian gantry robot has translational motion axes that are parallel to the cartesian reference frame axes, so both the forward as well as  the inverse kinematics is trivial.
So if you want more specific answers, you will need to ask more specific questions.
