Q:

Ubuntu 16.04 Ros Kinect Installation Unmet Dependencies

I tried literally every solution found on this website and beyond - no luck. Whatever I did, the installation just wouldn't work. Running this:
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-desktop-full

always and always results with:
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 ros-kinetic-desktop-full : Depends: ros-kinetic-desktop but it is not going to be installed
                            Depends: ros-kinetic-perception but it is not going to be installed
                            Depends: ros-kinetic-simulators but it is not going to be installed
                            Depends: ros-kinetic-urdf-tutorial but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

Before someone tells:

Ubuntu repositories of mine do include all three which you think of. I tried other countries' repositories as well, no luck.
Installing qt binding also did not work. I did remove qt5 library and I am still unable to install ROS.

Any thoughts?

EDIT2: Even after removing the package which caused the mess, I still cannot install ROS with the standard command. I did do aptitude and this is the output:

I had to remove universe one since it caused the priority (500 vs 1000) issue with the python-catkin-pkg. Apart from that all others are checked on the Ubuntu Software Center.
As for the cat /etc/apt/preferences.d, I have only one file called allow-downgrade with the following content:
Package: *
Pin: release o=Ubuntu
Pin-Priority: 1001

A:

At least for python-catkin-pkg and python-catkin-pkg-modules it turned out that the OP had a allow-downgrade file in /etc/apt/preferences.d/ that pinned the priority of all Ubuntu repositories (ie: official ones) to 1001.
As python-catkin-pkg is also provided by the Ubuntu repositories (via Debian and the UpstreamPackages), the higher priority of the Ubuntu repositories caused apt to only want to install the 0.2.10-2 version and not the most recent one (at this point in time: 0.4.8-100).
Removing the allow-downgrade file at least resolved the python-catkin-pkg problem, but additional issues with apt then popped up.

Yes. I'd like to also add that it's still unclear at this point what actually causes the problem, but one should acknowledge that it is clearly not a ROS problem, rather an Ubuntu problem. Thank you for effort again.
