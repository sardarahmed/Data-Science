Q:

Is there any way using ros canopen with JointTrajectoryController by profile position mode

I try to control my motor using canopen by JointTrajectoryController, but my motor driver do not support interpolate position mode, Please some one help me to figured out if I can use profiled position mode with PID loop? Thanks very much.

A:

The profiled position mode (as implrmented in canopen_402) will not work properly with the joint_trajectory_controller. The PP mode uses one set-point which has to get acknowledged and is not meant for trajectories.
However, you can just try it for your drive. There is no need to setup a PID controlller.
