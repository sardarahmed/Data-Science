Do you want to have this application or do you want to make that? Because most/all of this functionality already exists in ROS.

Are you aware that rqt lets you loading plugins into one rqt instance?

Thank you , I have awared this just now , but I also would like to know : are there some plugins in rqt that could get the laser scanning map and display it in real-time ? (not rviz) So can you give me some advise?

A:

In addition to @dornhege's comment, you can also create your own rqt plugin by reusing existing rqt plugins. This QA might be of your help.
For laser, it depends on how you want to visualize laser input. RViz has LaserScan FYI.
