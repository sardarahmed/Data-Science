Q:

remove gazebo2 and install gazebo7 for ros indigo

I have installed Indigo: host gazebo version 2.x package before.
Now I want to change gazebo2 to gazebo7, do I need to remove the gazebo2 and all the gazebo2 package related first, and then follow the official install tutorial?
If so, how to remove them cleanly, correctly and safely?
By the way, I also wonder if gazebo7 and ros-gazebo7 package installed, will any code which run on ros-gazebo2 run well on ros-gazebo7 as well?

A:

Yew, you have to remove gazebo2 first. Use this command: $ sudo apt-get remove gazebo2*.
And then you follow the official tutorial. The easiest way is using the official script, which I put in my own repository and you are free to download.
And then if you want to integrate ROS and Gazebo well, then you are recommended to install ros-gazebo package using the following command: $ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-gazebo7-ros-pkgs. Since there are some API modifications, chances are that you have to modify some functions in order to be compatible with Gazebo 7 if it was used in Gazebo 2 initially.

When I try to remove gazebo*, apt-get ask me to remove ros-kinetic-desktop-full, which I want to keep. How do you change the flag that enforces that removal ?
