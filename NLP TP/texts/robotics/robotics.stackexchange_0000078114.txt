Q:

How to use an USB-hokuyo-laserscanner in ros-kinetic

How do I use a USB-hokuyo-laserscanner in ros-kinetic? hokuyo_node seems to be working and pretty well documented (since I'm a beginner using ros, that's important for me, too), but it isn't supported for kinetic. urg_node, since it's the newer driver, should also do the job, but I've got no idea on how to use the USB and not an ethernet interface. Is it even possible?
Any suggestions and help setting up (in a ros-beginner-friendly way) would be great.
Thanks in advance.

A:

I just got the answer myself.
First I cloned hokuyo_node (git) into ~/catkin_ws/src. Afterwards I called catkin_make which resulted in telling me, that the driver_common package (git) is missing. Cloning this one, too, and I could run catkin_make successfully.
After sourcing ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash again, I was able to call rosrun hokuyo_node hokuyo_node.
