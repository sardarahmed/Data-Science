Q:

rosserial_arduino IDE error

I install ros_lib into the arduino environment. When I try compile HellowWorld, I have error:
 In file included from /home/tuuzdu/sketchbook/libraries/ros_lib/ros/node_handle.h:38:0,
                     from /home/tuuzdu/sketchbook/libraries/ros_lib/ros.h:38,
                     from HelloWorld.pde:6:
    /opt/ros/hydro/include/std_msgs/Time.h:42:18: fatal error: string: No such file or directory
    compilation terminated.

File /opt/ros/hydro/include/std_msgs/Time.h exists.

Did your rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py call run without errors/warnings? Does Time.h exist somewhere in a subfolder of your /home/tuuzdu/sketchbook/libraries/ros_lib/?

I have this problem on 64bit machine and I have not problem on 32bit machine. Both machines with Ubuntu 13.04 and ROS Hydro. On 32bit make_libraries.py creates headers in ros_lib folder: std_msgs, rosserial_msgs and others.But on 64bit not! I try copy header primary-to-secondary, but it hasnt effect

A:

Perhaps ROS is not in the path of the utility you are using... But the error seems to be pointing to the following segment of Time.h:
#ifndef STD_MSGS_MESSAGE_TIME_H
#define STD_MSGS_MESSAGE_TIME_H

#include <string> //This line here is line 42
#include <vector>
#include <map>

#include <ros/types.h>
#include <ros/serialization.h>
#include <ros/builtin_message_traits.h>
#include <ros/message_operations.h>

So I'd say it's got to do with rosserial's PATH. Unfortunately, I'm not an expert on this... I've used it only slightly. If you are launching from the system, try launching from a terminal. Perhaps this is like the issue with QtCreator... You can only use it in a terminal in order to get the right paths linked. Please note that this is simply speculation, though...
Keep us posted! This could definitely be helpful for others in the future.

Yes, I launch Arduino IDE from terminal with all necessary environment variables. Please see comment above.
