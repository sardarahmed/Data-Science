Q:

Using TF to detect user

I am trying to use the TF transforms from Openni_tracker to detect the presence of a person. I want to perform an action when a "user" is detected.
Is this possible - I'm aware that openni_tracker publishes "New User" and "Pose Psi" detected but this isn't published to a topic so I'm not sure if it is possible to do.

A:

openni_tracker publishes only the the set of transforms for the skeleton joints for each tracked users.
You can look for all or one of these (i.e. head_1 or head_2).
However, you can also modify the code in order to add a topic for the "New User", but, as far as I understood, when the program says "New user detected", you do not have the tracked skeleton necessarily.
