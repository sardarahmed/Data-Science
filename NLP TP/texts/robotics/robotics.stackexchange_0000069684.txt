Q:

Control loop missed its desired rate

I tried to run move_base navigation to a goal on Odroid C1+ board.
But the result is bad, the robot didn't move smoothly.
Here is the result screen recording:

And this is my move_base parameter files:
https://github.com/wennycooper/learning_nav/tree/master/config/fake
The strange thing is, if I run the same code on my desktop PC. The result is pretty smooth.
I found the difference is, on my PC, the control loop frequency can reach to 2.5Hz as specified, but it can only reach to ~2.2Hz on Odroid C1+.  I even tried the same test on Raspberry Pi 2, the result is even worse...
Any idea to make it better??

I also tried XU3, the control loop rate can reach >=3 and the result is much better.

A:

The problem is with the cpu and the processing power. As @makokal said I do not think it is related with move_base.
Maybe you should try lowering the costmap resolution, and/or costmap sizes etc. Therefore your navigation stack will require less processing power and memory. However your navigation performance may degrade as a result.

Thanks for your reply. I tried modify the (both global & local) costmap resolution to 1.0 and local map width x height to 1.0x1.0.  The control rate did slightly increased to 2.45... but it's still not good enough. Any more recommendation??

You may try increasing sim_time, sim_granularity and angular_sim_granularity a bit.

BTW, I found the system is not very busy in overall. It's a quad-cores CPU and only one core is almost 100% when running move_base.

Yes, I tried increasing sim_time=1, sim_granularity=0.5 and angular_sim_granularity=0.5, the result is still not god.  Now I'm afraid that Odroid C1+ is just not powerful enough for move_base....
