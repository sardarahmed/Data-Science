Q:

Finding your colcon built workspace's lib path using ros2

Hi,
I was wondering if there was an equivalent to ```catkin_find --lib --include`` in ros2.
I need this information to create a non ros package that includes ros publishers and subscribers.
Currently, I am using a workaround which is to use ros2 pkg prefix foo to find the messages created by the workspace and then move my way up the folders using ../.
I was wondering if there was a better way of doing this.
Also, if it is not to much trouble, cmake_ament no longer uses pkg-config to find packages.
How can I add my workspace's libraries to the CMakelist? This is for the case of custom msgs and services.

Why do you have to move up in this case?
The command will return the install prefix of the package foo. All files installed by that package will be in subdirectories, e.g. bin, include, lib, share.
If you need pkg-config like results you can invoke cmake --find-package ... to get information about include directories, libraries etc. (see Find-Package Tool Mode).

Thank you very much for your response.

This was just a mistake on my part.
As you mentioned the include, lib. and shared could be found by using the prefix command.
I will try using the suggested cmake --find-package  command. Thank you again
