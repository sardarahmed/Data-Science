Q:

What's the differences between the packages openni_camera and openni_launch?

There are 2 launch files kinect_frames.launch and openni_node.launch and 1 node openni_node in the openni_camera package.
And for openi_launch package, there are several launch files
depth.launch             device.launch            kinect_frames.launch     rgb.launch               
depth_registered.launch  ir.launch                openni.launch  

and no nodes.
I'm wondering the differences between openni_camera/openni_node.launch and openni_launch/openni.launch.
And what are the other launch files such as depth.launch and device.launch in openni_launch package for? How do I use them?
Thanks for answering.

A:

openni_camera contains the driver for the OpenNI devices. The functionality is broken up into nodelets, individually responsible for publishing and processing various pieces of data.
openni_launch is just a convenience package, providing launch files for the openni_camera nodelets.
There are two high-level launch files.

openni.launch brings up all the launch files for the nodelets.
openni_node.launch brings up the system in a node instead of nodelets.

The rest of the launch files are just building blocks - you can use them to bring up the system in a distributed manner, or if you're only interested in partial data.
