Q:

ROS_PACKAGE_PATH problems

Hello friends.
I downloaded a folder with some rosbuild type packages.
I'm trying to build the packages, but for that I needed to use the following command:
 export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/paulo/Workspace

I then made rosmake name_of_package name_of_package and I built all of my downloaded packages.
They all build without any errors, what is good. But the problem is the following.
When I try to use roslaunch, ros tells me it can't locate roslaunch. Gives the following error:
Invalid <param> tag: Cannot load command parameter [rosversion]: command [rosversion roslaunch] returned with code [1]. 

Param xml is <param command="rosversion roslaunch" name="rosversion"/>

If I do the source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash I can use roslaunch again or it finds the roslaunch pack if I use rospack find roslaunch but it forgets about the packages I built.
Anyone knows how I can solve this problem? Like how I can built the packages and keep roslaunch and the rest of ros working?
Thx so much!
p.s.:If you are curious about the folder with packages I downloaded its the following.

A:

ROS_PACKAGE_PATH should include your ros_workspace as well as ROS system installed path.
Add this to your .bashrc file so that it executes on every terminal launch 
source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash 
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/paulo/ros_workspace:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
