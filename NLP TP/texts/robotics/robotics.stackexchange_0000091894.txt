Q:

Compiler warning (c++11): Zero as null pointer constant

Hi,
I'm using QTCreator with ROS Plugin and compilie my nodes with C++11 support. I get the following compiler warning when using e.g. ROS_DEBUG(). How can setup QTCreator to ignore this warning?
Warning: zero as null pointer constant
expanded from macro 'ROS_DEBUG'
expanded from macro 'ROS_LOG'
expanded from macro 'ROS_LOG_COND'
expanded from macro 'ROSCONSOLE_DEFINE_LOCATION'

In CMakeLists.txt:
add_compile_options(-std=c++11)

Related: ros-industrial/ros_qtc_plugin#321.

How can setup QTCreator to ignore this warning?

I'm not sure whether you can do this globally, but you can suppress it per-file with:
#pragma clang diagnostic ignored "-Wzero-as-null-pointer-constant"

That's not very nice though as it now ignores those for everything, not just the macros.

It would appear this has already been addressed in ros/rosconsole#14. That has changed everything to use nullptr instead of 0, but that has only been released into Melodic, not Kinetic afaict (part of 1.13.8, but Kinetic only has 1.12.14).
