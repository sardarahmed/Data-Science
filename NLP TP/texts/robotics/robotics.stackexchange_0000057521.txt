Can you edit your question and include exactly what code/commands you're using, what you expect to happen, and what is actually happening?

A:

Basically, in ROS it uses the cv_bridge for convert into image, and the opencv is the same as the normal opencv library ( maybe Opencv 2.4.6), you can use this link for the reference.
