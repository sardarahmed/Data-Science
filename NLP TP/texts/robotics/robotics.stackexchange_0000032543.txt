Q:

Sending Goal to action server fails

I am trying to send goals to the move_base action server, as per
 the ROS tutorial . My action server is the one created by  roslaunch move_base_amcl_2.5cm.launch  from the navigation_stage package.
I always get the server error "Failed to find a valid control". This is also the case no matter what launch file I use from the navigation_stage package. I desperately want  one single test case (no matter how simple) for which the base_local_planner is used to find the goal.
In addition, setting the initialpose from the command line hangs; the message is latched, but there is no effect in Stage.
FYI, my ros version is 1.2.4 and I use cturtle. As I have other packages working fine in this environment, I don't want to upgrade to diamondback and the newest nav stack unless there is no option.

A:

I resolved the problem by installing diamondback with Boost 1.40.0. The boost threads I had was causing multiple issues, including crashing stage-ros frequently. Thanks, Eitan.
