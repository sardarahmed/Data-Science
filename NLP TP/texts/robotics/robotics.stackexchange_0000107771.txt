Q:

Where can i find the code about move_group_interface.plan method?

I'm studying moveit.
A trajectory was created through a method called plan, but I couldn't find the process, so I asked a question.
thank you

A:

This should be in the MoveIt GitHub repository. More specifically, you can find it here in the move_group_interface.cpp file. In simple terms, this method prepares the action goal, sends the goal, and handles the result.
The function takes only a reference to the Plan object, and the process does not really tell you what is happening under the hood. For a deeper understanding of how the motion planning request is constructed, look into the constructMotionPlanRequest function too. You can find it here.
