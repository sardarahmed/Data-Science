Q:

pass arguments with called service

Hey,
in my code I call a service that calls another service
bool srvCallback_my_switcher(cob_srvs::Trigger::Request &req, cob_srvs::Trigger::Response &res)

{   
    if (client.call(srv))
    {
        srv.request;
        stuff..

    res.success.data = true;
    return true;
}

is there a possibility to call the service srv with an argument for example a bool variable?
I would like the called service to differ whether variable is true or false.
Kindly guide :))

A:

You should pass the variable you need by assign srv.request.[VariableName] = [true, false];, like you did in the response. Please also look at this tutorial:
http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingServiceClient%28c%2B%2B%29
beginner_tutorials::AddTwoInts srv;
srv.request.a = atoll(argv[1]);
...
client.call(srv)
