Q:

Debug output in different terminal windows

Hi,
I'm using ROS_DEBUG_NAMED with different names in my code. Do you know if it's possible to use the terminal to see only the output of a certain debug logger instead of using rxconsole?
I've a windows machine where I want to watch the output from different debug loggers by connecting to my work machine via SSH.
Thanks

A:

There is not a text console for viewing filtered rosconsole outputs.
