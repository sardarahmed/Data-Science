Q:

terminal starts with: bash: source/opt/ros/fuerte/setup.bash: No such file or directory

I have installed ubuntu 12.04 and ros fuerte version 1.8.10. When I type the command "rosversion ros", the terminal returns the version as 1.8.10.
But each time I start the terminal, it shows
"bash: source/opt/ros/fuerte/setup.bash: No such file or directory"
in the very first line. What is the problem ??? :\

A:

I guess you have a line
source/opt/ros/fuerte/setup.bash

somewhere at the end of your ~/.bashrc file. Note that there is a space missing after the source, i.e. the line should be:
source /opt/ros/fuerte/setup.bash

Open ~/.bashrc and fix the line.
