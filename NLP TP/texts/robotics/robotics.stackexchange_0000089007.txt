Q:

Modeling Tri-Track with URDF and Simulate it in Gazebo

Hi,
I'm trying to model a Triangular Tracked Wheels robot, which I'm building it physically. (Something similar to Wall-E character). What would be the preferred approach in doing so? I know how to model the sprockets and track's links (I already have the meshes), but how to combine them in one thread and simulate them in Gazebo, is puzzling me.

A:

The support for tracked vehicles has been merged to Gazebo 9 and 11. It works only in ODE. You can have a look at the usage here: https://github.com/osrf/gazebo/blob/gazebo11/worlds/tracked_vehicle_simple.world . Non-deformable tri-tracks should be no problem.
