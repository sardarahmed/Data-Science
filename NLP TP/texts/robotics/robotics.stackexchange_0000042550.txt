Q:

How to solve 'Error: cannot find SOCI header file: soci.h'?

I followed rein.
And I download rein:
  svn co https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/branches/trunk_diamondback/stacks/object_recognition/rein

I use ubuntu 12.04 with ROS fuerte.
And I found the same question and try the patch.
I success to patch it.
  patch -i rein_cmakelists2.patch

But it seems couldn't solve that problem.
