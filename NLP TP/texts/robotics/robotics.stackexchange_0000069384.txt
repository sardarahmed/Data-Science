A:

The rosdoc-lite package is a simple tool for automatically generating ROS wiki documentation.
It is not under active development. I don't expect we ever add all possible doxygen configuration options to it. But, you can submit pull requests to override specific customization options (see this example).
If you need complete control over all doxygen options and configuration, I recommend that you create your own doc pages directly.
