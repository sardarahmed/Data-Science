Q:

How do I start turtlebot_simulator correctly

Hi, I installed ROS via:

sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu oneiric main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
wget http://packages.ros.org/ros.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ros-electric-desktop-full
echo "source /opt/ros/electric/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
. ~/.bashrc

Then turtlebot via

sudo apt-get install ssh ros-electric-turtlebot-robot

However when I run the turtlebot simulator via:

roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_empty_world.launch

I get

[turtlebot_gazebo] is not a package or launch file name

Any ideas?

A:

The turtlebot-robot debian doesn't include the turtlebot_simulator package to install this package:
sudo apt-get install ros-electric-turtlebot-simulator-desktop
