Q:

C++ node to change dynamic reconfigure parameters

Hello,
I am using the turtlebot navigation move_base packages for my work and I would like to know if it's possible to change the planner parameters through a CPP API such as the max, min velocity and acceleration on the fly. I know move_base uses the dynamic reconfigure server, how can those parameters be accessed through a cpp program, for instance?
Thanks,
Sai
