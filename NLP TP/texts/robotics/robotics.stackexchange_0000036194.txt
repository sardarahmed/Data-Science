PCL Harris Keypoints

Is there a sort of supported way to use PCL's spiffy new HarrisKeypoint3D keypoints with ROS?

perception_pcl_unstable appears to be too old to have the harris keypoints.

A:

You can check out perception_pcl_unstable and modify it to use the latest trunk release. (at your own risk) Comment out the revision line in Makefile and adjust the manifest to pcl-1.4
