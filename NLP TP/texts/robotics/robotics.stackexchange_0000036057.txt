Q:

bus error on armv7l

Hello all,
I'm trying to run the a modified version of asctec_autopilot on a gumstix overo tide (armv7l). Running the nodes is not a problem. But when I try do launch nodelets I get bus errors (http://pastebin.com/MXe6bAUB).
Is this somehow related to https://code.ros.org/trac/ros/ticket/2883 and can I solve this by applying that patch? Or is there a fault on my side?
Thanks in advance

A:

There's a thread that might be related http://code.ros.org/lurker/thread/20121128.193914.99c8dd91.en.html#i20121128.193914.99c8dd91
That ticket also does look relevant.
