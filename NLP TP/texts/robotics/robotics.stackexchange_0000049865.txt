Q:

when will move_base_msgs be catkinized?

In my catkin package ,if I import "move_base_msgs",
then "ImportError:No module named move_base_msgs".
I know it is because it has not be catkinized,so I want to know when it will be completed.
My catkin is thirsty for this module.

A:

The navigation stack is not yet catkinized. Do you have a package that depends on just the messages, but not the rest of that stack? I don't see any current catkin work in that repository: https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation

For future readers: note that this question was posted back in 2013. The move_base_msgs package was converted to catkin in the ROS Hydro distribution and is still basically the same for Indigo and Jade.
