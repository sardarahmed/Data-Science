Q:

Atlas joints documentation. Where to find

I am able to control all Atlas joints following tutorials, but the joints names are not always a good enough description to realize which one is which. Is there any document that describes which joints corresponds to which joint name?
Best regards,
LR

A:

The best option is probably to run
roscd atlas
roslaunch urdf_tutorial display.launch model:=atlas.urdf gui:=True

and then play with the sliders to figure out which joint corresponds to which name.

Hello, where can i find that tutorial? Using these commands all i get is: [urdf_tutorial] is not a package or launch file name

"sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-robot-model-tutorials" ... should get you the package
