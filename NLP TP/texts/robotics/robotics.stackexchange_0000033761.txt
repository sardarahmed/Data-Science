Q:

Porting ROS to other Languages

Suppose I wanted to write an implementation of the ROS paradigm for other languages.I notice that there is a complete implementation of ROS for Java, as well as Python, and I was thinking specifically about writing an implementation for C# in Mono and .NET. Is there a list of core features somewhere I would have to implement to get this off the ground? Are there any good resources and best practices I should look for before embarking on this project?

I also want to write C# client for ROS, but I haven't found the way to do it. Can I have your msn or mail? If I can help you anything, I would like to share all my experiences. I have several month of ROS experiences.Now is working on navigation and cognitive.Thank you~

A:

There is a basic introduction for Client Libraries also adressing the implementation of new client libraries.
