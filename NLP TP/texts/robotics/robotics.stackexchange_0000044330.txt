Q:

UDP Transport Hints in ROSJava

I am trying to find out if there are any UDP capabilities in ROSJava as of this moment.  An earlier question back in February had asked the same question (I apologize for duplicating), however, I am trying to see if there is any new/recent news on the subject.  I looked through the code and saw nothing, so the answer seems like no.  Just want to make sure I didn't miss something.

A:

You didn't miss anything. There is no UDP support. Please file an issue and star it. You'll be notified if there are changes to it:
