Q:

Octomap update frequency

Currently we have already integrated the 2d hector_slam (which uses 2d laser range finder and provides tf information for the Octomap) and 3d ocotomap (in which the point cloud was provided by ASUS Xtion). But the update frequency of Octomap is pretty low.
    I used $ rostopic hz /octomap_full  to get the octomap update frequency, the following are some of the output:  

subscribed to [/octomap_full]
average rate: 0.176

     How to increase the octomap update frequency? 
     
     Highly appreciate your time and help!

A:

Is the octomap server at 100% CPU? The actual octomap integration might just be the bottleneck.
