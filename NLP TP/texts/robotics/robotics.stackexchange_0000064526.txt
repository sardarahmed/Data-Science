Q:

tf, translation between frames

Hi,
I have a setup with multiple target frames. Now I want to get the position of my last frame in relation to the world frame.
During execution typing
rosrun tf tf_echo /world /LAST_LINK
I receive exactly what I am looking for
**- Translation: [20.632, 0.000, -3.759]

Rotation: in Quaternion [-0.574, -0.000, 0.819, 0.000]
in RPY [-0.000, 1.222, 3.142]**

How can I read these values in my program in order to perform further calculations from it?
