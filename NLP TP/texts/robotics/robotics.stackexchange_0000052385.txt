Q:

[ipc bridge]MATLAB could not recognize function 'geometry_msgs_Twist'

I install the ipc-bridge on Ubuntu 12.04 following the instruction in
alliance.seas.upenn.edu/~meam620/wiki/index.php?n=Roslab.IpcBridge#Using
For the step 7 I could not compile the last four msgs successfully and I changed the last line in "ipc_bridge_ros.mk" to
$(CXX) -I./include $(ROS_CXXFLAGS) $(IPC_BRIDGE_CXXFLAGS) -lstdc++ $(IPC_LFLAGS) -lipc $(ROS_LFLAGS) $(ROS_LIBS) $^ -o bin/$@ -lroscpp -lrosconsole -lroscpp_serialization -lipc

Every thing sets after this modification.
However, when I tried the demo provide in the instruction, my MATLAB give me the error message says that
Undefined function 'geometry_msgs_Twist' for input arguments of type 'char'.

I also modified the ".bashrc" file to export the MEX to my MATLAB path and still does not working.
Anyone have a idea what's going wrong and how should I fix this?

Did you solve this problem? I met a same one.

A:

If you want to use the ipc_bridge functions, you must first add the path of the specific binary to Matlab:
addpath('Address to the /bin directory of specific message which includes all the mex-compiled binary files')
