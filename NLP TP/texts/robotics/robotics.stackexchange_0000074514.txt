Q:

Combining tf data and URDF model

Hi, I have a human URDF model that I can display in Rviz and I am getting tf data from Kinect v2. I am trying to place human URDF model on the tf data so I will have a chance to see the human URDF model moving instead of lines representing skeleton. Is there way for me to do that? Thanks a lot!

A:

You should make sure the URDF tree matches the TF tree
The name of each link of the URDF should correspond with a TF frame

Can you give me a detailed explanation such as how can I make sure the things you told me above? I am kinda new in these sort of things. Thank you very much!

What are the names of the links in your URDF? What are the names of the links in your tf data?
