A:

Let me google that for you!
Long explanation: http://people.csail.mit.edu/sparis/publi/2009/fntcgv/Paris_09_Bilateral_filtering.pdf
Short explanation (taken from PCL documentation):

sigma_s the half size of the Gaussian bilateral filter window to use
sigma_r the new standard deviation parameter
For more information please see C. Tomasi and R. Manduchi. Bilateral Filtering for Gray and Color Images. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, 1998.
