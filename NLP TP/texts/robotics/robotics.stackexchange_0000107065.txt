Q:

ROS2 listener/talker only works for talker on MacOS Sonoma 14.2 on M1-Max within docker

I have Sonoma 14.2 on my M1-Max and can not make it run for talker/listener couple of ROS2 in docker container
I followed steps at here
Talker sends messages but no response from listener.
How should I discover the issue ?
I am running talker/listener in same container and not giving any config definition for startup

docker run -it osrf/ros:iron-desktop

in docker shell :

ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener &
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker

A:

When you start your Docker ROS container are you telling it --net=host ?
This is my start ROS 2 Docker (on Raspberry Pi5 but you'll get the idea):
#!/bin/bash

cd ~/pi5desk/ros2ws
# --rm removes container after exit
# --w working dir to start in
echo -e "\n*** STARTING ROS 2 HUMBLE PLUS IN DOCKER ***"
docker run -it --net=host  -v /home/pi:/home/pi -w /home/pi/pi5desk/ros2ws --rm r2hdp
echo -e "\n*** EXITED DOCKER ***"

If you used the first example - it should have worked.
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener &
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker

Did it?
Did you start the Docker container detached and connect two terminal sessions to the same container?  (That should have worked without needing a network.)
If you started two docker containers interactively, without specifying a network - the two containers cannot see each other.  That will not work.
Please clarify exactly your sequence of commands to start docker, and run the talker and listener.
