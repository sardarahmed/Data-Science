Q:

Can I do on my robot.urdf in RViz without real hardware access? (Simulation mode only)

I'm not sure that I can do simulation mode first without real hardware access.
If yes, How to do that?
I appreciate any help and pointers in any direction.
Thanks. :

A:

First (and slightly pedantic, but important): RViz is not a simulator. It's a data(flow) visualisation tool.
If you want a full dynamic simulation of a robot (ie: including physics), you could use Gazebo, V-REP or any other simulator. You only need a model of your robot for that (kinematics, dynamics, geometry, etc).
Your ROS nodes can treat the simulated robot as a real robot, and RViz can visualise data coming from the simulator just as it would data coming from a real robot. There isn't really a difference.

It means that I need to work simulator on Gazebo first and then use simulator data from Gazebo for RViz right?
Big thanks.
