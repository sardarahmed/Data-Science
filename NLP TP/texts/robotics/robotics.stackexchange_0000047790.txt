Q:

fatal error No such file or directory compilationin

Hi everyone,
I use groovy/ROS with catkin and Eclipse IDE.
I need to use btQuaternion for this reason I do include for this    #include <LinearMath/btQuaternion.h>  in my main program .cpp. Of course  LinearMath exist in  tf2 package. I add in package.xml the following :     <build_depend>tf2</build_depend>  <run_depend>tf2</run_depend> . Additinaly I go to propertise->C/C++Include Paths and symbols -> Add External Include Path -> /opt/ros/groovy/stacks/geometry_experimental/tf2/include. However the results were not satisfactory and after build project I get following error:
fatal error: LinearMath/btQuaternion.h: No such file or directory compilation terminated. make[2]: *
or all result of built of project are:

A:

I'm not super familiar with building in eclipse, but you may be missing a part of your include path.  The full path to btQuaternion.h is:
/opt/ros/groovy/stacks/geometry_experimental/tf2/include/tf2/LinearMath/btQuaternion.h

Your eclipse-property setting only goes up to: .../geometry_experimental/tf2/include, but I think it should also include an additional tf2 directory.
You could also try to compile the package directly from the command line with rosbuild to see if that works.  If so, then maybe you just need to re-run make eclipse-project and see if that fixes things.
