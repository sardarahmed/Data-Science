Q:

Is it possible to have 2 nodehandlers for a single node

Hi,
I was checking one of the question posed in this forum where there was an incomplete code that has 2 node_handlers in a single code. Though i see its wrong in that particular code. i am curious to know if any such situation would arise where this possibility comes.
As for as i know 1 node should have 1 node_handler. Correct me if i am wrong.
Thanks,
Karthik

A:

If, for example, you had:
ros::NodeHandle nh;
ros::NodeHandle private_nh("~");

Then, nh.getParam() would look in the global namespace for a parameter, whereas private_nh.getParam() would look in a private namespace.
This configuration (one global, one private) is most common situation in which I use multiple NodeHandles.
