Q:

Tutorial: Controlling a Mobile Robot with its Range Sensor

Hi,
I tried to implement the tutorial plugin my_plugin_with_sensor.cc (explained here) in the Pioneer robot I am using in my world model. The simulation is not working as expected and mentioned in the tutorial page. The moment I start Gazebo, my robot starts moving back if gain <= 2.0 else starts tumbling and goes crazy and goes out of the solid boundary walls.
What shall I do ?

can u plz tell me how u solve the problem as i m aslo facing same

A:

i have solved this problem by little modification in my code
if (min_dist < this->laser->GetRangeMax())
{
    **double torque = this->gain *( (min_dist - target_dist)*0.1 );**
printf("torque %lf\n",torque);

    this->leftWheelJoint->SetForce(0, torque);
    this->rightWheelJoint->SetForce(0, torque);
  } 

now it is not starts tumbling and goes crazy and goes out of the solid boundary walls.
