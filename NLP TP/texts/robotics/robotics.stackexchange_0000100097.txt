Q:

Is there not a urdf utitlity package(liburdfom-dev or liburdfom-tools) in noetic?

I'm trying to install urdf utility package to check_urdf command for my .urdf files. And when I try to install the utility package using the following commands
sudo apt-get install liburdfom-tools 

or
sudo apt-get install liburdfom-dev

I get the following result
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package liburdfom-tools/dev #depending on the command

Am I doing something wrong or does the urdf utility package not exist in noetic?

A:

This package needs to be built from source. Refer to this tutorial:
http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Installing%20ROS%20Indigo%20on%20Raspberry%20Pi
For example,
$ cd ~/ros_catkin_ws/external_src
$ sudo apt-get install libboost-test-dev libtinyxml-dev
$ git clone https://github.com/ros/urdfdom.git
$ cd urdfdom
$ cmake .
$ sudo checkinstall make install
Hope this helps you

Hello! This helped, thank you! I am also trying to check my urdf using the package "urdfdom_py" but the terminal says this package cannot be found. I was wondering if you know anything about this package, if not I appreciate your reply!
PS command I am trying to run
This provides a JSON version of the robot, but crashes when the description has erros. Review the errors to  fix the URDF file.
rosrun urdfdom_py display urdf robot_des.urdf
