Q:

Is it possible to load OGRE meshes in Ignition Gazebo

I can export OGRE meshes from blender with blender2ogre so it seems straightforward to use them in the simulations but the sdf "mesh" tag doesn't support this format.
Is it true that I can't use the OGRE meshes in Ignition Gazebo, or I am just missing something?
The errors when I try to use
<geometry>
    <mesh><uri>/some/ogre.mesh</uri></mesh>
</geometry>

in ignition-dome:
$ ign gazebo test.sdf 
[GUI] [Err] [MeshManager.cc:119] Invalid mesh filename extension[/some/ogre.mesh]
[GUI] [Err] [MeshDescriptor.cc:56] Mesh manager can't find mesh named [/some/ogre.mesh]
[GUI] [Err] [Ogre2MeshFactory.cc:496] Cannot load null mesh [/some/ogre.mesh]
[GUI] [Err] [Ogre2MeshFactory.cc:84] Failed to get Ogre item for [/some/ogre.mesh]
[GUI] [Err] [SceneManager.cc:335] Failed to load geometry for visual: visual

Interesting, I had never seen that file format.
Ignition Gazebo currently only supports these mesh formats:

COLLADA
OBJ (+ MTL)
STL
