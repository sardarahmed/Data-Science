Q:

Troubles installing ROS C turtle base

Hi there,
I am following step by step the directions reported on this web page to install ROS Cturtle on Ubuntu 10.10. However, when I try to install the package (step 1.4), I received a message like:
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-cturtle-base
I also tried the other packages (ROS only and PR2), but I got the same message. Same thing if I click on the link suggested on the web page.
What am I doing wrong? I apologize if my question sounds very basic, but I am beginner with Linux and with programming in general.
Thanks in advance for your help!
Cheers,
George
Update:
Hi guys,
thank you for you reply. I don't know what to say... I tried to re-install everything yesterday (following carefully the directions), and I obtained the same result as before. I tried today, and I got a different error message (see below). I tried multiple times, but I obtained always the same result.
Why this difference? What did I do wrong now? I know that most likely it is my bad, but is it possible that there is some problems in the repository?
Thank you, George

E: Broken packages

Update:
Hi everyone,
thanks a lot for your help on this issue; modifying "etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list" from 'jaunty' to 'maverick' worked on my lab machine! :)
Unfortunately I am having troubles installing ROS (diamondback) on my netbook now, and the issues seem to be of the same nature as before. More in details, when I type (following step by step and carefully the indications of this page):
sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-desktop-full
I get the same error message as before:
E: unable to locate package ros-diamondback-desktop-full
So I checked the "/etc/apt/sources.list.d" folder, but I didn't find "ros-latest.list".  I didn't get any other error messages before this step, and I set Ubuntu repositories to allow "restricted," "universe," and "multiverse." Any suggestion about why this is happening? Do you think that the fact I am running Ubuntu 10.10 Netbook Edition could be a problem?
Thanks

A:

I think you mangled the package sources.
Jaunty is not 10.10.
Can you check your /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list (or similar)?
It should say maverick and not jaunty.
If that is OK, what does
apt-cache policy ros-cturtle-base give you?
