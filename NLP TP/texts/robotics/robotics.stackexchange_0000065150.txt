Q:

UR5 use catesian coordinates in ur_driver test_move.py

Hi,
i would like to write some catesian coordinates in test_move.py but i can only change the joint positions.
Has anyone an idea?
Link to test_move.py:

A:

You might be interested in the MoveIt ComputerCartesianPath function. Apparently it is also supported by the Python wrappers, but I don't know how well it works there (see Python ComputeCartesianPath on moveit-users).

I am looking for something like this, that's right. But I don't want to use moveit.

Then I guess you'll have to do the IK yourself for all the points that you want in your trajectory. MoveIt includes a service that you can use for that. Alternatively, you could perhaps make use of the libraries in the ur_kinematics package.

Note that not using MoveIt will also mean that you'll have to do collision checking yourself.

Thank you very much for the answer. This was very helpful =)
