Q:

Need help with Peak USB Hardware

I would like to know which package is best suited for writing custom application that can Send and Receive CAN messages using Peak USB hardware.
From the search I could find libpcan & Socket_CAN as two options. Out of this two:
1.I am not sure how to install libpcan with melodic(I am not sure whether even it is supported).
2.I am not able to find any documentation on Socket_CAN APIs which I can use for reference.
Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.
