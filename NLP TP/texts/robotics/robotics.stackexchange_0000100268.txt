Q:

How to install launch.py files in a python package in ros2 (python package is created without CMakeLists.txt)?

Hi! The question as in the topic.
When I just create a python package as described in this ros tutorial here, and then manually create a launch/launch_file.py and do colcon build, I cannot execute ros2 launch my_package launch_file.py becuase file '.launch_file.py' was not found in the share directory of package 'my+package' which is at 'path/2/ros_ws/install/my_package/share/lidar_odom'.
I do not have CMakeLists.txt in my package because this file is not created when you create a python package following the mentioned ros tutorial.
How to install then my launch files?

@EtienneSchmitz, many thanks for your answer! Maybe this particular code did not work in my case, but it inspired me to modify it a bit and the following piece of code worked for me
setup(
...
data_files=[
...
('share/' + package_name, ['launch/launch_file.py']),
],
...
)
