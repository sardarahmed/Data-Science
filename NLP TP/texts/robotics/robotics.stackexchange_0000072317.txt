Q:

How to compile the move_base package

Dear All,
I want to modify the code in the move_base package and compile.I downloaded the source code of the move_base package, and there were some errors when run "rosmake move_base":

This code block was moved to the following github gist:
https://gist.github.com/answers-se-migration-openrobotics/6875be8ac068fc67da5b10e950d1e61f

How can I compile the move_base package?

A:

You don't tell us which specific version of ROS you're using, but move_base has not been a rosmake package since at least 2013.
It should compile with catkin_make, but you'll have to create a catkin workspace for that first. See wiki/catkin/Tutorials/create a workspace for some more information.
