Q:

how to remove collision objects from Rviz by code

Hi all,
I was wondering if a function able to remove collision objects from world do exists...
because the

planning_scene_interface.removeCollisionObjects(object_ids)

function requires at least 0.4/0.5 seconds delay to be effective on Rviz, but my target is to remove it istantaneously.
I know there was a similar issue with the placement of an object in the world, because also the function

addCollisionObjects

requires that delay in order to be effective in Rviz. But this has been solved by using another function:

applyCollisionObject

So if anyone has ever dealt with these things please try to help me. Thanks in advance.
ROS Kinetic, Ubuntu version 16.04

A:

You can use bool applyCollisionObject(const moveit_msgs::CollisionObject& collision_object); by specifying  collision_object.operation = collision_object.REMOVE; when you create the moveit_msgs::CollisionObject
