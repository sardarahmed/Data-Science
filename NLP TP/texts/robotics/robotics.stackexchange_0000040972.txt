Q:

Installation of ROS-velodyne-Package

Hey,
I'm new to ROS, so don't be mad :-)
I want to install the velodyne_driver(actually the whole velodyne related stuff), and my best guess was, that this command would do that:
rosinstall $ROS_WORKSPACE http://utexas-art-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/stacks/velodyne/velodyne_driver
This is the error I get:
ERROR in config: Invalid multiproject yaml format in [http://utexas-art-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/stacks/velodyne/velodyne_driver]: while scanning a simple key
in "", line 2, column 1
could not found expected ':'
in "", line 3, column 40
OS: Ubuntu 12.04
ROS: Fuerte

A:

For Ubuntu 12.04 Fuerte, there is a binary package already available:
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-velodyne

For building the latest trunk from source, I recommend rosws:
roslocate info velodyne | rosws merge -

As always, use the trunk at your own risk. It is pretty stable right now. In fact, there is one bug fix there that is not yet released (but coming soon).
