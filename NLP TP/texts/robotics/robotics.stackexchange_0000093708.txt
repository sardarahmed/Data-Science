Q:

No definition of [boost] for OS version [xenial]

I'm installing ROS kinetic from source code on Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS, by following instructions on http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Source
However when I proceed to below step, I got strange errors.
$ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro kinetic -y

ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:

A:

The problem is solved by upgrading system libraries. And below tools are in the upgrade list:

python-catkin-pkg
python-rosdep
python-rosdistro
python-rosinstall
python-rosinstall-generator
python-rospkg
python-vcstools
python-wstool

After the upgrade, all worked smoothly.
