Q:

dynamixel_workbench: message fields for single_manger to multi_port

I am running ROS kinetic on  Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS (and kernal name 4.13.0-32-generic). I am working with the dynamixel_workbench stack. Specifically, I have a MX-106, an MX-64, and another MX-64 daisy-chained.
I want to get a rough estimate of torque output of motors over time. The message published to the topic /dynamixel/MX when I run single_manager.launch contains Present_Load, Present_Voltage, and Present_Temperature. I am interested in knowing these values when I run 3 motors.
When I run roslaunch my_dynamixel_workbench_tutorial multi_port.launch to control my 3 motors, the message published to /dynamixel_state does not contain those same fields I am interested in.
Is there a straightforward way to have the voltage/load/temperature fields published for multi_port (ideally without delving through the source code and creating my own custom overlay)?

Hi :)
You can add your interest state. But this is only way to open the source code.

just to clarify, adding dynamixel_state[cnt].Present_Load        =dxl_wb_[port_cnt]->itemRead(dxl_id_[port_cnt][index], "Present_Load"); to this list will work? Should I also have to edit the message file that is used to include an additional field?
