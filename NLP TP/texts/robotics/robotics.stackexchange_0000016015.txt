Q:

Is Programming/Coding necessary to pursue a masters degree in robotics?

I am soon going to finish my undergrad in mechatronics engineering and wish to take up robotics for my masters. But I absolutely dislike any form of coding/programming. I am however,interested in the mathematics and physics behind the working of a robot. I'd also love to study about the control systems in a robot. So is coding a requirement if I want to take up robotics?
PS: I couldn't find the right tag for the question. Sorry! Please direct me to the right one if required.

A:

Is coding a requirement if you want to take up robotics? No, but it is strongly recommended. 
The field of robotics is highly multidisciplinary. I primarily work on AUVs as a software developer, but my team consists of mechanical (ME), electrical (EE), and computer (CPE) engineers as well as physicists. Most of them don't look or write any of the code, but rather (as needed) assist the software developers in working out the mathematics for our acoustic systems, motor controllers, etc. 
If that sounds like what you are interested in, then those opportunities definitely do exist, but they are slim. Most groups that do work with robotics (industry or academia) expect their members to be able to work directly with code to varying degrees. That could be MEs or physicists programming high-level controllers, EEs or CPEs programming microcontrollers, or working directly on the larger code base (architecture, planning, perception, etc.). 
With this in mind, I suggest giving programming another chance. Not everyone will enjoy programming, but I think most people who turn away from it just didn't have a good first experience to really be able to appreciate the beauty of computing.
