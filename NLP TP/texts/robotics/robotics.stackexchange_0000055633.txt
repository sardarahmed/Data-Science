Q:

How to use .msg in source code as a variable?

I want to use nav_msg/GridCells.msg and OccupancyGrid in my package,How to use it in the source code. It is not a member of nav_msgs and it is only a .msg and I am unable find documentation for using GridCells as a member variable i.e. I want to initialize occupancy grid and add data to it and publish it as a topic. I want to do in cpp.

@tfoote Thanks I did that now.

A:

What have you tried so far? What isn't working?
The c++ publisher/subscriber tutorial shows how to create a ros message, add data to it, and then publish it.

I just initialized as :
nav_msgs::OccupancyGrid og;
og.data=temp_data;
but the error while compiling is
OccupancyGrid is not a member of nav_msgs
Is this how you initialize? Is OccupancyGrid not a member and cant it be used like a class?

If you want help debugging why your code won't compile, you need to edit your original question to include a small and complete example, as well as the exact error message.

Sounds like you might forgot to put a #include <nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid.h> into your source file. Still, lindzeyÂ´s comment applies: Post code, then people can make informed comments.

It was a simple mistake, OccupancyGrid was typed as OccupacyGrid. Thanks for your help. :)
