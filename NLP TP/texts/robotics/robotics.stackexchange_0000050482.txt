Kinect thermal imaging

Can kinect sensor be used as a thermal imaging camera and return body temperature ?

A:

No, not that i know of. The Kinect IR sensor works with an IR wavelength not far away from visible light (830nm), which is too short for thermal imaging.
Also there may be a lot more reasons, why this isn't working, that i dont know of. :)

To test for yourself, turn off the lights, cover up the IR projector, point the kinect at something hot, and take a look at the IR image stream. @Ben_S is correct that you won't see anything (I've tried).

The human body has a wavelength around 10 micrometers. So compared to the bandwidth of the kinect, it's not even worth it trying :-)
