Q:

gazebo simulation

Hi!
I want to simulate the navigation of a pioneer p3dx in Gazebo.
I can add the robot with:
opt/ros/electric/stacks/p2os/p2os_urdf/launch$ roslaunch pioneer3dx.gazebo.launch

I can control it with the keyboard with:
roslaunch p2os_launch teleop_keyboard.launch

But I'm not able to add the world to the simulation, because when I call:
opt/ros/electric/stacks/simulator_gazebo/gazebo_worlds/launch$ roslaunch office_world.launch

the robot disappear.
Any suggestion?

A:

I solved modifing the file pioneer3dx.gazebo.launch
I changed the line:
<include file="$(find gazebo_worlds)/launch/empty_world.launch"/>

with the line:
<include file="$(find gazebo_worlds)/launch/office_world.launch"/>

And now I can move the pioneer in the simulated office world

You should not change files that are installed by system packages since they will be overwritten on updates. Instead, copy the launch file into your own ROS package where you can modify it safely.

Thank you Lorenz, I didn't specify it but I usually copy the files in my workspace and then change them.
