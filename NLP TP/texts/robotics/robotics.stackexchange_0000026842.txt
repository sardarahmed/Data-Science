Q:

Gazebo plugin sdf configuration tags proper documentation

Hi, I was documenting some Gazebo plugins and I was adding information about how to configure them (using the child sdf tags of the  element) in the doxygen plugin class documentation, but I don't know if it is the right place. I was then wondering if there is a standard/guideline for proper documenting the child sdf tags that a Gazebo plugin accepts for configuration.

A:

We haven't defined a standard for documenting plugins, but we should. Here is an issue to track this.
For now, you can put plugin documentation in the plugin's header file.
