Q:

Matlab Simulation using Webots!

I am trying to run this youbot ( sample world) from webots, where the controller is implemented in MATLAB, on running the code it pops out the following error seen in the picture attached. I have also however installed the Support for MinGW-w64 C/C++ Compiler, though it still shows the same error. Could someone help a bit? The error is as follows: 
Warning: Name is nonexistent or not a directory: C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\matlab 
> In path (line 109)
  In addpath (line 86)
  In launcher (line 23) 
The MATLAB "MinGW-w64 C/C++ Compiler" addon is not installed, please install it from: https://fr.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/52848-matlab-support-for-mingw-w64-c-c-compiler

A:

You've got two serious problems clearly stated in your error message:

Warning: Name is nonexistent or not a directory: C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\matlab 

And

The MATLAB "MinGW-w64 C/C++ Compiler" addon is not installed, please install it

Have you fixed these problems? It looks like you don't have the Webots library installed and you also don't have a compiler installed. Nothing is going to work and we can't provide any other assistance until you get these resolved (and resolving them may fix everything).
