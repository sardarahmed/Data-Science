Thank u guys....i will go wid ubuntu den....

A:

Currently Windows support is only experimental. I would recommend you to install an Ubuntu Linux and get familiar with the Ubuntu Package Manager that is used to manage software. Once you have done that, you can proceed to the ROS installation instructions for Ubuntu:

I second this suggestion - If you're just getting started with ROS, you don't want the headache of using an unsupported operating system. You'll want to set up your machine as a dual boot, following the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot. It's surprisingly painless.

That's definitely a good idea, thanks for mentioning!

And I guess once you have discovered the beauty of Linux, you will get rid of your Windows partition ;-)

After 4 years, are we still in experimental stage?
