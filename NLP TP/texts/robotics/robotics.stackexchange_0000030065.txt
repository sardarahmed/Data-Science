Q:

How to contributing python versions of tutorials? e.g. Tutorials for arm_navigation

I sometimes find myself converting the C++ versions of the tutorials into python.
e.g. http://code.google.com/p/gt-ros-pkg/source/browse/trunk/hrl/advait_sandbox/arm_navigation_tutorials/src/arm_navigation_tutorials/
What, if any, would be a good way to add links to python sample code to the tutorials?

A:

I can think of two things you can do:
First, you can make a wiki page for your python tutorial. The general ROS tutorials simply put up two versions for the same tutorial:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials
For example,

Writing a Simple Publisher and Subscriber (Python)
Writing a Simple Publisher and Subscriber (C++)

Second, you can contact the stack maintainer, and maybe they'll include your tutorial package for release along with the rest of the stack.
