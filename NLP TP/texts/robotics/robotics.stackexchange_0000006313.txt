Q:

How do you calculate the moment of inertia of a Quadcopter?

I'm building a quadcopter for my final year project. I have a set of equations describing attitude and altitude but they involve $I_{xx}$, $I_{yy}$ and $I_{zz}$. None of the papers I have read describe how these are calculated. they simply choose it before their simulation. Can anyone help?

A:

You can calculate the moment of inertia of a pendulum by measuring the period of oscillation for small amplitudes. Suspend the quad by one arm and give it a little push and time the period. It does work better for larger aircraft, measuring the period of a quad-pendulum will be tricky. Maybe get a video of the aircraft with a high framerate so you can get a more accurate measurement than just a stopwatch.

Also having an accurate solidworks model or cad model should have the moments of inertial in some properties list.
