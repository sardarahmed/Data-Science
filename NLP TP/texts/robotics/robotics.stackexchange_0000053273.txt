Q:

RGBDSLAM map recording

Hi, All,
I am able to run rgbdslam (with openni camera) on fuerte. My question is how can I save the 3d map (as a video?) that is been built. I thought about using rosbag to record all published topics, but how can I visualize the 3D map? I know I can visualize octomap related topics in rviz, what about the 3D map with the image overlay (the map on the rgbdslam GUI)? Thanks a lot for the help.

A:

Do I understand correctly that you would like a video of the incremental creation of the point cloud map?
I once tried to extend rgbdslam's gui class to store screenshots of the 3D visualization to disk, but unfortunately it didn't work out.
You can run recordmydesktop (or gtk-recordMyDesktop) to capture the rgbdslam window, but that's probably rather slow.
Otherwise, you could save the clouds to pcd files (from rgbdslam) and then manipulate the files with a script, using pcd_viewer to display and save a snapshot of each state.
