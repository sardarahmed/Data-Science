Q:

Example bagfile of SICK LIDAR data on robot driving around

I'm interested in some example bagfile data of a robot driving around indoors with one of the large SICK scanners like the SICK LMS 200 (180 deg FOV, 1 deg angular resolution, high update rate of 75Hz). Does anyone know where to find such a bagfile? I don't have access to the hardware myself and seeing how many people have pioneers with SICK scanners on them, I'm sure there must be some bagfiles floating around somewhere :). I basically only need the scan data (provided the vehicle doesn't experience attitude changes/is driving on flat ground).

A:

I have a bagfile (5.8MB tar.bz2) that might work for you. On the base_laser1_scan topic you'll find the data from a SICK LMS291 outputting at 75Hz with 0.5 degree increments in a 180 degree FOV and 80 meters max range. The 0.5 degree increments actually means you get 2 separate 1 degree scans with slightly different angle_min and angle_max values to reflect the starting offset. If you just want 1 set of 1 degree scans, just pick a starting angle_min and filter all the scans with a different angle_min.
For a ground truth, these scans were taken while going from "X" to "O" and back on the map attached to this answer.

The bagfile I linked also contains uncorrected odometry information for the robot (CWRU's HARLIE) as it moved along, as well as laser scan topics from a Hokuyo URG-04LX (or URG-04LX-UG01 I can't remember exactly which) and the laser extracted from a Neato XV-11.
If that bagfile doesn't contain what you were looking for, I can check this evening to see if I still have the bagfile that we built the posted map from with gmapping. I believe that one was taken with the scanner set to 1 degree resolution as opposed to 0.5 degree resolution.
UPDATE:
The bagfile that the map was built from (I'm ~90% certain) is here (44MB tar.bz2). I can't actually say for certain since my NVIDIA driver is currently in a weird state, so RViz isn't displaying laser data. The name and date are right for a data collection of that mapped area though.
The SICK was set to 1 degree mode, as there is only one angle_min value in the bagged data (/base_laser1_scan topic again). All other parameters were the same as above.

Hi Eric, thanks for the bagfile, that already helps. A 1 deg resolution one would be even better, so if you find it let me know :) Thanks again.

Updated my answer with the link to another bagfile. I'm certain that it has 1 deg resolution, and pretty positive that it could be used with gmapping to produce a map very similar to the one I posted (so it covers a much larger area than the bag I originally posted).

Thanks a lot for the additional data!
