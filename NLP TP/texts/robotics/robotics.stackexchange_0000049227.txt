Revisit REP3 with respect to C++11?

Is there a migration plan to C++11 in the works?

Are you referring to this: "A wholesale jump to C++[0|1]x will not happen until all commonly used OS platforms fully support it."?

A:

We have not reached the point that even all the Ubuntu platforms support C++11x.
A good status page for support shows we're still a ways away from general support.

So are we essentially waiting for the most recent LTS Ubuntu to support GCC 4.8? Or are we happy with a reasonable subset of C++11? Once Lucid is no longer supported (i.e. 4 weeks from now), Precise offers GCC 4.6 and most of the useful bits of C++11.

What is the current status of this? Indigo is going to support Ubuntu 13.10 and 14.04 both of which ship with with gcc 4.8.[1|2] as per http://packages.ubuntu.com/saucy/gcc .
4.8.1 is C++11 feature complete http://isocpp.org/blog/2013/05/gcc-4.8.1-released-c11-feature-complete

Seems like ROS Jade might be a good time to support C++11
Comment by William on 2014-12-23:
What does "ROS supporting C++11" mean? Requiring or supporting C++11? C++11 has been on by default for OS X for a quite a while now and ROS works fine there. I would not lightly require C++11 for Jade, because we don't need C++11 features and it would exclude systems without C++11.
