Q:

Using two roscreate-pkg packages and being able to read the src file code

Hi everyone,
I have one package (lets call it a) and inside this is the CMakeLists.txt file, manifest.xml and a few .h and .cpp files of code that talk to each other in the src folder. My src file is starting to get a little big so ideally I want to have more than one package (such as one called b) that has its own CMakeLists.txt file, manifest.xml  and src file. What I want is the code in the src folder for package a to be able to communicate with the src folder for package b. I added the line:
<depend package="a"/>
to the manifest.xml in package b but I am unable to read the src code from package a.
Perhaps my way of thinking is wrong. If so, could you explain to me the best way to partition the code would be? If I am on the right track, what have I missed out?
Thanks in advance.

This ROS answer (http://answers.ros.org/question/33779/how-do-i-link-an-executable-with-library-in-other-package/) covers all the things you have to do.

Thanks so much!

A:

See this ROS answer. You have to export cflags and lflags in package a in your case mentioned.
