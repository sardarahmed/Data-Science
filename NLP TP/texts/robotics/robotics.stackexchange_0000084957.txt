Q:

ROS support in Windows 10 tablet + Qt GUI application

Hi, I want to create an Qt GUI (using qml) application which is targeted to run on a windows 10 tablet. Whether ROS can be installed in mobile or tablet platforms.
I have a windows tablet UI application and planning to 1) Subscribe for a ROS topic and ROS data 2) Update the application GUI , based on the data received from ROS node.
Is there any alternative solution develop GUI application with ROS , to run on a mobile platform.

Don't know about Win10, but: bgromov/ros_qml and severin-lemaignan/ros-qml-plugin.

No idea. It's QML, so my answer would be: maybe.

A:

With a lot of work ROS can be made to run on Windows but it takes a lot of work and is not a supported platform. (For ROS2 it is a supported platform) If you want a web based GUI that can work on a tablet I recommend checking out Robot Web Tools

There is #q238646, but it's also unsupported (and most tablets run the ARM version of Win10, which doesn't have WSL iirc).
