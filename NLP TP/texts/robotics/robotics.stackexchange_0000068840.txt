Q:

Hector_SLAM vs Gmapping

Hi there,
I am currently using a laser scan message for range and encoders for odometry, should I only be looking at gmapping since I see most of the uses of hector_slam are without odometry. Or should I try both and see which method obtains better results?

A:

Hector_Slam can be used with or without odometry, so either way, you will be fine. I would say try both and see which one gives you better results.
