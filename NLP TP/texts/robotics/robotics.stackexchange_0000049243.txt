Q:

Missing resource

Hy,
im trying to install UWSim but when I type rosdep install UWSim it shows me this:
ERROR: Rosdep cannot find all required resources to answer your query
Missing resource UWSim
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/groovy/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/opt/ros/groovy/share
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/groovy/stacks
I have checked and there is folder opt and every subfolders in it.
I have downloaded from wiki a virtual machine with Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS and ROS Groovy Galapagos pre-installed and tried with that and I still get this error.
Can someone help please...

A:

Follow this for installing instructions. Assumming you have downloaded and added to your workspace the package "underwater_simulator" the command

rosdep install UWSim

should install the required dependencies. The error is "Missing resource UWSim", which means that ROS cannot find UWSim. Test if you can do a "roscd UWSim". If you cannot, then you have to add UWSim to your workspace.
To add this package to your workspace, follow this tutorial. I recommend you to follow all the tutorials.

there is folder "underwater_simulation" in my home directory and it has subfolder "UWSim". "opt" folder with his subfolder "ros" is in File System. I tried to copy "underwater_simulation" to "ros" but it doesnt  let me.
