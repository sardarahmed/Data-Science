Q:

Combine Fuerte and Electric in one application

Hi everyone,
I want to combine two computers in a ROS network. On one of them runs Fuerte, the other PC executes ROS Electric. I cannot implement a connection between both. Are there known problems with different ROS versions in this context?
In a pure Electric network the connection works well.
Best wishes from Germany

A:

While it might be possible to set up communication between electric and fuerte nodes, this use case is not supported and definitely not recommended. Message definitions might have changed and you might run into all different kinds of bugs and problems.
Btw. please always tag your question appropriately to make sure the right people get notified.
