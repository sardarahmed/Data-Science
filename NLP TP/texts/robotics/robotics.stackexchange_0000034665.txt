Q:

What is the origin of the inertia tensor in URDF

The URDF specifications for a link require that the origin of the inertial frame must be located at the center of gravity of the link. (urdf/XML/link)
What is the origin of the 3x3 rotational inertia matrix? Is it

the origin of the inertia frame, which is also the center of gravity, OR

the origin of the link reference frame.

The inertia matrix will be different depending on whether it is calculated with respect to 1 or 2.

A:

I imagine that its (1) but I'm unfamiliar with the actual implementation to back that up.

Yes, it is indeed (1): the inertia matrix is specified in the inertia frame. I updated the wiki documentation.
