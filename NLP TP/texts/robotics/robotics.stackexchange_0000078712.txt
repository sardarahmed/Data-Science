Q:

Empty Octomap in RGBDSLAM

I am using rgbdslam_v2 with the Intel Realsense R200 on ROS Kinetic. It seems to be working fine and I am getting a point cloud in the RGBDSLAM GUI. However, when I turn off the cloud display to view the Octomap, it seems to be empty. Saving the Octomap also just saves an empty Octomap. I have tried enabling online octomapping and running the Point Cloud Occupancy Filter menu item (which I am not quite sure how is supposed to be used - is it for generating the Octomap when online octomapping is disabled?), but to no avail.
Is there something I have missed?
Thanks.

The voxel filter is meant to geometrically downsample the clouds. I guess it should better not be used with octomapping, might work though. Have you set the "store_pointclouds" parameter to false? It is true by default.

A:

I have a same problem. Although i set "store_pointclouds" to false, the saved octomap file has no data. The saved octomap just include as follows.
# Octomap OcTree file
# (feel free to add / change comments, but leave the first line as it is!)
#
id ColorOcTree
size 0
res 0.5
data

I just click "Save Octomap" in the menu without clicking any other menu. I'm working on Ubuntu 16.04, Kinectic and rgbdslam v2 (https://github.com/felixendres/rgbdslam_v2)
Thank you.

I solved this issue by adding return true in bool GraphManager::updateCloudOrigin(Node* node). This function needs to return a bool but return true is missed in the end of the function. The function can be found in graph_mgr_io.cpp. I finally have a binary octomap file.

Not solving I have tried to set the store_pointclouds option to false and then tried your method nothing changes

You may try with setting store_pointclouds to true. It is helpful to post your saved octomap for solving this problem.

Thanks for the above answer the return true thing worked I got binary octomap
