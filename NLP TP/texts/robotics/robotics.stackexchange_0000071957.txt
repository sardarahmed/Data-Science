Q:

Release only on certain Ubuntu platform?

For example on Indigo, can I exclude certain Ubuntu distro, say Saucy, upon making a release? Well it looks like it's not possible at this momement, but is it planned to become possible in the future? I don't mean it's necessary for any of my purpose for now but I'm just curious and sounds like it's convenient.
While releasing a package into Indigo, I found a DEB of one of the dependencies, python-termcolor (ticketed), is not available only on Saucy (ie. available on Trusty onward).
Apparently rosdep (run during bloom process) couldn't resolve the dependency and gave an error, but then bloom offered an option to skip it (log1). Combined with a recent announcement, I thought I could somehow move forward making a release into Indio except on Saucy platform. Turned out I was wrong (I then got a bunch of error emails from buildfarm (log2) stating that a release branch for Saucy wasn't found).

A:

It is not planned to support custom set of distributions. Simply because one ROS distribution aims to provide a certain set and not diverge across various Ubuntu distributions.
That being set your specific problem might be resolved by the fact that EOL Ubuntu distributions will be not be built for in the near future. See http://lists.ros.org/pipermail/ros-users/2016-February/069828.html for more information on that.

Ok, I think I just misinterpret Tully's announcement. Now I understand that once Saucy's build reaches EOLed for Indigo, 1) all Indigo build jobs for Saucy will be stopped, 2) and maintainers will not have an option for excluding certain platforms (same as we have not had).
