Q:

Fuerte sensor_msgs::Joy Changed?

~/ros/p2os/p2os_teleop/src/p2os_teleop.cc:169:64: error: ‘const struct sensor_msgs::Joy_std::allocator<void >’ has no member named ‘get_axes_size’
Am I missing something or what? This program built fine in ROS-E..

A:

This not only affects sensor_msgs::Joy but all messages. All get_...size and set..._size functions were already deprecated and are now removed in favor of the standard vector API. See Fuerte migration.
