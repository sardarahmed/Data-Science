Q:

When is the case to disable database using?

I followed pr2_tabletop_manipulation_apps/Tutorials/Starting the Manipulation Pipeline
It says
"disable database use altogether. In this case, this part of the launch file can be absent. See details below in the Sensor Processing section for disabling database use throughout the pipeline. "
I'm not understand when should disable to use database.
Thank you~

A:

To use the database you need to have one. Either you need to set it up locally, which is work or you use Willow's that needs an internet connection. If you don't need the database, you can thus disable it and not worry about that.
