Q:

Waiting for the move_base action server to come up

Hi, I'm facing this issue, getting "Waiting for the move_base action server to come up". I am running all nodes on same laptop.
gazebo + jackal_sim_robot + jackal_sim_mec + jackal_lnav (this contain amcl and move_base) + simple_navigation_goal node. simple navigation goal node is used from link: http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutori...
I am able to navigate robot in rviz but when i run simple_navigation_goal node , it print log "Waiting for the move_base action server to come up". ! Please help.

A:

This error usually means that move_base is not running, or that the simple_navigation_goal is not configured with the correct action server name for the move_base node. Do a rostopic list and look for a move_base topic ending in /goal. The entire path preceding the /goal portion is the name of the action server.

Hey, mine is /move_base/goal and /move_base_simple/goal, but it is still showing the same error. Can you help?

move_base_simple is not an ActionServer, the move_base developers just chose a similar name. An ActionServer will create 3 topics: goal, feedback and result. In your case, the ActionServer name is probably "/move_base" (but look for those other topic names to be sure.)

@Mike Scheutzow I'm having the same issue where I have the the server name correct(move_base), but nothing happens. I'm trying to use the action client and server move the robot around while it's getting map information from SLAM. Please take a look at my question here
