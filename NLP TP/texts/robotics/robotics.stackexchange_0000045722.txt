Q:

Error message: Could not connect to roomba

Hi,
I was trying to run the node roomba500_light_node in package roomba_500_series. I have connected the roomba. But it gives me the error message:"could not connect to roomba".
I think I may have missed something in the process. Maybe a driver for roomba500? Could you give me some suggestion regarding how to solve the problem?
Thank you so much!
Regards,
Deb

Hi Deb, Could you be able to resolve this error and communicate with roomba ? I am also facing similar problem. Please let me know in case you figured this out.  Thanks, Devasena

A:

Hi Deb,

First check to which USB port your roomba is connected using command:

ls /dev/ttyUSB*

Change the permission of that USB port say it's /dev/ttyUSB0...

sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0

Now try running rosrun:

rosrun roomba_500_series roomba500_light_node
Hope this helps !!
