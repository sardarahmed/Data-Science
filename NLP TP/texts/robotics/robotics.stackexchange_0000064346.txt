Q:

start map_server with custom frame_id

I currently use
rosrun map_server map_server testenvironment.yaml

to run the map server. It uses "map" as frame_id. I want it to set "odometry_link" as frame id. The documentation says something about a parameter ~frame_id, but it does not say how to use it. Can anyone give an example of how to start the map_server with a custom frame id?

A:

you can pass frame_id param from command line
rosrun map_server map_server testenvironment.yaml _frame_id:="odometry_link"

thanks to http://streebgreebling.blogspot.de/2010/04/passing-command-line-parameters-to.html

Update:
passing param in .launch file
<node name="map_server" pkg="map_server" type="map_server" args="testenvironment.yaml">
<param name="frame_id" value="odometry_link" />
</node>

Thanks that helped a lot, I would have never guessed that. How to do the same thing using a map file?
<node pkg="map_server" type="map_server" name="the_map" args="$(arg map_name) _frame_id:="odometry_link" />
?
