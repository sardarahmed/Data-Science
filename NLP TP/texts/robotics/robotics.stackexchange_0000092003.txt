Q:

Schunk LWA4P initialization problem with ros_canopen

Hi,
I try to launch a LW4P with ros_canopen. I use ROS kinetic and a PCAN-USB Pro adapter.
I already tried out the suggestions on similar problems on ROS answers and on GitHub but unfortunately my issue remains.
First I setup my CAN interface
$ ~/catkin-pem-robot-v2# sudo ip link set can0 down
$ ~/catkin-pem-robot-v2# sudo ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 500000
$ ~/catkin-pem-robot-v2# sudo ip link set can0 up txqueuelen 20

Then I launch the robot
$ ~/catkin-pem-robot-v2$ roslaunch pem_robot pem_robot_v3.launch

Thanks to Mathias LÃ¼dtke power supply was one issue.
Now I get the following output:

I am still not able to launch the LWA4P and I encountered some strange things:
It seems that some of my CAN modules are not recognized at all. At the startup candump can0 only gives me the following:
can0 705 [1] 00 
can0 706 [1] 00 
can0 70A [1] 00

If I only launch the recognized nodes without the non-recognized nodes, I can move the recognized nodes as expected.
I also double-checked my CAN module IDs and CANopen communication mode with the Schunk Motion tool.
What could be the reason for not recognizing some of my modules?
Thank you in advance!
Any help is highly appreciated!

Hello , did you try to start just the driver "canopen_motor_node"  and manualy spawn your controller ? with rqt if it's easyer.
Is your candump complete ? I don't see node many node state in you candump but, as log indicates a controller interface not found probleme.
I think it migh help if you send your configuration file *controller.yaml and canopen_chaine_node.yaml etc.

A:

EMCY: 8A#2232257400000000
EMCY: 85#223225740000803F
EMCY: 86#2232257400001C42

If I am  not mistaken, this is an under-voltage emergency alert (0x3222).
Please check your power supply.

thank you! Yes apparently power supply was one issue. The EMCY message have disappeared now. However, the other error messages are remaining and I am still not able to launch the LWA4P.
I encountered some strange things:
It seems that some of my CAN modules are not recognized at all. At the startup candump can0 only gives me the following
 can0  705   [1]  00 can0  706   [1]  00 can0  70A   [1]  00

But what could be the reason for not recognizing some of my modules?
Thank you in advance!
