Q:

tf for every child frame?

Hey there,
Is there any possibility to kind of "get" all child frames of a specific frame?
I want to make a transformation (simple rotation on 2 axis) to every child frame of a specific frame. Something like a list which i can iterate through would be awesome, but I'm open to other ideas for sure.
Thanks in advance

A:

There is not an API to support that query specifically.
There is a method to get all the frames as yaml which you can then iterate and filter based on the parent.
