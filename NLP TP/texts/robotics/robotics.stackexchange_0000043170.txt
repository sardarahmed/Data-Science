Q:

Mapping photos on walls in Gazebo

Hello,
I'm using a visual slam algorithm in my PR2 simulation and I'm trying to enhance the visual aspect of walls. I would know if it is possible to map photos on walls objects and if yes, where I can find information (or how to do that - I'm wondering about urdf files).
I'm working with Electric.

A:

The Darpa ARM Simulator has a Gazebo world with a wall (thin box) and a picture of their lab wall mapped onto it:
The launch file is here:
http://svn.thearmrobot.com/darpa_arm_sim_servers/RobotModel/launch/DarpaRobot.launch
and you can examine the code in:
http://svn.thearmrobot.com/darpa_arm_sim_servers/RobotModel/
Somewhere in there you can see different *.png wall pictures they tested. I don't know if a photo-realistic picture would look any good though.

That is really instructive, thanks ! I tried to modify from this example but without success. Do you have any information about the way to declare a new Material to be accessed from others urdf files ? I try to had one in Gazebo.Darpa.material but it didn't work.

Finally I manage to build my own model from this example. When adding new material, Gazebo my be quitted and run again (probably a question of loading Media stuff). Thanks again !
