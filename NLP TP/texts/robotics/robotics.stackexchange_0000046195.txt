Q:

When to use Gmapping?

Hello
I have some question regarding Gmapping. I would like to know when to use it. I have a sensor package consist of Laser range finder, IMu  and Camera. I was using amcl for the robot pose estimation. I do not have encoders(odometry) so was using IMU for the ICP in the laser scan matcher node. So I had an option oof using Gmapping , but I actually used the amcl with the laser scans. Any explanation of Gmapping??
Thanks

A:

AMCL is a localization method that
localizes your robot in a previously
known map.
Gmapping is a SLAM (simultaneous
localization and mapping) method that
simultaneously generates a map and
localizes your robot in it.

In a nutshell (for details on the difficulties of the SLAM problem see for example this overview paper), SLAM can be more brittle than pure localization as the map used for localization is not static.
