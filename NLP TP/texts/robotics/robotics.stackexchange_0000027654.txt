Q:

How can I use the deprecated function SetAngle?

Hi everybody,
In my plugin I want to set the angle of a revolute joint according with a particular dynamic.
To do this I used the function
void gazebo::physics::Joint::SetAngle ( unsigned int  _index, math::Angle  _angle) 

This function in declared as GAZEBO_DEPRECATED(version).
When I try to compile the code, I have this return :
warning: 'void gazebo::physics::Joint::SetAngle(unsigned int, gazebo::math::Angle)' is deprecated (declared at /usr/include/gazebo-5.2/gazebo/physics/joint.hh:396 [-Wdeprecated-declaretions].

I'm not able to understand why I can't use this function.
Is there a  method that enables the user to use this type of function?
I tried to add this piece of code :
 #if defined(__GNUC__)
 #define GAZEBO_DEPRECATED(version) __attribute__((deprecated))
 #define GAZEBO_FORCEINLINE __attribute__((always_inline))
 #elif defined(_WIN32)
 #define GAZEBO_DEPRECATED(version)
 #define GAZEBO_FORCEINLINE __forceinline
 #else
 #define GAZEBO_DEPRECATED(version) ()
 #define GAZEBO_FORCEINLINE
 #endif

But appears an error like:
may not appear in macro parameter list
#define GAZEBO_FORCEINLINE __attribute__((always_inline))

Otherwise, is there other functions that can make the same thing of SetAngle?
Thank you, bye!

A:

I don't know how to use a deprecated function (maybe it depends on the gazebo version you use).
The new function should be SetPosition .

Thank you, the error disappears! I hope that the joint will behave as I want.
