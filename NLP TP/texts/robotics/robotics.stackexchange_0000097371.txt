Q:

roscpp: set / get vector containing infinity from parameter server

Hello everyone,
I would to read a vector containing some infinity components from the ROS parameter server. I have included the following line in the roslaunch:
<rosparam param="my_vector">[0.0, inf, 0.0]</rosparam>

Using the command line rosparam get tool, the vector seems to be loaded correctly in the parameter server, but trying to read it from my node with the following lines:
std::vector<double> v;
ros::param::get("my_vector", v);

returns false.
Is there any built-in way to set / get an infinity value from the parameter server?
Thank you in advance

A:

Shouldn't it be .inf instead? Your v is a vector<double>.
