Q:

RVIZ will not execute

I am trying to run a LiDar taken from the Neato XV-11 vacuum cleaner on ROS nad amd using RVIZ to visualize the data coming from the sensor. However, I ran into the problem that RVIZ was not receiving and MAP data to display. I consulted the site and As per the video tutorial under map, I found that I did not have any topics being displayed. I tried to enter the topic manually but not RVIZ will not initialize and I am receiving the following error.
[ERROR] [1338754771.604753719]: Caught exception while loading: Character [ ] at element [3] is not valid in Graph Resource Name [map (nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid)].  Valid characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, / and _.
Kindly suggest what when wrong and what can be done regarding the same.

A:

Seems to me you placed a space in map (nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid) which is not valid.
Remove that space in ~/.rviz/display_config or ~/.rviz/config and start rviz.
