Hey Hamid, I haven't seen you in a bit.  Have you used cv_bridge a lot? After realizing the camera_pose_calibration package is broken, I started looking into OpenCV for processing the Kinect data streams.  Is this a path you would recommend?

Hey :) I do not use cv_bridge a lot.I just use it for converting between ROS images and OpenCV image Once.
If you want to use OpenCV with the depth data you can use cv_bridge to convert the ROS topic into an OpenCV cv::Mat.
I hope this helpful for you. :)
