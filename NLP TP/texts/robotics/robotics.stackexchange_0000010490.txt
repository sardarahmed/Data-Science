Q:

Is it possible to use a LiPo charger as a lab bench power supply?

I recently thought about building a lab bench power supply, it comes in cheaper and I love to build things...
But then I also have a LiPo charger an iMax B6AC, that I had bought for my quadcopter, then came the idea of whether I can use the charger as a lab bench power supply...
My questions is, could this work and how could I make it work?

A:

You could trick the charger into providing power for you by applying a voltage to the balance sensing lines. However the control you have over it would be limited. 
Switching power supplies are ridiculously cheap these days. Search ebay for "switching power supply dc 24v" for whatever voltage you want. I just keep a pile of these in the closet for the voltages I use the most (5, 12, 24 and 48). That plus one low power bench supply with current limiting to debug new boards with.
