Q:

AssertionError: Test node [test_rosjava/tester]

Good night,
I am testing ROSJava and I am using the guide from:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosjava
When I am executing the example:
rostest --text test/rosjava_test.launch
I receive the following error

Traceback (most recent call last):
File
"/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/ros_comm/tools/rostest/src/rostest/runner.py",
line 60, in fn
self.fail(message) AssertionError: Test node [test_rosjava/tester] does
not exist or is not executable

I would like to know what is the problem.
Cheers
Juan Antonio

A:

The wiki page was sort of outdated. I've updated it accordingly. You can run the test as follows:
roscd test_rosjava
make test

NOTE for future readers: this is for the old, JNI-based rosjava
