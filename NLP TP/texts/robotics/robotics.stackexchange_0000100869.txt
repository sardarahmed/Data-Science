Q:

lifecycle_msgs/msg/state.hpp is missing by build ROS2 UR_Robot_DRIVER

Good evening to all participants.
when i'm compiling the last state of the UR driver for ROS2, so i get a fatal error
workspace/install/hardware_interface/include/hardware_interface/system_interface.hpp:26:10
"fatal error: lifecycle_msgs/msg/state.hpp: No such file or directory26  #include "lifecycle_msgs/msg/state.hpp"

the package "ifecycle_msgs" is installed, and the Cmakelist contains "find_package(rclcpp_lifecycle REQUIRED)".
has someone already such experience done and how to make it fix and running???
thanks for any information about that

A:

You need to also depend on the lifecycle_msgs package. Add it to your package.xml and CMakeLists.txt so it is found and the include directories are added to your compilation commands by CMake.
