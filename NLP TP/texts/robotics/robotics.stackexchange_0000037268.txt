Q:

Spawn an xml model in gazebo

This is my xml file(name:pool.xml):
 

  

 

 
 

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
Gazebo/White
 
 
I used the command line:
rosrun gazebo spawn_model -file pwd/pool.xml -urdf -z 1 -model my_pool
I have the master node running(empty_world.launch), but after the command line nothing appears. How can I spawn the current xml file (if everything is ok with it) in an empty_world.launch??

A:

Did you actually use the pwd/pool.xml? If yes pwd is supposed to be the directory where you saved pool.xml like ros/electric/stack/Tutorial/pool_package/.
