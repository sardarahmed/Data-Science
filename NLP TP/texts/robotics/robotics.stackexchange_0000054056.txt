Q:

catkin_make error

Hello I am trying to build a package 'gruvy_usarsim_inf' by using catkin workspace. I have set the dependencies also; but when I type in the terminal "catkin_make" following error comes.

A:

You have to install that dependency depending on what version you have. If you have Indigo and below you can do it through apt-get. If you're running jade or higher then you have to build from source.
Here are some command to try :
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
sudo rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro jade -y

This worked for me (+1).
Just one correction: it's not a single command, it should be split into three:
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
sudo rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro jade -y
