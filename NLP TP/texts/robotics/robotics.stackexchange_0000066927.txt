Q:

Import question

Hello, Im new in ROS and Im having a problem importing a .py file from my scripts folder to another .py in the nodes folder of the package.
I know how to import anything in the src folder, but I cant find information about how to do what I wanna do.
Maybe this is a silly question, but I'll apreciate any help. Thank you!!

A:

you'll have to add the scripts folder in the PYTHON_PATH. But it's probably better to change the layout of your project (move the script inside src?)
