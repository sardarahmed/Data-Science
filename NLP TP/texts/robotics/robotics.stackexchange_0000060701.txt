Q:

Help with opencv random error

Hi,
So I have been working with opencv and ros to do object detection and everything seemed to be fine until the other day and suddenly when i start using the SURF detection line of code I get this error.
/home/frank/catkin_ws/devel/lib/bingo_detection/bingo_detection_server: symbol lookup error: /home/frank/catkin_ws/devel/lib/bingo_detection/bingo_detection_server: undefined symbol: ZNK2cv9Feature2D7computeERKNS_3MatERSt6vectorINS_8KeyPointESaIS5_EERS1
I have no idea what I did.

A:

I figured it out,
It was an issue with the CMakeList.txt and the OpenCV libraries. I had originally had the CMakeLists.txt addtarget to specific folder inside my project which had the opencv libraries. But for whatever reason when i did an update it would no longer let me do this so i just needed to remove
${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/lib/libopencv_core.so
And all others...
and replace with
${OpenCV_LIBRARIES}
And that fixed the problem

@TT: can you post your system specifics, like Linux distro, hardware platform, etc ? Since this is solved, we might as well document it; Might can help other souls going through the same calvary. I will vote you answer right, since you with your current karma points may not be able to do so.
