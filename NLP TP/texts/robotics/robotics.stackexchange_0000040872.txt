I didn't even know it was already a windows version. Probably is still a bit buggy/inmature. Anyway, probably is better if you add information about which windows version you have an so on

A:

I just figured out to solve this, the tutorial in the wiki was pretty vague about it.
Basically, what you need to do is to add C:\Python27\ and C:\Python27\Scripts to the PATH IN the Setup.bat. Not the path for python when you install it the first time.
Edit your PATH in setup.bat so that it looks like this -
set PATH=C:/opt/ros/fuerte/x86/bin;C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Scripts;%PATH%
Remember to move the files out from the external Scripts folder(not the original Scripts folder found in Python27).

It does actually say "add C:\Python27\ and C:\Python27\Scripts to your PATH." You can do that in setup.bat, or in windows user/system environment variable settings, or even in registry.
