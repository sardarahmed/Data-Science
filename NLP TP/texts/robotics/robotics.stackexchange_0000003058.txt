Q:

Why cannot we find EtherCAT shields?

I have a riddle about EtherCAT in mind and I'd like to have your point of view about it...
With the rise of open platforms and hardware, and easily accessible embedded machines, it is now rather straightforward to install a RT system such as Xenomai on a raspberry PI, or a beagleboard black, or whatever cheap platform you prefer...
Now to connect these a RT bus would be really cool (e.g. EtherCAT...).
Hence my question: every hobbyist face the same problems with RT communication, so is there any good reason why there does not exist any open EtherCAT shield for raspberry PI or beagleboards? It would solve so many problems...
Any thoughts on why? Any idea?

A:

There are some small EtherCAT peripherals, like Shadow's Ronex system, which gives you a great deal of I/O, although it's not in the 'shield' form factor.
