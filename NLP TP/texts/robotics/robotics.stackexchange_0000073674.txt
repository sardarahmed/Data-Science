Q:

Source for RVIZ_Plugin_Tutorials

Title says it all, I've been googling and have been unable t find the actual source code. Where's the documentation for this?
With a catkin example CMakeLists.txt file if possible.

A:

Searching for rviz plugin tutorials on Google gets me to wiki.ros.org/rviz_plugin_tutorials, which then under Package Summary has a link to github.com/ros-visualization/visualization_tutorials where rviz_plugin_tutorials is one of the sub directories.
Make sure to select the correct branch, some things have changed (especially with how rviz handles / links to plugins).
