Q:

Graphically monitor CPU - RAM etc over ROS

Hi,
I am using an ODROID-XU4  on a quadrotor. On the ODROID is running ROS. To the Odroid is also connected to a  camera flea3 by PointGrey. I am launching the pointgrey node to connect to the camera and it is working fine.
I am not sure but it seems that when I increase the frequency of acquisition of the camera (from 30 Hz and greater) the quadrotor becomes a bit unstable. It does not happen all the time but sometime. Because I don't know where this behavior is coming from I thought that it could come from the CPU/RAM which are working too much.
For this reason I was thinking if there is some tool which enables to store a rosbag file which then can be easily plotted to check the allocation of RAM and CPU when the frequency changes.
Thanks in advance for your help.

A:

There are not many runtime performance monitoring solutions for ROS. You can look at the following tools:

rqt_top It's similar to top for ROS nodes running locally on your machine. It requires a graphical desktop environment to run since it only monitors the local machine it is running on.
drums I wrote this tool two years ago. It should do what you are looking for both at host and process level. The documentation is far from perfect, but I may be able to assist you get it to run on your machine. You can log the data both to rosbag and to a time series database.
arni This is similar to drums but with better documentation. The main difference is drums does not rely on ROS for gathering the statistics and also implements its own light-weight publish/subscribe middleware to collect and store the performance metrics. Unlike drums, arni comes with some fault recovery mechanisms built-in.
