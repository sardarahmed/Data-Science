Q:

Set the maximum speed of robot

I would like to know how can I set the maximum speed of the robot manipulator. I am currently using set_max_acceleration_scaling_factor(1), is there any function that can help to increase it's speed.

A:

In your ros_package their should be a joint_limits.yaml file, in which the speed limits are set.
There you can set the speed limit, or turn of speed limit by setting has_velocity_limits to false. The yaml file should look similar to the following:
joint_limits:
    joint_1:
    min_position: -2.84
    max_position: 2.84
    has_velocity_limits: true
    max_velocity: 3.141592653589793
    has_acceleration_limits: false
    max_acceleration: 0
