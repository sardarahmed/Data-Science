Q:

Is wait_for_service required before every service call?

Hi, I don't fully understand the mechanics of rospy's wait_for_service function. Are we required to call wait for service every time we want to call the service, or only once when creating the ServiceProxy?

A:

You don't need to call wait_for_service, but it is highly advisable, since you want to make sure that your service is available before calling it.

What can cause the service to become unavailable?

Too many things actually. From connection problems to bad code handling that would kill the node that runs the service. Keep in mind that you can set a timeout in wait_for_services after which an exception will be thrown.

The most common reason is at startup that the other node has not yet advertised the service or the connection has not been established.
