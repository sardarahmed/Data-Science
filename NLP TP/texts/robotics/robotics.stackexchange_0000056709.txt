What you mean by "write a tf"?

I don't know but when i want to creating a map using hector slam, it needs a tf?

Is your laser fixed on a robot or are you using laser alone without anything else? It would be nice to make your question more detailed - more details will lead to better answers ;)

Did you check this tutorial: http://wiki.ros.org/hector_slam/Tutorials/SettingUpForYourRobot ?

Thanks for your attention dear.
yes, i read tutorial but i don't understand it completely.
my laser fixed on robot by two dynamixel motor (roll and pitch) to Balance it by gyro,
how can i write a tf with this stuff?

A:

Ok, with laser scanner fixed on two servos you need following:

create appropriate URDF model (including robot, those servos / joints, your laser scanner)
publish current angles of servos to joint_states topic (sensor_msgs/JointState)
run robot_state_publisher which will transform joint state to TF
read carefully tutorial on how to setup hector_slam on your robot

Then, there will be TF transformation between laser scanner (laser_link in the tutorial) and robot base (base_link).
