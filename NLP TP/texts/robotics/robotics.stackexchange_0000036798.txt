Q:

Manipulator arm Gazebo

Hello. I want to simulate a manipulator arm on a mobile robot (URDF) in Gazebo. What package I must use? I saw that the arm_navigation package is used in RVIZ. Can I use this package in Gazebo? Could anyone suggest my another package or mode to simulate a manipulator arm in Gazebo?
Thanks very much and sorry for my English.

A:

You could look at the shadow_robot. This is a manipulator called the Shadow Hand. It provides a good example of a manipulator in Gazebo. Try this tutorial.
You could also try cob_arm_navigation.

Hi! Finally I have done that with pr2_mechanism (pr2_controller_manager, ...), adding controllers to the joints and my arm is working very well. Thanks for your help.
