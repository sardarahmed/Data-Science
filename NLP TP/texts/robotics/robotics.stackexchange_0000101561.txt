Q:

Does axclient.py exist for ROS2?

The axclient.py documented here is quite a handy tool for quick debugging and testing.  Does its equivalent exist for ROS2?

Just to be clear, axclient.py provides GUI, not CLI. I bet those who lands on this question are looking for axclient-equivalent (i.e. GUI), which I doubt exists in ros2 yet.
