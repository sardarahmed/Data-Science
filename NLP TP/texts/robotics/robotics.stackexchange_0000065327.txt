Problem detecting yaml-cpp in Hydro installation on MACOS Maveriks

I'm trying to install ROS hydro on a macbook running Maveriks 10.9.5.  The machine setup was cloned from a Lion machine which means I've had some problems with out-of-date dependencies and so on.  My current problem comes when the system tries to build  camera_calibration_parsers which fails with the error
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:16 (if):
if given arguments:
"VERSION_GREATER" "0.5"

Unknown arguments specified
I have managed to do a fresh-ish install of ROS on an iMAC running Maveriks 10.9.5 so I suspect the problem is legacy libraries on this machine.  By comparing the two installations it looks like the build is failing to instantiate YAML_CPP_VERSION (and a bunch of other YAML based variables used by cmake)
The problem may be that yaml doesn't appear in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages but instead appears in /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages . I've uninstalled and reinstalled pip (making sure I have the correct version) but this doesn't seem to have made a difference.  rosdep claims to be able to find everything it needs.
I'm a little wary of trying something drastic (like deleting the contents of /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages) so was wondering if anyone had a clearer idea why catkin_make_isolated can't detect yaml properly

Isn't yaml-cpp a C++ library, not a Python library?

A:

Yes.  I finally tracked the problem down to the fact that pkg-config was not installed in /usr/local/bin for some reason.
