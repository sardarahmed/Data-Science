Q:

Unreliable (UDP) Transport Hints in Rospy and Rosjava

I haven't been able to find anything to indicate if subscribers for rospy or rosjava can currently use UDP transport.
It looks like rospy uses UDPROS at some point, but I haven't seen examples or documentation on its use.
Thanks!

A:

No, they cannot.  The code in rospy is an incomplete/unfinished implementation.
