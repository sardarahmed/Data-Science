Q:

tutorial/1.4/beginner/build world problem with saving

Hi,
Thanks for your help in advance :)
I've installed gazebo 1.4 from source on a gentoo machine.
I created a world and placed some static objects in it.  I then deleted a couple of the objects and then saved the world file and closed gazebo.  When I restarted gazebo with the saved world, the objects I deleted were still there.  It happened both the times I tried it.
Also, when I start gazebo, I get some unfamiliar messages and I'm not sure what they mean:
$ gazebo  myworld.sdf &
