Q:

catkin and CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG

Should I be able to set CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG or the variants for the other build types in my CMakeLists.txt for caktin packages? It seems to have no effect. Setting CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS seems to work, but I want to set different defines depending on the build type.

A:

Yes, it does actually seem to work if you have no typo in -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug...
