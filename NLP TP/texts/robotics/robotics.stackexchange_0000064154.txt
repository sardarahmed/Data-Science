Q:

Instalation of ar_pose

Hi,
could you tell me, is it possible to use ar_pose on Indigo?
Where I can find updated and stable version of this package?
Before I use catkin_make I have to download cv_bridge and other dependencies?

Hi,
You can use Max Schwarz's fork of the package ar_tools at github (make sure to get the catkin branch)  which compiles and works fine on hydro, might work fine in indigo as well:
