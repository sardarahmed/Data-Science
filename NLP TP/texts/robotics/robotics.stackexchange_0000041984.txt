Q:

How to give multiple users on one computer access to run ROS?

I have installed ROS in my home directory as an administer user. When other users, even with admin privilege, try to run ros commands, they receive the command can not be found message. Is there anyway that I give other users access to run ROS using my software?

On Ubuntu 18, ROS Melodic I have the same problem. On the same machine I need to connect two different users and both of them to run ROS without interfering to each other.
Any new developments?

A:

The easiest way is to install the binary packages (assuming you are running Ubuntu).
Update: Do not try sharing access to source trees. Only one user should run rosmake within a working copy. Users should each create their own separate working copies when doing shared development. Synchronize those changes via normal source repository commits and updates.
