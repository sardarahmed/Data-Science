Q:

Rosjava: Problem sending a string to the sample

Dear all,
I am playing around with the rosjava tutorial. When running the Listener node together with the talker node it works fine and the Hello world is printed out. But if I run
rostopic pub /chatter std_msgs/String "Hello"

It will not work anymore. The listener throws the following exceptions:
01.02.2012 14:52:15 org.ros.internal.node.topic.UpdatePublisherRunnable run
SCHWERWIEGEND: java.lang.RuntimeException: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused
01.02.2012 14:52:17 org.ros.internal.node.topic.UpdatePublisherRunnable run
SCHWERWIEGEND: org.ros.exception.RosRuntimeException: Connection exception:   eich-ThinkPad/192.168.103.42:39099

A:

I solved the issue temporarily be setting ROS_IP to 127.0.0.1. How can I tell the Listener Sample node to use the external IP of my machine? Is the Listerner Sample node bound to localhost?

Something is wrong with your network configuration. You shouldn't get a "no route to host" exception when trying to connect to your own external IP.

Have you tried setting ROS_IP to your external IP? 192.168.103.42 in your example log output.
