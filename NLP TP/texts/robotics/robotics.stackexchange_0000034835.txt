Q:

bumblebee2 or bumblebee1394, this is the question

hi all,
I want to acquire images from a Bumblebee2 stereo camera device (IEEE1394 HW interface), in order to publish them , so they could be available for other nodes. Browsing the existing software at ros.org, I've found two packages that can be useful to do it:
 http://www.ros.org/browse/details.php?name=bumblebee1394

 http://www.ros.org/browse/details.php?name=bumblebee2

So, my question is, can anyone give me an advice / comment about why using one package or the other ?
I'm using ROS-electric.
Thanks, community help is very valuable !

A:

i have been using a slightly changed version of the bumblebee2 node.
the changed i made to the node can be found in this answer: http://answers.ros.org/question/1118/bumblebee2-640x480-under-diamondback?answer=1894#1894.
these fixes work for diamondback, im not sure if they work under electric (it probably works unless some messages have changed by a lot).
(yes i know this is quite an old question, just posting for anyone with the same question)

Electric should probably work, too. I don't recall any significant camera interface changes for that release.
