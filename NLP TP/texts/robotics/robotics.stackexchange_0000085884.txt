Please change the title of your question to be a bit more descriptive. Your current title is too generic.

The error is not Invoking "make -j4 -l4" failed but /bin/sh: 1: pyrcc5: not found. Is pyrcc5 installed? (in Ubuntu, you can get it in the pyqt5-dev-tools package, not sure whether ROS uses another version).

A:

I had a similar problem, running sudo apt install pyqt5-dev-tools fixed the problem for me.
