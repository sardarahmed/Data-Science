Q:

Unable to load msg

I am looking for the Pseudoranges from the Satellite to the GPS receiver mounted on the Husky robot. I thought maybe I could find them logged in the message which has the  data type "nmea_msgs/Sentence"  however when I use :
rosmsg  show  nmea_msgs/Sentence
I get this error : Unable to load msg  [nmea_msgs/Sentence] : Cannot locate message [Sentence]: unknown package [nmea_msgs] on search path ................ and the error goes on
Any clue why is this happening ? , rosmsg show is working find with all other message types
Thanks in advance,
Naz

Does that mean I will not be able to comprehend message with datatype Sentence (from package nmea_msgs) ? . Does this mean my only option would be migrating to hydro from fuerte ? Is there any way around it ?

You can likely install it from source into your workspace.
