Q:

indigo desktop-full

Hi,
I don't find what is missing to the indigo packages to be able to get the desktop-full. At this time, indigo gets 368 packages and hydro 1260. But I think that when we install hydro-desktop-full, not all of them are installed. Am I wrong ?
So my question is: where can I find the list of packages needed to have the desktop-full (and so what is needed to add from source) ?
Thanks
Configuration: Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr / indigo
