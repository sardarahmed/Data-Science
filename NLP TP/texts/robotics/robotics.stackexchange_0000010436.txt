Q:

What is the difference between ROSberry Pi builds?

I went to go install ROS for my Rassberry Pi and found that there are 5 different variants. What is the difference between them and where can I go to learn about these differences for future updates?
Link to the ROSberryPi downloads I'm talking about:

A:

Well this is embarrassing. I didn't realize they are in fact different distributions not variants. Also found the page where you can find out more about them: http://wiki.ros.org/Distributions
