Q:

Dependencies not satisfied: ros-indigo-gazebo5-msgs?

I am releasing a package via Bloom into ROS Indigo that depends on gazebo_msgs. Since the Indigo-supported version of Gazebo v2.x, I am confused where the buildfarm is finding the dependency of gazebo5_msgs. How do I explicitly state that this package does not depend on gazebo5_msgs?

A:

Looks like the system that run bloom was configured to use our rosdep overlay typically used to release ROS wrappers for gazebo new versions not officially supported in ROS.
If you still have access to that system, you can easily verify it by running:
rosdep resolve gazebo_msgs

If this is the case, in order to use the standard ROS supported versions again, I would suggest to remove the 00-* files in /etc/rosdep/sources.list.d , run rosdep updateand launch bloom again to generate a new -release version of your debian control files.

The combination of yours and Tully's answers are absolutely spot on. I had the OSRF gazebo sources added to my sources list, but had not actually installed ros-indigo-gazebo5-msgs. Cleaning my environment of the OSRF sources, and then re-blooming worked like a charm. Thanks guys!
