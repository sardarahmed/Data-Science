I will not write your code for you. We're here to offer free advice; if you want someone to build your software for you, they'll probably want to get paid for their time.
That said, you probably want the <include> tag in roslaunch: http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML/include
You may also want to read the roslaunch tips for large projects tutorial, because it discusses a lot of the different ways that you can use roslaunch to include other launch files, set parameters and run nodes.
