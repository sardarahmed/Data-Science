Q:

Using RRT* from OMPL as global planner in ROS

I want to use RRT* as global planner for my turtlebot. Should I reinvent the wheel by writing the algorithms myself from scratch (as a plugging) as suggested here:  https://answers.ros.org/question/320619/how-can-i-change-the-default-global-path-planning-algorithm-a-and-dijkstra-into-my-custom-path-planner-rrt/
or can I use something like OMPL, if yes, how ?  I read something about ompl_ros_interface, but in the documentation page it is said that ompl_ros_interface is not available for Kinetic.

And if its not quite what you're looking for, it'll at least get you 80% there.
