Q:

Adding Octomap data to planning scene in ROS Electric

I am trying to use data from an octomap for collision avoidance in arm_navigation. Octomap_server publishes a series of collision objects on the octomap_collision_object topic so I was hoping that I could use these but this does not work (I tried remapping to the collision_object topic). Is this something that would have worked in diamondback but doesn't with the electric planning scene architecture? How can I add the octomap data to the arm_navigation planning scene in ROS electric? Thanks.

A:

Maybe the version of octomap_server for Electric doesn't publish the collision map. I have a version of octomap_server that was ported from Diamondback to Electric that does publish a collision map on "collision_map_out".
You can see the version here:
https://sbpl.pc.cs.cmu.edu/redmine/projects/full-body-nav/repository/revisions/master/show/octomap_server
You can get the code:
git clone https://sbpl.pc.cs.cmu.edu/redmine/people/mike/full-body-nav.git

I know that that version works and does what you want.

Happy to hear it. It seems like you are as well :)

Collision map publishing on the same topic has now been backported to octomap_server in octomap_mapping (trunk).
