Note: this only answers the question in the context of ROS 1.

Default is TCP (ie: reliable).
Unless user specifies the unreliable transport hint.

Are there some other protocols supported as well ?

No, not by default.
There are some alternative transports available, but you'd have to install those yourself (they're old, but see ethzasl_message_transport fi).
See also ROS/Technical Overview - Topic Transports.

@gvdhoorn : Then isnt ROS similar to the ROS2 QoS in respect to the Communication Protocol ? Both can either select reliablity (TCP) or Best Effort (UDP) ?

Well .. they're similar like a car is similar to a bike: both have wheels, but I wouldn't say that a bike shares much of the other characteristics of a car.
If you really want to, you could see TCPROS and UDPROS as primitive forms of what DDS can do for you. But I wouldn't do that.
