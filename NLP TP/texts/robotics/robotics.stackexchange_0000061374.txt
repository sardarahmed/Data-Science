Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Removed distro

I have just remove groovy, and now when i launch a new terminal it says :
/opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash any file or folder of this kind.
So how can I stop ros from searching the disro groovy?

A:

Remove the source /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash line from your .bashrc file in your home directory.
If you've upgraded to Hydro, you could also just update it to source the setup file for Hydro.

BTW: this has been asked (and answered) many times before. See for instance "terminal starts with: bash: source/opt/ros/fuerte/setup.bash: No such file or directory" and "ubuntu/ros error". A Google search using "no such file or directory" setup.bash site:answers.ros.org turns up many results.
