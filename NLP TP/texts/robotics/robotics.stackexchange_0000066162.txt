Q:

Modify Rviz fixed frame from ros node

I need to interact with a rviz UI which is running as a rqt pluging inside a bigger GUI. Basically, I need to change the "fixed frame" when some event is triggered.
I know that using librviz you can greatly interact with rviz, but that requieres that the rviz UI is created and launched programatically from the interacting node, which is not the case (the rviz UI is already running as a separate QT plugin).
Is there any way of modifying the configuration of rviz from a remote node? Is it possible at all for a ROS node to interact with rviz through topics or services?
Thank you and best regards,

A:

I'm not sure I understand you correctly, but programmatically controlling camera viewpoint (and animating it) is possible using the rviz_animated_view_controller plugin. This is a regular RViz plugin, so does not require you to use librviz at all, and you interact with it using ROS msgs.
