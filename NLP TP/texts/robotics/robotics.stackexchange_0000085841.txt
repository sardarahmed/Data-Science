Q:

Which unity do the linear and angular speed have in the teleop_twist_keyboard node?

Hi,
I was wondering the unity of linear and angular speed when running the teleop_twist_keyboard node in ROS, are there m/s and rad/s? I could not find anywhere this information.
Additionally, as time dependent speeds, do they use the real time or simulated time?
Cheers,
Simone.

Please see #q248465 and #q212296 for related (and possibly duplicate) questions.
Summary: everything is in SI units, following REP-103.
