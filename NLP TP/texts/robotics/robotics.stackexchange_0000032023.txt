Q:

Polygonal Map not working in rviz

I've been trying to get PolygonalMapDisplay to work in rviz [specifically with the kinect demos] In rviz the polygonal map display says "plugin from package [mapping_rviz_plugin] not loaded for display class [mapping_rviz_plugin::PolygonalMapDisplay])
I've looked around in the file system and can't find any Polygonal Map stuff. Does anyone know where I might be able to find this plugin/how to get polygonal maps to work in rviz?
Thanks!

A:

I had the same problem with the kinect.
I solved the problem in this way:
"rosmake mapping_rviz_plugin"
