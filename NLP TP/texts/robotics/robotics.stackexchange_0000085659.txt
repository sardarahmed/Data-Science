Q:

package moveit_simple_grasps in kinetic

Hey everyone,
I have written a small plugin for ROS after this tutorial:
http://wiki.ros.org/pluginlib/Tutorials/Writing%20and%20Using%20a%20Simple%20Plugin
Now I have already installed a lot of packages that I can do a simple catkin_make in the ws, but no I am getting this error:
    -- Could not find the required component 'moveit_simple_grasps'. The following CMake error indicates that you either need to install the package with the same name or change your environment so that it can be found.
CMake Error at /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:83 (find_package):

      Could not find a package configuration file provided by
      "moveit_simple_grasps" with any of the following names: 

moveit_simple_graspsConfig.cmake
moveit_simple_grasps-config.cmake

Now I have already installed this package via apt:
 % sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-simple-grasping

but I am getting the same error as mentioned before.
I have only found the requested package for hydro and indigo... can someone tell my what package I should install to get my tutorial compiled?
Thx in advance! :-)

The package you installed is probably not the correct one: note how the error message mentions moveit_simple_grasps, not simple-grasping.
The former may be found here: moveit_simple_grasps.
The latter here: simple_grasping.
