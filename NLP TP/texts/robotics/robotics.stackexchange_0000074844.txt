Q:

How to use SDF with ROS packages in gazebo?

Using ROS Indigo and Gazebo 2.2 on Ubuntu 14.04
I have created a model for a robot that is similar to Clearpath's Jackal. What I am trying to do is have the already-created Jackal packages apply to my robot model. In other words, I am trying to substitute the model of Clearpath's Jackal with my robot model so that Clearpath's Jackal packages can apply to my model.
The robot I made is in SDF while the packages for Clearpath's jackal reference and use URDF/XACRO.  Does anyone know if it is possible to implement the SDF files and/or remove the URDF/XACRO files from the packages so that the Clearpath's Jackal's packages would apply to my model? If it is possible, what would be the best implementation process?
Thanks!
Pooja

Hey! did you get it? I am having a similar problem now.

A:

In the title line you mentioned "in Gazebo" but in the body I got the impression that you're willing to operate a real robot using SDF. If I'm so please update the title.
Anyways, based on my assumption above, AFAIK you can't / will be very limited to operate your ROS-based robot with SDF. See #q204803.
