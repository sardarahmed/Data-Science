Q:

Dart is crashing on startup

So I was able to recompile Gazebo with Dart, but I keep getting this bizarre error:
***** Internal Program Error - assertion (dartChildLink.get() != __null) failed in virtual void gazebo::physics::DARTJoint::Init():
on loading a world. What should I do? Did I miscompile Dart? Is it a problem on Gazebo's side? This is Gazebo 1.4 btw.

A:

Apparently, Gazebo will crash if you try to fix a model to the world frame and load the world with the Dart engine. I have submitted a ticket on this issue.
