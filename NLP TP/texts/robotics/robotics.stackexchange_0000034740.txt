Q:

Kinect not detected

Hi,
I previously posted an issue regarding errors in openni drivers installation (http://answers.ros.org/question/2297/openni-drivers-installation-errors). With the answer to this question i was able to install the drivers successfully.
Then i ran the openni_camera node's openni_node.launch file, which says the devices is not connected.
aravindhan@rrc-laptop:~$ roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch

Please post the output of "lsusb"

A:

Reinstalled Ubuntu 11.04 (32bit) installed ROS electric and everything else. Now started getting the pointcloud from Kinect in rviz.
Hope this is not the solution to the question but since I couldn't find much help on this, I had to go this way.
So this is one of the solution to the problem.
Thanks
Karthik
