Problem with Indigo and Gazebo 2.2

I have a problem with Gazebo 2.2. When I launch gazebo, I see this error

A:

At the moment I replaced "http://gazebosim.org/models" in "http://old.gazebosim.org/models". Now it all works!
Thanks to all!!!
UPDATE
The best way to solve this problem is update Gazebo 2.2, but you must add packages.osrfoundation.org at Ubuntu repositories.
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu trusty main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-latest.list'
wget http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -

Then if you update Ubuntu, It install Gazebo 2.2.5.
Now it all works!

interesting...
where did you change that link?
in which file?
Comment by Stefano Primatesta on 2014-12-15:
In "source /usr/local/share/gazebo-2.2/setup.sh".
I think there's a problem with http://gazebosim.org/models link.

I replaced it in /usr/share/gazebo and /usr/share/gazebo-2.2. Still the problem persists. Infact, gazebo stil uses the previous url

After modifying the URL you have to source the same file:
source /usr/share/gazebo
source /usr/share/gazebo-2.2
