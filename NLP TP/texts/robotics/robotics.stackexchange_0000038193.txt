Q:

Getting static_map in amcl does not work

Hi there,
Yesterday I installed the latest updates (including the gazebo and navigation stacks). Since then, the amcl does not work anymore. I traced the problem back to the service call AMCL makes to the map_server to get the map.
This is the code (it is the standard code)
link:amcl_node.cpp line 495
The call is made (AMCL printing: Request for map failed; trying again...), but it never reaches the map_server service. I tried to call it manually via a terminal ( rosservice call static_map ) and then the service is carried out correctly and a response is sent.
I'm using Ubuntu 11.10 and ros-electric.
Thank you

A:

It was in the namespacing of the service. My amcl node ran in another namespace ("/turtlebot") then the map_server ("/"). It will work if both nodes run in the same namespace.
