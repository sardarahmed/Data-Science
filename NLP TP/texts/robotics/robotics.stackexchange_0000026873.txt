Q:

Gazebo complains about default_robot_hw_sim

I originally opened this in ros but it may be gazebo issue?
Gazebo complains about default_robot_hw_sim in hydro. BTW if I run the script that is mentioned it runs says successful but still get the same error.
pluginlib WARNING: In file /tmp/buildd/ros-hydro-gazebo-ros-control-2.3.3-0raring-20131021-0406/src/default_robot_hw_sim.cpp PLUGINLIB_DECLARE_CLASS is deprecated, please use PLUGINLIB_EXPORT_CLASS instead. You can run the script 'plugin_macro_update' provided with pluginlib in your package source folder to automatically and recursively update legacy macros.  Base = base_class_type, Derived = derived_class_type

A:

That's just a deprecation warning message. You can ignore it. I've submitted a gazebo_ros_control pull request that, among other things, eliminates the source of that message.
