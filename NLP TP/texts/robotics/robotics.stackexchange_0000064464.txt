Q:

Using the Navigation stack on a larger vehicle

Hello Everyone,
I have a mobile robot(Rectangle size) of about 10X16 ft. I am trying to make it autonomous in an indoor area. The scene is not gonna be much cluttered. Imagine it is in pose A and I need it go to pose B.
I can get encoder data from the Omnidirectional wheels on the base and the laser scan data from the LIDAR. Could you please advise whether its advisable to move ahead with this package for this problem?. Also have anyone out there tried using ros navigation on a larger vehicle?. Please let me know, Thank you.

A:

I believe as long as you set the 'holonomic robot' parameter to true, specify the footprint (size of your robot) of your vehicle properly, set the voxel grid parameter to true (assuming your robot is probably pretty high and you dont want to hit something from the ceiling) instead of just a 2D costmap so your 3D LIDAR data is actually used for height information as well, i believe you should not have a problem using the nav stack. You just have to make sure your velocity and acceleration values are correct/reasonable for the robot of your size.
Have a look at http://wiki.ros.org/costmap_2d as well as http://wiki.ros.org/base_local_planner
