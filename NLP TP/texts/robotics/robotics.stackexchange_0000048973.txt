Q:

How to save file to the current directory with roslaunch?

i write a simple C++ program to save an image
cv::imwrite(filename,visual_img);

when i run it directly from Eclipse, the image is saved in the current directory (the directory where the Eclipse project file is in). but when i run it with roslaunch
<node pkg="testProg" type="testProg" name="testProg" />

the image is saved in home/.ros
so what should i do to save it to the current directory?
p.s. i encounter the same problem when i try to load the image. always fail to load if i put the image in the current directory when i run it by roslaunch.

A:

See the attributes section on the roslaunch wiki page.
Using the "cwd" attribute, you can specify that the node should be started using the executable's directory as its working-directory.  The default behavior is to use $ROS_HOME directory.
For example:
<launch>
  <node name="test" pkg="my_package" type="my_node" cwd="node" />
</launch>

However, it is generally better to use $ROS_HOME subdirectories for files you want to write.
