If you put quotes around a URL then a link doesn't get rendered. If you just put the URL in with nothing around it a link does get rendered.

@jayess someone from ROS community say that to me so that link not disappear after changing URL

I don't understand your comment, but if you look at every instance in which you put quotes around a link that link renders as text not as a link. I removed the ' from this one as a demonstration.
