Q:

Separate ROS android library

There is plenty of disparate info on ros.org about creating Android apps compatible with ROS. What I can't find (in any complete fashion) is whether or not there exists a stand-alone jar library which I can add to a Java (Eclipse) project that will let me send and receive ROS messages, without requireing a full rosjava install.
I found this but without more information I can't tell if it's close to what I'm looking for: http://www.ros.org/wiki/android

A:

I'm not sure what you're looking for.  A library which implements ROS communication protocols is a ROS library.  I suggest you look at rosjava.

... to provide some limited ROS compatibility with remote nodes, on a machine with a full ROS installation.

I'm looking for "drop-in" ROS capability for mobile development. That is, I don't want to have to perform the entire ROS installation process (for various convenience reasons). Specifically, in the ideal case, I want a JAR that I can include in an Eclipse Android application...
