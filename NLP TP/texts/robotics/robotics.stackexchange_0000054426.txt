Q:

Authorization required when checking-out bullet from kforge

Hello,
I am trying to check out bullet from kforge with the following command.

hg clone
https://kforge.ros.org/geometry/bullet

Then it asks an authorization and spitted out a warning message.

warning: kforge.ros.org certificate
with fingerprint (my pc's mac-address)
not verified (check hostfingerprints
or web.cacerts config setting) http
authorization required realm:
kforge.ros.org Restricted Area user:

Mercurial version is 2.6.2, python 2.7.2 and running on Mac and the Ubuntu Linux.
Any recommendation would be appreciate.

A:

Repos on kforge are being decommissioned this is the generic response for a repo which has gone away. http://ros-users.122217.n3.nabble.com/code-ros-org-and-kforge-ros-org-td4020313.html
