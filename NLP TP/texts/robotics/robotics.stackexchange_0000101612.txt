Q:

Fanuc CRX-10iA/L on ROS Noetic

I’m working on a project that involves a Fanuc CRX-10iA/L robotic arm.
I have Ubuntu 20.04 as a dual boot in my windows machine, but the fanuc_experimental repository doesn’t mention anything about ROS Noetic. What would you say is the easiest, fastest, and least error-prone way out?

Back up my data, uninstall Focal and install (dual boot) Bionic/Xenial. In this case, would there be any reason for not choosing Ubuntu Bionic/ROS Melodic over Kinetic when it comes to Fanuc CRX-10iA/L?

Keep ubuntu 20.04 and build things from source. Is that even possible?

Would you have any other suggestions?
Edit:
When running the command below according to the readme in ros-industrial/fanuc as pointed out by @gvdhoorn that's what I get.
theodoro@ubuntu:~/catkin_ws$ rosdep install --from-paths src/ --ignore-src --rosdistro noetic
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
fanuc_crx10ia_support: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [fanuc_resources]
fanuc_r2000ib_support: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [fanuc_resources]
fanuc_r2000ic_support: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [fanuc_resources]

How can I install this dependency?
Thank you so much.

Have you seen the readme in ros-industrial/fanuc, to which ros-industrial/fanuc_experimental refers?

Thank you for your comment, @gvdhoorn. I've been reading a lot of your answers lately and I'm a huge fan of the work you do for the ROS community.
I saw this readme a few minutes after posting the question but was not sure how the "experimental" side of things would play out when it comes to this specific package.
Is building the fanuc_crx10ia_support package possible and supported in ROS Noetic or would you advise me to use ROS Melodic instead?

I don't believe I can make it any clearer than what the readme states:

Building the packages on newer (or older) versions of ROS is in most cases possible and supported. For example: building the packages in this repository on Ubuntu Bionic/ROS Melodic or Ubuntu Focal/ROS Noetic systems is supported.

did you only git clone https://github.com/ros-industrial/fanuc_experimental.git?
If so: that's not enough.
When building fanuc_experimental from source, you must also clone ros-industrial/fanuc into the same source space.
