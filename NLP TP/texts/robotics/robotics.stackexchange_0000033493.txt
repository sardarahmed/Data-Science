Q:

About "openni_kinect" stack

Hi,
Can someone point me to a specific "openni_kinect" or similar that has already point cloud built. I was looking at "openni_nodelet.cpp" installed from source. Previously, I was looking at "openni_nodelet.cpp" installed from apt-get, it has such a point cloud already, unfortunately, because of using with eclipse, I need to installed it via version control (from source).  Is there any?

What I mean by "point cloud built" is there is such a functionality that I can extract and manipulate data based on X, Y, Z in cartesian coordinate(preferably)..

Can you explain what you mean by having a "point cloud built"?

A:

I'm not sure if this is what you need, but you can checkout the openni_camera package using mercurial from: https://kforge.ros.org/openni/openni_ros

Unfortunately, this one doesn't offer/provide point cloud. Thanks anyway.
