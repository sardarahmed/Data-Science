Q:

Â¿GPS Glonass Ublox7 with nmea_serial_driver?

Hello I am trying to connect a GPS Usb Glonass Ublox7 with nmea_serial_driver and I can't. I have checked where it is connected using ls / dev / tty * and I have it connected in ttyACM1.
If I run the command:
$ sudo cat /dev/ttyACM1 
or 
$ sudo cat /dev/gps1
I get NMEA sentence. However when executing the command:
$ rosrun nmea_serial_driver _port:/dev/ttyACM1 _baud:=115200
I get the following error that can't open port
The Glonass GPS supports any standard baud rate.
If I run the following command:
$ groups 
I get the following:
: lauratfg adm dialout fax cdrom floppy tape sudo audio dip video plugdev input nopasswdlogin lpadmin scanner gpio i2c spi sambashare samba
I don't know what else to do ... Help please. This gps doesn't work with nmea_serial_driver?
Thank you. Greetings.

A:

The problem was that I had the gpsd daemon installed.
The solution has been to find which process was using the port for this I opened a terminal with the following command:
$ ps aux
After this, all the processes appear in the terminal. I looked for the one called gpsd which had a number assigned for example 3223.
I opened another terminal and ran the following command:
$ sudo kill -9 3223
From here, I was able to run the node nmea_serial_driver. I also recommend disabling bluetooth
