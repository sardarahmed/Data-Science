A:

REP-0118 explains the depth image interface.
Assuming you are using the openni_launch package, the topics published are documented here. From what you asked, you probably want one of these:

/camera/depth/image
/camera/depth/points

The image is a 2D depth matrix containing floating point distances in meters. The points are a 3D point cloud in the camera's frame of reference (/camera_depth_optical_frame).
