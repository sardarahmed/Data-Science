Q:

SLAM without landmarks?

First, is it possible to build map without landmarks for a robot in 2D? Let's say we have an aisle surrounded  by two walls. The robot moves in this environment. Now is it feasible to build such a SLAM problem? Or landmarks must be available to do so?

A:

I think you misunderstand what a landmark is. It is a generic, catch-all term for anything that a robot can recognize and use as part of a map. In particular, "landmarks" are important for feature-based SLAM algorithms, such as EKF-based slam. What you use for "landmarks" depends on what sensors are available to the robot.
In your case, since you haven't specified any sensing, then we'll assume the robot knows when it hits an object. Then any "landmark" is simply any time the robot bumps into something. If you do this with pen and paper, you'd just wander around and put an X any time you hit something, then turn and keep wandering. As time goes to infinity, you'd have a reasonable map of where object boundaries are, and what the object shapes are, as long as everything is static.
In this case, the "map" can just be a bitmap, where each pixel is 0 or 1, depending on if it has an object in that space or not. Scaling is up to the application.
I suggest doing a bit more research on these topics:

Occupancy Grid representation
Feature-based mapping
