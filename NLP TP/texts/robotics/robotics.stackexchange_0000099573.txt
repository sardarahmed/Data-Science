Q:

Win10+ROS 2: rosdep install errors: unsupported OS

I am getting some error on running rosdep install:

rosdep install --from-paths ./src --ignore-src -r -y --rosdistro galactic 

ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved to system dependencies:
cyclonedds: Unsupported OS [windows] 
rmw_fastrtps_shared_cpp: Unsupported OS [windows] 
rmw_cyclonedds_cpp: Unsupported OS [windows] 
rmw_fastrtps_dynamic_cpp: Unsupported OS [windows]
rmw_fastrtps_cpp: Unsupported OS [windows]
Continuing to install resolvable dependencies...
#All required rosdeps installed successfully

I would really recommend to not use -r in these command lines. It's just going to give the impression rosdep actually did something useful, while in reality it just ran into errors and gave up.
Then it merrily prints:
Continuing to install resolvable dependencies...
#All required rosdeps installed successfully

and if you don't pay attention, it's almost as-if things are ok ..

A:

There is no package manager on Windows. Unfortunately that means that rosdep cannot work there either as it relies on using a package manager to install the dependencies. The Windows installation instructions don't use rosdep they will be used by Linux and other platforms.
