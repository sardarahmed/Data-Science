Q:

NAV2 - Gazebo does not load model

Hi there,
I am running this tutorial https://navigation.ros.org/getting_started/index.html#installation
I am using ROS2 Foxy in Ubuntu 20.04 and Gazebo 9
I have exported the models as the tutorial explains:
 source /opt/ros/<ros2-distro>/setup.bash
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH:/opt/ros/<ros2-distro>/share/turtlebot3_gazebo/models

However, Gazebo is not loading:

I should have this behavior at the end when setting a 2D goal pose to the robot:

But I am not having success in localizing the robot...

Hi Steve,
I fulfilled the export statement with "ros2-foxy" instead of "foxy".
In addition, I have installed additional pkg:
sudo apt-get install ros-foxy-turtlebot3-gazebo*
sudo apt-get install ros-foxy-robot-state-publisher*
Then it worked.
Steve, I checked your podcast with Ricardo and the NAV2 documentation.
I decided to use NAV2 for our research, which uses an autonomous truck for off-road monitoring applications. We were using Autoware.Universe, but we checked that it is "too much" for our simple scenario and decision-making needs. I checked that NAV2 works for Ackermann types, but even for a big truck?
I am also "afraid" about the localization pkg: The NDT-MCL localizer you mentioned on the podcast. We do have velodynes, but we're off-road, so we don't have a previous map with landmarks to match. Is this something impeditive to using NAV2 off-road?
What is your consideration in this regard? Do you have some success of-road cases to share a link?
Thanks
