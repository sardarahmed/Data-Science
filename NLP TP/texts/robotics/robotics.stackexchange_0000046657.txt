It is easy to start two kinects separately on two different Terminals with the launch files for two kinects by editing the following

You don't need to edit the args. As the name says they are arguments. You can just pass different args to the same launch file and you will get two different launches.

A:

You can use one launch file which expects arguments that you have mentioned in the question as input. Then u can call the launch file twice with different arguments.
