Q:

MoveIt Kinematics Solver No kinematics solver instantiated for this group

Hi everyone,
I followed the moveit kinematics C++ API because I want to use the inverse kinematics solver. Firstly, I created my own URDF file, followed the tutorial about the MoveIt! Setup Assistant and created the config package for my robot.
The problem appears when I call setFromIK function from my JointStateGroup, the log shows:
[ERROR] [1360777186.680515210]: No kinematics solver instantiated for this group

And this is my launch file:
<launch>

<include file="$(find test_kinematics)/launch/upload_urdf.launch"/>

<node name="test_kinematics" pkg="test_kinematics" type="test_kinematics" respawn="false" output="screen">
 <rosparam name="kinematics_solver" command="load" file="$(find jim_moveit_config)/config/kinematics.yaml"/>
</node>

<node name="rviz" pkg="rviz" type="rviz" />

</launch>

And my kinematics.yaml file:
main_arm:
  kinematics_solver: pr2_arm_kinematics/PR2ArmKinematicsPlugin
  kinematics_solver_search_resolution: 0.005
  kinematics_solver_timeout: 0.05

main_arm is the name of my JointStateGroup.
Do you know where is my mistake ?
Thanks for your help ;)

A:

I found the solution. I used RobotModelLoader instead of KinematicsModelLoader to load the robot description. KinematicsModelLoader initializes the kinematics solver whereas RobotModelLoader doesn't.

which header file did you add when using KinematicsModelLoader?
Comment by JonasG on 2018-06-07:
@arthur_ Did the KinematicsModelLoader exist? I don't finde something about it. I have a similar problem.
I have uploaded my urdf, srdf and the kinematics.yaml, but it gives me an error:
No kinematics solver instantiated for group 'arm_1'
It would be great, if you can help me out.
