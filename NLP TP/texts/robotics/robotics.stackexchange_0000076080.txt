Q:

[ariac/gear] Could not load controller 'ariac/arm'

Hi,
I'd normally open an issue against osrf/gear; but there doesn't seem to be an issues tab on the Bitbucket repository.
I'm having some issues launching the GEAR examples.  Namely, when I do roslaunch osrf_gear sample.launch, gazebo opens with the simulation but the arm seems to appear on the ground and only moves very slowly.

I also get these error messages when launching:
[ERROR] [1472745023.718771045, 0.001000000]: Could not load controller 'ariac/arm' because controller type 'effort_controllers/JointTrajectoryController' does not exist.
[ERROR] [1472745023.718824000, 0.001000000]: Use 'rosservice call controller_manager/list_controller_types' to get the available types
Error when loading ariac/arm
[ERROR] [1472745023.728961885, 0.009000000]: Could not start controller with name ariac/arm because no controller with this name exists
I thought it may be as simple as me missing effort_controllers but I seem to have them installed already.  It seems as if the controller plugin is not existent?
For reference, I wrote this script to do my environment setup so this is what I am using: https://github.com/cwru-robotics/cwru_scripts/blob/master/ariac/ariac.sh
Thanks in advance for any help anyone may be able to give.

Also - the support forum for GEAR seems to be only available to OSRF employees: https://groups.google.com/a/osrfoundation.org/d/forum/ariac-support

A:

Turns out I didn't have ros-indigo-joint-trajectory-controller installed.  Oopz.
Do a sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-joint-trajectory-controller and have a nice day.
