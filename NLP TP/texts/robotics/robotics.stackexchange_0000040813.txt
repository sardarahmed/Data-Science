Q:

How to fix the motion_planning_rviz_plugin on Fuerte?

Hi All,
I really want to make rviz subscribe to arm_navigation_msgs::DisplayTrajectory and there is already a plugin for that:motion_planning_rviz_plugin in arm_navigation stack. Thanks!
However, there is a typo (an extra 'g') for the class field of class entry in its plugin_description.xml triggering the following error msg when adding Planning Display.
[ERROR] [1337924692.343620701]: The plugin for class 'motiong_planning_rviz_plugin/Planning' failed to load.  Error: Failed to load library /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/arm_navigation/motion_planning_rviz_plugin/lib/libmotion_planning_rviz_plugin.so. Make sure that you are calling the PLUGINLIB_REGISTER_CLASS macro in the library code, and that names are consistent between this macro and your XML. Error string: Cannot load library: No manifest in /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/arm_navigation/motion_planning_rviz_plugin/lib/libmotion_planning_rviz_plugin.so: motiong_planning_rviz_plugin__Planning

Based on what I understand from this tutorial, I naively corrected the name field of class entry in plugin_description.xml under /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/arm_navigation/motion_planning_rviz_plugin.
But, I got a segfault when adding Planning Display (Rviz suddenly quit, badly with an empty rviz-*.log).
Still, have no idea why that trivial correction for a seemingly trivial typo in the .xml leads to a segfault.
Do I overlook something?
Thank you.

I can confirm this bug (including the segfault after the naive fix), but I don't know what to do about it. I've updated the relevant bug with a link to this question. Maybe the next step would be to email Gil Jones directly?

Thanks Martin.

A:

Fix for both the type and the segfault released into arm_navigation 1.1.10 - it'll take a couple to get through the build farm and pushed into the public repos (it's already on ros-shadow-fixed for most distros).  Let me know if you encounter more problems.
