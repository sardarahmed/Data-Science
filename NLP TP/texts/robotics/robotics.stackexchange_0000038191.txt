This ticket says that 'fixed in r54208. running prerelease tests. '. Does it means that I can dist-upgrade ROS electric and fix that problem now or waiting for several days? Or how can I update it? Thank you~

check http://www.ros.org/debbuild/electric.html and look for p2_common 1.6.2.  I am not sure exactly how long it takes between ros-shadow-fixed and the ros repo.
