Q:

How can I generate wiki docs with Epydoc?

Using the default API documentation generator (Doxygen), the code API docs for http://wiki.ros.org/ackermann_vehicle_gazebo are generated correctly. I want to use Epydoc instead of Doxygen, so I made the following changes:

In ackermann_vehicle_gazebo/package.xml, I added a rosdoc element:

  <export>
    <architecture_independent/>
    <rosdoc config="rosdoc.yaml"/>
  </export>

In ackermann_vehicle_gazebo, I created a rosdoc.yaml file:

- builder: epydoc
  config: epydoc.config

In ackermann_vehicle_gazebo, I created an epydoc.config file:

[epydoc]
modules: nodes/*.py
docformat: restructuredtext
private: no

After making these changes, I received an e-mail from noreply@jenkins.ros.org with the subject "Build failed in Jenkins: doc-hydro-ackermann_vehicle #13". The mail contains a large number of messages, but I can't determine the error that caused them. What do I need to do in order to generate code API docs with Epydoc instead of Doxygen?

It would help to post a link to the Jenkins doc job that failed. Can you run rosdoc_lite locally on your development system?

Yes. If I do the following:

    cd catkin_ws/src/ackermann_vehicle/ackermann_vehicle_gazebo
    rosdoc_lite .

Documentation is written to ackermann_vehicle_gazebo/doc.

A:

The first problem is that rosdoc_lite ignores any output coming from epydoc which makes debugging / analyzing anything impossible. I have fixed this in: https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rosdoc_lite/issues/50
The second problem is that the epydoc.config file seems to be incorrect. When specifying the module file explicitly (rather then using wildcard matching) it started to generated html code. The patch for the ackermann_vehicle_gazebo package is here: https://github.com/wunderkammer-laboratory/ackermann_vehicle/pull/1
