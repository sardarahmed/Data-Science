As this is a popular question and a top google result, maybe the accepted answer should be changed to a current solution, like the one presented by merosss

A:

As of Indigo the correct command for ROS1 is:
rosversion -d

For ROS2 instead use:
echo $ROS_DISTRO

rosversion -d gives me "jade"
rosversion roscpp gives me "1.11.16"
Does it mean I am using 1.11.16 jade version?
Thank you
