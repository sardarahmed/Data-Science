Hi,
I'm very new on ROS.
I use Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty).
I want to install ROS on my Linux.
Which ROS is the best for my OS..??
Jade, or Indigo, or maybe there is something better then those two..??
Thank you.
Regards,
Seano

A:

ROS Indigo was made for Ubuntu 14.04 and is recommended for stability and more community support. You could also wait a bit and install ROS Kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04 in May.
