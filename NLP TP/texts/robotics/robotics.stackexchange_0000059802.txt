Q:

RVIZ through ssh

I want to know if there's a way to run rviz remotely.
I tried connecting to the PR2 and I'm just trying to use the rviz (just for some test, because i could actually use it from my computer connecting through the master).  I'm connecting with -X option: ssh -X user@robot
So, trying to use rviz, this is what I get:
rosrun rviz rviz # launching rviz

(process:27710): GConf-WARNING **: Client failed to connect to the D-BUS daemon:
//bin/dbus-launch terminated abnormally without any error message

(process:27710): GConf-WARNING **: Client failed to connect to the D-BUS daemon:
//bin/dbus-launch terminated abnormally without any error message

(process:27710): GConf-WARNING **: Client failed to connect to the D-BUS daemon:
//bin/dbus-launch terminated abnormally without any error message
QGtkStyle was unable to detect the current GTK+ theme.
[ INFO] [1401799963.738721331]: rviz version 1.9.34
[ INFO] [1401799963.738810068]: compiled against OGRE version 1.7.4 (Cthugha)
Segmentation fault

Any thoughts?

Just a wild guess: Is there even X running on the PR2?

I tried with xeyes (actually with tuxeyes) and it works pretty well the X server (as far as I can see)

A:

Rviz over SSH isn't supported.
