Q:

How to change laser scan point size and colour in ros3djs?

I'm visualising laser scan points in ros3dlib using the code snippet below. This works well but the points seem to be displayed as big white blocks on my web GUI. How do I change these to small red points?
let frontLaserScan = new ROS3D.LaserScan({
    ros : this.ros,
    tfClient : tfClient,
    topic : '/lidar_scan',
    rootObject : viewer.scene,
});

Worked it out! Just need to set the material option like this:
let frontLaserScan = new ROS3D.LaserScan({
    ros : this.ros,
    tfClient : tfClient,
    topic : '/lidar_scan',
    rootObject : viewer.scene,
    material : { size: 0.1, color: 0xff0000 }
});
