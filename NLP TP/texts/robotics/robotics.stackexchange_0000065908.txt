Q:

How can I create a map by using gmapping and a Hokuyo-Scanner?

Hey,
i have a Hokuyo-Scanner (UTM-30LX-EW) and i would like to create a  2D-Map with gmapping and visualize this in realtime with Rviz.
Can anyone tell me  what the best way is to do this?
my Steps are:
$ roscore 
$ rosrun urg_node urg_node _ip_address:="192.168.0.10" scan:=base_scan
$ rosrun gmapping slam_gmapping scan:base_scan
$ rosrun rviz rviz --> add map --> set topic to "map" --> set fixed frame to "map"
Rviz shows a massage "no map received!"
Is there any simple way to create and view a map by using Hokuyo-Scanner over Ethernet?
or what do i wrong?
thanks and best regards

Gmapping requires odometry. Check out hector_slam.
