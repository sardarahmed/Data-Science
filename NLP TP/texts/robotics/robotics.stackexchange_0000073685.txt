How to to get some of my apm data to ROS for doing 3D SLAM using MAVROS

i do /diagnostics and came to know that its because of the absence of GPS and other compulsory hardware. BUT i do not want to use GPS and compass data
THANKS in advance!

@hashim have you come into any solution?

A:

rosservice call /mavros/set_stream_rate 0 10 1
use the above command to start publishing other datas as well
