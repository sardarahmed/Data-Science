Q:

ldr lxf to urdf

Hi everyone,
is there a current nxt version for ros? We mostly need it to model the robots with LDD, then translating the files from ldr and lxf to urdf. But i didn't find any current build for nxt.
Or is it possible, to install the diamondback-build from ros_nxt and use these files with the hydro-build?
Thanks in advance
