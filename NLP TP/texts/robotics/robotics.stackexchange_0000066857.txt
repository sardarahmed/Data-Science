Q:

"You don't have permission to access" laser.bag

Hello,
I was trying to follow the laser_pipeline tutorial: http://wiki.ros.org/laser_pipeline/Tutorials/IntroductionToWorkingWithLaserScannerData
I saved the link for laser.bag (located here: http://vault.willowgarage.com/wgdata1/vol1/wiki_docs/laser_pipeline/laser.bag) but it said that I didn't have permission to access it. From the bag file: "You don't have permission to access /wgdata1/vol1/wiki_docs/laser_pipeline/laser.bag on this server." Is this just an outdated link?
Thanks

A:

Yeah, that's an outdated link to an unmaintained Willow Garage server. Someone will probably need to recreate that bag file.
If someone does, recreate it appropriately contact me (@tfoote) and I can place it on download.ros.org

Looks like there is access to the bag file here: http://answers.ros.org/question/211361/unable-to-download-laserbag/
