Q:

Robot Serial Communication Error

We are using a Koro robot for our PC based automation solution. But sometimes the robot is getting the command but refuses to respond. Then I get a serial communication timeout error. The error is happening for a random type of commands and it is also not happening all the time making the troubleshooting difficult.
I doubt the driver problem. How do you approach this problem.?
Thanks

Welcome to Robotics... Hopefully, this will give you some pointers, although your situation is not easy to debug remotely :)
Things to consider (and I appreciate its a non-repeatable problem):

Does it only happen when battery levels are low, or also with full charge (voltage low)
Does it only happen when the robot is active, or also from stationary (processor overload)
What else is the control PC doing? (PC overload)
Have you checked that the comms link is correct (voltage levels, numbers of bits, protocol etc) - Check with an oscilloscope.
Noise interference (EMC) if the motors are active
Can you log what is received at the robot?
Is the receive buffer on the robot big enough for the biggest command sequence? (buffer overflow)
Have you checked the cable, both for continuity and that it isn't loose.

As things stand, it is difficult to be able to determine...

I found out the problem was with the serial communication card..I connected the robot through the direct PC com port 2. It was working fine
