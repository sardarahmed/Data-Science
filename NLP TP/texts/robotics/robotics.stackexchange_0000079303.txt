Q:

get the list of all message types in python

Does anyone know how to get the list of all ros messages types in python? I'm looking for an equivalent of the command line tool rosmsg in python, something like 'rosmsg list'. I haven't found it in rospy.

A:

rosmsg is python (as are many of the command line tools: ros_comm/tools).
