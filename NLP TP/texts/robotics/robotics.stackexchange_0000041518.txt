Q:

Is there a way to subscribe to a topic without setting the type?

I try to create some UI to allow users to select a topic and visualize the data published on that topic. To get started I wanted to have only one field for the topic name and connect to it with python. In theory it should be possible to receive callbacks without knowing the message type since the messages are introspectable in python using:
message.__slots__
message._slot_types
message.__getattribute__('x')

I tried to use the Subscriber class but that one enforces the use of a data class when you subscribe to a topic.

A:

You can try and use the internal rostopic API directly to list topic names and detect the topic type (see the code API page for rostopic here)
The only drawback of using the API directly is that code breaking changes may be made to it in the future. If you are worried about this, you could potentially try and parse the output of the rostopic command, as this command line tool is stable.
