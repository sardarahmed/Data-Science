Q:

occupancy grid implementation?

what is the most commonly used package in ROS for occupancy grid-based SLAM? I see slam_gmapping, octomap, voxel_grid
the jossum project also gives a very good demo

It is probably slam_gmapping, but what is the purpose of this question? If you can clarify, we can help more in detail.

thanks, my goal is to pick an existing package which is the most mature and has the highest performance , so that I can just use it on my project without too much investigation and comparison by myself.
