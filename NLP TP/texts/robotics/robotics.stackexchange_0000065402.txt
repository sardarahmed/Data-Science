Q:

rxplot not found

I've installed Indigo on Ubuntu 14.4 and I'm doing the rosserial IR ranger tutorial. When I execute
rxplot range_data/range
I get
rxplot not found.
I gather this command has been superceded by rqt_plot. If so what would the proper command line be.
Thanks
RoboBill

A:

rqt_plot is supposed to be a drop-in replacement for rxplot in most situations. Try:
rqt_plot range_data/range
