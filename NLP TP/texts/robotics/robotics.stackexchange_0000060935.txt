Q:

How to combine joint state publisher with urdf?

I have gone through this tutorial:
Using urdf with robot_state_publisher
I wrote my urdf file (for a right arm with fingers) and launched it and it worked and I was able to change everything using the gui. Then I wrote a state_publisher.cpp the same way as the tutorial and a launch file. Now I want everything to work together but I don't know how. In the tutorial it only says that I should run rviz.

A:

You also need to compile the C++ node you've written, and then launch the launch file, which will load your URDF onto the parameter server and run the robot_state_publisher and your node.
If you think the tutorial could be clearer about how to do this, feel free to update it with additional instructions.

I should launch the launch file of the robot_state_publisher ? and how will this link to my urdf file ? (I have a package for the urdf and another for the robot_state_publisher)

The param tag in the launch file loads your URDF into the parameter server, and the robot_state_publisher and other nodes can use it from there.
