Q:

the odom of irobot create is not right when move backward

As stated in the title, when the create robot is moving backwards, the odom value reported for x position is increasing rather than reducing.
I tested both irobot_create_2_1 and turtlebot_node, and the same results observed.
Is this because of the onboard encoder limitation?

A:

In general, dead reckoning style odometry on the Create is... definitely not good. Implementations do of course vary. For the most part this seems to have to do with both hardware limitations and the limitations of building a driver that doesn't run directly on the bot but on top of a serial connection to the Open Interface. I posted a few thoughts that might help in this thread. This is not to knock the Create because it is cheap and tough and pretty much my favorite platform. That said, it only really comes into its own with some kind of navigational aid like a laser scanner, Kinect, or just a web-cam.
You aren't alone in reporting problems with X being absolute across multiple drivers. Can you provide a few more details about your setup? Do you have more than one Create for which this seems to be a problem?
