Q:

Velodyne has the same IP domain as my WIFI network

Hello,
Can I use WiFi and velodyne simultaneously? I thought the answer is yes if two network has different ip domain. Velodyne is 192.168.1.xx, while one of my network is 192.168.3.xx. It works well.
But when two domains are the same. Both are 192.168.1.xx. I can't use network any more. Is there any ways to address this? I can't modify my network subnet. If have to change the IP of velodyne, is it possible and how to do?
Thanks a lot.

A:

The velodyne lidar provides a web browser page that you can use to change the device's IP address. It is found on port 80 of the velodyne's IP address.
