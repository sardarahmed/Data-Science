Q:

Gazebo amcl_pose rate

Hi,
I am running a turtlebot in Gazebo and want to change the amcl_pose rate. Currently, when I type rostopic hz /amcl_pose, I get 1 or 2 messages like the following every 1 second:
average rate: 1.856
    min: 0.132s max: 0.849s std dev: 0.14089s window: 80

Is there a way to increase this rate?
Thanks!

A:

Actually, the amcl_pose rate doesn't have to be that fast. Cuz odom_pose rate is 10Hz to 50Hz, which is continuous. The duty of amcl_pose is to fix the odometry drift.
While I guess you can still change the amcl_pose rate by tuning the parameters of amcl. You can go to amcl wiki for details. You may tune the max_particles, update_min_d or other parameters, but it hard to change the rate directly, in my opinion.
