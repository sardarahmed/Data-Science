Q:

arm_navigation problem with sia10d_mesh_arm_navigation

Hi there,
I'm fairly new to ROS and especially the ROS packages for industrial robotics and automation applications. when I was creating a package,I have used the link "http://code.google.com/p/swri-ros-pkg/" to download "sia10d_mesh_arm_navigation".  For that I have created a package and relevant folders with files (folders like config, launch and src). Than I tried to build above mentioned package and I was known that have to implement arm_navigation stack for dependencies. After that, I tried to build necessary packages from arm_navigation stack. I have unsuccessful with ompl_ros_interface. It was given the following error message even through I have successfully build the ompl package.
mkdir -p bin
cd build && cmake -Wdev -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=rospack find rosbuild/rostoolchain.cmake  ..

I was just wondering if there's a proper method to overcome the above problem.
Thanks in advance

A:

You shouldn't need to build arm_navigation from source - just apt-get install ros-fuerte-arm-navigation.  If you do want to build from source on fuerte you'll need to install the separate ompl deb using 'sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-ompl'.  If you have other issues using ros-industrial code with fuerte
