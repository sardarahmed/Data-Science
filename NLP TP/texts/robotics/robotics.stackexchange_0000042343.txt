Q:

Sensor Topic Conventions

We have a sensor that will be used in several locations in a robot (e.g. multiple instances of a single hardware device).  Is there a preferred naming convention for message topics under these situations?  I have not been able to find anything under the ROS Best Practices page
It seems like ideally, one would like to remap the root topic while maintaining the subtopics,
/sensor/raw
/sensor/calibrated

launching as
/remapped_sensor/raw
/remapped_sensor/calibrated

however the "remap" tag appears to only work for full topics.
Two other options seem to be nesting under a namespace (somewhat reduntantly) e.g.
/location_namespace/sensor/raw    
/location_namespace/sensor/calibrated

Or alternately, defining a launchfile argument (with default value) that specifies the root topic
/launch_arg/raw
/launch_arg/calibrated

Or perhaps there are other conventions?
Thanks!

A:

What we like to do is have the sensor topics exist (or be remapped to) in what appears to be the global namespace, then nest the node launch under a namespace. That's your /location_namespace/ example, without the redundancy.
For example (code untested, but I think it gives you the idea):
<group ns="location"/>
   <node pkg="foo" name="bar" type="baz">
      <remap from="camera/rgb/image_color" to="rgb/image_color"/>
     <remap from="camera/camera_info" to="camera_info"/>
   </node>
</group>
