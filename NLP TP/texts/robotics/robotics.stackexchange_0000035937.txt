Q:

Running rosjava tutorial examples

Tried usual searches to see if anyone else was seeing this, but when I run:
rosrun rosjava_bootstrap run.py rosjava_tutorial_pubsub org.ros.tutorials.pubsub.Listener
I get an error that says:
Loading node class: org.ros.tutorials.pubsub.Listener
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException: Node name not specified.
I noticed that the documentation for rosjava seems a bit out of date (since NodeFactory.newNode no longer takes a default name), so it could be that I need some sort of argument, but I don't know what it is.
Any suggestions?

A:

This is now handled by NodeMain.getDefaultNodeName(). It is no longer required to specify "__name:=...".
