Q:

Libpcan study sources

Respected,
I need to work on the concept of "libpcan". It is an entirely new topic and the possible sources i have found so far from where i can know and learn about this are as follows:
http://wiki.ros.org/libpcan
http://www.care-o-bot.de/en/research.html (not sure whether the latter link will help me or not).
When i try to implement the "libpcan" from the link "http://wiki.ros.org/libpcan", i get the following error on using the command "sudo ./install_pcan.sh"

I am new to this field of libpcan and i am getting too many doubts and errors on this.
Regards

This question already has an answer that isn't related to build issues, and in general other users don't look at questions that are answered. Please post your build issue as a new question.

I tried but i failed to find the relevant solution. Probably some are present but are related to bring changes in the xml files to remove the error.
Unfortunately, i am unable to link them with my issue.

In case you have the sol. ,kindly let me know. I am trying to get started with any possible code with libpcan and other can drivers, but still unable to implement a basic "libpcan" reference section on ros site. If you have the solution, or u know the link to the solution, do let me know.
Regards

A:

libpcan is a library for interacting with CAN interfaces from Peak System. There are many versions of the driver that are repackaged for ROS, but the original version comes directly from Peak System, and I would start with their documentation: http://www.peak-system.com/fileadmin/media/linux/index.htm

Thank you for the response sir.
But there are soo many driver versions to be read and downloaded. Being a beginner in this field, it is very tough for me start with an appropriate driver, can you help me which driver to begin with? Also, none driver has any code to implement.KIndly help me.
Comment by ahendrix on 2017-02-16:
Presumably you have some reason or requirements for wanting to use libpcan; you should be able to use those reasons to figure out which version to use (or just use the latest version).
Comment by ahendrix on 2017-02-16:
I'm not sure which version of libpcan you're looking at, but it looks like version 8.3.1 of includes the source code for the library and the driver.

Respected,
This could be an absurd beginning for libpcan. But i just need to start with a version ( i do not know which version will suit me) on which i can find readily avalaible example codes on the net so that i can gsin basic knowledge to understand its implementation.

Since you have a lot more experience on this concept, it would be good for me to follow whichever version and source you will suggest to me.

You asked "where is the source for libpcan" and I knew the answer, so I answered. I don't use libpcan much myself, and you haven't mentioned any of your requirements for using it, so I cannot suggest a version.

If you want official advice about which version of libpcan to use for your application, I suggest you contact Peak System directly.
