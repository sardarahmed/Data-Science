Q:

Compensator design

I got a plant $G(s)=\left(0.13s+1\right)/s^2$ to design a compensator which provides below demands:

Settling time : max 2s
Overshoot : max %35
Gain margin : min 10 dB
Phase margin : min 30 deg
Controller effort (r to u) : max 0.9
Bandwith : min 10 rad/s

The best architecture so far was the one below but I couldn't reach the demands.

assigning $C1=0.03\cdot\left(\left(s+80\right)\left(s+10\right)\right)/\left(\left(s+0.12\right)\left(s+1\right)\right)$, $C2=17.5\text{m}$ and $H=1$ results as below:

Can anyone explain or guide a design approach on how to handle $\left(s+a\right)/s^2$ type plants when designing compensators or mention some tips/shortcuts for architecture selection? How do we select the order of the controller?

A:

Consider the traditional control diagram below.

If you set $C=(2\zeta\omega_ns+\omega_n^2)/(0.13s+1)$, then you'll get the following closed-loop system transfer function:
$$
T=\frac{GC}{1+GC}=\frac{2\zeta\omega_ns+\omega_n^2}{s^2+2\zeta\omega_ns+\omega_n^2}.
$$
This can be achieved through zero-pole cancelation, which is doable since $G$ has a zero in LHP.
Finally, you can easily attain your design requirements with $\omega_n \approx 10\,\text{rad/s}$ and e.g. $\zeta=\sqrt{2}/2$.
The requirement on the maximum controller effort cannot be attained with a pure LTI controller though. You may thus consider LTV and/or nonlinear approaches to this end for controlling a double integrator (for example relying on optimal control).
