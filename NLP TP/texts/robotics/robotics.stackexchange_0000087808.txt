Q:

Learn ros doing exercices

I've just started to learn ROS and I think the best way to learn it is doing things with it. I get bored if I read or watch videos without doing anything.
Could you recommend me a book, online course or tutorial where exercises that I can do and check my results?
By the way I'm running ROS Lunar in an Ubuntu 16.04.4 and I want to learn ROS and how to connect it with Gazebo.

I've just started to learn ROS and I think the best way to learn it is doing things with it. I get bored if I read or watch videos without doing anything.

In that case (I too struggle to learn things in a vacuum), I recommend that you identify a project/goal that interests you, e.g. face-tracking turret that tracks, identifies, and shoots foam darts at (specific) coworkers.
Once you have an interesting goal, try to achieve it using ROS. You will have a strong incentive to learn about the parts of the ROS ecosystem that are relevant to your goal.
