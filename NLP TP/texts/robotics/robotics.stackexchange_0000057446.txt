Q:

cannot locate LinearMath/btMatrix3x3.h

Hi,
I intend to convert quaternion into rpy using btMatrix3x3.getRPY(). However, i get the following error when i try to compile.
this is done with only #include <LinearMath/btMatrix3x3.h> included in my cpp file.
/home/chao/catkin_ws/src/simple_navigation_goals/src/robot_state3_with_class.cpp:23:36: fatal error: LinearMath/btMatrix3x3.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.
this error msg showed up when i added <depend package="LinearMath"/> into the manifest.xml
[rospack] Error: package/stack 'simple_navigation_goals' depends on non-existent package 'LinearMath' and rosdep claims that it is not a system dependency. Check the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH or try calling 'rosdep update'

appreciate your help, thank you

A:

You don't mention which ROS distribution you are using, but if it is Groovy or Hydro, you want to include
<tf/LinearMath/btMatrix3x3.h>

and depend on tf, not LinearMath, which is not a package.

my apologies for the negligence. yes, i am using Groovy with Ubuntu 12.04. I suppose that the  you mentioned is to be included in my cpp file? like this (  #include   ) ?

I have tried to put #include <tf/LinearMath/btMatrix3x3.h>, #include <tf/Matrix3x3.h> but it shows error

apparently ROS answers mucked up my answer, those should be slashes... see the edit above

Hi, i have tried to put #include <tf/LinearMath/btMatrix3x3.h> but it shows ##fatal error: tf/LinearMath/btMatrix3x3.h: No such file or directory## My tf package is at /opt/ros/groovy/share/tf and inside has ##cmake  msg  package.xml  srv## Could it be possibly that there is something wrong with my tf package?

Hi, i managed to find the answer already :) it is in the package bullet. just put "#include<bullet/LinearMath/btMatrix3x3.h>" will do. Thanks for your help
