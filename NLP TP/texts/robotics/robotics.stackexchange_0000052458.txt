Q:

Cannot locate rosdep definition for [nodelet]

Hi all,
I'm trying to install RGB-DSLAM to my machine following the instruction specified under "RGB-D SLAM for "Not-yet" ROS Users" and I encountered a bug.
when I typed this in the terminal:
$rosdep install rgbdslam_freiburg
it returns:
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
rgbdslam: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [nodelet]
Some Specification: Ubuntu 12.10, 32-bit, Groovy, Opencv 2.4.5
Thanks.

A:

This looks like rosdep does not know that it is expecting groovy so cannot resolve nodelet to ros-groovy-nodelet.  Does the tutorial declare that it's using groovy?
