Q:

How to move a model using external C++ application and gazebo transport?

Lets say I have a simple box loaded in gazebo world. How can I move this box using the gazebo transport client, and sample code somewhere, I don't see anything in examples that matches?
Second question is lets say I update position at 1Hz, can I also set the body rates, so gazebo smoothes the position in between position updates?

A:

I ended up just creating my own model plugin and created my own tcp interface using the gazebo/transport/Connection.hh . I didn't use full gazebo transport since I didn't want to make that a requirement for clients on the other side.
