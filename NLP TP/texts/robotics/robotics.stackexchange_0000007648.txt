Q:

iRobot Create 2 sensors

Can someone please provide me with a list of sensors on the create 2?  I am hoping to get one soon, but want to be sure it has ultrasonic sensors and not just bump sensors before I do.

A:

The Roomba does not have ultrasonic sensors, but it does have quite a few infrared proximity sensors.  The Open Interface Spec calls it the "light bumper".
Package IDs 46-51 (pages 30 and 31) describe the different light bumper IR sensors.  They return a 12 bit number (0-4095) which will roughly correspond to distance to an object.  However it is highly dependent on the object's material.  The "light bumper" packet (45) contains a binary version of all the light bumper sensors together.  I don't know what threshold is used for this.
