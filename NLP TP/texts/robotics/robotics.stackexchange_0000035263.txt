Q:

trouble starting environment server for arm_navigation stack

I'm working with the new electric arm_navigation stack. I went through the wizard and am working with my auto generated launch and config files. So when I launch my arm_navigation launch file, everything seems fine except it continues to get hung up on:
[ INFO] : waitForService: Service [/register_planning_scene] has not been advertised, waiting...
[ INFO] : Robot frame is base_link
[ INFO] : Waiting for robot state ...
[ INFO] : Waiting for joint state ...
[ WARN] : Got joint state update but did not update some joints for more than 1 second.  Turn on DEBUG for more info
[ INFO] : Waiting for environment server planning scene registration service /register_planning_scene
[ INFO] : waitForService: Service [/register_planning_scene] has not been advertised, waiting...
[ INFO] : Waiting for environment server planning scene registration service /register_planning_scene
[ INFO] : waitForService: Service [/register_planning_scene] has not been advertised, waiting...
[ INFO] : Waiting for robot state ...
[ INFO] : Waiting for joint state ...

....If I don't include the environment server by commenting the following out of my launch file....
<include file="$(find planning_environment)/launch/environment_server.launch">
    <arg name="use_monitor" value="true" />
    <arg name="use_collision_map" value="false" />
</include>

....then it stops complaining. But of course if I don't include the environment server then I can't run any of my clients to move the arm.
I've already found this thread but I'm already doing a fake publisher and the problem persists even when I don't include the joints I'm having to fake publish.
Has anyone dealt with this issue before or do I seem to be forgetting a small but cruicial step in getting this to launch?
Thanks.

A:

After going back into my fake joint publisher, I had missed a couple of joints. That was the fix. Launching no longer gets hung up on the environment server.
If you need help with this topic similar to mine, use this script: https://kforge.ros.org/turtlebot/turtlebot_arm/file/5b219f3e6b8e/turtlebot_arm_bringup/scripts/fake_pub.py to do a fake publish joints that normally don't have a transform. Just be sure to verify you included all of your joints (my mistake).

Hi seth, I'm having trouble similar to what you posted here, but I don't have much experience with ROS or linux, and I don't know what should I put instead of: "roslib.load_manifest("turtlebot_arm_bringup")" in the fake_publisher script, if I'm working too with my own robot. Thanks!

Carlos, replace "turtlebot_arm_bringup" with the package name that you are working in. for more details, look here: http://www.ros.org/wiki/rospy/Overview/Initialization%20and%20Shutdown
