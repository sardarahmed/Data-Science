Q:

Hole in floor using the building editor

What is the easiest way to define a hole in a floor using the building editor?
Background is: I want to model a building with an elevator, using the elevator plugin.
What I've done is loading the example elevator world and adding a building model I've created before. Doing this I now have an elevator and a building, but if the elevator is inside of it it can't change floors because the collision is still there.
How could I solve it?

A:

There's no easy way to open a hole in the building editor. One way would be to create a building which has stairs in the bottom floor where the elevator would go, and after the SDF file is saved, then go into the file and delete the Stairs_* link.
