Q:

Roslaunch utilising Gazebo 1.0 not Gazebo 1.3

Hi All
I've installed Gazebo 1.3 to replace the Gazebo 1.0 as suggested here.
However when I go to run previous roslaunch files (for a gazebo 1.0 model) instead of launching Gazebo 1.3 and parsing the model to 1.3, it instead launches Gazebo 1.0 with no changes to what I had before installing Gazebo 1.3. I've followed the directions given, and my launch file is based on the old rosplugin.launch. However it doesn't seem to specify a version:
<launch>
  <!-- set use_sim_time flag -->
  <param name="/use_sim_time" value="true" />
  <node name="gazebo" pkg="gazebo" type="gazebo" args="$(find HMMv2)/worlds/HMMv2withGripper.world" respawn="false" output="screen"/>
  <node name="gazebo_gui" pkg="gazebo" type="gui" respawn="false" output="screen"/>
  <node name="imageviewhead" pkg="image_view" type="image_view" args="image:=/gazebo/cam_sensor1" />
  <node name="imageviewRH" pkg="image_view" type="image_view" args="image:=/gazebo/cam_sensor2" />
</launch>

now I take from the above launch file that it is using the simulator from the gazebo package in /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/simulator-gazebo/gazebo.
How do i change it to direct to where the gazebo 1.3 files are stored, the binaries are located in usr/bin, with the rest of the parts spread across the /usr/ folders
Cheers
Peter
I can run Gazebo 1.3 from the commandline no problem.

A:

I believe the problem is that roslaunch uses rospack to find the location of Gazebo. If the path to Gazebo 1.0 is first in the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environment variable, then roslaunch will use the 1.0 version.
Right now, the easiest way is to sudo apt-get install drcsim, and source the /usr/share/drcsim/setup.sh file.
Update
I think roslaunch can't launch programs that live outside of ROS. Someone should correct me if I'm wrong. One work around is to create a bash script that lives inside a ROS package. The bash script can then run gazebo. For example:
#!/bin/sh
gazebo $1

Don't working for me
Comment by PMilani on 2013-02-06:
yeah sorry nate, but installing drcsim, copying across all the paths from the setup file to ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, doesn't work either. is the drcsim formatted as a ros stack? or would removing the gazebo 1.0 stack be suitable (by moving the directory and replacing the executables in the fuerte bin folder with the 1.3 executables? )

What is DRC anyways?  I tried to google it, found the user guide, but the explanation of what it is is not implemented yet: http://gazebosim.org/wiki/DRC/UserGuide .

I believe its the simulator for the Darpa Robotics Challenge. Theres a simulation track in the competition and the DRC is the simulator to use. Its based on Gazebo with the latest refinements

PMilani is correct. The simulation component is called the Virtual Robotics Challenge, which is taking place this June.

Thanks.
