Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: c++ or python

I am currently using python to make stuff in ROS, would it be worthwhile to learn cpp? Are there things you can't do with python? Is it easier to program things with c++?

A:

I'll add something to @aak2166 answer.
Some library you might want to use are going to be exclusively in Python or in CPP. For example, as far as I know, PCL is only in C++ so if you want to use it, you will have to learn C++.
Smash is only in python.
So it depend as well on your project but knowing both is certainly an advantage since you won't be limited by this.
