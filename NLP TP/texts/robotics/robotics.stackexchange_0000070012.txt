Q:

catkin_make package that uses mavros_msgs

Hi, I am working on a package to test the idea of controlling my robot over /mavros/rc_override topic. I made a package via catkin_create_pkg and added mavros and mavros_msgs to the find_packages part in the CMakeLists.txt and also added both to the package.xml. Then writing the code and using #include "mavros_msgs/RCIn.h"as suggested (or with < and >.
After saving and doing the catkin_make in the catkin workspace root directory, it fails as it says it can not find mavros_msgs. When I delete that from the package.xml and CMakeLists.txt, it falls as it tells me it does not #include "mavros_msgs/RCIn.h" (same if I use < and >).
As I haven't done much with cmake and catkin I came here to find a solution. I have been searching the internet but couldn't find an example that fits my requirements.
Thanks for your time
Regards,
Martin

What you are doing sounds generally reasonable, so the error must lie in the details. Please post the relevant parts of CMakeLists.txt and package.xml along with the exact compiler error messages.

A:

Did you install the mavros_msgs package? The fact that catkin doesn't find it is suspicious.
You could try and find the package via command line: $ catkin_find mavros_msgs. If you can't find it you will need to get the package first.

Mavros depends on msgs, so it should be installed.

Executing catkin_find mavros_msgs gives me no results.
