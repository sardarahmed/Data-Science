Q:

Where can ros-jade packages for Ubuntu 14.04 trusty be found?

It appears that ros-jade has been removed from http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu/dists/trusty/main/binary-amd64/Packages and only ros-indigo is available.
If anyone knows of an archive with ros-jade for Ubuntu 14.04 trusty please pass it along.
When was ros-jade removed?  I feel like it was available in April of 2019.

A:

Jade has been EOL since May 2017 (wiki/Distributions), with the final package repository sync in September 2017 (discourse announcement).

When was ros-jade removed? I feel like it was available in April of 2019.

A breach of security of build.ros.org was detected around April/May (discourse post), as a precaution, all packages for supported distributions have been rebuilt and as part of the cleanup, all packages of no-longer supported ROS releases (which would include Jade) have been moved to the snapshot repository (discourse post by @nuclearsandwich ).
If you still want to/need to use ROS Jade, you'll have to install it from the snapshot repositories. The linked wiki page explains how to set that up.
