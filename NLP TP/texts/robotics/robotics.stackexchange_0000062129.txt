Q:

battery_state_of_charge publishes nothing on Pioneer3DX

Hi,
in the rosaria documentation is written that, if the pioneer supports battery_state_of_charge the topic is published. The topic is published, but there is never any data comming. Does anyone know if the Pioneer3DX supports battery_state_of_charge ? If it supports it, what do i have to do to get the values ?
regards peter
