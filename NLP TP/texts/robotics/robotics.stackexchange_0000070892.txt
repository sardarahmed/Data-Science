Q:

Ros on anything else than ubuntu: how?

Hello everyone.
I used Ros a while ago for Univ.
Now I'd like to test it in a work environment and where there is a mix of CentOS and Debian.
I can't seem to find any updated information about building from source.
The latest I can find is Electric on Debian.
What's the situation nowadays?

Note that you may run into issues if you follow the default (Ubuntu) from-source installation instructions on Debian.
