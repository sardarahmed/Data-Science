A:

I'm assuming you're asking about gazebo.  Usually you need a modern discrete graphics card.  For more details you should ask on gazebosim.org.

Is there any robot with which 2D navigation stack is already setup in case of Gazebo? And we can send robot to a particular location through rviz or simple_navigation_goals.
Is there any socket involved between communication of ROS and Gazebo?
