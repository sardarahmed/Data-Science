Q:

twist message: angular velocity unit

Quick question, the nav_msgs: twist has angular component in x,y,z.
I view this as the velocity of rotation with respect to x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis. But what is the unit of such velocity. Degree/second or radiant/second?

A:

ROS uses SI units, specifically MKS.
That means for angular rate the default is radians/second.
All default units are defined in REP 103
