A:

On the ros-users mailing list an announcment was made that the Hydro release will be delayed due to the results of a survey asking how users would like to see the ROS release cycle scheduled. At this time I have not heard of any new release date scheduled for Hydro.
An updated timeline for the Hydro release has been proposed on the ros-users mailing list.

As of now the last suggested release date was the 29th July, beta freeze 29th june. I think the date is believable, but not set in stone yet.
