Q:

ROS-enabled golf-car?

Hello,
I am quite interested to build a ROS-enabled golf-car, perhaps this is one step towards autonomous vehicle. I did a search and only found Grizzly from clearpath robotics is quite similar to an autonomous vehicle, but Husky can't carry passengers. My question is, is there any ros-enabled golf-car available in the market, or sth. similar?  Ideas are welcome.. Thanks a Lot.

Clearpath also has the grizzly, which might fit your size a bit better.

Yes, What I mean is Grizzly, not husky. In fact, Husky is even smaller.

Unfortunately, a car is out of my reach at the moment... Perhaps, sth. that doesn't need a license plate
