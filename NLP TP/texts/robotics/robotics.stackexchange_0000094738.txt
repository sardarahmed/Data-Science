Q:

How much time do I need (approximately) to learn ROS and create my own package?

i want to create my own package  (catkin, etc., + simple URDF model, adding sensors and programming it for autonomous navigation in Gazebo) . I have just started to learn ROS thoroughly. I want to use python programming language to program my simulated robot model.
Just give me advice...
How much time do i need ?

A:

A week or two sounds like a realistic period. You already know all you need to do. Before Gazebo, look at stage for a 2d simulation which is much simpler to get running. Turtlebot simulation packages are a good place to start

thank you) It would be good if I had a mentor in robotics , but anyway there are many robotics forums like this one and It's so nice)
