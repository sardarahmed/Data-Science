Q:

Cannot find duration__rosidl_typesupport_connext_c

Hello!
I am trying to compile ROS2 builtin_interfaces__rosidl_typesupport_c.dir/rosidl_typesupport_c for a non supported DDS and I am hurting this error:
[ 46%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/builtin_interfaces__rosidl_typesupport_c.dir/rosidl_typesupport_c/builtin_interfaces/msg/duration__type_support.cpp.o

compilation terminated.

I cannot find where the duration__rosidl_typesupport_connext_c.h is generated. Could you tell me where it is?
Thanks :)

A:

Found it.
It was under rosidl_default_generators/rosidl_default_generators-extras.cmake.in
set(_exported_dependencies
HERE
)
And I forgot to add my dependency.
