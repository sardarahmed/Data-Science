Q:

Is there a list of free available robot models for gazebo?

Hi, I wanted to know if there is a list of free available robots to play with in gazebo; such as turtlebot, PR2,  erratic-robot?
Maybe there are some models for the Pioneer, Care-O-bot, Roomba, Peoplebot, Nao, Aibo, Kephera, etc.
Thanks for your help!

A:

Though not Gazebo specific, this page  has a list of many of the models that are available.

I think I also think that a better search at the Player Project page will add some models to this list.

hey can't I download the models from models.gazebosim.org, so that gazebo doesn't have to look for these models online or dependent on the internet connection, Is it possible?
