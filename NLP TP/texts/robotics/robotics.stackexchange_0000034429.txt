Q:

TF_NO_FRAME_ID: Ignoring transform with child_frame_id

Hi, I've tried the pi_tracker package. I have no errors running skeleton.launch and tracker.launch. However, when I rosrun rviz, I met the following errors
[ERROR] [1316763642.701371303]: TF_NO_FRAME_ID: Ignoring transform with child_frame_id "/right_shoulder"  from authority "/skeleton_tracker" because frame_id not set
[ERROR] [1316763642.701422097]: TF_NO_FRAME_ID: Ignoring transform with child_frame_id "/right_elbow"  from authority "/skeleton_tracker" because frame_id not set
[ERROR] [1316763642.701475147]: TF_NO_FRAME_ID: Ignoring transform with child_frame_id "/right_hand"  from authority "/skeleton_tracker" because frame_id not set

In rviz, in TF display. I got status: warning "/openni_camera: No transform from [/openni_camera] to frame[/world] /openni_depth_frame: No transform from [/openni_depth_frame to frame[/world]" etc....

The robot model in the rviz has no errors. I've also changed the 'skel_to_joint_map' parameter in the tracker_params.yaml, to correspond with the joint names with my robot urdf model.  I also changed the line in the 'self.cmd_joints.position[self.cmd_joints.name.index('myRobot_jointName')] = right_shoulder_lift_angle' in the tracker_joint_controller.py to my robot urdf's joint name.
Is there anywhere else I need to change in the code? Thanks a lot!

A:

You need to change the fixed frame and target frame to something connected in rviz.  See the user guide
