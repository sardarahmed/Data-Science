Q:

Number of diagonal elements in the pose covariance matrix

The control.yaml file inside the husky_gazebo package defines the value of the  pose_covariance_diagonal parameter as  [0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.03].
A pose is made up of 7 elements - [x, y, z,q_x, q_y, q_z, q_w]. So, shouldn't the number of elements in the pose_covariance_diagonal parameter  be 7?

A:

That covariance doesn't use a quaternion for rotation portion, it uses: roll, pitch, yaw.
