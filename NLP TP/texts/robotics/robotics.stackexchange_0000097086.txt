Q:

use scaled_vel_traj_controller in moveit_config

Since the use of ur_robot_driver, I have been using scaled_pos_traj_controller in the ros_controllers.yaml file. Now I want to use scaled_vel_traj_controller. Simply changing the action_ns: in the ros_controllers.yaml file does not work. Moveit keep waiting for the scaled_vel_traj_controller to come up.
I have found a ur5_controllers.yaml in the config folder under ur_robot_driver. How to adapt this to be used?

A:

It has been found that in the planning_execution.launch file, one should have included ur5_bringup.launch. There, one of the tags controllers, one of the default controllers to be activated was scaled_pos_traj_controller. Changing it to scaled_vel_traj_controller will bring up the scaled_vel_traj_controller. One should do the same for the stopped_controllers tag.
