Q:

ROS Twist Mux Figuring Out which Channel is Selected

Hello. I am working with the ROS twist mux package http://wiki.ros.org/twist_mux and am writing a program that needs to know which channel of the twist mux is selected. Is there an easy way to do this or does anyone know of a good work around if an easy way does not exist? Thanks.

@gvdhoorn Thanks. I decided to just go ahead and implement the feature myself. https://github.com/ros-teleop/twist_mux/pull/20

Nit: until your PR is merged, your answer is not actually the answer.
