Q:

geometric_shapes package error, assimp/aiScene.h not found

I am trying to set up the full Jade installation on Ubuntu 14.04.3..
I've followed the official instructions to do this
(http://wiki.ros.org/jade/Installation/Source), but have hit something
of a roadblock with the following:
$./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
http://answers.ros.org/question/187358/geometric_shapes-package-fails-to-process-assimpaisceneh-not-found/
The above is similar to my problem but no workaround is given there.
Here's the terminal output showing what happened with geometric_shapes:
==> Processing catkin package: 'geometric_shapes'
==> Building with env: '/home/toji/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/env.sh'
Makefile exists, skipping explicit cmake invocation...
==> make cmake_check_build_system in '/home/toji/ros_catkin_ws/build_isolated/geometric_shapes'

<== Failed to process package 'geometric_shapes': 
  Command '['/home/toji/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/env.sh', 'make', '-j4', '-l4']' returned non-zero exit status 2

Reproduce this error by running:
==> cd /home/toji/ros_catkin_ws/build_isolated/geometric_shapes && /home/toji/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/env.sh make -j4 -l4

Command failed, exiting.

I will appreciate any help.

Hi, after running across the same problem, I found that geometric_shapes expects files only present in older versions of assimp. This one worked for me: https://sourceforge.net/projects/assimp/files/assimp-2.0/assimp--2.0.858-sdk.zip/download (cmake . && make && make install)

A:

geometric_shapes detects ASSIMP incorrectly, but several other projects do it correctly. You can force the detection to work right by doing by including this on the catkin_make command: -DASSIMP_UNIFIED_HEADER_NAMES=ON . Mine looked like this: ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DASSIMP_UNIFIED_HEADER_NAMES=ON
