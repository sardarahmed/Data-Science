Q:

How to setup tf for real robot?

I have done a complete navigation stack simulation with my robot model using URDF and gazebo, where i have added tf & jointstate plugin in urdf file. Now I have assembled my robot with the required hardware (actuators and sensors), so how to setup tf for my real robot.
Please post the steps involved and direct me to the resources to learn or some existing packages.
PS: I have done tf tutorials in ROS navigation stack but i cant figure out how to do it for complete robot mobile robot

Closing this as it has been answered

A:

You need to look at the TF Tutorials. #1 for both C++ and Python is setting up a transform broadcaster.
[EDIT]
Been a few months :P. You can use the URDF model to publish the transforms. Using the  tag allows you to enter the parent ID, child ID, and origin transforms between links.
If you want to make a quick tranform tree though, here is the transform broadcaster I made for a robot while working on my MASc. Making the transform tree doesn't give you a visual, but it does provide the transforms between parts.

Should i build the broadcaster code for my complete robot or i can use my URDF to publish the tf?
Comment by Icehawk101 on 2016-03-23:
I've always built the tf broadcaster for my robots, so I am not sure if the URDF model can publish the tf or not

Can you pls share a tf node of a robot. The tutorials have only the broadcaster and listener.
