Q:

Does 6DOF robot arm + linear rail = 7DOF arm?

Assume we have a 6DOF manipulator, take UR5 as an example. Does adding a linear rail, on which the robot sits, add a 7th DOF to the system, making it equivalent to a 7DOF manipulator? Any caveats?

A:

You are correct.
Adding an external axis results in 6+1=7 DOF.
Caveats...the same as for any redundant system

solving IK requires a more complex approach (and then path/trajectory planning also)
precision/repeatability/accuracy can be affected if the external axis has a worse precision/repeatability//accuracy
same goes for dynamic performance
technical compatibility issues might arise (depending on how the external axis is controlled and what communication protocols are available at the robot controller)
