Q:

Apt Install Ros Kinetic Problem after recent update

Hi, I'm having issue installing ros after this update. I'm on ubuntu 16.04.
When I try to apt install ros-kinetic-ros-core after using apt update it attempts to fetch python-rospkg 1.1.9 and python-rospkg-modules 1.1.9. Neither of those exist after this update so it just gives me an error about not being able to find them. I'd expect apt update to cause it to search for 1.1.10, but that's not happening and I'm confused as to how to fix this. I have a file in my /etc/apt/sources.list.d for ros called ros-latest.list and it's contents are,
deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu xenial main

The exact error message from apt is,
Ign:1 http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu xenial/main i386 python-rospkg-modules all 1.1.9-1
Ign:2 http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu xenial/main i386 python-rospkg all 1.1.9-100

E: Unable to fetch some archives, maybe run apt-get update or try with --fix-missing?

You should make sure to run apt-get update again. If you have any trouble after that please edit your question to show the output of apt-get update as well as apt-cache policy python-rospkg
Depending on your networking situation you may have proxies between you and the server that might be causing issues.

I ended up resolving the issue by upgrading to 18.04, so I can't tell exactly what the original problem was.

It could be that this is another manifestation of #q325039: apt not finding packages because of out-dated indices is one of the symptoms of not having the correct key installed.
