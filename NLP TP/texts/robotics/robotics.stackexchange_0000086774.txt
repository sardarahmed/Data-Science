Q:

rqt_reconfigure unable to resize column in Kinetic [solved]

Hello,
When I launch (with ROS Kinetic)
rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure

I can't resize the column where the reconfigure server names appear.

It's annoying when there are many levels in a tree, like when launching openni2_launch for example, then it's impossible to read no matter how I resize the window.
Anybody has the same issue, is it a normal behavior ?
Thanks!

More input needed, e.g. screenshot of the GUI where we can see the problem you're talking about.

Besides, if any of existing PRs (e.g. this, this) are related then you can chime in there.

In fact the issue has been solved, my package was a bit old, after an upgrade of ros-kinetic-rqt-reconfigure, the issue is solved !

A:

To solve that, just upgrade your package:
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-rqt-reconfigure
