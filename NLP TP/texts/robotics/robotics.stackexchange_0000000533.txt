Q:

What was the earliest concept of a robot?

I'm a highschool student studying electronics and for an assessment task on the history of electronics I have decided to focus on the history of robotics. I want to begin with the earliest possible concept of a robot and progress through major developments in robotics to the current day. Where should I begin my research?

A:

I've found the wikipedia article (as well as its linked articles) on the history of robots to be enlightening:

The history of robots has its roots as far back as ancient myths and legends. Modern concepts were begun to be developed when the Industrial Revolution allowed the use of more complex mechanics and the subsequent introduction of electricity made it possible to power machines with small compact motors. After the 1920s the modern formulation of a humanoid machine was developed to the stage where it was possible to envisage human sized robots with the capacity for near human thoughts and movements, first envisaged millennia before.

Also, you might mention R.U.R., a play in the 1920s that popularized the term robot:

R.U.R. is a 1920 science fiction play in the Czech language by Karel ÄŒapek. R.U.R. stands for Rossum's Universal Robots, an English phrase used as the subtitle in the Czech original.1 It premiered in 1921 and introduced the word "robot" to the English language and to science fiction as a whole.

A:

If I recall correctly Leonardo da Vinci is credited with the earliest design of a robot. My personal favorite is generally referred to as Leonardo's robot. However some accounts place Leonardo's cart as having come first and is generally considered a robot because it could be "reprogrammed" by replacing its cogs.

If you are interested in real and fictional robots (for concepts), the CMU Robot Hall of Fame may be useful.
