Q:

ERROR in config: /home/pi/catkin_ws/src has no workspace configuration file '.rosinstall'

Hi, I'm running Indigo on a RPi
I have a code to run a servo as a ROS node. It has dependencies on sensor_msgs to use a PS3 controller. When I put ROS on the Pi, though, I used the bare bones install, no sensors. So, I tried to install it using
pi@raspberrypi ~/catkin_ws $ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-sensor-msgs
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-indigo-sensor-msgs
pi@raspberrypi ~/catkin_ws $ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-common-msgs
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-indigo-common-msgs

I then read over the page on ROS/Pi stuff, and saw it said to make a new rosinstall file to download the packages. So I followed the instructions.
pi@raspberrypi ~/catkin_ws $ rosinstall_generator common_msgs sensor_msgs --rosdistro indigo --deps --wet-only --exclude roslisp --tar > indigo-custom_ros.rosinstall
pi@raspberrypi ~/catkin_ws $ wstool merge -t src indigo-custom_ros.rosinstall
ERROR in config: /home/pi/catkin_ws/src has no workspace configuration file '.rosinstall'

Now I don't know what to do. How can I not have rosinstall? I don't really know what's going on.

A:

If you want to do wstool merge -t src then the src folder needs to have a .rosinstall file. You can get this by doing wstool init src first. Optionally you can do wstool init src indigo-custom_ros.rosinstall directly.

Thank you, that was an easy fix.
