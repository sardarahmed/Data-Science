Q:

When will drcsim-nightly switch to 2.4 release?

I presume that 2.4 is the latest official release.  Why is the nightly build still installing 2.3?
I thought nightly was supposed to be the most up to date.

Same for downloading source from bitbucket and compiling it.

A:

It can happen that some time elapses between development on a release branch and those changes being merged back to the default branch, which is where the -nightly releases are created.  The default branch is also the branch that you'll use when building from source unless you explicitly switch branches.
We just merged from the drcsim_2.5 branch back to default.  So the next -nightly release will contain 2.5.x.
We merge fixes from the release branches back to default periodically.  If you notice that something's missing from default, please let us know.
