Q:

How to change $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

Hi, there.. I'm new using ROS and I'm doing the tutorial for creating a package (http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage).
I tried to  do "roscreate-pkg" and I got this
 jesus@ubuntu:~/ros_workspace$ roscreate-pkg prueba1
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
WARNING: current working directory is not on ROS_PACKAGE_PATH!
Please update your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environment variable.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Created package directory /home/jesus/ros_workspace/prueba1
Created package file /home/jesus/ros_workspace/prueba1/Makefile
Created package file /home/jesus/ros_workspace/prueba1/manifest.xml
Created package file /home/jesus/ros_workspace/prueba1/CMakeLists.txt
Created package file /home/jesus/ros_workspace/prueba1/mainpage.dox

Please edit prueba1/manifest.xml and mainpage.dox to finish creating your package
jesus@ubuntu:~/ros_workspace$ echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
/opt/ros/electric/stacks

So I realized that my path is placed in root and I want to move it to "/home/jesus/ros_workspace"
How can I do this?                Thanks

A:

Add this line to your ~/.bashrc directly under the call to /opt/ros/distro/setup.bash:
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/ros_workspace:${ROS_PACKAGE_PATH}
