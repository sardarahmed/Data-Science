Q:

Define Startup State in MoveIt

Hey guys,
i want to declare the startup state of my UR5 Robot for motion planning in MoveIt (using a Python script). Every time i launch the demo file in RViz, the robot is lying flat on the ground (all joint states are zero). How can i define the start pose of the robot?
I already declared the following:
moveit_commander.roscpp_initialize(sys.argv)
rospy.init_node('ur_arm')
pub_pos = rospy.Publisher('arm_pos', Pose, queue_size=10)    

scene = PlanningSceneInterface()
robot = RobotCommander()
group = MoveGroupCommander("manipulator")

Thanks for your support. Im running ROS Indigo on Ubuntu 14.04

Can you please include some text on what you've already tried? This has been asked a few times already, so if you've tried some things but they didn't work that would be good to include as it would avoid readers suggesting the same things.

A:

This is not Python specific.
Initial states of the robot when simulated with demo.launch can be set to named targets in config/fake_controllers.yaml.
See http://docs.ros.org/kinetic/api/moveit_tutorials/html/doc/fake_controller_manager_tutorial.html?highlight=fake#yaml-file-examples for an example.

If i add
    initial:
      - group: arm
        pose:  home

where do i define what "home" is?
Comment by v4hn on 2017-03-01:
home has to be a named target.
These are defined in your robot's srdf file.
You can either add them by hand or use the moveit_setup_assistant
