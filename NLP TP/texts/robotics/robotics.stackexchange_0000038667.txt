Q:

clock model not displayed in gazebo

Hi everyone,
I was going through gazebo tutorial at : http://ros.org/wiki/simulator_gazebo/Tutorials
, when I launch empty world I didn't see clock model, only gplane and point_white is being shown.
I am not able to control the speed of simulation.
Launch file empty_world.launch has
  
line.
Am I missing something.
What is needed to be done to bring the clock model and control the speed of simulation.
Thanks in advance

Are you referring to the "use_sim_time" parameter? What clock model are you referring to?

As in the tutorial : http://ros.org/wiki/simulator_gazebo/Tutorials/StartingGazebo In the figure that is displayed (on the page), I can see on top left, under model:-
clock,
gplane, &
point_white
but whne I run  'roslaunch gazebo_worlds empty_world.launch'  I only see
gplane
point_white
& no clock

hi hsu,
by cont speed of sim' I mean, for eg,

I launched an empty gazebo world.
Span an empty cup
Applied a body wrench (as in http://ros.org/wiki/simulator_gazebo/Tutorials/Gazebo_ROS_API pt 9)
Now, can I control the sim clock so that I see rotation faster or slower?

A:

If you are talking about the "clock model" in diamondback,
as of electric, the "clock model" has been removed from the world file.  The gazebo binary built from gazeboros.cpp contains a publisher for /clock and various services such as the model factory for spawning models.  In fuerte, the model is slightly shifted as all ros related topics/services are now available there through system plugins, invoked by loading them with the -p option when starting up gazebo.
In terms of "controlling the speed of simulation", can you explain in more detail what you mean by it?  Thanks.
