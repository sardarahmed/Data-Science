Q:

rviz screen problem

hello,
I'm working with rviz and when I  run rosrun rviz rviz I get the screen like this. I searched a lot and I tried several solutions but none helped.
I'm using NVIDIA C61 [GeForce 7025 / nForce 630a] graphics card with nvidia-304 driver installed. I also use ubuntu 14.04 and ROS indigo 1.11.20.
any suggestions would be highly appreciated.
thank you in advance

A:

It looks like a default RViz screen to me...are you sure there's a problem?
You might need to set a robot state publisher or other information sources, then select and/or set up appropriate displays/panels...

I can't make out the contents of those images. The resolution is fine (about 1080 x X), but it looks like the scan lines are interleaved. Can you just do a screen capture rather than taking a picture of the screen? (Try the 'screenshot' program.)

"you will get what my problem is" or... you just explain it yourself.

I didn't know how to explain my problem that's why I used photos. the problem is exactly what you said! when I run rviz it looks like the scan lines are interleaved and the colors are mixed some how. at first I tried the screenshot program but the output is just a black screen that can't be opened.

and the point is that all my screen becomes like this not only the rviz window and I have to restart my pc to get the screen back and be able to use it again.

Ah. That seems like less of a ROS problem and more of a graphics card issue. But I don't know and it's out of my general knowledge area. Sorry, hope someone else can help...

yeah I think the problem is with my graphics card as well but I only have this problem with rviz. by the way, thank you :)
