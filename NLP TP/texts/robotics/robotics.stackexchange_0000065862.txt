Q:

undefined reference to `ros::console::initializeLogLocation()' in turtlebot_arm_block_manipulation package

Hi,
I added #include <ros/console.h> in the header files on top of my .cpp, but I still get this error :
undefined reference to `ros::console::initializeLogLocation()'

What shall I add in CMakeLists.txt, in catkin_package,
or in package.xml?
I use ROS Hydro.
Thanks

Please include your current CMakeLists.txt and package.xml. Remove all the boilerplate comments from it before posting.
(but most likely you are missing a dependency on roscpp)

Hi, thanks. As you can read, I included roscpp...

A:

Thanks gvdhoorn
The missing dependencies were in the CMakeLists.txt In the turtlebot_arm_block_manipulation/CMakeLists, two scripts are commented and not compiled to executables, with a "TODO" mention. I uncommented the declaration without adding the target_link_libraries(..) and add_dependencies(...) that are needed.
It was like that :
# TODO need review
# add_executable(block_manipulation test/block_manipulation.cpp)
# add_executable(block_manipulation_actions test/block_manipulation_actions.cpp)

Should be like that :
add_executable(block_manipulation test/block_manipulation.cpp src/cear_move_gripper.cpp)
target_link_libraries(block_manipulation ${catkin_LIBRARIES} ${PCL_LIBRARIES})
add_dependencies(block_manipulation turtlebot_arm_block_manipulation_gencpp)

add_executable(block_manipulation_actions test/block_manipulation_actions.cpp src/cear_move_gripper.cpp)
target_link_libraries(block_manipulation_actions ${catkin_LIBRARIES} ${PCL_LIBRARIES})
add_dependencies(block_manipulation_actions turtlebot_arm_block_manipulation_gencpp)

Note that "src/cear_move_gripper.cpp" is a node I implemented to action the gripper.

If somebody can correct it in Github, it would be nice for the next users :)
