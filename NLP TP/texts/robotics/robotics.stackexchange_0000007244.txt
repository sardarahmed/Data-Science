Q:

Conceptual problem regarding electronic shutters

I have been looking at CCD and CMOS sensors and cameras to decide which one to use in the process of automatic control of a printing process. By now I am getting the grips on almost all the essential numbers and abbreviations but there remains a problem with shutters.
I understand that there are different types of shutters, both mechanical and electronic, and I can understand how they work. My problem concerns shutter speed. If I use a mechanical shutter, well then the maximum shutter speed depends on that particular element in the assembly, but how does it work for electronic shutters? I have never read "Max shutter speed" in any specs. The only thing I usually see floating around are frames per second. But those do usally not pass a limit of about 120 fps. Depending on how the sensor it is built one could think that the maximum shutter speed therefore is 1/120 or 1/240 if it uses half frames.
Can this be right? It seems really slow. I will be faced with the task of recording crisp and clear images of paper which moves at about 17 m/s. That is never possible with shutter speeds that slow. Will I be forced to use a mechanical shutter or am I misunderstanding something?

A:

Shutter speed is a synonym for exposure time. Exposure time is linked to the frames per second (FPS):
$t_{exposure} + t_{readout} \leq 1 / {FPS}$
So the answer to your question is: no. FPS is usually the more limiting factor because of the readout speed and the bandwidth to transmit the data. 
The FPS you select provides an upper limit for the exposure time, but not a lower limit. You can make your exposure time much shorter. How short depends on your camera model, but usually much shorter than a millisecond.
