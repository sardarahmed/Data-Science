Q:

Altering Scene.cc to Change Grid Size

This is a follow-up question to an earlier one I asked regarding changing grid size. Is there any way to access the Scene.cc file so I can change the hard-coded value of 20x20? I tried to use ls in the directory it's stored in, but all it showed were the .hh files.

A:

You would need to build gazebo from source. Try these instructions. Then look in the gazebo/rendering folder for Scene.cc

I see. Thanks. I'll find an alternate method, then.

I suppose you could also write a GUI system plugin to modify the grid size
