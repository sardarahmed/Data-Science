Q:

move_base takes longer time to update the Goal Status why?

Hello
I am doing an experiments on Navigation Stack by referring the Link ( http://wiki.ros.org/navigation  ) But While doing experiment I am facing one Issue.
I am using Rtabmap ( Localization ) + visual odometry + move_base ( with teb_local_planner ).
I am sending goal to the move_base by Cpp APIs, The myprogram.cpp( CPP code ) sends  5 goals to the robot one after the other but after reaching each goal the Robot waits for the GOAL STATUS for more than 2 minutes or it takes longer time than this .Please can you suggest me why the Status takes much longer time to update. Is their any parameter in move_base pkg or in the teb_local_planner which affect this ?

have you checked parameters xy_goal_tolerance and yaw_goal_tolerance in the teb_local_planner?
Comment by Aasiya Shaikh on 2017-02-08:
Yes I have checked My Values are :
xy_goal_tolerance = 0.02
yaw_goal_tolerance = 0.08
Do this parameter have any relation with status ?

A:

You may have already found a solution to this problem, but I am currently doing the exact same thing, and I was encountering the exact same problem. I was also using the teb_local_planner, but it really didn't make sense that the local planner could be causing the waits. In the end I decided it was something in move_base, so I put together a very simplistic version of move_base where I monitor the global planner, local planner, and costmaps. This may not be the best answer for this problem as move_base has some nice features that I am missing, but I don't have it wait anymore when it reaches the waypoints and I also didn't need some of the other features in move_base as well. If you need some examples, look at NavfnROS and TrajectoryPlannerROS. I only suggested these planners because  they have some examples of how to set it up, but you don't have to use those exact planners. You can use the global_planner and the teb_local_planner in a very similar way or even write your own.
