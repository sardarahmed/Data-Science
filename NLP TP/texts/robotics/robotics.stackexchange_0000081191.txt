Q:

Install ROS Kinetic with Anaconda/Miniconda

Hi, I am trying to install ROS Kinetic but I need Anaconda. When I run catkin_make I get the following error

A:

to use Anaconda you will need to do a lot with your PYTHONPATH to make sure that all dependencies are on the path that Anaconda's interpreter is using.
I would recommend trying to find a way to use anaconda separately/in parallel with your anaconda installation. The main problem is that Anaconda doesn't use the standard installed python libraries so often you end up with missing resources.
I'd recommend searching for other questions about anaconda on this site. Here's a quick sampling:
