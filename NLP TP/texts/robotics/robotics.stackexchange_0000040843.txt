A:

You can always download the package and build it. Try:
svn co http://swri-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/motoman
rosmake motoman

There also appears to be tutorials for it too, so take a look at them.

Don't forget to add that working copy to your $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. The rosws script is a good way to manage source tree checkouts.
