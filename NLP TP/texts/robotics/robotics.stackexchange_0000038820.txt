as it said here....
for Ubuntu 10.10 systems with the ROS Electric binaries installed use
"rosinstall ~/ros /opt/ros/electric 'http://www.ros.org/wiki/roboearth?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=roboearth.rosinstall'"
how about 11.04 system?
i think i missing something here...

for ~/ros...do i need to change it to my own path?

It should work for Ubuntu 11.04 too. ~/ros is the directory where the stacks & packages will be downloaded to.

A:

Try the hint given in the svn output (i.e. "locked svn: run 'svn cleanup' to remove locks"). Or you might try to just delete the whole directory and start from scratch again.
