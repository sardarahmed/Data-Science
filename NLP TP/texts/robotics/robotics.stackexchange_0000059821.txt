Did you add the laser topic in rviz? What frame is the laser scan in? What is your fixed_frame in rviz?

the error under LaserScan Status is :- Transform [sender=/sicklms] For frame [laser]: Fixed Frame [base_laser] does not exist
i tried editing the fixed_frame as map , still didnt work

A:

This is a transform problem. The laser measurements are published in the base_laser coordinate frame, but rviz is trying to display them in the "laser" or "map" coordinate frame. Set your fixed frame to "base_laser" and you should see the data displayed. If you want to use another frame you need to make sure TF transforms are published to connect base_laser to your other frames (for instance by using http://wiki.ros.org/robot_state_publisher and a urdf)

my fixed fram is set to base_laser only, still no data. I do not understand what is supposed to be done. Sorry for being a noob but please help.

sounds like the laser is actually using the "laser" coordinate frame.... what do you see in the frame_id field of the laser message when you echo it?

Stuck at the same point.   Have tried changing the Fixed Frame under Global Options from "map"  to "base_laser" and  "laser".   I can see the data being published  when I do rostopic echo /scan.   Still no data showing up on map.

Got it to work.   Changed the Fixed Frame in Global Options to "laser"  and the topic in LaserScan to "/scan".
