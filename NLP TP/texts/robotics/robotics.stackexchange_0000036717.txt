A:

In general, there is no private messaging provided. It is possible for moderators to send private messages to users and for users to send private messages to the moderator team using the "give feedback" link at the bottom of the page.
Even without private messaging provided by ROS Answers, you can sometimes find the user's email with enough searching (either their weblinks or previous ros-users posts). Keep in mind the Support Guidelines, namely that questions sent directly to developers will not help the community at large the next time a similar question comes up.

If you use The @user name it will notify them that you have replied to them.
