Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: rviz vs vtk

I have a to create a new vizualizer for a robot related project. While I have solid experience with OpenGL, that experience points to there being a productivity gain from using a toolkit. The decision comes down to rviz, or VTK.
The vizualizer will need to be:

embed-able in other applications
middleware agnostic
displays will renders, there seems to be more to leverage from VTK

To be honest, from what I see there is very little I can leverage from rviz. What I may want to leverage have ties to the "ros way" of doing things which conflict with being middleware agnostic. VTK also seems to have a larger set of components, and potential power.
Thoughts?
Related, can ogre and VTK play together in the same app? (i.e. if someone wanted to make an rviz plugin for a VTK based component)

A:

VTK is a better approach for ROS-agnostic visualization.
I believe VTK uses OGRE, itself.
If you later want to integrate your tool into a ROS system, you might consider the new rqt framework, which is designed to be easier to plug into than rviz.
