Q:

How to Launch OpenNI for KINECT

I am having trouble launching OpenNI in ROS. Here is the code that is generated in the terminal. Please help!
...auto-starting new master

Also, I can not post the output from rostopic hz /camera/rgb/points because when I enter that command, the terminal does not respond.

The problem is: The terminal stops after those two lines. Shouldn't I be able to enter additional commands? The terminal window behaves as if it's still working on some part of the program.

What exactly is the problem you are having? That looks like normal startup for the openni_node. Can you post the output of 'rostopic hz /camera/rgb/points'? That will tell you if the driver is actually streaming data that you could then examine in rviz.

... the last two lines are: [ INFO] [1304977559.863246868]: rgb_frame_id = '/openni_rgb_optical_frame'
[ INFO] [1304977559.865246392]: depth_frame_id = '/openni_depth_optical_frame'

A:

This is entirely normal behavior. After successfully launching, the terminal will not allow you enter additional commands, as the driver is still working - it is in fact in the actual data streaming loop.
In order to run additional commands (such as rostopic hz /camera/rgb/points or rosrun rviz rviz), you will have to open new terminal windows to enter them in.
If you are new to ROS, I suggest you go through the beginner tutorials to get a feel for how you normally start, interact with and write ROS nodes.
