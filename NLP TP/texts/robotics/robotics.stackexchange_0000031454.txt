Q:

Packages at http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu natty main are empty

I'm trying to install ros-diamondback-desktop-full on Ubuntu 11.04, but I noticed that the packages at http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu/dists/natty/main/binary-amd64/ are empty. Are the packages for Natty not ready yet?

A:

As far as I know, they are still setting up for Natty packages. You can check the status of builds here: http://www.ros.org/debbuild/diamondback.html

It's on the order of week(s)

Interesting.  Any idea on a timeframe?  Are we talking a week?  A month?  6?

we're still rolling out patches and fixes in the low-level stacks.  Natty introduced a lot of changes, including Python, GCC, Boost, and more, so it's taking longer than anticipated.

Taking a look at the build status page linked above, there are still some outstanding debs that aren't building and are notable. Specifically I see vision_opencv and simulator_stage in the red (ie broken). Many packages are built though, so progress is being made.

Any updates for this?  I'd love to install the desktop installation on Natty, so that I can have working graphics.

fergs' answer is correct.  We only just spun up the repository today, and numerous stacks are not yet compatible with natty.  We appreciate any patches from the community.
