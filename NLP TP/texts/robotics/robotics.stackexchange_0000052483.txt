Q:

PrimeSense Carmine not working in ROS while kinect works

I got a PrimeSense Carmine 1.09 and plugged in my laptop.
As I got kinect working before, I was really shocked that Carmine didn't work...
Is there any difference between the driver for kinect and Carmine?
Thanks in advance!

Have a try with the soon-to-come OpenNI2 support in ROS: http://answers.ros.org/question/54747/primesense-carmine-doesnt-work-but-asus-xtion-does-openni-launch-devices-connected-but-not-found/?answer=66451#post-id-664511

Thanks! However do you have an idea when are they going to release?

That's being worked on as we speak: https://github.com/ros-drivers/openni_camera/issues/15

Both OpenNI2 camera & launch have been released. They are currently available only on the shadow-fixed repo. The next sync should bring them into public as well.
