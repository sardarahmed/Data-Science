Q:

Adding a new folder with displays in rviz

When I want to add a new display to rviz there are two folders I can choose from: rviz and rviz_plugin_tutorials. I want to add a new folder with new displays. How can I do that? I want to choose display from object_recognition_ros_visualization.

A:

You will have to start rviz in an environment where this package is installed / compiled and the corresponding setup.bash file is sourced.
