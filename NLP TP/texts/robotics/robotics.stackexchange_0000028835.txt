Q:

What are the changelogs of Gazebo 7.16.0 recently released?

On Ubuntu 16.04, up until one week ago the gazebo version released on the PPA below was the 7.15.0
echo "deb http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable `lsb_release -cs` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list

wget http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.key -O - | apt-key add -

Today when installing gazebo again, the version installed was 7.16.0.
I couldn't find the changelog of this version on https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/src/default/Changelog.md
Does anybody know what changed from version 7.15.0 to 7.16.0?
