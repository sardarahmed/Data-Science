Q:

libopencv2.3-dev conflict

I enabled the ROS Electric repository in Ubuntu 11.10. However, while installing ros-electric-desktop-full, I ran into the following dependency conflict - ros-electric-vision-opencv depends on libopencv2.3-dev version 2.3.1+svn6514+branch23-7~oneiric; however, the version of libopencv2.3-dev available is 2.3.1+svn6514+branch23-8~oneiric. I think the ros-electric-vision-opencv dependency list needs to be updated to bring it in sync with the version of libopencv2.3-dev.
