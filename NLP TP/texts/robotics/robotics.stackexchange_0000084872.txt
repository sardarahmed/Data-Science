Q:

Problem reinstalling ros indigo

I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 and had previously installed ros indigo. I uninstalled it with
sudo apt-get purge ros-indigo*
sudo apt-get autoremove

then tried the steps in the wiki to install it again, did all the steps but when I get to
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-desktop-full 

this comes up
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 ros-indigo-desktop-full : Depends: ros-indigo-desktop but it is not going to be installed
                       Depends: ros-indigo-perception but it is not going to be installed
                       Depends: ros-indigo-simulators but it is not going to be installed
                       Depends: ros-indigo-urdf-tutorial but it is not going to be installed

Does anyone have an idea on how to install ROS?

A:

It seems to still think you have ros-indigo-desktop, ros-indigo-perception, ros-indigo-simulators and ros-indigo-urdf-tutorial installed or something related to those. I suppose your purge didn't work entirely. Try and delete them again through a sudo apt-get remove packagename?
If that fails, you can try and do a sudo apt-get install -f (attempt to fix any broken packages). And then try to run your install again or try to delete them again and try the install again after that.
