Q:

Error starting Turtlebot 2

Hey,
I am currently using a Turtlebot 2 with ROS groovy.
When I start the script minimal.launch in the package turtlebot_bringup on the robot's laptop, I get the following error :
nodelet: /usr/include/eigen3/Eigen/src/Core/DenseStorage.h:69: Eigen::internal::plain_array<T, Size, MatrixOrArrayOptions, 16>::plain_array() [with T = float, int Size = 4, int MatrixOrArrayOptions = 0]: Assertion `(reinterpret_cast<size_t>(array) & 0xf) == 0 && "this assertion is explained here: " "http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox-devel/TopicUnalignedArrayAssert.html" " **** READ THIS WEB PAGE !!! ****"' failed.

It seems that the problem come from the bumper2pc node, because if I comment the include tag corresponding to the bumper2pc I don't get the error...
Moreover if I connect the Kobuki base to my desktop computer, I can start the script and everything works perfectly.
All packages are up to date on both computers.
How can I solve this problem ?

What model/make is your laptop Caroline? Given that your pc is fine with the same software, maybe that can point us toward actually being able to reproduce the problem.

@Daniel : Thanks for your help, the model of my laptop is : Asus Eee PC 1025C.

Another question; do you have 32 or 64 bits OS installed?
Comment by CarolineQ on 2013-05-14:
@jorge : On the robot's laptop (Asus) I have a 32 bits OS installed, could this be a problem ? Thanks for help.
Comment by Daniel Stonier on 2013-05-14:
Yes, I think we have narrowed down the problem. Eigen will align long, float and double variables differently on 32/64 bit, so what may work on one, might not on the other. We'll try and reproduce here.

Follow the bug report on github.
