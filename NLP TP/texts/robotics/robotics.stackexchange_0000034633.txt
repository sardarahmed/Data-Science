Q:

CUDA aware ROS node

Hi,
I am a CUDA newbie. I managed to install CUDA on my lucid (Ref: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1625433 ) and I am able to run all the examples  in the SDK. Now I am trying to have CUDA aware ros node.
I tried http://www.ros.org/wiki/cuda. But it is compiling forever (> 3hrs ).
[ I killed the make and it messed up with my nvidia driver.
I then have to re-install the nvdia drivers]
Is there anything else I should do before rosmaking the gpgpu stack ?
(http://www.ros.org/wiki/cuda).

hello , my question http://answers.ros.org/question/60862/how-to-use-cuda-in-ros-furete/   ,can you give me some advice about above question/     thanks

A:

I suggest that you not use the gpgpu stack at all; instead, install CUDA like you would any third-party library dependency, and add CUDA-appropriate lines to your package's CMakeLists.
Put differently, treat your ROS package like you would any other compile that needs CUDA; don't try to get CUDA through ROS.
