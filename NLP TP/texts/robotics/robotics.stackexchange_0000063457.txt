Q:

how to omit the step of setup.bash every time?

I am new in ROS. I have a question.
When I use ROS, I have to do like this every time I start new window of Terminal.

$ source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

and this step enable me to use  "roscd".
Do I have to do this step every time?
Or does anyone know how to skip this step?
If there is a website about this, please let me know.

A:

Put this line in your .bashrc and it will be executed every time you open a terminal automatically.
