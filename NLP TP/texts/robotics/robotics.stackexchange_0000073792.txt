I have the same problem. According to this thread at stackoverflow it might be because of mismatching Boost and QT versions.

A:

I just fixed adding as "The Martin" said:
In qnode.cpp:
#ifndef Q_MOC_RUN
#include <ros/ros.h>
#include "../include/testpackage/qnode.hpp"
#include <ros/network.h>
#endif

Did you add a separate qnode.cpp file, or the file was exisiting, and you edited it??

As an addition: The #ifndef Q_MOC_RUN .. #endif statement has to encapsulate all ros- and boost-related includes in your code. It should not encapsulate Qt or STL-includes.
