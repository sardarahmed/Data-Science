Q:

CMake_Error, gazebo_ros

hello, when i try to use catkin_make for my workspace, i got this error
CMake Error at /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:83 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "gazebo_ros" with
  any of the following names:

    gazebo_rosConfig.cmake
    gazebo_ros-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "gazebo_ros" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "gazebo_ros_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "gazebo_ros" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  RoboND-Kinematics-Project/gazebo_grasp_plugin/CMakeLists.txt:9 (find_package)

Makefile:1914: recipe for target 'cmake_check_build_system' failed
make: *** [cmake_check_build_system] Error 1
Invoking "make cmake_check_build_system" failed

my workspace contain only this package in the src: https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Kinematics-Project
i removed my gazebo and installed a new version gazebo9, i thought this what cause the error so i removed it and installed gazebo7 again.
when i try to use catkin_make with a workspace which doesn't contain any thing related to gazebo it works fine.
i am using Ubuntu 16, gazebo 7.14.0, kinetic-kame.
Thanks in advance

A:

The gazebo_ros package doesn't seem to be installed, check if rospack find gazebo_ros return a path and if not install the package : sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-gazebo-ros.
