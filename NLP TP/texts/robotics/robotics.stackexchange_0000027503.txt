Q:

Even static object are movable in Translation mode

Using Translation Mode I can move any objects on Gazebo AFA I tried, whether an object is is_static true or not. If this is true, is there a way to make objects not transferable?
Example
$ gazebo /usr/share/gazebo-2.2/worlds/willowgarage.world  
:
Gazebo multi-robot simulator, version 2.2.5

A:

The is_static tag means something is not movable by physics, but it is still movable by the user.
You could try adding a joint from the world to the model. The user can drag it away but as soon as the mouse is released, the model should snap back to the original pose.
