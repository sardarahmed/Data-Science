Q:

Gazebo fail to connect to master in 30 seconds. It does not run from the very first time

I am new to Gazebo as well as Ubuntu...
So dont have much knowledge about any of them.
I have been trying to install gazebo's latest version.
Step by step copying the lines from the installation guide to the terminal.
But at the end when i try to run gazebo it tells to wait for master and never connects to it.
Below is the terminal screen after i enter Gazebo.

Please open one question per problem.

A:

Do the following:

source /usr/share/gazebo-1.8/setup.sh

gzserver

on a new shell run,gzclient <your-world.sdf>. If you run just gzclient, you will see the empty world.

There are many gazebo lovers here who can help you out but in future remember to post questions related to standalone gazebo on answers.gazebosim.org or at least post a copy there.

@SalmaanAhmed please mark answer as correct if it helped you

Very helpful but gzserver should have the world not gzclient.
http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=components&cat=get_started (at the bottom).
E.g.
gzserver <your-world.sdf>
then in new terminal
gzclient
