Q:

rxbag plot does not show any message fields

I'm trying to use the "plot" plugin for rxbag in order to plot (x,y,z) depth data from a kinect.  I'm able to open the plot gui, but when I click on the cog icon to select fields to plot, nothing happens.
Can anyone tell me why this is happening?
Thanks,
Paul.
EDIT:  I am using electric on ubuntu 10.4.

Pre-formatted text lines start with four spaces.

joq:  Apologies for another basic question:  How did you format the above edit to appear as it did on my screen?  (assuming you did this).
Comment by Paul0nc on 2011-11-07:
joq:  See my edit above regarding rosbag output.  Thanks.

What does rosbag info say about this bag file?

Eric:  I am using electric on ubuntu 10.4.  I do not get any error messages in the terminal.

Could you update your question to include which ROS release you are using (Diamondback, Electric, etc)? Do you get any error messages in the terminal where rxbag was run from?

A:

I don't see anything wrong with your bag contents. It has data, apparently the right type.
Sometimes I've noticed rxbag refusing to display message contents if its cursor is positioned at the beginning of the data.
Try moving the cursor past the first few messages before attempting to plot.

Agreed.  I'll check to see if one exists or open one.
Comment by joq on 2011-11-08:
We should open a defect ticket for this problem. It's been happening for several releases.

Many thanks joq.  Moving the cursor did the trick.
