Q:

Could not find a package configuration file provided by "cv_bridge"

I created my catkin package like so:
 catkin_create_pkg dcp_processing sensor_msgs cv_bridge roscpp std_msgs image_transport

I don't edit anything, then I compile the package:
catkin_make

I get that error the cv_bridge is missing. I didn't add or edit anything in the package so everything is by default as it is created with catkin_create_pkg.
I'm using Ubuntu 16.04 Kinetic ROS Distribution.

I get that error the cv_bridge is missing.

well, is it? Do you have ros-kinetic-cv-bridge installed? What is the output of rospack find cv_bridge?
Adding it to your package as a dependency does not automatigically make it available.

Yes I know but I did install ros full version so as I don't miss any package.
I get [rospack] Error: package 'cv_bridge' not found

A:

Yes I know but I did install ros full version so as I don't miss any package.

Installing ros-$distro-desktop-full does not result in all packages getting installed. The various metapackages provide you with a convenient way to install a select set of them, but definitely not all. See REP-142: ROS Indigo and Newer Metapackages - Desktop variants.

I get
[rospack] Error: package 'cv_bridge' not found

That would seem to indicate that cv_bridge is not installed on your machine. Check with dpkg -l | grep cv-bridge. If that also doesn't result in cv_bridge being found, then install it with (on Ubuntu):
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-cv-bridge

and try again.

Edit: cv_bridge should be installed as part of vision_opencv which is (through perception) part of desktop_full, so not having cv_bridge would be strange if you did in fact install desktop_full.

dpkg -l | grep cv-bridge doesn't result anything so it is not installed. I just installed it and it works. Thanks! I want to know why it didn't get installed the first time when I installed ROS? usually I don't need to installed cv_bridge separately.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-10-03:
I don't know why it didn't get installed. What is the output of dpkg -l | grep desktop-full?
Comment by ROSkinect on 2017-10-03:
It doesn't show anything just like with dpkg -l | grep cv-bridge
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-10-03:
Then I guess you didn't "install ros full version" as you claimed earlier. Only ros-kinetic-desktop-full would install cv_bridge automatically.
Comment by ROSkinect on 2017-10-03:
I just checked with this: grep ros-kinetic ~/.bash_history I found that I launched sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-desktop-full
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-10-03:
According to everything I can find and verify desktop_full should install cv_bridge, so I'm not sure what happened.
You could see whether /var/log/apt/history.log or /var/log/apt/term.log contains anything that can shed some light.
