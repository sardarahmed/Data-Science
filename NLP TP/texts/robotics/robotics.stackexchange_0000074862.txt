A:

The start and end date are both at the unix epoch, i.e. zero. You need to set the message time. It is not necessarily the same as the time in the message header, but I guess for your purpose you can copy that one, if you have no original message time.

Sorry but i am confused . Is there a message time for rosbag file and a message time for topics ?? if it is so how do i set the time for rosbag file. Thanks for your replay.

The messages have a timestamp in the bagfile, so rosbag knows in which sequence play them. Also rosbag uses them to publish the /clock topic, so all nodes can act as if the data were current. Some messages also contain timestamps within the payload data of the message, usually by including "Header"

How did you "write" the bagfile?
