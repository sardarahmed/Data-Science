Q:

Error while running move_group.launch ( MoveitSimpleControllerManager: Action client not connected: arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory )

Hi, This question was already asked once but was not answered as it did not have sufficient information. On running the moveit_group.launch, following is the error thrown:
MoveitSimpleControllerManager: Action client not connected: cool1000_trajectory_controller/follow_joint_trajectory
Action client not connected: cool1000_gripper_controller/gripper_action

The code in the following link "https://github.com/davetcoleman/clam" is customized to a 7 dof arm having a different configuration from clam arm. The difference is in the sequence of joints in the arm. Here is the data in the configuration files:
cool1000.yaml
joint1_controller:
type: dynamixel_hardware_interface/JointPositionController

      init: 2048
      min: 1017
      max: 3084

joint3_controller:

        joint7:

The above config files are called within a launch file having the following line in it:
  <!-- Start arm trajectory action controller. -->
  <rosparam file="$(find cool1000_controller)/config/cool1000_trajectory_controller.yaml" command="load"/>
  <node name="arm_trajectory_controller_spawner" pkg="dynamixel_hardware_interface" type="controller_spawner.py"
    args="--manager=cool1000_controller_manager
          --port=multi_joint_dummy_port
          cool1000_trajectory_controller"
    output="screen"/>

In the cool1000_moveit_config folder following are the values in the controllers.yaml:
controller_manager_ns: cool1000_controller_manager
controller_list:
  - name: cool1000_trajectory_controller
  action_ns: follow_joint_trajectory
  type: FollowJointTrajectory
  default: true
  joints:
   - joint1
   - joint2
   - joint3
   - joint4
   - joint5
   - joint6
   - joint7
- name: cool1000_gripper_controller
  action_ns: gripper_action
  type: GripperCommand
  default: true
  joints:
   - gripper_joint

Did you already solve the isue of the  "action client not connected" problem?
I will be very interested if you have.
Comment by Sphenops on 2015-05-29:
Hi Daan, yes I have got a reason why this error is thrown and hopefully it is right. Just dint post it as I am still not sure if that solution helps.You would need to write a code for client similar to the one provided in this link: http://wiki.ros.org/dynamixel_controllers/Tutorials/Creatingdynami

Hi Daan, were you able to resolve the error?
Comment by dan on 2017-03-07:
Would you post how you modified that dynamixel example?  I have the exact same issue and tried to use that example, with appropriate changes, but still have the same error.

A:

Creating a client similar to the one provided in this linked solved the issue:

Can you explain how did you implement that client? or what has to be changed in order to work with the robot? thank you!
Comment by Sphenops on 2017-03-15:
Please check the flow of the code.Through the client you send the data to the server.Usually this error comes either when you do not have the server launched, or the names of the message do not match for the data to be passed from client to the server.Look for the message FollowJointTrajectoryAction

Hello!
Can you please give us more details?I have the same problem since one month and i can't solve.
