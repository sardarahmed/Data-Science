Q:

Point cloud Data analysis from ROS bag - Info required

I am asking for information on how to proceed. I am fairly new to ROS environment.
I have ROS bag recorded data with point cloud topics (x,y,z,velocity,intensity). I have to perform analysis on this data.

First I have  to extract Only the point cloud topics from Rosbag. Any suggestions on how to achieve this ?

Second take the extracted point cloud topics and be able to either plot or graph (x,y,z,velocity,intensity). Any suggestion on which software/language/platform is best to achieve this. ?

Appreciate all the help I can get here.

A:

Check out the rosbag Code APIs. This will allow you to isolate messages from specific topics from the rosbag.
You can use either C++ or Python to process your rosbags and point clouds. I'm not familiar with getting velocity or intensity data from PointCloud2 messages but in general I find that if you want more than x,y,z data from the point clouds then it's better to use C++. The Python API for accessing point clouds data is more limited. Check out the Point Cloud Library (PCL) for processing point clouds.
