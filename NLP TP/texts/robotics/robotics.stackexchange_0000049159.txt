Q:

how to change usb_cam parameters?

Hello.
I have installed usb_cam package. And making use of it with visp_auto_tracker:

roslaunch visp_auto_tracker tracklive_usb.launch

But the camera looks quite bright, i would like to edit those parameters (brightness, contrast, etc.) as easily as with dynamic_reconfigure and uvc (which i used for a totally different project):

rosrun dynamic_reconfigure dynparam set /uvc_cam_node contrast 90

Please help.
Greetings ROS community.

I found a "workaround" for my petition: guvcview will configure the webcam, whenever i quit guvcview the changes modified (with the graphical interface) will remain when launching with visp_auto_tracker .
However, it still lacks the functional properties of dynamic_reconfigure , for example dumping

A:

did you try rqt_rconfigure ?
rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure

usb_cam does not currently provide dynamic_reconfigure access to camera parameters, so running this command will not do anything to address the question (though it will provide access to compression settings in image_transport)
