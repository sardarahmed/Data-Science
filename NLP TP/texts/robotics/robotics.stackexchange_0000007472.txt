Wiring & driving TowerPro SG90 servos

I got my hands on a few Tower Pro SG90 9G servos but cannot find their schematics or datasheet anywhere (besides that link).
I have the following concerns:

Looks like they're rated for 4.8V, but will they tolerate a 5V supply?
How do I determine the current they require, in amps, mA, etc.?
There's 3 wires: brown, red & yellow-orange, what do each of these guys do?

If I had to guess I'd say that red is power, another one is direction, and another one is the position to rotate to

A:

Regarding the voltage, the Amazon listing for this servo gives the operating voltage range to be 3.0 to 7.2V, so it should accept 5V no problem. 
Regarding the current draw, on the user questions section of the same page, one user stated that these servos drew between 750 - 1000mA when fully loaded. 
Regarding the wiring, PCB has a great article on servos that says the wiring would go generally how you would think - red is (+), black or brown is (-), and the other wire is signal. It says that Tower servos use red, black, and white wires. 
Hope this helps!
