Hi @jenanaputra,
To add a (sonar) sensor to a model, you just need to attach the sensor link to you main model link and instantiate the sonar plugin to produce readings. hector_sensors_descriptionpackage have already implemented a sonar sensor model with its own plugin, you can check here. If you have doubts about Xacro or URDF you can check this and this links
Wih that Xacro macro you can instantiate the sonar sensor and attach it to the model providing the proper parent link name. E.g.: base_link. Once attached when you launch the simulation you will be able to see it working. If you have doubts about sensor or plugin on Gazebo you can check this link and this.
Hope this helps you.
Regards.
