Q:

netft sensor integration with UR5?

Hi,
I am trying to integrate the netft sensor mounted on ur5 with ROS groovy (on Ubuntu 12.04). I also came across this particular stack  here. As I understand, this stack is built using rosmake and it is still associated with the old ROS versions(Diamondback, Fuerte). Has anyone tried to implement and integrate this stack in groovy, more specifically using catkin_make? If yes, requesting you to kindly share the details.
This tutorial here, seems to be very latest. This is what I would like to achieve in groovy. I would also want to understand the effort/steps involved in making the changes?
Awaiting your response,
Thanks and Regards,
Murali

Maybe late but for people looking for it, I have catkinized the netft metapackage.
