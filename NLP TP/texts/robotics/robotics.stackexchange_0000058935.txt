Q:

openni2 color point cloud

Hellow,
When I was using openni2_launch in groovy I had a topic camera/depth/points_xyzrgba. Or now I have only camera/depth/points. Is there any reason for that ? How can I recover the color of the Point Cloud now ?
Thanks

A:

For openni2_launch, there are several arguments that need to be set in order to get color point clouds.  For the ASUS sensors, all you have to do is set depth_registration:=true, which will enable the hardware to create the color point clouds.  This should give you /depth_registered/points which you can display in color.  If you want to create color point clouds using software instead of hardware, then set depth_registration to false, and rgb_processing, depth_processing, and depth_registered_processing to true (should be set by default in openni2.launch).  This should give you /depth/points which is not color, and /depth_registered/points which is in color.  The problem I have discovered is that  /depth_registered/points does not display correctly when using software depth registration.  I do not get a color point cloud unless part of the camera is occluded and the point cloud is very small.
I would be curious to know if anyone else has had this problem or if it is repeatable for anyone else.
