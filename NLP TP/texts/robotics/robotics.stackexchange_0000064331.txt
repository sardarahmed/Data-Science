Q:

Build failed in Jenkins

Hi there, I released the new ros packages using the bloom 0.5.12.
But, Since the update the souredeb Jenkins job has been repeatedly failing.
Please See http://jenkins.ros.org/job/ros-indigo-waypoints-navigation_sourcedeb/198/
Umm.. What should I do?

Maybe you want to add the result of $ bloom-release --version to your description.

A:

Please see Jenkins Build Errors.
dpkg-source: error: syntax error in ros-indigo-waypoints-navigation-0.0.1/debian/control at line 10: block lacks the 'Package' field
dpkg-buildpackage: error: dpkg-source -i -I --before-build ros-indigo-waypoints-navigation-0.0.1 gave error exit status 25
debuild: fatal error at line 1350:
dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -d -us -uc -i -I -S failed
gbp:error: debuild -i -I returned 29
gbp:error: Couldn't run 'debuild -i -I -S -uc -us --lintian-opts --suppress-tags newer-standards-version'

You mention using Bloom 0.5.12, but the error message seems to be similar to the one copy/pasted in the post I referenced: are you sure you are using that version of bloom? Several updates have been released recently.

I checked the version of the bloom from README.md.

I'll try it from raising the version of bloom.

This problem was resolved thanks to your support. I was mistaken about this problem is inherent in the bloom 0.5.13. The solution was to use the bloom 0.5.14.
