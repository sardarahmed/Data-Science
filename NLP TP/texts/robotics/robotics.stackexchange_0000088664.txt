Q:

Error: ‘tf’ has not been declared

I'm following the MoveIt Tutorials.
I'm try to  catkin_make, but have a issue with package "moveit_tutorials"  .
    /home/bkmen/catkin_ws/src/moveit_tutorials/doc/pick_place/src/pick_place_tutorial.cpp: In function ‘void pick(moveit::planning_interface::MoveGroupInterface&)’:

Please post your source code as well. It's likely that you've forgotten to include the necessary headers for tf.

Also, can you please update your question with a link to the tutorial that you're referring to
Comment by mlautman on 2018-08-29:
Is there a reason you are using catkin_make instead of catkin build? The tutorials specifically tell you to use catkin build

@mlautman: your reply was not an answer, so I've converted it to a comment.

A:

Yes, i'm include  <tf/transform_broadcaster.h>  into pick_place_tutorial.cpp and the issue has solved. Thanks.

its the same error come while running the rrt algorithm and this solve the issue by adding this to the error generating file. Thanks for the answer.
