I find that src/ (add_two_ints_client.cpp) is present.
Even then I'm getting this error

Please add the output of tree /home/kv/catkin_ws/src to your original question. Use the edit button/link for that.

I have added it

A:

It seems that your problem is that you have created add_two_ints_client.cpp and add_two_ints_server.cpp in the src folder of your catkin workspace, while they should instead be in an src folder inside beginner_tutorials (i.e. catkin_ws/beginner_tutorials/src).
Moving your scripts in there should allow catkin_make to successfully build.
Also, make sure you have declared your executables in the CMakeList.txt file inside the beginner_tutorials folder. You should have something like:
add_executable(add_two_ints_server src/add_two_ints_server.cpp)
target_link_libraries(add_two_ints_server ${catkin_LIBRARIES})
add_dependencies(add_two_ints_server beginner_tutorials_gencpp)

add_executable(add_two_ints_client src/add_two_ints_client.cpp)
target_link_libraries(add_two_ints_client ${catkin_LIBRARIES})
add_dependencies(add_two_ints_client beginner_tutorials_gencpp)

Hope this helps.
