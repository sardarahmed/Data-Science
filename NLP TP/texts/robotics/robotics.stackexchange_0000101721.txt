Q:

How to distribute amcl's particles all over the map?

Hi, when you first launch Rviz with particle cloud, the particles is gathered around the robot model, I wonder how to make those particles distribute all over my map? Thanks in advance.

A:

The amcl node provides a service named "global_localization". It is documented on the wiki page for the amcl node. You can call the service from code or from the terminal command line.
