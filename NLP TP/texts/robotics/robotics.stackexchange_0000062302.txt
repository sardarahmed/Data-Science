Q:

global path planner pass through high cost area on local cost map

hi, all,
the global path planner on my robot NavfnROS always produces plans that pass through dark area on local cost map.
and whenever it does so, the robot refuses to move. I guess it's because there's a risk for collision. my parameter settings are quite simple
NavfnROS:
  allow_unknown: false

how do I prevent the planner giving plan that transverse dark area on the local cost map

A:

You have to make sure that the "dark area" on the local cost map also appears on the global cost map. If I am not mistaken, the global path planner does not take into account the local cost map.
