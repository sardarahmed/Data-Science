Q:

Local vs. Global Parameters? In a Launch File?

Hello,
What is the difference between setting a parameter in a launch file like this (i.e. outside of a node tag):
<param name="param01" value="value01" />
<node name="node01" pkg="package01" type="node01" />

and this (i.e. wrapped inside of a node tag):
<node name="node01" pkg="package01" type="node01">
      <param name="param01" value="value01" />
</node>

Thanks a lot!

A:

The first example defines a "relative" name.
The second defines a "private" parameter.
Most ROS nodes look for parameters in their private namespace, so the second is generally preferred. But, there are sometimes reasons to define parameters at a higher level, as in the first example.

It's relative, not global. When pushed into a namespace it will not be at the top level anymore (unless you use the /). When using the second variant, the parameters are private without the ~ already.
Comment by gavinmachine on 2011-11-25:
Would the top parameter also be considered a global? Also, does that mean that private param names should always start with "~" and global with "/" (following the link you provided)?
