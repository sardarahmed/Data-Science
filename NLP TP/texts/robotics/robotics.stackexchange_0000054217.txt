Q:

Why gmapping needs base_link → odom?

In my idea, the frame should be:
map->odom->base link->laser

gmapping says it needs:
<the frame attached to incoming scans> → base_link
    usually a fixed value, broadcast periodically by a robot_state_publisher, or a tf static_transform_publisher.
base_link → odom
    usually provided by the odometry system (e.g., the driver for the mobile base)

Why it just reverse?
Am I missing something?
Thank you~

A:

The gmapping specification only requires the ability to transform data from the laser scan frame into the base_link frame and from the base_link into odom frame.  It does not specify the exact way that the frames are connected.
