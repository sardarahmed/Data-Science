Q:

arm_navigation visualization error: No default planner configuration defined under 'default_planner_config'

Hello ROS Wizards,
I am trying out the new (and incredibly awesome) arm navigation planning wizard on my home built robot (Pi Robot).  The wizard runs flawlessly and I generated a planning group called "left arm" that runs from the torso link to the left hand link.
Next I wanted to try the planning components visualizer so I launched the automatically created planning_components_visualizer.launch file.  Most of the nodes fired up fine until I ran into the following error:
No default planner configuration defined under 'default_planner_config'. A default planner must be defined from among the configured planners

The full output from the launch file looks like this:

Any thoughts on how I can fix this?
Thanks!

A:

Add the following line at the end of your auto-generated YAML configuration file for OMPL (config/ompl_planning.yaml):
default_planner_config: SBLkConfig1
We'll update the gui soon so it reflects this change and adds the line in automatically.
