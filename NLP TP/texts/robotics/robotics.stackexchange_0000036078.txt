Q:

error while loading shared libraries: libros.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

I am using ROS Diamondback on Ubuntu 10.10.
I was running my ROS node without problem until I tried ssh to run a rosnode from a remote machine.
After that, on my own machine, when I run I ROS node which has been working fine earlier using rosrun, I encountered this error message:
error while loading shared libraries: libros.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Any pointers on how to fix this please? Thank you very much.

Hello Tuan,
I am also having similar kind of problem. Can you please tell me how you resolved that. I am a new user. So, I did not understand the steps you did to fix the problem.
Any help will be appreciated.

A:

Well, I did not know exactly what the problem was but I deleted the binary, remake and it worked again. However, I will really appreciate if anyone can share the reason for this happening please?
