A:

Hi,
I faced similar issue. It is the version control issue. I went to the link https://amor-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/hg/ and downloaded files and folders manually. And placed them in the same tree structure as given in the server and followed the rest of the process in the tutorial http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROSARIA/Tutorials/How%20to%20use%20ROSARIA. It worked for me. Let me know if you face any issues in the process.
Hope this helps.
Thanks,
Karthik
