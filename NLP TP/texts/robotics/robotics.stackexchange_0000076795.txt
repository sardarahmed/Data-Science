Q:

rtabmap_ros: how it works?

Hi to all,
I'm using the rtabmap_ros package in my project in order to build 3D maps from my recorded bags files.
The package works very well and I'm able to obtain accurate maps.
I've read all the documents about the RTAB-Map algorithm and also the articles wrote by Mathieu Labb√©.
The problem is that I still can't understand how mathematically the closed loop detection works and how the 3D map is built.
Is there any document which I can read in order to understand how the algorithm mathematically works?
Can you help me please?
Thank you a lot!

A:

Hi,
For loop closure detection, see this paper. The code follows pretty much the algorithms shown.
For the 3D map, we simply assemble point clouds of each node in the graph, as described loosely in the paper your referred:

Fig. 9 shows the resulting global map by assembling  the  RGB-D  point  clouds  from  the  Kinect  using the optimized poses of the graph.

Search Graph-Based SLAM to learn more about the map structure used in RTAB-Map.
cheers
