A:

You could take a look at mapviz. It's not RViz, but similar enough.
Less of a complete solution (and an actual RViz plugin): gareth-cross/rviz_satellite.
Another option might be osm_cartography.
I haven't used either, but I know the ppl behind mapviz and that is well maintained, sees a lot of usage and is still actively developed.

Edit: comment by @tfoote:

there's also rqt_marble and marble_plugin

+1 for mapviz the pure 2D interface is often better for these sorts of applications, there's also rqt_marble and marble_plugin
