Q:

Problem with roscore?

Well this is a new one. I updated my packages, and now roscore doesn't work. Here's the error code:
allenh1@muri-pc7:~$ roscore
... logging to /home/allenh1/.ros/log/b450054e-c45a-11e1-b560-0025648c1ab0/roslaunch-muri-pc7-2554.log
Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.
Press Ctrl-C to interrupt
Done checking log file disk usage. Usage is <1GB.

Traceback (most recent call last):

    version = rosstack.get_stack_version(stack_name)

    m.author = _check('author')(p, filename)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rospkg/manifest.py", line 67, in check
    raise InvalidManifest("Invalid manifest file [%s]: must have a single '%s' element"%(filename, name))

Invalid <param> tag: Cannot load command parameter [rosversion]: command [rosversion ros] returned with code [1]. 

Param xml is <param command="rosversion ros" name="rosversion"/>

What have I done now...

A:

Duplicate of this question. Just do a pip install -U rospkg.

I think we should stop recommending easy_install. Use pip, it's better.
Comment by ipso on 2012-07-02:
@joq +1: pip has 'uninstall', easy_install doesn't. Also pip freeze | grep XXX is nice.
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-07-02:
Both have their problems but you are right, I should stop mentioning easy_install.
Comment by Vittorio88 on 2012-07-15:
Actually the Question you linked to later says the correct solution is to remove rospkg, not reinstall it. Go to link to view full answer.
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-07-15:
That's not true. Look at the last sentence of my answer, in the edit. The correct solution for now is to update rospkg since it will be updated anyway when rosdep or rosrelease is installed or updated.
