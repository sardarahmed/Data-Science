Q:

std_msgs/ColorRGBA[].displaying different color for each point

Hello sir,
I am trying to display different color for each point. I am able to display points with single color using:
             draw.color.b = 1.0;
             draw.color.a = 1.0;

but in am unable to display points with different colors.
my lines of code is:
for(int i =0;i<=5;i++)

{

geometry_msgs::Point p;

     std_msgs::ColorRGBA c;
      p.x =i;
      p.y = 1;
      p.z = 1;
             c.r = 1;
             c.g = 1;
             c.b=1;
      draw.points.push_back(p);
      draw.colors.push_back(c);
}
marker_pub.publish(draw);

thanks for the help.

Please update your question to say what you see on the screen and what you expect to see when you render.

A:

In the code you posted, the color is the same (white) for all the points: r=g=b=1.  Maybe you meant to have something like:
c.r = 0;
c.g = 0;
c.b = float(i)/5;
Which would give you a spread from black to blue.
