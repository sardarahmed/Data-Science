Q:

ROSRUN missing command

On an Ubuntu 14.04 with Indigo (installed a while ago) and recently updated to catkin_tools,
I miss the rosrun command, cant run any node, the error in terminal is rosrun: command not found,
while all other other commands are present:
rosbag                        roslocate
rosclean                      rosmaster
rosco                         rosmsg
rosconsole                    rosmsg-proto
roscore                       rosnode
rosdep                        rospack
rosdep-source                 rosparam
rosdistro_build_cache         rosservice
rosdistro_migrate_to_rep_141  rossrv
rosdistro_migrate_to_rep_143  rosstack
rosdistro_reformat            rostest
rosgraph                      rostopic
rosinstall                    rosunit
roslaunch                     rosversion
roslaunch-complete            rosws
roslaunch-deps                roswtf
roslaunch-logs 

In my .bashrc I have:
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash 
source TE_workspace/devel/setup.bash
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:~/TE_workspace/src

where $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH is after exporting /opt/ros/indigo/share:/opt/ros/indigo/stacks:/home/user/TE_workspace/src
What am I missing? What could be the problem?

A:

Do you have the ros-indigo-rosbash package installed?

Thanks, that pkg was missing. It should had been installed earlier. I found out that a jade was also installed and I uninstalled recently could that action remove also rosbash? Different distro should not do something like that.

I don't know, that would completely depend on how you uninstalled, what commands you used, etc.
I do know that 'updating to catkin_tools' has nothing to do with it: you cannot actually 'upgrade' to it, as it is a stand-alone package, and orthogonal to any other ROS pkgs installed.
