Q:

Quadrocopter Ardrone detection and tracking QRCode

I'm now using a visp_auto_tracker package to detect QR-code for Quadrocopter, but during flying it can not work because of the vibration of Quadrocopter, how can I solve this problem? The aim is to detect it and use the relative position to fly stably and get the info from QR-code.

A:

Based on my prior experience, ar_track_alvar can robustly detect and track QR like tags on AR-Drone 2.0 video feed when the drone is hovering or slowly moving. Parrot Bebop Drone's (the successor to AR-Drone 2.0) video stream is quite stable since it performs on-board video stabilization. You may be able to use visp_auto_tracker with Bebop.
