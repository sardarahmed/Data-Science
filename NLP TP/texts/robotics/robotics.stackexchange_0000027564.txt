Q:

use of class RandomVelocityPrivatePlugin class

Hii,
May I know the need to make the class RandomVelocityPrivatePlugin in the source of RnadomVelcoity Plugin?
Is it just a default class for the cases, when user doesn't explicitly gives the update and clamping variables some value?

A:

The *Private classes are part of the PIMPL idiom implementation (opaque pointers).
You can see the PIMPL idiom listed in the Gazebo style guide.
