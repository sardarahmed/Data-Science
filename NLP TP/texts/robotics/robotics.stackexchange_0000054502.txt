Q:

Broken ROS hydro configuration

After during a system update this morning my ROS configuration is not valid anymore. I am using Ubuntu 12.04 and hydro.
My config is as follows (which used to work..):
source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash    # <-- ROS HYDRO
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:/some/path:/some/other/path
export ROS_WORKSPACE=/some/path
# Catkin workspace 
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
# MoveIT setup  (i installed from source..)
source ~/moveit/devel/setup.bash # <-- Using the source installation of moveit
# More modifications modifications
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:~/more/folders

As said this used to work, but not anymore. I now have to source my hydro setup manually (added it again as the final step in my bashrc file).
Any ideas of what caused this change? Am i doing something wrong in my configuration steps?
This is what is shown when running roscore

What is "not working" exactly? What environment variables are set? Some of the other setup.bash that you are sourcing might overwrite things.

I just updated the Question. What puzzles me is that it worked on Friday.. But after an update this morning something went wrong.

Did the system update also update ROS pacakges?

A:

Okay so this was a stupid typo in a package.xml file. I must have edited it as the last thing Friday. I corrected it and all works fine.
Sorry

Can you tell me how you solve the problem? Because I encounter the same problem.
Comment by Juan on 2015-01-03:
This is due to some syntax error in your package.xml. For me, I accidentaly hit enter in one line and broke a commented line into an uncommented one with syntax errors. After fixing this, I could run roscore again.
