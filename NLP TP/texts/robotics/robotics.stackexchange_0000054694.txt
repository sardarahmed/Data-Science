Q:

Retrieve end effector pose in MoveIt

I am creating a node that has to publish the pose (and if possible twist) of the end effector.
My robot publishes a tf which I think could be used in this fashion. But I would also like to benefit from MoveIt's high-level API which allows to give names to the end effectors.
Additional question: if you have anything for the end effector twist, that would be very helpful.

With twist do you mean how it is oriented or how it is moving (i.e. velocities)?
Comment by Flavian on 2013-10-09:
Yes, as in geometry_msgs::Twist

A:

As stated in here by Simon Jansen:

Assuming you're using the high-level
movegroup interface, could you not do
something like this:
moveit::planning_interface::MoveGroup *group; 
group = new moveit::planning_interface::MoveGroup("arm");
group->setEndEffectorLink("hand_left");
geometry_msgs::PoseStamped current_pose =
group->getCurrentPose();

but this is if you want to define a new group. If you want to use the group linked to your previous end-effector you should do:
moveit::planning_interface::MoveGroup group("your end-effector");
group.getCurrentPose();
