Q:

Navigation Without Pre-Built Map for Collision-Free Movement

I want to design a vehicle to operate in an environment where building the map initially is not feasible.

A:

Yes, in 2 ways.

You can build a map while your navigating, there's no requiring the map is prebuilt, just if you have one its available. You can navigate fine in SLAM because its still providing the map -> odom transform & also giving you the map image if that's helpful for navigating in your case

Nothing in navigation strictly requires a map, you can navigate without a map, just can't use the static layers in your costmap meaningfully

hi,
if I want to use the first approach, navigating while mapping and localization (SLAM), do i need to put rolling-window as TRUE, in both local and global costmap param???
