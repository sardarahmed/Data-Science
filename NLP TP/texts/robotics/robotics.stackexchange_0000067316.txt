Hi SakulRelda,
just have a look to the github-repository here and the C-API-documentation here. Insert "manipulator"instead of "right_arm". Compiling works using the command catkin_make in the command line. Have a look at this tutorial.
Using all that you'll be able to use the UR5 through C-API.
Best regards

Note that the C-API driver is only compatible with system versions up to 1.8 on CB2 controllers. CB3 controllers are not supported (see also wiki/ur_c_api_bringup).
