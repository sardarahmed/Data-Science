Q:

pointcloud_to_laserscan error on eddiebot stack

Hi everybody, I'm trying to run successfully the following launch file:
robotictang/eddiebot/blob/master/eddiebot/eddiebot_bringup/kinect.launch

This code block was moved to the following github gist:
https://gist.github.com/answers-se-migration-openrobotics/5005c79984aa828d9ab174a6b8195085

which is part of the eddiebot stack
it was created by Tang Tiong Yew to interface the Eddie robot with ROS using turtlebot API's
I installed the package point_cloud_to_laserscan and the error keeps apearing.
I saw that the use of this package was eliminated from the most recent turtlebot stack file.
they use insted "3d.sensor.launch" is there a way that I can use that file for this robot?
thank you,
Omar

thank you it worked,
here is my generic kinect.launch file
do I need to modify anything else?
