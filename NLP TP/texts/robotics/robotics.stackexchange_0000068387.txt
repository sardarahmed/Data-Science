Q:

Trying to Update Pose of HectorSLAM

Hi guys,
I am using hector mapping and it works kind of good. I want to synchronize the map with some other tool and I would like to know:
How can I delete/reset/restart the map which is created by hector mapping
How can I set the inital pose of hector mapping for example it is not (0,0,0) it is (13,21,5)
Thanks for your help.

A:

The clearing question I already answered here.
The estimated pose can be moved by publishing to the "/initialpose" topic just how it is done for AMCL. The easiest option is to just use the "2D Pose Estimate" button in rviz. Currently, this does not automatically reset the map however.
