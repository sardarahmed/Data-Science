Q:

when trying to install the ros jade packages it doesn't show up the file or directory

$ sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-ros-tutorials

I used
$ sudo apt-get install ros-<jade>-ros-tutorials

it shows
bash: jade : No such file or directory

Could anyone please help me out in installation process.

A:

The angle brackets normally indicate that they should be replace with the name of the distro, so the correct command is:
sudo apt-get install ros-jade-ros-tutorials
