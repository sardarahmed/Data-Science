Q:

source based install of orocos_kinematics_dynamic failed with vcs not setup correctly when installing ros electric from source

I ran the following:
rosinstall ~/ros-electric/ros "http://packages.ros.org/cgi-bin/gen_rosinstall.py?rosdistro=electric&variant=desktop-full&overlay=no"

And got this at the very end of the output:
Installing https://kforge.ros.org/geometry/kdlclone orocos_kinematics_dynamics-0.2.1 to /home/ajc/ros-electric/ros/orocos_kinematics_dynamics

 vcs not setup correctly

I realize I'm installing to ~/ros-electric/ros. I tried installing to ~/ros and the same problem emerges.
I have seen http://answers.ros.org/question/1645/vcs-not-setup-correctly-while-i-install-ros-using, and have attempted the installation about 10 times, always receiving this output.
I can and have installed diamondback with no issues. (I have removed its previous installation at ~/ros (its the only directory I removed, the problem still persists) I also tried removing the ~/.ros directory.
Some information:
git version 1.7.6
rosinstall 0.5.15
Linux whales 2.6.39-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Sat Jul 9 15:31:04 CEST 2011 i686 AMD Athlon(tm) 64 X2 Dual-Core Processor TK-55 AuthenticAMD GNU/Linux

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

A:

I suspect that this was an issue with the repository from which it was checkout out orocos_kinematics_dynamics.  That's what the error means, and I've just tried the command myself now and it works.
