A:

rospy does not support the unreliable (UDP) transport. ( http://answers.ros.org/question/28322/unreliable-udp-transport-hints-in-rospy-and-rosjava/ ).
If you want to use a raw UDP socket in your node to communicate with some other, non-ROS UDP device, you'll need to write raw sockets code (or find a different library to wrap your UDP sockets)

I learned from one of my college courses; our textbook was Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment

There are a bunch of tutorials online as well, but I haven't tried them so I can't recommend a specific tutorial. A google search for linux sockets programming turns up quite a few.
