Q:

Problems spawing a simple object

As I had much problems with gazebo under fuerte I decieded to try out groovy with gazebo 1.3. But it wonÂ´t spawn a simple object.

I tried to convert the empy.world with gzsdf tool but I could not locate the tool..

Hi,
make sure you sourced the setup.bash file:
/<path>/gazebo$ source setup.bash

then run in a terminal:
$ rosrun gazebo gzsdf convert /<path>/your.sdf

or
/<path>/gazebo$ ./gazebo/bin/gzsdf convert /<path>/your.sdf

(you may need sudo rights for converting the empty.world file, or you could just create another one in a different package)
!!!!Update!!!!
to spawn use:
$ gzfactory spawn -f /<path>/model.sdf -m model_name -x 1 -y 1 -z 2 -R 0 -P 0 -Y 0

Cheers,
Andrei

I can find the plugin now but I can't convert the empty world. That does not seem to be the problem.  I think spawn_model does not work anymore?
Comment by AndreiHaidu on 2013-04-01:
and why cant you convert the world file? that should also work, did you try it with sudo?

spawning works now thanks. Weird that I also had to source the gazebo setup,bash, this was not necessary in fuerte.
