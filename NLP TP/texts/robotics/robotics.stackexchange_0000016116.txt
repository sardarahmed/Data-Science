Q:

Data saving/sharing standards for objects, actions and senses

I am working on a language (computer language) for robotics to communicate with each other.
I am looking for naming standards that is unique and usable for robotics, for example when two robots are communicating with this language, they will use a word(standard) for an object like "door" that is understandable for both because they are using one unique naming standard.
As I searched the internet I couldn't find something helpful for naming objects, senses and actions may robots share with each other and they understand what are they meaning for.
Syntax of my language
SEND BY loc ON object = door

This language is a query language like SQL that programmer based on programming conditions writes communication queries to archive some data from destination robot or requesting some actions from it.
In the code above, loc and door are names that should be declared by a standard that both robots can understand them.
I'm asking you if you can suggest any naming standard for saving and sharing names on robots and if there is robotics communication standard to suggest especially scholars. thanks.

A:

"ontology" is the search term you are looking for. There are a few. You will have to review them to see if any meet your needs.
A little background learning about ontologies will help you navigate the options.
You may be tempted to only look at ontologies made by roboticists or with the word robot in the title, but each ontology is created with a set of assumptions or contexts in mind. You may miss a useful ontology if you only look at robotics.
