Q:

Unable to connect two FlexBE states

I am a beginner in FlexBE. I was able to connect the start state to initial_wait state and then initial_wait state to print_greeting state. But I am unable to connect from print_greeting state to finished state. You can see what I am trying to say from the image given below. Could anyone help?

Please attach your screenshot to the question directly. I've given you sufficient karma for that.

Okay. Thanks

A:

I understood how to do it. The unconnected outcomes of each state are listed at the bottom of each state's visualization. First, click on the outcome (in this case click on "done" in Print_Greeting) you want to connect and then click on the target.
