A:

The tutorial rely on the previous version of the android(and obsoleted) sdk
$ wget http://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r13-linux_x86.tgz
$ android update sdk -u -o -t "`android list sdk -o | grep "Android API 9" | awk "{ print \\\\\$1; } " | sed 's/-//g'`,`android list sdk -o | grep "SDK Platform Android 2.3.1, API 9" | awk "{ print \\\\\$1; } " | sed 's/-//g'`"

Also, I have do downgrade rosjava_android repository
hg update ec39ea3fdb22
Then ant still produce error but ant install works. Should we need to upgrade the wiki tutorial?
