Q:

actionlib axclient always disconnected from server

Hi all,
I am trying to run an action using my computer as a client and a robot as a server. I am using the actionlib axclient for that.
In my computer I can see the topic I want to use
rostopic info /navigation_wp/goal
Type: navigation_wp/NavigateActionGoal

Publishers: None

Subscribers: 
 * /navigation_wp (http://<robot_host>:39727/)

However when I use the axclient it always says that I am disconnected from the client and I can not send any goal
rosrun actionlib axclient.py /navigation_wp/goal

See picture attached
C:\fakepath\axclient.png
Also, I have checked that my bashrc is correctly set
export ROS_MASTER_URI="http://192.168.0.42:11311"

which is the IP of the robot
Any clue?
Thanks!

A:

I faced a similar issue on ROS Noetic.
I noticed my server nodes were advertized as http://<HOST_NAME>:<portname>
I didnt look into the cause of the problem but defining a ROS_IP on my server so that the nodes show up as http://<HOST_IP>:<portname>. (I do not remember if I had to set a ROS_IP on the client as well, so maybe you'll need to do that too).
Maybe this will solve your problem too ?
