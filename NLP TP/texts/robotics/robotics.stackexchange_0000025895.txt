Q:

No contact information returned

As can be seen from the picture below there is obviously a collision. However no contact information is returned.
At the beginning of collision a lot of data returned, but after the system gets to equilibrium contact information is not longer available.
Is it a bug or I have to tune some simulation parameters? Is there any workaround for this?
Thanks,
Boris

EDIT: Here are model and world SDFs.
I just noticed that there is a solver of type quick in my world. Can it be the cause?
EDIT #2: Tried Solver type world, but now I am unable to spawn any objects from gui - Gazebo simply dies.

Hi, are you getting the contacts from messages, or you have your own plugin? If it is a sensor, then seeing the sdf file might also help.

I have my own plugin, but $ gztopic echo /gazebo/default/physics/contacts also shows nothing (except for time).
Comment by AndreiHaidu on 2013-02-21:
In your plugin is the sensor active?   ( 'this->parentSensor->SetActive(true);' ) But I suppose yes, if you said you get the data at the beginning.

Yeah, sure, it is active.

Inactive objects get automatically disabled. This will stop collisions from being reported.
Comment by Boris on 2013-03-09:
@nkoenig, so what triggers them back to active? Thanks.

there is a <allow_ auto _disable> tag in within  that you can set to false. You can give this a try
Comment by nkoenig on 2013-03-17:
An active object that collides with an inactive object will make the inactive object active.

A:

A model without links will become inactive when it reaches a resting state.
You can disable this behavior on a per-model basis using the <allow_ auto _disable> tag in within .

should be like this:

<allow_auto_disable>false</allow_auto_disable>
....
