Q:

What happened when I use ros-load to load cram-language

I followed this ros answer page to use roslisp_repl package to load cram-language.
When I load cram-language, it seems have trouble, so it appear backtrace.
When I choose abort the message shows:
  Evaluation aborted on component #:ALEXANDRIA not found, required by #<SYSTEM "cram-utilities" {1003186611}>.

How to do next?
Thank you~

A:

It seems like you didn't do a rosmake cram_language. Alexandria is a 3rd party library that is downloaded by rosmake.
