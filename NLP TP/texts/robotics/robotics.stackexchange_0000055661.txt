A:

Can you paste the output of the console ? Do you get any error or what ?
IPC_Bridge is a bit hard to setup. Btw, now there are other better options that IPC_Bridge, have a look here: http://wiki.ros.org/groovy/Planning/Matlab
I would recommend rosmatlab as it is very easy to setup and works perfect.
