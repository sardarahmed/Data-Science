Q:

Draw Image in rviz 3D visualization frame

Hello,
i look for a simple way to display a static image in the 3D-visualization frame in rviz.
Is it possible to lay a image (a.e. a .png-File) over a plane marker? If yes, how it works?
if no, exist another way to realize it.
Thanks for your answer!

A:

How about making the image a texture on a flat plane created in Blender or similar, export it to dae then load it into rviz as a mesh resource marker?
