Explanation of Quadcopter Dynamics, Components and Control

I am about to build my own quadcopter from scratch. However i am having problem with understanding how it is possible to control the quadcopter without knowing the current rpm of the BLDC motors. According to my understanding the rpm is needed to calculate thrust force etc. in the mathematical model, which will be used for regulation.
The ESCs I have seen have two wires to connect them to the flight controller. The first one is GND and the second is signal wire, which are used for sending PWM signal- no information about the motor speed. There is also the  IMU unit, which provides information about the acceleration of the whole aircraft- but again no information about the motor speed. 
I would be grateful if someone could explain it in details how this is. 

A:

A couple things, the first is that the controller does not really care what the "real" values are. Everything is relative, if the controller sees that it is sinking it will increase the thrust until it is not sinking. If it is tilting too far to the left it will decrease the right thrust and increase the left thrust. (Here is a good resource if you want to design your own controller)
The other thing is that we normally assume that thrust response from the motor, ESC, prop combo is instantaneous so in an ideal world if we told the motor to change from 5% speed to 100% speed in an instant it would happen but in the real world there is some delay this is normally modeled as the difference between a sine wave input at a certain frequency and its output. This is called Phase and Gain margins.
