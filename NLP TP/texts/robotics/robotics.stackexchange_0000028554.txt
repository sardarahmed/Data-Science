Q:

Using Gazebo without ROS?

Hi I have a question.
After going through the documentation of Gazebo I am a little frustrated.
I really like the sim in ROS but for my current project I can not use ROS.
What I want to do is: Visualize a real robot in a 3D visualization together with additional stuff (like a "ghost" robot showing the goal config, little spheres indicating goal position, frames, etc).
So basically I want a lightweight RViz without using ROS.
The documentation links back to ROS all the time so I don't really know if I can use Gazebo.
My questions now are:

Can I simply load urdfs into the simulator (like with pybullet)?
1a. If I can only load SPFs, is there a conversion tool? (Somehow when Gazebo is used in ROS, there are also only URDFs/Urdf-macros used.)
Can I update robot joints continously in a program without ROS (and how?)
Can I disable all collision detection (basically the actual phys. simulation), so I can spawn robots into each other and don't have delayed actuation due to inertia?

Any help would be much appreciated. I think Gazebo should be able to do everything I want, I just don't know how to get there.

A:

Using Gazebo without ROS?

Yes, Gazebo is intended to work as a standalone robot simulator / visualizer.

What I want to do is: Visualize a real
robot in a 3D visualization together
with additional stuff (like a "ghost"
robot showing the goal config, little
spheres indicating goal position,
frames, etc). So basically I want a
lightweight RViz without using ROS.

This may be possible via Gazebo Plugins in some of the later version of Gazebo.

The documentation links back to ROS
all the time so I don't really know if
I can use Gazebo.

Have you looked through the Gazebo Tutorials? Many of them cover using Gazebo without ROS.

Can I simply load urdfs into the
simulator (like with pybullet)?

Yes.

1a) If I can only load SDFs, is there
a conversion tool? (Somehow when
Gazebo is used in ROS, there are also
only URDFs/Urdf-macros used.)

You can load URDFs directly into Gazebo without ROS, but you can also convert a URDF files into a SDF file, using
gz sdf -p my_urdf.urdf > my_sdf.sdf

Can I update robot joints continously
in a program without ROS (and how?)

Yes, you can do this via a custom Gazebo Plugin.

and: http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=set_velocity&cat=
and: https://answers.ros.org/question/233059/gazebo-set-joint-angles-by-ros/

Can I disable all collision
detection (basically the actual phys.
simulation), so I can spawn robots
into each other and don't have delayed
actuation due to inertia?

Yes.
