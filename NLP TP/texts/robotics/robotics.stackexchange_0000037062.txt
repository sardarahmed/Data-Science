Q:

Problem installing openni_kinect

I started using ROS last week and tried installing openni_kinect. I followed the steps here:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_kinect
Everything seems to work properly until I get to step 4 when I start to compile. I get an error:
[ 20%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/depth_image_proc.dir/src/nodelets/register.o
/home/drcool/openni_kinect/openni_kinect/depth_image_proc/src/nodelets/register.cpp: In member function ‘void depth_image_proc::RegisterNodelet::imageCb(const ImageConstPtr&, const CameraInfoConstPtr&, const CameraInfoConstPtr&)’:

make[1]: *** [all] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/drcool/openni_kinect/openni_kinect/depth_image_proc/build'
The bolded section states the specific error. Before I began installing this I installed the nao stacks for ROS located here:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/nao/Installation
My current system is Ubuntu 11.10 oneiric, and I did a full desktop install of ROS electric. Any help with this problem would be appreciated.

A:

If you're using ROS on Ubuntu, you shouldn't have to install the drivers from source; just do:
sudo apt-get install ros-electric-openni-kinect
