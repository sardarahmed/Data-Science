Hi
I used <export><python path="..."/></export> in manifest.xml with rosbuild, is there way to set similar thing in catkin?

A:

You should do this with an environment hook, see:
http://docs.ros.org/hydro/api/catkin/html/user_guide/environment.html
http://docs.ros.org/hydro/api/catkin/html/dev_guide/generated_cmake_api.html#catkin_add_env_hooks
https://github.com/ros/ros/blob/indigo-devel/core/roslib/env-hooks/10.ros.sh.em
https://github.com/ros/roslisp/blob/master/env-hooks/99.roslisp.sh
However, you should reevaluate why you need to do this. Instead you should install your python code into a place where it can be on the path automatically.
