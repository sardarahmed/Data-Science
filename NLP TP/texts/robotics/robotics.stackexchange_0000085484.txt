Q:

point grey camera withe jackal

Hi,
I am using the jackal for my university project.
I have attached a camera to collect images and am using the cv bridge library to get snapshots.
On the desktop and simulation environment, I use the same camera and cv::bridge. I am able to see the images that are being captured because cv::window works.
I use ssh to log into the jackal and run my program.
Is there a way to make sure that the images are being taken and they are what I think they are?
For example, is there a way that I can enable the gui of the cv brigdge on the jackal and use CV window to see the images being taken and processed?
Please advise. Need help.
Regards,
rsmitha.

A:

If you publish the images on the Jackal, you should be able to subscribe to them on your PC, and use something like image_view to display them.
Afaik the Jackal does not have any graphics hw.
