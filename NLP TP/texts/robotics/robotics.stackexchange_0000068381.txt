Q:

ImportError: No module named rospkg

Hey,
I'm trying to compile a rospackage, but I throws the following error:

ImportError: No module named rospkg

I checked if it is installed:

sudo apt-get install python-rospkg    ->   python-rospkg is already the newest version.

dpkg -L python-rospkg    ->   /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages

And if that is in my python path:

echo $PYTHONPATH
->  /home/ruud/Dropbox/ros/catkin_workspace/devel/lib/python2.7/dist-packages:/opt/ros/indigo/lib/python2.7/dist-packages:/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7:/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages:/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rospkg:/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages

The problem looks very similar to http://answers.ros.org/question/44669/fuerte-no-module-named-rospkg/
As far as I see 'rospkg' is not inside /usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7
Help! :)

A:

I solved the issue by:
$ git clone git://github.com/ros/rospkg.git
$ sudo python setup.py install --user 

Apparently rospkg was not installed properly? Still not sure what is the cause though..

Hm. If at all possible, I'd avoid using distutils / setuptools to install rospkg. I've seen way too many installs (of ROS) freak out after some time. It's probably better (but more involved) to figure out why the debian pkg doesn't seem to be working for you.

Yes I prefer to find the cause here. Currently it is fixed, but I did not learn a lot from it..  :)
