Q:

Why is Groovy's rosmake so slow?

Hello,
After upgrading from Fuerte to Groovy (debian packages under Ubuntu 12.04) I have found rosmake runs much slower than it used to.  For example, for one of my typical stacks including 7 packages and mostly Python code, rosmake takes 7.9 seconds under Fuerte and 149 seconds (2 min 29 sec) under Groovy. That's 18x slower(!).  Is this expected?
Thanks,
patrick

A:

I guess groovy's rosmake is so slow because rospack is so slow now. This is also the topic of this Q/A. Would of course be very interesting if any improvements are planned as this affects a lot of people.

Thanks @Stefan Kohlbrecher.  I didn't see a ticket on this problem so I logged one here: https://github.com/ros/rosdep/issues/218

A recent patch has greatly improved rosmake performance for my test package under Groovy--from 149 seconds to 22 seconds.  Thanks @tfoote and the author of the patch!
