Q:

How to install and run openni_tracker for Hydro

Thank you in advance for your help and patience.  I am new to ROS  and could use some help with openni_tracker and the Microsoft Kinect.  I'm am using Ubuntu 12.04 and ROS Hydro
I have installed openni_camera and openni_launch according to openni_camera:
$ sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-openni-camera
$ sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-openni-launch
$ rosdep update

I have no problems running openni_launch and viewing the point cloud data, color image, or disparity view using Rviz and image_view.
I have installed openni_tracker:
$ sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-openni-tracker
$ rosdep update
$ roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch
$ rosrun openni_tracker openni_tracker

and get an error
[ERROR] [1416949546.535139208]: Find user generator failed: This operation is invalid!

I've uninstalled ROS (both Groovy and Hydro) with
$ sudo apt-get remove ros-<distro>

and still the problem comes up.  I've read in a few threads that I should install NITE dev or something to help.  But have also noticed that it hasn't helped some people.
Again, I am new to this, so some step-by-step help would be much appreciated.  Thanks in advance.
UPDATE:
I've also installed openni2_tracker...located in ~/catkin_ws/src/.  When I go back to my catkin_ws and use catkin_make, I get the following errors:
-- ==> add_subdirectory(openni2_tracker)
CMake Error at /opt/ros/hydro/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:75 (find_package):

I am not sure what this means or how to fix the problem...thanks for your help.

A:

I have found the solution to my issue on this page and this page.
And was able to successfully view the tf for all my 'joints' via Rviz using this page.
Thanks.
