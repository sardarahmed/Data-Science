Q:

geometry_msgs/Vector2?

Is there an extension of geometry_msgs including 2D types, such as geometry_msgs/Vector2?
I don't seem to find such a package on Github, for example.

A:

If you're looking to store 2D positions or poses, perhaps the Point or Pose2D types in geometry_msgs could work?
For Point, just ignore the z member. If you don't care about orientation, ignore theta in Pose2D.

Right; my concern was mostly about keeping the message type semantically consistent with the content; but of course we can reuse Point for 2D.

Well, I guess it's a bit of a point for discussion, but using Pose2D for this seems like a good fit: it encodes a position in a 2D space, with an associated orientation.
You could consider submitting a PR that adds a Vector2 (or maybe Point2D) to geometry_msgs though.
