A:

No Ubuntu Oneric packages are currently in the repository.
I would not expect to see them there until after Oneric is officially released by Ubuntu.
The answer above refers to the Ubuntu binaries. You can probably check out ROS sources and compile them on Oneric. There may be some problems with system dependencies or perhaps a new compiler version. If so, please report them. The ROS package maintainers will want to fix them.
