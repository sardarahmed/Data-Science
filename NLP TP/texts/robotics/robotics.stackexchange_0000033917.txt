Q:

How to install lse_communication stacks?

I found lse_communication is a useful serial port stacks.
Before, I use svn co to download and use it correctly.
But When I want to use the following command:
  sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-lse_communication

it says could not find that package.
How to use apt-get to install it?
Thank you~

A:

LSE communication is currently not available as a Debian binary release.
You will have to install it manually via version control.
You can do this one of two ways, a rosinstall file, like this:
 - svn:
     uri: http://isr-uc-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/unstable/lse_sensor_network/
     local-name: lse-sensor-network

And then simply do a rosinstall
rosinstall <TARGET DIRECTORY> <ROS DIRECTORY> <ROSINSTALL FILE>
rosinstall ~/devel/ros /opt/ros/electric ~/Downloads/automow.rosinstall

And then source the generated file, for bash, this would be:
source ~/devel/ros/setup.bash

You can also add this to your ~/.bashrc file.
Your other option is to actually check it out in your ROS directory:
cd /opt/ros/electric/stacks/
svn co http://isr-uc-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/unstable isr-uc-ros-pkg
rosmake -i lse_communication

You may have to perform some of these actions with sudo, and the -i flag to rosmake will mark the packages as built, so you won't have to rebuild them again (making it easier to work with user priviledges).

No, you can always update by navigating to the directory that you installed it to and running "rosinstall ."

If I use the first way to install,when that stack updated,whether the system will update it for me or not?
