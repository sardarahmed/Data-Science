Q:

Cannot Subscribe or Publish with latest release & Arduino Diecimila

I have installed and compiled the latest version of the rosserial stack. I have been attempting to run the samples (Hello World, etc.), after I wasn't able to get my own code to work. It turns out, none of the sample work properly.
For example, the hello world sample, when I start the python client there are no errors, but the topic from the arduino is never published.
i.e. run:
roscore
rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyUSB0
rostopic list
The topic is not there.
I have verified that the arduino is running properly, and on the correct port (and no port errors are given). The only output is:
[INFO] [WallTime: 1331948389.955027] ROS Serial Python Node
[INFO] [WallTime: 1331948389.956859] Connected on /dev/ttyUSB0 at 57600 baud
Device is Diecimila, running on ros-electric/Ubuntu 11.04 Natty
No errors in making the packages, etc.

Do you see the message "Lost sync with device, restarting..."?

A:

Maybe you could try with another Arduino if you have one nearby. I completed these tutorials a few weeks ago using indigo-ubuntu 12.04 lts with a duemilanove just for configuration informations and to confirm that it is supposed to work.
Best regards,
Pascal
