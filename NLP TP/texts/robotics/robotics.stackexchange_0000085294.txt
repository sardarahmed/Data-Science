Q:

Don't block on rospy.init_node

Hello,
Simple question : is there a way for not blocking on init_node call ?
Doing it (Python) ;
      init_node("MyNode", disable_signals=True)

if roscore is not launched I get, which is normal, this :
      Unable to register with master node [http://localhost:11311/]: master may not be running yet. Will keep trying.

However it's not raising ROSException so it just blocks on it. Can we prevent it ?
Thank you for your help

@r00t8: don't post answers unless you are answering your own question.

A:

Related question (almost a duplicate): #q10499.
Relevant part of the answer there (from ros_comm/tools/rostopic/src/rostopic):
def _check_master():
    try:
        rosgraph.Master('/rostopic').getPid()
    except socket.error:
        raise ROSTopicIOException("Unable to communicate with master!")

_check_master() is not part of the public API of rostopic, but you should be able to use it.

Note that this is not an actual answer (ie: it doesn't make rospy.init_node(..) non-blocking), but your question title and question body don't actually correspond with each other.
This would seem to be an xy problem.
