Q:

"laser_geometry.h" cannot be used

Why I got an error when I use #include "laser_geometry/laser_geometry.h" or with (<>). Is this one deprecated in Electric. Or any path that I can use in Electric..

A:

You have to add the laser_geometry package as a dependency to the manifest.xml of your own package:
  <depend package="laser_geometry"/>

The #include as stated by you should then work (provided laser_geometry can be found in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH).

@dornhege: I also assume that way..just to cross check with you all..thanks anyway..

It's probably already a dependency of another package you use.

Thanks a lot..I just wonder for some packages i even don't need to add it in manifest file like geometry_msgs package that i use, it just works..
