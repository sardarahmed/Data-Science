Q:

ros2: Clock sleep_until

Hi,
Is there an implementation available for sleep_until or sleep_for with Clock interfaces on ros2?
The document here says it does, http://design.ros2.org/articles/clock_and_time.html but could'nt find.
Please help.

A:

sleep_until and sleep_for haven't been implemented yet. https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/465 is the issue tracking it.
