Q:

Can't find moveit_benchmark_statistics.py

Hello,
I want to create a pdf of my benchmark.log-file by using following command:
faps@faps-Aspire-5740D:~/Desktop$ rosrun moveit_ros_benchmarks moveit_benchmark_statistics.py config1.cfg.1.log -p bechmark_results.pdf

But:
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named moveit_benchmark_statistics.py below /opt/ros/groovy/share/moveit_ros_benchmarks

I've installed the newest version of moveit.
How can I make it work?
Thx in advance

A:

It looks as if this script is not included in the ros-groovy-moveit-ros-benchmarks debian package.  I'm not sure if this was deliberate, or is just an oversight.  You should contact the package maintainers (see the package.xml) for more clarification.
If you look at the package's CMakeLists.txt, you can see that the other package executables are added to the install() script, but not moveit_benchmark_statistics.py.
You could always try to grab that python script directly from the source repository and run it independently from the package itself.  Depending on how the script is set up, that may work.
