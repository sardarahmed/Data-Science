Q:

ROS Gazebo filesystem details?

Hello, I am new to ROS and want to spawn models in urdf format from ROS in Gazebo. I have come across numerous tutorials but none of them is clear as to where I am supposed to save my urdf file, as well as the mesh files that the urdf uses...Please help

A:

The common practice is to have a /urdf and a /mesh directory in your package's root directory. However, you are free to save your urdf and mesh files where ever you want, just make sure you point to the correct location in your launch files.

In the launch file, when I write the location of the file as "home/user/"... it doesn't work...I have checked the location of the files, they are correct

It would help if you add the relevant line of your launch file and the error you are getting to your question.

thank you, but I figured it out :) I made a catkin package and placed all the files there according to this tutorial
