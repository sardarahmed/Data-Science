Hi,
There is no tutorial for the same. But if you want to do the detection of the tabletop_objects you may look at the tutorials at http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/ and read through the below topics
a. Euclidean cluster extraction.
b. Cluster recognition and 6D pose estimation.
I used them straight forwardly for my work of detecting the tabletop_objects.
Hope this helps!
Thanks,
Karthik
