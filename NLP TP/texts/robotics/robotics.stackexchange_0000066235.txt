Q:

Can I define a xacro with params by another xacro?

Hi I am trying to define a xacro macro with another macro.
But I am getting an error about one of the internal params from the macro.
Is there an escape sequence or something for that?
Currently I get the error:

raise XacroException("Property wasn't defined: %s" % str(ex))
xacro.XacroException: Property wasn't defined: u'name'

<xacro:macro name="rr_mat_gaz_color_def" params="color material">
    <xacro:macro name="rr_mat_gaz_${color}" params="name material">
       <gazebo reference="${name}_link">
        <material value="${material}" />
       </gazebo>
    </xacro:macro>
</xacro:macro>

Thanks!

A:

Fairly certain you have to define the macros sequentially and not recursively.
