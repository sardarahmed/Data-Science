Q:

catkin_create_pkg failure

Hi All,
catkin_create_package fails with the following error when I try to create a package on my new laptop:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/usr/bin/catkin_create_pkg", line 75, in 
main()
File "/usr/bin/catkin_create_pkg", line 63, in main
boost_comps=args.boost_comps)
File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/catkin_pkg/package_templates.py", line 142, in _create_package_template
urls=[])
File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/catkin_pkg/package_templates.py", line 55, in init
self.validate()
File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/catkin_pkg/package.py", line 244, in validate
raise InvalidPackage('\n'.join(errors))
catkin_pkg.package.InvalidPackage: Invalid email "CRA@rhutchins@todo.todo" for person "CRA@rhutchins"
Does anyone know how to fix this?
Thanks!
Ryan

A:

As the error message states (Invalid email) the value CRA@rhutchins@todo.todo is not a valid email address (it contains two at signs).

Thanks Dirk.
Your diagnosis was correct. The fix is to specify:
catkin_create_package -m rhutchins <package_name> 
So, simply typing my user name without the domain preceding it fixed my problem.
