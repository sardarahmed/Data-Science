Q:

Error during turtlebot launch in ROS

When I run 
roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch
I am getting this error:-
> from defusedxml.xmlrpc import monkey_patch ImportError: No module
> named defusedxml.xmlrpc while processing
> /opt/ros/kinetic/share/turtlebot_gazebo/launch/includes/kobuki.launch.xml:

pip install defusedxml
