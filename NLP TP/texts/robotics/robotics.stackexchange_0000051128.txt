Q:

Writing subscriber for turtlebot (C++)

Can anyone help me (maybe already have) writing a simple program to subscribe to TutleBotSensorState and use  a callback function to display some of the data, for example temperature.

Of course I have read this part of the tutorial and I know how to write subscribers for turtlesim. I am interested in knowing how to write the callback method for turtlebot.

You need to change the include line to point to the message header, and then change the datatype of the callback function. And you should make sure to have the dependency on the package as well.

header and dependencies are set appropriately, but when I try my callback I get errors. Could you give a specific sample callback function for turtlebot.
