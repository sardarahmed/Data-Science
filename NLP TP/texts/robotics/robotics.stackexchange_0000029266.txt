Q:

For using plugin, how to find a list and example code

I had a problem to load models and then collide themselves since miss loading of physics plugin.
https://answers.gazebosim.org/question/27844/imported-models-couldnt-collide-each-other/
I have searched this URL ; https://ignitionrobotics.org/libs/plugin, but it is still hard to understand its structure.
In my searching skill, It was hard to find plugin list and examples for me. It would be appreciated if you give me some hints.
