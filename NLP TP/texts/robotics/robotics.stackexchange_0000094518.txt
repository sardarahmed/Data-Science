Q:

MoveIt detect collision for disabled links in SRDF

Hello,
I’m new to this community so if I’ve made some mistakes please let me know. My problem description is as follows:
I created a new arm+sensor+gripper URDF and used the MoveIt Setup Assistant to generate a MoveIt config package. When I use MoveGroup to move the arm I get this error:
Found a contact between 'gripper_finger1_inner_knuckle_link' (type 'Robot link') and 'gripper_finger1_finger_tip_link' (type 'Robot link'), which constitutes a collision. Contact information is not stored.

In my SRDF these 2 links are disabled:
<disable_collisions link1="gripper_finger1_finger_tip_link" link2="gripper_finger1_inner_knuckle_link" reason="Adjacent" />

I’ve also tried updating the allowed collision matrix by updating the planning scene diff and then call apply_planning_scene service.
At this point I’m not sure what else to try. I hope you guys can help me. Thank you.
EDIT: I'm using Ubuntu 18.04 and ROS Melodic. MoveIt is installed from deb

A:

I figured out what I did wrong: I updated the allowed collision matrix in the planning scene and I think this overrides the disabled collisions in the SRDF. Commenting out that part of my code resolves this issue.
