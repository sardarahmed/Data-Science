Q:

RVIZ Access pose variable of custom msg

Hello,
I have created a custom msg that has a int and a posestamped. Considering that my msg is called customMsg I can do a rostopic echo for customMsg or per example customMsg/Pose and see only the pose variable. How can I achieve the same on rviz? When I do customMsg/Pose on rviz it try to find that exactly topic.
Thank you

A:

rviz cannot subscribe to custom message types, unless you write a custom rviz plugin for your message type. Sorry.
rostopic is the only tool that can display only one field from a message; most other tools is ROS do not have that ability.
