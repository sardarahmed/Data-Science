Q:

How do I tell colcon to tell cmake to tell make --jobs?

Here's something that saturates all 12 of my available cores:
colcon build --parallel-workers=3

How do I tell colcon build to use at most three cores at any given time?

A:

Colcon doesn't do that. Or, rather, it does, but only in ways that sacrifice one of the two "independent dimensions of parallelization".
Here's the first way:
MAKEFLAGS=-j1 colcon build --parallel-workers=3

Here's the second way:
MAKEFLAGS=-j3 colcon build --executor sequential
