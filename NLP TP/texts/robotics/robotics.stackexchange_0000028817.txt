Q:

Does Gazebo simulate air resistance?

Does gazebo realistically simulate the air resistance? I see you can set an atmospheric pressure in the simulation but I don't know how to validate the correctness of the aerodynamics. I need the simulation to generate a realistic forces acting on the link given the geometry and velocity of the link. Does gazebo do that or do I need to make a plugin for this?

A:

Hi.
I created based on the hectorplugins a simple plugin that generated drag to a model, in whatever direction. It's a basic approach but at least it should get you going in the right direction.

Here you have the whole code for the solution:
Video explaining the solution and demo
ROSJect Plug and play project with solution
Git with all the solution
I'll post here the file for the plugin creation:
C:\fakepath\fluid_resitance.cpp
And a snippet on how to use it in a Model URDF:
<!-- Add plugin Air Resistance -->
<gazebo>
    <plugin name="fluid_resitance_plugin" filename="libfluid_resitance_plugin.so">
        <fluid_resitanceTopicName>/fluid_resitance</fluid_resitanceTopicName>
        <NameLinkToApplyResitance>simple_sphere_base_link</NameLinkToApplyResitance>
        <rate>2.0</rate>
    </plugin>
</gazebo>

Hope it helps ;).
