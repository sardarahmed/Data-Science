Q:

How to measure displacement, cheaply and without using an accelerometer?

Motion is known to be confined in a sphere with radius of about 0.5m, and resolution doesn't have to be very high (5cm is enough). The device will actually be incorporated in a toy designed for kids.
I tried implementing that with an accelerometer but the estimated displacement drifted away 100s of meters per minute.
Is there some other solution, maybe involving electrical or magnetic fields? It's important that the sensor costs no more than a few bucks.
Edit: The device should not be attached to anything mechanical and its movement is in 3d (a kid moves the toy freely).

A:

Ultrasonic transducers are the best bet, in my opinion. However, they might cost you a little over "a few bucks".
You have two options:

Set two/three ultrasonic Rx/Tx pair along one plane. Trigger them sequentially, in quick succession and triangulate your object in 3D. 

A drawback of this approach is that the sensor noise would be phenomenal.
The other option would be:

Set three ultrasonic transmitters, one along each plane (X,Y and Z),
near the boundary of the active region in which the object will be
moving.
Place the ultrasonic receivers inside the object, one facing each
direction.
Precompute a lookup table that tracks the ultrasonic flight time
along each direction separately.
During operations, trigger the three sensors in quick succession,
getting X, Y and Z values consecutively.

This method should be less noisy.
You'll need and omnidirectional ultrasonic transmitter, like this: http://www.metrolog.net/transdutores/piezofilm/ultra40k.php?lang=en
[I'm not sure how much three of them would cost, but there must be some cheaper variant available somewhere].
