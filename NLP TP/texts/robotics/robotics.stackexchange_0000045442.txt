Q:

household_objects_database remote access issue

I am trying to access household_objects_database remotely following the tutorial here
I launched the remote connection script
roslaunch household_objects_database objects_database_remote_client.launch

However when I try to run the following command
rosservice call /objects_database_node/get_model_list REDUCED_MODEL_SET

I get the error: Unable to communicate with service [/objects_database_node/get_model_list], address [rosrpc://grasp.willowgarage.com:15432]
It says in the tutorial that server might be down. However website (grasp.willowgarage.com) seems to be up.
I try to ping to port 15432 and here is the result
nmap -p 15432 grasp.willowgarage.com

Starting Nmap 5.21 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2012-11-02 13:02 EET
Nmap scan report for grasp.willowgarage.com (70.35.54.194)
Host is up (0.22s latency).
rDNS record for 70.35.54.194: gw.willowgarage.com
PORT      STATE    SERVICE
15432/tcp filtered unknown

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 5.41 seconds

So, what am I doing wrong? Is this

A:

Unfortunately, Willow Garage seems to block their database from external access for quite some time now and I think nobody ever updated the tutorial.
If you do not have a PR2 that has the database already installed, you have to set up your own database server. This tutorial shows you how. I guess you've seen it already.

Thanks for the answer. I've seen the tutorial, yes, but I didn't want to deal with the configuration details. Thanks again for clearing that up.
