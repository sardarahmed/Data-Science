Q:

Kobuki error , Kobuki/Watchdog no signal in rqt. Kindly help me out?

I am working with turtlebot 2 , I have searched everywhere about this problem. After launching oslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch the terminal works fine but turtlebot does not move or show any kind of movement. When I ran ''rosrun rqt_robot_monitor rqt_robot_monitor'' it is giving me these two errors , kobuki error and kobuki/watchdog no signal. Kindly help me out as I am a totally new to this thing.

A:

It sounds like you're launching the telop applications but do not have the drivers for the kobuki started. For the teleop_keyboard launch files to be useful you need to also be running roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch in another terminal simultaneously.
