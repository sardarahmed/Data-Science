Q:

point transform from rotation and translation in python

hi all. the python tf api has a function for transforming stamped points but i can't find anything to transform a point with just a rotation and translation...
there is a function for returning a matrix from the translation and rotation... is this the only way of transforming such a point?
cheers, Garrick.

A:

The reason is that you need stamp (time and initial frame) information to transform a point into a different frame, otherwise it has no context. If you want to apply the transform directly, just apply the same operations as the transformPoint function, using the 4x4 matrix.
