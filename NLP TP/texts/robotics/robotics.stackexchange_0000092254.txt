Q:

Interface between ROS and UR Polyscope

Is it possible to interface between UR's Polyscope and ROS.
For example, can you command a wait function in Polyscope and let ROS take over control of the robot in the meanwhile?

A:

I'm going to answer this in the context of ur_modern_driver and universal_robot, as those are the packages typically used -- right now -- with UR robots.

This is not something that is supported by ur_modern_driver.
It does only upload a small urscript program when trajectories are actually being executed (this one), and that program does quit when the trajectory is finished (or at least: if you're not using ros_control), but uploading any program to the controller will automatically shut down whatever was already running.
You could potentially achieve what you are asking by integrating the urscript program ur_modern_driver uploads when executing trajectories into a larger urscript program but only allow actual robot control when you'd like to, but that is not something that ur_modern_driver supports out-of-the-box (so would require custom development).

The work currently being done by FZI & UR on a new driver does support the scenario you describe, but that driver hasn't been released yet.
