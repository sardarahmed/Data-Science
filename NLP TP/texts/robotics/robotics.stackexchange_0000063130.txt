Q:

Package running in 64 bit, not running in 32 bit

Hello all;
I have a package that uses PCL libraries  and that works perfectly in Groovy and Hydro, both in 64 bit machines.
In 32 bit machines, I can compile the package exactly the same way, without problems, but in execution it does not work.
The callbacks in it go indredibly slow, sometimes taking more than a minute, when in 64 bit they work perfectly fine.
Any possible causes for this package being stuck in 32 bit?
I am runnning Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit with Hydro and Groovy, and Ubuntu 12.04 32 bit with Hydro.
Thank you all in advance,

Can you please post the error that you get during execution?
Comment by altella on 2014-10-07:
It really gives no error... simply the callbacks are not executing at the rate specified
Comment by Tirjen on 2014-10-07:
So are the callbacks executing at a lower rate or they are not executing at all? Are the two machines equivalent in terms of CPU, RAM etc?

It's quite possible that the additional instructions and optimizations available in 64-bit mode make a big performance difference.
Comment by altella on 2014-10-07:
I think they are executing, but a callback intended to run at 10 HZ, needs 80 seconds to enter for the first time
Comment by altella on 2014-10-07:
The PC's are the same in terms of CPU and RAM, but it seems that the computation required for cluster extraction in PCL makes a HUGE difference btw 32 bit and 64 bit versions of the same OS.

A:

Solved, it is a mere computation problem, of quantity of RAM and processing power of 32 bit vs 64 bit.
After downsampling the cloud, it goes just fine.
