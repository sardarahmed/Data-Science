Q:

Cannot find rosserial_python serial_node.py

I installed rosserial_python using the following commands:
$ sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-rosserial-arduino
$ sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-rosserial
Sourced the setup.bash file.  And I get the following error:
rosrun rosserial_python serial_node
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named serial_node below /opt/ros/melodic/share/rosserial_python
The serial_node.py is not in the share directory.  Why is ROS looking in that directory?  I found it under /opt/ros/melodic/lib/rosserial_python
Does the lib directory need to get added to ROS_PACKAGE_PATH?
Thank you.

A:

So I found the solution:
So I originally had installed rosserial_python from source in my catkin_ws.  I then removed that code from the src directory and rebuilt it with catkin_make ,but I still had the code in the devel, build, and install directories.  After removing the lib, share, and install directories from those directories and rebuilding then I no longer get this error.
Looks like the catkin workspace overlay was getting in the way of the code in /opt/ros/melodic.
