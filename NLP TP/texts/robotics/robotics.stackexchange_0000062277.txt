Q:

Detect contact normals in gazebo

Hey,
I am using two versions of gazebo on two different PCs one with Hydro and gazebo 1.9 and the other PC is with Indigo and Gazebo 2.2. In both I uploaded the same empty_world.world. In addition I uploaded a block model, the same model that has contact with ground plane(lies on the ground plane)in both versions of gazebo. In gazebo 1.9 I can see in the topic ~/physics/contact the 1 contact that I should see (in steady state). However in gazebo 2.2 I see this contact in the beginning  (transition state, for a second) and then 0 contacts in steady state.
What could be the problem? Where is the problem? If its a bug, in what version of gazebo?
Thanks in advance,

A:

I found an answer. there is a parameter in gazebo: <allow_auto_disable> 0 </allow_auto_disable> the default value is 1 and it should be zero for my purposes
