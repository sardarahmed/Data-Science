Q:

Roslaunch arguments problems

Hello,
I'm trying to make a simple roslaunch file. The problems are the arguments. My node needs 3 arguments, I don't understand how i should write the launch file.
this command works fine: rosrun teste_aruco ros_aruco2 live ~/catkin_ws/src/ros_aruco/data/logitech_9000_intnsics.yml 0.127
How do I turn this into a roslaunch? I'm trying something like this:
<launch>
    <node name="teste_aruco" pkg="teste_aruco" type="ros_aruco2" args="live ~/catkin_ws/src/ros_aruco/data/logitech_9000_intrinsics.yml 0.127" />
</launch>

And this does not work...Anyone knows how to do this currectly?

A:

I'm not sure about that but I think you can't use the "~" to define your home directory in a launch file. You could try something like:
<launch>
    <node name="teste_aruco" pkg="teste_aruco" type="ros_aruco2" args="live $(find ros_aruco)/data/logitech_9000_intrinsics.yml 0.127" />
</launch>

or use the full path to the .yml file.
