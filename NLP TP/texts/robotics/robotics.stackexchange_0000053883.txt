Q:

How to programmatically add display to running Rviz instance?

I'm writing a package that is meant to be run after a 3rd-party package starts Rviz. My package simply provides a new display type, and some topics for that display type to subscribe to.
Currently, I have to launch the 3rd-party package, then launch my package, then manually add and configure the display type to Rviz. It would be nice if in the launch file for my package I could automatically add and configure the display.
Is this at all possible? I don't think Rviz exposes any services for this, or allows you to 'force' it to reload a custom config file, so I don't know how this would be possible.

I thought about that, but it was too ugly to seriously consider :)
I guess I'll just resort to hacking the other package's config file, and maintaining a vendor branch. It would be nice if there were a Better Way in the future...

A:

The only (hacky) way I see would be to add a 'rosnode kill' on the rviz instance launched by the 3rd party package and an rviz instance with a different config to your own launchfile.
