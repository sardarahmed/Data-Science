Q:

is it easy to write own drivers?

Suppose i have here a new Bluetooth PS joystick. Would it be easy to write a driver for it to work with ros? would it be a lot harder than writing a sensor for Ubuntu Linux?
Thanks in advance, i'm very novice in this matters.
greetings ros community

ROS already has PS3 joystick drivers, see:

And probably several packages converting buttons into robot commands you could use as a template. Like my teleop_ps3 package.
