Q:

Remapping a topic inside a controller?

I have a ros-controls controller publishing a topic, and I'd like to remap that topic with a roslaunch <remap> tag. I tried applying the remap to both the controller spawner and the hardware interface node, and neither seemed to take.
Is there some other method required?
