Q:

How to install ROS fuerte on ubuntu 11.10 64 bits?

When I apt-get it shows:

Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.

A:

You are trying to install Precise packages (Ubuntu 12.04) instead of Oneiric packages. Fix /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list (rename precise by oneiric) and don't forget to sudo apt-get update before you try to install again.
