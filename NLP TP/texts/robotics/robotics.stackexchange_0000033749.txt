Q:

How do I get the pr2_gazebo_doors_demo to work?

Hi all,
I tried to run the demo exactly as descibed in the wiki.
I get the following error:
roslaunch file contains multiple nodes named [/r_arm_controller/joint_trajectory_generator].
Please check all  'name' attributes to make sure they are unique.
Also check that $(anon id) use different ids.
What can I do to get it working?
I have ubuntu 10.4 and diamondback pr2all installed.

A:

I updated the door wiki for diamondback.
But there appears to be a problem with redundant nodes as Andy suggested.  The fix have been pushed into trunk, pending next release.

Ok, i got it working by removing two node definitions. 1) pr2_doors_actions/launch/door_actions.xml: remove/comment lines 56 to 64. 2) pr2_doors_executive/doors.launch: remove/comment lines 15 to 20.

the name conflict seems to come from

I removed the "experimental" SVN checkouts (which were required for cturtle) and went through all steps in the wiki, but the problem persists...
