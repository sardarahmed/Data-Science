Q:

What R_FLOAT32 stand for in PixelFormat enum?

I'm especially wondering about the R_.
public: enum PixelFormat
{
    UNKNOWN_PIXEL_FORMAT = 0,
    L_INT8,
    L_INT16,
    RGB_INT8,
    RGBA_INT8,
    BGRA_INT8,
    RGB_INT16,
    RGB_INT32,
    BGR_INT8,
    BGR_INT16,
    BGR_INT32,
    R_FLOAT16,
    RGB_FLOAT16,
    R_FLOAT32, // <- This one
    RGB_FLOAT32,
    BAYER_RGGB8,
    BAYER_RGGR8,
    BAYER_GBRG8,
    BAYER_GRBG8,
    PIXEL_FORMAT_COUNT
};
