Q:

fuerte on lucid: pr2_simulator deb package is gone?

Hi,
a recent update of fuerte on lucid seems to remove the pr2_simulator stack, which unfortunately also means that the pr2_gazebo_plugins package is gone. Even if I dont have a pr2, I was using the gazebo_ros_contoller_manager plugin in my simulation. Now it has been removed, which leaves me somehow lost. Does anybody know whether this was by some intention or is it just a bug?
Best
Georg

A:

Today, the package magically reappeared, so I could install it again!
