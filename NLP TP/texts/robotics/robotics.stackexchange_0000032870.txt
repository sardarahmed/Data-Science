Q:

rivz/ogre crash after update

Hello, I'm running Ubuntu 10.04 LTS with the diamondback ROS release.  I just upgraded my installation and now I can't seem to run rviz any more.  I was running it fine like 30 minutes ago before I decided to update my system.  I attached the error.  I tried searching on answers but I didn't see anything immediately relevant.
andrewha@andrewha-G73s:~$ rosrun rviz rviz

I'm having the same issue. Are you using the deb packages, or building independantly?

A:

So, it looks like something went wrong in how the debian packages were built for visualization_common in the latest diamondback release. I filed a ticket on this here, https://code.ros.org/trac/ros-pkg/ticket/5059, and the stack maintainer is looking into things. Until this is resolved, the solution seems to be to build visualization_common from source. Hope this helps.

it has been resolved.  the nvidia cg packages failed silently during the build.  we have rebuilt and reployed.
