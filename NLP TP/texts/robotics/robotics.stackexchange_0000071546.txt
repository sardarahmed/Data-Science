Q:

robot rotation in place speed lower then minimum

hello everyone
i am having a difficulty with my robot.
it navigates to a goal pretty well.
the thing is when it needs to rotate at the end to the orientation of the goal it doesnt seem to move.
when i look at the cmd_vel the robot receives a value of 0.457.. but the minimum value required for my robot to rotate is 0.55 this is also the value set in the base_local_planner_params so i dont get how can a value lower than the minimum is sent to the robot
please help me figure this one out
here is my base_local_planner_params file:
controller_frequency: 7.0
recovery_behavior_enabled: false
clearing_rotation_allowed: false

A:

i was able to find in the base_local_planner package in the trajectory planner cpp file a minimum value that was set too low 0.4 and i changed it to 0.6 and than things worked out :)

Are you saying your solution was to change the source code? That seems like a hokey fix, the parameter should be loaded via the yaml file. I am seeing the same general behavior. Move base commands my robot to turn at 0.4 rad/s even though I set my minimum to be 0.9. Anyone have a more permanent fix?
