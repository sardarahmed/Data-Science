Q:

Pausing or aborting movement to a goal

What's the best way to programatically pause or abort movement towards a goal location once it's in the process of being executed?

A:

The move_base node uses an action interface for managing its goals which is built on top of ROS topics one of which is, in this case, move_base/cancel. You can send a message-based cancel request, but I'd recommend using an action client to interact with move_base. Documentation that will probably be useful includes, actionlib documentation (http://www.ros.org/wiki/actionlib), and a tutorial on sending goals to the navigation stack using actionlib (http://www.ros.org/wiki/navigation/Tutorials/SendingSimpleGoals).
Hope this helps.

Is it possible to cancel the goal inside the ActionServer itself without adding a client side to it. I'm adding priorities to my multiple action servers and whenever any of the callbacks is triggered the server has to check if a goal with a higher priority is currently being executed.

If the received goal is with a higher priority of the currently running goal, the currently running goal needs to be canceled and the new goal is executed.
