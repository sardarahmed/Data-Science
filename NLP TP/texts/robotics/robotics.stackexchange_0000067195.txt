Q:

GUI noob - no prior experience with Qt or Rqt

Problem Statement:

I have a USB camera stream and I can view these images multiple ways.
But now, I have to create a GUI with say an image window that is streaming these images on a node "Listener.py" and has some control options available to the user.

Example Scenario:

I can see three buttons, and I need to do this :
   onClick(Button1): Display Image1 on ImageWindow
   onClick(Button2): Display Image2 on ImageWindow
   onClick(Button3): Display Image3 on ImageWindow

How do I go about creating this GUI?
I don't need an exclusive code, but any/all links to well-documented tutorials is terribly appreciated.
I actually went over to rqt/tutorials page but found it a little overwhelming.
Posting here in the hope that I get out of noob status and other noobs can benefit from constructive answers as well.

No takers?

A:

If you want to use image_transport for your video data you must use  C++ since there is no equivalent in Python at the moment.
You can create your own rqt plugin by following the tutorials and looking at the code of other plugins. If the existing documentation for that seems to be too overwhelming you might want to start with some beginner tutorials on ROS before.
For your specific goal it would make sense to reuse some of the code of the rqt_image_view plugin.
Update:
rqt is built on the gui toolkit Qt. You will find a lot of documentation about Qt itself which is not covered in the ROS wiki:

Qt widgets: http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/widgets-tutorial.html
Qt signals & slots: http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/signalsandslots.html
Qt threads: http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/threads-qobject.html
Threading in general: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_%28computing%29

Hi @dirk-thomas, my problem is not in understanding ROS, but the UI part of it.
http://wiki.ros.org/rqt/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20Python%20Plugin
for example, mentions several terms like "widgets", "signals/slots", "threads" that do not as of yet make sense to me.

However, thanks for the rqt_image_view plugin link. Maybe I should use the existing plugin, modify a few things there and then visualize how they look.
