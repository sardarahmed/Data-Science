Q:

errors in stacks in ROS

Hi, I'm not familiar at ROS errors,,
firstly , i installed Roboearth Stack using these four steps :
http://www.ros.org/wiki/roboearth
the result of that : I have the roboearth stack in Home/ros
i made a connection between this and ROS
by opening bashrc file
and typed "export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/opt/ros/fuerte/share:/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks:/home/ros"
and saved
i begin to run re_comm package in roboearth stack but itthrow an error
salma@salma-G31M-S2L:~$ rosrun re_comm run
[rospack] Error: stack/package re_comm not found

i don't know why ???
re_comm not in /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks
but in /home/ros/roboearth
why not found ??
and this is the result of rosmake roboearth now
salma@salma-G31M-S2L:~$ rosmake roboearth
[ rosmake ] rosmake starting...

Please do not add my name just to enforce a notification email. I see your question and I will answer it if I know the answer and if I have time. Be aware that I'm giving support here in my free time and voluntarily.

Are you sure /home/ros is the correct directory for roboearth?  In FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard), the home directory ~/. is the same as /home/username/.   /home/. is a different place. Since your username is salma, I'd guess that you should use /home/salma/ros instead of /home/ros

Great! Be sure and post the answer or accept the right one for others who might have the same problem.

A:

the home directory ~/. is the same as /home/username/.
you should use /home/username/ros instead of /home/ros
