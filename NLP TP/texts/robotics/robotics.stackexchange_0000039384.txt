Q:

Why cannot show kinect data on rviz with openni_node.launch?

I run
  roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch
  rosrun rviz rviz

I set Fixed Frame to /openni_rgb_optical_frame
I change PointCloud2's topic to /camera/rgb/points
Why rviz can't show any point cloud?

Yellow usually indicates that rviz hasn't received any data yet. Could you confirm that your Kinect is publishing data, say by using 'rostopic hz /camera/rgb/points'.

A:

Kinect isn't publishing data...
I found that kinect can't work with usb3.0 .
It works with usb2.0 .

you're right. to be exact, openni_kinect stack doesn't work with usb3.0.
