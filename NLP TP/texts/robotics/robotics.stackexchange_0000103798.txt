Q:

DeprecationWarning in ROS 2 Foxy

I am working on a project where a remote in a Jetson Nano on an RC-Car from my Laptop to run ROS2 Nodes.
So far everything is working fine despite of this warning, but i'm wondering if it can lead to problems later on.
Below is the demo talker node:
anassq@anassq-ThinkPad:-$ ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker
[INFO] [1693382772.600519335] [talker]: Publishing: 'Hello World: 1'
[INFO] [1693382773.600493124] [talker]: Publishing: 'Hello World: 2'
[INFO] [1693382774.600495367] [talker]: Publishing: 'Hello World: 3'
^C[INFO] [1693382775.563863256] [rcicpp]: signal_handler(signal_value=2)
anassq@anassq-ThinkPad:-$

Below is the demo listener node:
jetson@nano:—$ ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener
/opt/ros/foxy/bin/ros2:6: DeprecationWarning: pkg_resources is deprecated as an API. See https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html

jetson@nano:—$

Please Note: The Ubuntu image i flashed on the jetson-nano comes with already installer python and many other packages. Here is the source of that image: https://github.com/Qengineering/Jetson-Nano-Ubuntu-20-image
I tried updating the system and the rosdep, but it didn't work.
Does anyone have a suggestion to how this could be solved ?
Thanks a lot for the read
