Q:

Root password for default Turtlebot install

I bought a Turtlebot assembled from Clearpath Robotics and it arrived today (yay!). It came with Ubuntu and ROS already configured, however, I don't know the root password.
Following the set up instructions, I logged in with turtlebot/turtlebot successfully. However, when needing root access (changing the Time Settings in the GUI, for example),  I'm prompted for the root user password. It's not "turtlebot" or "root".
I'm asking the question here instead of from Clearpath's support incase others run into the same issue.

A:

The user "turtlebot" has sudo access. I was able to change the root password with:
sudo passwd
