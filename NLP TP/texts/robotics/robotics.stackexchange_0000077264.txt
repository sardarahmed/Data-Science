Q:

Documentation tutorial error from wiki

I am trying to submit several repositories for documentation following this tutorial: http://wiki.ros.org/rosdistro/Tutorials/Indexing%20Your%20ROS%20Repository%20for%20Documentation%20Generation
The command rosdistro_reformat file://$(pwd)/distribution.yaml fails with the following output:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/rosdistro_reformat", line 66, in <module>
    success = reformat_files(index)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rosdistro/verify.py", line 58, in reformat_files
    return verify_files(index_url, _reformat_files)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rosdistro/verify.py", line 67, in verify_files
    index = get_index(index_url)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rosdistro/__init__.py", line 121, in get_index
    return Index(data, base_url, url_query=url_parts.query)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rosdistro/index.py", line 47, in __init__
    assert data['type'] == Index._type, "Expected file type is '%s', not '%s'" % (Index._type, data['type'])
AssertionError: Expected file type is 'index', not 'distribution'

The error is the same if I rename distribution.yaml to foo.yaml.
I guess I could do the alphabetic sorting manually...

A:

Make sure your version of python-rosdistro is up-to-date.
