Q:

openni_tracker and OS X (again)

As I reported in another question, if I try to rosmake openni_kinect on my snow leopard system, openni_tracker fails, saying that is can't find a bunch of files:
error: XnOpenNI.h: No such file or directory

But these files all seem to be in the openni binaries I installed in another directory on my computer.
How do I tell openni_kinect where those files are?

Could you re-title the headline into a question? I'm hoping to set a trend to make questions easier to browse. Something like "How do you get ROS to find OpenN includes in OS X?" perhaps.

A:

Odds are pretty good it's a path problem.
Make sure that your PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH include the OpenNI stuff.
