Q:

rosrun: unable to locate the node robot_state_publisher

The exact error I am having is
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [robot_state_publisher/state_publisher]: can't locate node [state_publisher] in package [robot_state_publisher]

I have cloned the robot_state_publisher from ros wiki and already had done rosmake.
I have also sourced the terminal to devel before using rosrun aswell as exported all the reqaquired core packages and python path to the terminal before trying to run the robot_state_publisher.
here is the my CmakeList.txt file,
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8)
project(robot_state_publisher)

set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra")

find_package(orocos_kdl REQUIRED)
find_package(catkin REQUIRED
  COMPONENTS roscpp rosconsole rostime tf tf2_ros tf2_kdl kdl_parser
)
find_package(Eigen3 REQUIRED)

find_package(urdfdom_headers REQUIRED)

catkin_package(
  LIBRARIES ${PROJECT_NAME}_solver
  INCLUDE_DIRS include
  DEPENDS roscpp rosconsole rostime tf2_ros tf2_kdl kdl_parser orocos_kdl urdfdom_headers
)

include_directories(SYSTEM ${EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIRS})
include_directories(include ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS} ${orocos_kdl_INCLUDE_DIRS} ${urdfdom_headers_INCLUDE_DIRS})
link_directories(${orocos_kdl_LIBRARY_DIRS})

add_library(${PROJECT_NAME}_solver
  src/robot_state_publisher.cpp src/treefksolverposfull_recursive.cpp
)
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME}_solver ${catkin_LIBRARIES} ${orocos_kdl_LIBRARIES})

add_library(joint_state_listener src/joint_state_listener.cpp)
target_link_libraries(joint_state_listener ${PROJECT_NAME}_solver ${orocos_kdl_LIBRARIES})

add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} src/joint_state_listener.cpp)
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} ${PROJECT_NAME}_solver ${orocos_kdl_LIBRARIES})

# compile the same executable using the old name as well
add_executable(state_publisher src/joint_state_listener.cpp)
target_link_libraries(state_publisher ${PROJECT_NAME}_solver ${orocos_kdl_LIBRARIES})

Can you please help me solve this problem, I am trying to run a robot I have designed using xacro on gazebo and control it with ros. I have already installed ros_control and ros_gazebo packages. Thank you advance,

I have cloned the robot_state_publisher from ros wiki

why?

and already had done rosmake.

why?
Did sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-robot-state-publisher not work for you?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-01-04:
Please remove robot_state_publisher from your workspace (remove your build and devel folders as well), install the binary version, rebuild your workspace and try again.

after cloning it from the wiki, I had used rosmake to compile the cloning package. I am not sure whether its mandatory or not but I followed the same process i follow to create any new packages on catkin workspace.

rosmake is not used for Catkin packages. That would be catkin_make (or catkin build).
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-01-04:
In general: always try to use binary packages and install them using apt (or apt-get). There are few cases where you'd want to / need to build packages from source. git clone should not be your default for installing ROS packages.

build and devel folders contains other ros packages that I have been using. Doesn't remove the entire folders affect the entire project in a way that I had to create them all again ? and also may I know how it is going to help ?

build and devel contain only derived resources -- if you're using a normal Catkin workspace setup. ..
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-01-04:
.. That means that after removing build and devel, a catkin_make should result in all the pkgs in src being rebuilt. In the end devel should contain the same packages as before.

and also may I know how it is going to help ?

you've added robot_state_publisher to your workspace, ..
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-01-04:
.. and then built your workspace. If you now remove src/robot_state_publisher, but do not rebuild your workspace, your ROS environment will still point to the robot_state_publisher in your workspace, even though you've removed it.
That's why a rebuild is a good idea.
Comment by microbot on 2019-01-04:
Thank you very much , I have deleted the devel and build directories from the catkin workspace and when I used catkin_make command as you said they are created again. Thanks for explaining me the part.  So you suggest me to remove the cloned robot_state_publisher and then rebuild my workspace...
Comment by microbot on 2019-01-04:
..and then install the robot-state-publisher using the apt-get command?  I am kind of beginer to the ROS and catkin environment. so when you suggested me to rebuild, can you please tell me what exactly you meant ?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-01-04:
To get this clear first: always first try to use apt (or apt-get) to install ROS pkgs. Don't go git cloneing things. That's not how this works and it should not be your go-to command when installing ROS pkgs. There are situations where it's needed, but this is not one of them.

A:

As to your question: yes. Remove src/robot_state_publisher, remove devel and build folders, run sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-robot-state-publisher and then rebuild your workspace (run catkin_make).

Thank you very much, now I have got it about how to install. Thank you once again.
Comment by microbot on 2019-01-07:
the question I have asked had already been answered although I have got a beginner confusion , could you please point me where  the packages I installed using apt-get command located ? I have checked in the ros folder and it contains only ros core packages. can you please help me ?
