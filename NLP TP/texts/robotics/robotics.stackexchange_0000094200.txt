Make sure that you have installed "catkin_pkg", it is up to date and on the PYTHONPATH.

A:

Install catkin_pkg using below command
sudo apt-get install python-catkin-pkg

You have to verify that the catkin_pkg is installed into python 3 directory. If below command didn't work, try
pip3 install catkin_pkg

Make sure you have installed pip for running above command

No, please don't suggest people to use pip to install ROS Python dependencies. It's unnecessary and pip packages are not automatically updated as you circumvent the system's package manager.
There is one exception to this and that would be to install those packages for Python interpreters other than the system default.
But in that case please always mention the downsides, as it has plenty.

Ok understood. Can you please tell how to change the python interpreter.

On running the above suggestion, I received this error:
Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/catkin_pkg'
Consider using the --user option or check the permissions.

Try adding --user at the end of the command
