Q:

Easiest way to read QR codes

Hello,
I have been trying to use the hector_qrcode_detection_package to read QR codes, but I am having trouble getting it to run.  Is this package the easiest way to read QR codes?  If not, what other one should I be looking into?
If the hector package is the best and easiest way, can somebody please give me a more step-by-step method of getting it to run?
I'm running the hydro distribution.
