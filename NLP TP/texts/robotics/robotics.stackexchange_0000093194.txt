Q:

ROS2: Specify RTI Connext as rmw implementation on NVidia Jetson Nano not work

I'm trying to build my package with rmw_connext_cpp. It works fine on my PC (64bit, Ubuntu 18.04). Here is what I did:
vim .bashrc

then add line
export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_connext_cpp

However, when I try to do the same things on Nvidia Jetson Nano, the systems shows the following error:
-- Found ament_cmake: 0.7.3 (/opt/ros/dashing/share/ament_cmake/cmake)
-- Using PYTHON_EXECUTABLE: /usr/bin/python3
-- Found rclcpp: 0.7.7 (/opt/ros/dashing/share/rclcpp/cmake)
-- Found rosidl_adapter: 0.7.5 (/opt/ros/dashing/share/rosidl_adapter/cmake)
-- Found rmw_implementation_cmake: 0.7.2 (/opt/ros/dashing/share/rmw_implementation_cmake/cmake)
CMake Error at /opt/ros/dashing/share/rmw_implementation/cmake/rmw_implementation-extras.cmake:47 (message):
  The RMW implementation has been specified as 'rmw_connext_cpp' through the
  environment variable 'RMW_IMPLEMENTATION', however it is not in the list of
  supported rmw implementations, which was specified when the 'rmw_implementation' package was built.

Thanks!!!
BTW, I had already install rmw_implementation, rmw_connext_cpp, and rosidl_typesupport_connext_cpp.

A:

To be able to use rmw_connext_cpp, you need to install Connext on your system. However, RTI doesn't provide Connext builds for arm64 platforms.  rmw_connext_cpp is not declaring itself as supported, because it is detecting that Connext is not available on your system.
More info:
It is necessary to install alternative DDS implementations before you use them: https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Dashing/Linux-Install-Binary/#install-additional-dds-implementations-optional
The debian packages for RTI connext are available under a non-commercial license on amd64 but not on arm64 which is why you're seeing different behavior.
