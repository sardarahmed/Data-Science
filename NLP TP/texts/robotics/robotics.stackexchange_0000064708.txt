Q:

Is it possible to use a normal publisher in place of a TransformBroadcaster?

I'm just wondering whether a TransformBroadcaster does anything special that a normal publisher can't. Thanks

A:

The TransformBroadcaster is a class which takes care of basic boilerplate conversions and a little bookkeeping. The source is here: https://github.com/ros/geometry_experimental/blob/indigo-devel/tf2_ros/include/tf2_ros/transform_broadcaster.h and https://github.com/ros/geometry_experimental/blob/indigo-devel/tf2_ros/src/transform_broadcaster.cpp
