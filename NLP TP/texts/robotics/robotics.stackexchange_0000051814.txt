Q:

Navigation stack, rosparam error! [help!]

Hi all!
I have set up the navigation stack. And after running:
roslaunch navigation_for_segbot move_base.launch

I receive the following error msg:
error loading <rosparam> tag: 

    file does not exist [/home/abc/fuerte_workspace/sandbox/navigation_for_segbot/params/costmap_common_params.yaml]
XML is <rosparam command="load" file="$(find navigation_for_segbot)/params/costmap_common_params.yaml" ns="global_costmap"/>

Here is my roslaunch file:
<launch>
  <master auto="start"/>

  <!-- Run the map server -->
  <node name="map_server" pkg="map_server" type="map_server" args="$(find navigation_for_segbot)/maps/bwi_test_world.yaml"/>

  <!--- Run AMCL -->
  <include file="$(find amcl)/examples/amcl_omni.launch" />

  <node pkg="move_base" type="move_base" respawn="false" name="move_base" output="screen">
    <rosparam file="$(find navigation_for_segbot)/params/costmap_common_params.yaml" command="load" ns="global_costmap" />
    <rosparam file="$(find navigation_for_segbot)/params/costmap_common_params.yaml" command="load" ns="local_costmap" />
    <rosparam file="$(find navigation_for_segbot)/params/local_costmap_params.yaml" command="load" />
    <rosparam file="$(find navigation_for_segbot)/params/global_costmap_params.yaml" command="load" />
    <rosparam file="$(find navigation_for_segbot)/params/base_local_planner_params.yaml" command="load" />
  </node>
</launch>
  
 

And I have do have my
costmap_common_params.yaml  

inside my params folder inside the packge.

Are you 100% sure that the file /home/abc/fuerte_workspace/sandbox/navigation_for_segbot/params/costmap_common_params.yaml exists, that it's readable by your user and that it contains some yaml code?

Comment by Martin Günther on 2013-08-02:
The error says exactly what the problem is. The file does not exist.
Comment by salime on 2013-08-02:
I have that file, I am completely sure, and the code is readable because it was in the tutorial, so I don't know what else could it be

A:

Hi,
I experienced the same error with a different package. I could open the file and its in the right location too.
The solution is just delete the file and create it once again and put the data in it. It worked for me!
