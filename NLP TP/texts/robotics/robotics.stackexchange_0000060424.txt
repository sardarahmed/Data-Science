Q:

How to run tuckarm on Hydro?

I know the instruction on groovy:
rosrun pr2_tuckarm tuck_arms.py -r t -l t -q

It shows:
ira@ira:/opt/ros/hydro$ rosrun pr2_tuckarm tuck_arms.py -r t -l t -q
[rospack] Error: stack/package pr2_tuckarm not found
ira@ira:/opt/ros/hydro$ 

How to run it on Hydro?
Thank you~

I don't think the pr2_tuckarm package is released for Hydro yet. Sorry.

What's the main difference between groovy and hydro? Why it couldn't work on hydro? Thank you~

It is available in source, but It has not been tested ;) Give it a try.
