Q:

how to solve the error ? undefined reference to `laser_geometry::LaserProjection:

I am working in corverting the laserscan data to sonar data. In this task I had I have the same problem as in this question  "http://answers.ros.org/question/31968/compiler-cant-find-transformlaserscantopointcloud-function/"
The answer in this question is to first download the laser_generator package.

I downloaded it using "sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-laser_geometry"

Second add the package to the dependence in the manifest file..
I dont have a manifest file, instead I have a package.xml file.
I added
  <build_depend>laser_geometry</build_depend>

and
    <run_depend>laser_geometry</run_depend>

but still didnt work and I have the error:
undefined reference to `laser_geometry::LaserProjection::~LaserProjection()'

find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
 roscpp
 sensor_msgs
 ----- 
 ---- 
 ---- 
 laser_geometry // This line I added it here 
 )
