Q:

Ignore collision between specific models

Hi,
Is there a way to ignore collision between two objects ? Like an object passes through another specific object, but keeps the collision with the environment (other models and ground).
Thanks in avdance :)

A:

Hi,
you can use the <collide_bitmask> tag in the collision.
Here is the tutorial.
However you need the latest gazebo (v.6) in order to work. Meaning you need to install from source using the default branch for now.
Cheers,
Andrei
