Q:

Integrate velodyne and INS data

Hi,
I am working on project where I need to combine LIDAR scans and INS data together. I am using velodyne 32e model that i want to mount on UAV so INS data is important for accuracy. I can collect the LIDAR data and INS data in rosbag format that i want to convert into las format with accurate positioning. So that i can view data in ArcGIS.
I am able to convert lidar data to las format but unable to combine Position INS data with it
Is there any suggestion how can i do this???
thank you.

Hi, I am not very experienced in GIS applications. How did you convert PC2 data to .las? I have not found resources to do so

A:

The general ROS answer is to provide the appropriate coordinate frame transforms (using tf or tf2). To do that, you'll probably need to feed your INU data into some form of 3D localization package.
