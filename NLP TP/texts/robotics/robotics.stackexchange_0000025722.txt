Q:

hector_quadrotor not responding to cmd_vel

I'm using the hector_quadrotor package, and tyring to simulate in gazebo.  The simulated bot does not respond to commands over cmd_vel, from command line (rostopic pub), from a custom keyboard teleop node, or even from rosrun hector_quadrotor_controller test_trajectory.
I'm launching gazebo and spawning the drone using
$ roslaunch hector_gazebo_worlds rolling_landscape_120m.launch
$ roslaunch hector_quadrotor_gazebo spawn_quadrotor.launch 

I'm sure it's something simple I'm overlooking, but help would be appreciated!
Further tests show that cmd_vel does nothing with
$ roslaunch hector_quadrotor_gazebo quadrotor_empty_world.launch
$ rosrun hector_quadrotor_controller test_trajectory

either.

There was a small bug in the hector_gazebo_plugins package  introduced in r811 yesterday at 18:26 MEZ, that caused nan values in the Imu message for the first simulation step, leading to the effects you described. Height control should not have been affected. Could you try again with r814, please?

A:

Please do not double post your questions on answers.gazebosim.org and answers.ros.org. I propose to continue on ROS answers.
