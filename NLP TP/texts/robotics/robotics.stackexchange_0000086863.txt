Q:

Robot localization : needs a 4th sensor

Hello,
I use robot localization with 3 input sensor: IMU - Wheel_odometry - GPS_odometry using a static map from google maps.
But sometimes GPS isn't very accurate.
I use 2D lidars for detection that outputs a laser scan message to ROS navigation stack.
I want to use a set of lidars as an extra source of localization with the same static google maps.
So any help, How can I use a static map and 2D lidars to output a pose message to robot localization?
