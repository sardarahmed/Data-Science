Q:

Getting error code "string" from ArmNavigationErrorCodes for MoveArm action

The MoveArm action returns an  error_code in its result:
more MoveArmResult.msg
#An error code reflecting what went wrong
motion_planning_msgs/ArmNavigationErrorCodes error_code

which I can access then with:
result->error_code.val;

is there a way to get a string (which is more meaningful than an int) from this error code? something like the ENUM defined here:
/opt/ros/cturtle/stacks/motion_planning_common/motion_planning_msgs/msg/ArmNavigationErrorCodes.msg
# overall behavior
int32 PLANNING_FAILED=-1
int32 SUCCESS=1
int32 TIMED_OUT=-2

# start state errors
int32 START_STATE_IN_COLLISION=-3
int32 START_STATE_VIOLATES_PATH_CONSTRAINTS=-4

Thanks in advance,

A:

If you are in unstable and using C++, there is a convenience function in motion_planning_msgs that does this for you:
#include <motion_planning_msgs/convert_messages.h>

....
std::string err_string = motion_planning_msgs::armNavigationErrorCodeToString(error_code);
....

This will go into the release of the arm_navigation stacks against diamondback (which is essentially a copy of unstable).

Thanks. I guess I am not in unstable, it is not defined in my motion_planning_msgs/convert_messages.h . I am using the ubuntu virtual box appliance I grabbed from WG site a while ago (but I am up to date). Will this make it in the stable version sometime?
