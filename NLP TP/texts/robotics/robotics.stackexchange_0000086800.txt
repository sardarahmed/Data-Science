Q:

CMake: How to compile each node with a specific flag

I think this is really a CMake question. Let's say I want to compile the source for node 1, 2 and 3 with -pthread, -O3 and -Os flags respectively. How should I specify this in CMakeLists.txt and/or catkin_make command?

A:

Yes you can you the set_target_properties command to set many things including compiler flags just for one target.
You would add:
set_target_properties(<your_binary> PROPERTIES COMPILE_FLAGS "<your custom flags>" )

See the CMake documentation for more details.
