Q:

openni_kinect dosen't publish anything in the topics or rviz

Hi, I'm very new to ROS so bare with me a bit, I've just installed Electric on Ubuntu 11.04 on an Toshiba L650 laptop (ATI VGA)
I've installed opennni_kinect using the package
As I understand all I need to do is just to connect the kinect and start the openni_camera node so I did that using "roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch" and that kept on doing some stuff and stopped at
[ INFO] [1317816184.407080225]: rgb_frame_id = '/openni_rgb_optical_frame'
[ INFO] [1317816184.410629139]: depth_frame_id = '/openni_depth_optical_frame'
so I assumed everything is ok then followed the instruction to view the images on rviz but got nothing except a status warning in the point cloud2 screen in front of Topic saying "No messages received"
I checked using rostopic hz and rostopic echo for /camera/rgb/points but there is nothing there, also the global frame status indicates the status to be ok but there is nothing showing on the screen at all
I'm I missing something or is there a conflict with ATI driver or something? is there anything else rather than roscore should be running or is there any other steps before I run the node?

A:

Try running roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch; things have be re-arranged a bit in electric.
Do the messages printed to the console indicate that the device is connected?

After multiple retries I finally figured out the problem with rviz not starting, although I'm still unable to use see what I wan't in rviz but at least the openni driver does publish data in the topics, I'll just have to work on using them without using rviz

I think you're right, I tried your suggestion and used rostopic echo to listen to rgb/image_raw and ir/image_raw and I got all those numbers running on the screen, so I think the driver is ok now, unfortunately rviz gives some new "Segmentation fault" so I can't see what those numbers are, thanks

Thanks for your reply, unfortunately I didn't got to try it yet as I work with Kinect in the uni and I was busy with some literature review, I'll have some time tomorrow to work on the Kinect and try out the different launch file
