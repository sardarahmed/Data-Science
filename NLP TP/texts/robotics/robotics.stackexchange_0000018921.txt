Q:

Resolved Motion Rate Control, Rotational Part

I'm controlling 6 DOF robot arm based on image processing. Robot arm will grab the object. Below what my system looks

I can control the translational part of robot very well. But i cant control the rotational part. I mean i want the gripper facing down and rotate according angle of the object. Using jacobian equation
\begin{bmatrix}
dq1 \\ 
... \\ 
dq6
\end{bmatrix}= J(q)^{-1}\begin{bmatrix}
dx\\ 
dy\\ 
dz\\ 
drx\\ 
dry\\ 
drz
\end{bmatrix}
I try using rotational equation from this paper but still no luck, what should i do for rotational part
Note : To generate the jacobian, im using SerialLink.jacob0 from Matlab Robotic Toolbox by Peter Corke

A:

After a long-long research, i finally able to control the rotational part.
First of all, if you wanna control the orientation part you need to determine what kind of representation of orientation you wanna use. Available options :

Two Vector Representation
RPY Angle
Euler Angle
Unit Quarternion

If you use no 1, you only need geometrical jacobian (the original jacobian). I used the euler angle because 6 DOF robot has wrist joint (recommendation from several website). If using RPY and Euler as orientation, we need analytical jacobian. You can find how to calculate orientation error and analytical jacobian from this book

Hope this help anyone in future. Feel free to discuss and correct me
