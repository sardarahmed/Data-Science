Q:

Installing PCL for ROS Indigo

I have installed the latest PCL on Ubuntu 14.04 ROS Indigo, using the website: http://pointclouds.org/downloads/linux.html
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:v-launchpad-jochen-sprickerhof-de/pcl
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libpcl-all
Added to CMake:
find_package  (PCL REQUIRED)
...
include_directories(${PCL_INCLUDE_DIRS})
...
etc
But I get an error at find_package method saying that:
Could not find a package configuration file provided by "PCL" with any of
the following names:
PCLConfig.cmake
pcl-config.cmake

Add the installation prefix of "PCL" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "PCL_DIR"
to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "PCL" provides a
separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
Meaning that PCL was not installed correctly. Now my question is that what did I miss during the course of installation or did I mistype something when finding packages?

A:

You do not need to install the PPA. Please purge the PPA from your system.
To pull in PCL as a dependency for your source package automatically, modify your package.xml like so
Then go into the base of your workspace and run:
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro indigo -y

Rosdep will install the correct version of everything. A good reference for how to add PCL to your CMakeLists is here
