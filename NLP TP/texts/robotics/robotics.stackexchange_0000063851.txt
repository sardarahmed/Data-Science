Q:

move_base_node callbacks

Hi,
I was going through the code for the move_base_node:
int main(int argc, char** argv){
  ros::init(argc, argv, "move_base_node");
  tf::TransformListener tf(ros::Duration(10));
  move_base::MoveBase move_base( tf );
  ros::spin();
  return(0);
}

So I'm wondering, what callbacks does the ros::spin() at the end execute? The constructor for the MoveBase object has a subscriber, a couple of services, an action server and some other stuff.
And in general, I guess my question is - what callbacks does the ros::spin wait for?

A:

ros::spin() blocks until the node is killed with a signal (ctrl-C, segfault, etc) or through rosnode kill.
While ros::spin() is running, it services all of the callbacks for all topics, services, etc that are not explicitly handled by a separate spinner.

And how would it be handled by a separate spinner?
