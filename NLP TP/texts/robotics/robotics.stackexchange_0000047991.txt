Q:

MoveIt tutorial: PR2 Gazebo Quick Start

Following the tutorial on MoveIt wiki it is promted to create the pr2_moveit_controller_manager.launch file that includes a reference to controller.yaml. However the former is not included anywhere - neither in generated files nor in the files manualy added during tutorial.
How it is loaded then?
The "detailed documentation" refered from this section is empty yet. So I am a bit confused at this point.
Thanks,
Boris

A:

There is a section on the page link you posted titled "controllers.yaml" file, that describes how to create this file:
"This file should be created inside the config directory of the MoveIt! configuration package generated for your robot by the Setup Assistant. This file does not exist yet - it has not been auto-generated by the MoveIt! Setup Assistant. "
It says to copy-paste their version into your config directory. Did you try this yet?
EDIT (per comment)
Got it. What you need to do is create the pr2_moveit_controller_manager.launch file in the launch folder of your configuration package. Within that file you will see the line

rosparam file="$(find pr2_moveit_generated)/config/controllers.yaml"

That is where it is referenced.

Sorry for confusion. The question is not how to create this file, but how it is called by the system. I was unable to find anything that uses this file. So, the next question would be - why should I even bother to create it? It is also not mentioned anywhere in future tutorials.

Ah, I see. So it is then used through the parameter server. I somehow was inattentive and was thinking it is  and not , which is a big difference. Thanks to point this out!
