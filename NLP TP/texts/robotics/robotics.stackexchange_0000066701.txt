Q:

qrcode_detection problem

hi everyone
I want to use hector_qrcode_detection package. But i dont know if an uvc cemera is enough. In the launch file i see three different vision sources:

<launch>   

<remap from="image_percept" to="worldmodel/image_percept" />

<node name="qrcode_detection_kinect" pkg="nodelet" type="nodelet" args="load hector_qrcode_detection/qrcode_detection openni/openni_nodelet_manager">
<remap from="openni/image"             to="/image_raw" />
<remap from="openni/image_percept"     to="worldmodel/image_percept" />
<remap from="openni/image/qrcode"      to="image/qrcode" />
<remap from="openni/image/camera_info" to="image/camera_info" />   

</node>

<node name="qrcode_detection_pseye_left" pkg="nodelet" type="nodelet" args="load hector_qrcode_detection/qrcode_detection pseye_camera_left">
<remap from="image" to="left/image_mono" />   

</node>

<node name="qrcode_detection_pseye_right" pkg="nodelet" type="nodelet" args="load hector_qrcode_detection/qrcode_detection pseye_camera_right">
<remap from="image" to="right/image_mono" />  

</node>

</launch>

Do i need to add kinect and another camera to use it? Honestly i can not do it with my uvc camera.
thanks

A:

You do not need another camera. The above launch files loads a separate instance of the qrcode detection nodelet into each camera's nodelet manager (kinect, and two pseye cameras).
If you're looking to do some very simple qr code detection, you can also try zbar_ros, sample launchfile here.

Thanks for your help. It seems useful package. But when i try to run launch file i see an error: Skipping XML Document "/opt/ros/hydro/share/zbar_ros/nodelets.xml". Do you know how should i add nodelets,xml file to my package?

I solved it. Simplely i copied nodelets.xml from your repository to my zbar_ros directory.

Please make a separate issue and post more information.

Well, I has solved this problem. If I want to use zbar_ros to identify QR code, I just need to change the topic's name. In fact , I don't have a nodelet for usb_cam so that I occured such problems.
