Q:

Publish clicked point in Rviz without using navigation stack

I wish to publish the clicked point in Rviz. I read that we need to be using the ROS navigation stack for this feature to work. However, my setup doesn't use laser scans and relies on aruco markers. Hence, I am not using the navigation stack.

A:

You do not need to be using the ROS navigation stack. Just have your software subscribe to the topic that rviz is publishing for clicked points.
