Q:

Snake.cpp isn't in Fuerte?

Hi,
Why there isn't the function snake in opencv installed by default by ROS Fuerte? I saw the function does exist when you install opencv from the opencv.org

A:

Starting in Fuerte, OpenCV is not a ros package but a system dependancy. Double check which version of opencv you installed for ros and which version has snake. Also look around answers.ros.org, there might be a solution for you.

Ok, for what I understand ROS Fuerte has version 2.3.1, I was looking at version 2.4.0 ... But how can I implement that function, or how can I update my OpenCV version from Fuerte ... I have installed OpenCV 2.4.0 in Ubuntu 11.10 but my system uses OpenCV from Fuerte by default

You can't easily switch it.  If you want to you need to check everything that builds on top of it out from source.
