We're using an Intel NUC board with a Core i3. Works like a charm.

Hi Hendrik
could you tell me about details of this board
which version of linux you use on it?
and how hard is working with it ?
Comment by Hendrik Wiese on 2013-10-25:
It's a pretty neat small board with an mSATA and two memory slots and a Core i3 processor. Here's /proc/cpuinfo of the board: http://pastebin.com/ysmZjgU5 Working with it is like on a normal PC. Ubuntu 13.04 64bit runs pretty well on it.

A:

Depends on what you want to do with it. There is are instructions for the beagleboard and the Raspberry Pi. But it depends on your application if those boards have enough computing power.
