Q:

Torque in kg/cm?

I was looking up the motor parameters for some stepper motor where they listed the torque of the motor at different current/voltage but the torque they listed was in kg/cm.
How is kg/cm even a remotely acceptable unit for torque?
How do I calculate the torque in Nm from kg/cm?
Clarity note: Its not kgcm which represents [0.098 kilogram force = 1 Nm.]
Website where this happens.

A:

It is most likely kgf-cm, as kg/cm is not a valid unit for torque.  
Apparently writing kg/cm when kgf-cm is meant is a common mistake made on datasheets.
According to this conversion of kgf-cm to Nm, 28 kgf-cm of torque is 2.7 Nm, and 150 kgf-cm of torque is 14.7 Nm.
