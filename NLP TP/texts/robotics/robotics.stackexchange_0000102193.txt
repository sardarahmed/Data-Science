Q:

Unable to locate package ros-noetic-bfl

I have done sudo apt(-get) update by times.
And most of other packages of ros-noetic have been normally installed.
Has ros-noetic-bfl been renamed in noetic ?

A:

The wiki page says the Bayesian Filter Library is orphaned.
You can try compiling the older ros package source link on the wiki page, or you can install it as a regular system library from apt using package name liborocos-bfl-dev.
