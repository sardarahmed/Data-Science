Q:

How to extract a point cloud from Kinect recorded videos (.oni files)

Hi there,
When a live Kinect is connected, launching openni with roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch starts publishing point clouds at topic /camera/depth/points.
I have videos recorded from Kinect in OpenNI file format  (.oni). Can I extract point clouds from these videos? Is there is away openni.launch can be executed with these videos or without live camera?
Thanks.
