Q:

roslaunch p2os_urdf pioneer3dx.gazebo.launch crash on ros-electric

Hi
The pioneer gazebo example (pioneer3dx.gazebo.launch) from the p2os stack crashes.
I am running it on a Ubuntu 11.04 (64bit) and I used the pre-compiled package installation.
Gazebo starts but crashed because of the libgazebo_ros_controller_manager.so
Gazebo successfully initialized

Comment by hsu on 2011-09-20:
is pr2_gazebo_plugins (under pr2_simulator stack) installed?  that's where gazebo_ros_controller_manager is.

A:

Hi found my mistake
The package ros-electric-pr2-simulator was not installed.
This package includes the missing lib file libgazebo_ros_controller_manager.so
Therfore running
sudo apt-get install ros-electric-pr2-simulator 

solves the problem.
cheers
PS.: The same would would also happen on diamondback
