Q:

Context menu in rqt_bag won't appear

When running rqt_bag version 0.2.14 in ROS Groovy, I was trying to right-click the timeline to enable topic publishing, but the menu wouldn't appear. The menu WOULD appear in rxbag. In rqt_bag, however, right-clicks and middle-clicks didn't even seem to dispatch events. The strange part is that on another machine with a different graphics driver, rqt_bag works as expected.

rqt_bag 0.2.14
ROS Groovy
Xubuntu 12.04
Nvidia CUDA display drivers
