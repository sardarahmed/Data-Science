Q:

What is the origin of the term catkin?

I am curious about the meaning and/origin of the term catkin. The best I could find was dutch slang for a little cat.

I happen to be Dutch and I've never heard anyone use catkin as slang for a small cat.
The wikipedia page on catkin does say:

The word catkin is a loanword from the Middle Dutch katteken, meaning "kitten"

are you referring to this? A loanword is hardly something I would call slang though.

A:

It's a reference to Willow Garage. From the overview of catkin

The name catkin comes from the tail-shaped flower cluster found on willow trees -- a reference to Willow Garage where catkin was created.
