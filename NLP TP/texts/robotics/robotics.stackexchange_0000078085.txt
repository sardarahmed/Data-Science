Q:

Control turtlesim via webpage

Hi all,
I was trying to control turtlesim from a webpage in my android phone. I followed this tutorial:
http://iguanatronics.com/simple-tutorial-on-rosbridge-and-roslibjs/
I ran "roslaunch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket.launch" and "rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node" in my laptop. Also i opened the web page to control the turtlesim in my android mobile. But, the web page displays:
"Error connecting to websocket server.
Connection to websocket server closed."
Please help !

Hi all,
I found the solution by myself. The IP address to be specified is that of the ros machine, and not the non ros one. So, i simply put the ip address in this line:
url : 'ws://192.168.0.100:9090'

And i could control theturtlesim from non ros computer.
Thanks !
