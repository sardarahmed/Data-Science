Q:

rqt_publisher broken ('rospack' is not defined)

Hi.
I cannot use rqt_gui since the last update. The topic drill down is updating without any results:

And when I click on refresh, I have this message:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/hydro/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rqt_publisher/publisher_widget.py", line 103, in _update_thread_run
    for base_type_str in rosmsg.list_msgs(package, rospack=rospack):
NameError: global name 'rospack' is not defined

I have just re-installed everything this weekend so my settings are clean (I already had this message before the update).
Thx for the support.
PS: rospack is installed.
EDIT1: as requested in the comments.

Any idea when this patch will be delivered?
Comment by Dirk Thomas on 2013-10-15:
The release has already been made and is available in shadow-fixed (http://ros.org/debbuild/hydro.html?q=rqt_publisher). Next time the repo will be synced it will be available in public. I can't give a good estimate when that will be since we wait for some other packages to clear - may be today.

Updated this evening and the bug is fixed.
