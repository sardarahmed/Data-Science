A:

Like this:
# "List of ';' separated packages to build"
catkin_make -DCATKIN_BLACKLIST_PACKAGES="foo;bar"

Well, you have to to --force-cmake and you only have to do the above once I noticed. But it works. How do I list the current value of cmake CATKIN_* variables?

They are in CMakeCache.txt. Not sure if there is a nice method to get those.

ccmake, cmake-gui and such

Also, "cmake -L | grep CATKIN"

Aha, "ccmake ." did work if I was in build. Strange I thought I tested that before asking.
