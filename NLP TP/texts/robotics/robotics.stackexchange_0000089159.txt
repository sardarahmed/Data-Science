Q:

[RVIZ2] Load configuration at launch

I'm trying to load an existing configuration for RVIZ2 from command line, but it seems that it is not possible, differently from RVIZ in ROS1.
Does RVIZ2 support command line parameters?

A:

The answer was simple: rviz2 -h
Options:
  -h, --help                             Displays this help.
  -d, --display-config <display_config>  A display config file (.rviz) to load

Hi, Have you tried the same from a launch file? This doesn't work for me:
Node(package='rviz2', executable='rviz2', name="rviz2", output='screen', arguments=['-d '+rviz_path])

Note it should be arguments=['-d', rviz_path] as mentioned here
