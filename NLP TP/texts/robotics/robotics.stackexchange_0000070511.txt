Q:

Why the .config file doesn't works for me

Ubuntu: 12.04
ROS: Hydro
I am learning to set the level of logging message, however, I find that my .config doesn't work.
This is my source code in example1.cpp:
#include <ros/ros.h>
int main( int argc, char **argv )
{
  ros::init( argc, argv, "example1" );
  //ROS_DEBUG( "This is a DEBUG message!" );   
 ROS_INFO("This is an INFO message!");
 ROS_WARN("This is a WARN message!");
 ROS_ERROR("This is an ERROR message!");
 ROS_FATAL("This is a FATAL message!");

 ros::spinOnce();
 return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

chapter3_tutorials.config:
log4j.logger.ros.chapter3_tutorials.config=ERROR

example1.launch :
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<launch>
  <!-- Logger config -->
  <env name="ROSCONSOLE_CONFIG_FILE"
       value="$(find chapter3_tutorials)/config/chapter3_tutorials.config"/>

  <!-- Example 1 -->
  <node pkg="chapter3_tutorials" type="example1" name="example1"
        output="screen"/>
</launch>

After I roslaunch the code, it should print only logging message ERROR and FATAL,
But the INFO and WARN also are printed.
How to solve it?
Thank you~

A:

Looks like there is one "config" too much, try this:
log4j.logger.ros.chapter3_tutorials=ERROR
