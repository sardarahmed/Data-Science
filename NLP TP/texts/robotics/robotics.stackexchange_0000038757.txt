Q:

How to compile stage on Mac OS X Lion?

Hi!
I'm trying to compile stage on my OS X but I'm getting an error with libjpeg:
$ rosmake stage --rosdep-install
Using environment variable ROS_OS_OVERRIDE name = osxbrew version = lion
[ rosmake ] Packages requested are: ['stage']
[ rosmake ] Logging to directory/Users/user/.ros/rosmake/rosmake_output-20120316-145058
[ rosmake ] Expanded args ['stage'] to:
['stage']
[ rosmake ] Generating Install Script using rosdep then executing. This may take a minute, you will be prompted for permissions. . .
Using environment variable ROS_OS_OVERRIDE name = osxbrew version = lion
Failed to find rosdep libjpeg for package stage on OS:osxbrew version:lion
[ rosmake ] rosdep install failed: Rosdep install failed
Also:
$ brew install libjpeg
Warning: jpeg already installed
I followed the Homebrew Mac OS X install tutorial here:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/electric/Installation/OSX/Homebrew
My version of OS X is 10.7.3
Thanks in advance!

Stage 3 or Stage 4?
Comment by Gonçalo Cabrita on 2012-03-16:
Stage 3.2.2, its what comes with electric, forgot to mention that!!!

A:

Unfortunately Stage 3.2.2 does not work on OS X.  Stage 4.x does however, and there are patches for stage_ros to be compatible for Stage 4 as well.  I would recommend that as a solution.
Here are some general notes about it on my blog:
