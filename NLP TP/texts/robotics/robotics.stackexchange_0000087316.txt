Q:

ROS multi-machine communication failure: invalid master URI

Hi, I have set up ROS to communicate between my robot (using raspberry pi) and my laptop. It worked for a period of time but  somehow stopped working suddenly. The reported error is:
invalid master URI:192.168.43.244:11311
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

Please note that the procedures I took for ROS master and slave to communicate should have been correct or I wouldn' t have succeeded in the first few times.
I can not find any related information for this problem, so someone who has an idea please tell me what is going wrong and how I can fix this please. Thanks.

A:

invalid master URI:192.168.43.244:11311

If this is a copy-paste, then it's indeed an invalid URI, as it doesn't include the protocol part. It should probably be:
http://192.168.43.244:11311

It worked for a period of time but  somehow stopped working suddenly.

That would seem rather strange: unless you have someone else editing your files, the http:// part would have to have dropped of on its own.

This solves the problem. My fault. I forgot to add http:// in the latter times.

Where we need to add "http://". It is there  in the bashrc file so where should I add this. Kindly help me.

If it's already there, there wouldn't be anything to add.
You'll want to post a new question and precisely describe what you're trying to do, what you observe doesn't work, what the symptoms are, what you've tried to solve it, and refer to this question.
If it then turns out to be a duplicate, it can still be closed.
