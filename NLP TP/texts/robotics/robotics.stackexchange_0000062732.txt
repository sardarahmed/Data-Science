Q:

Can anybody please tell how to use web camera in ROS?

I want to use webcamera to test images in ROS. I am programming using OPENCV and want to see the live video stream from my laptop in a window on ROS.  When I try to launch a file whose contents are given below, I get an error that "ERROR: cannot launch node of type [uvc_cam/uvc_cam_node]: can't locate node [uvc_cam_node] in package [uvc_cam]
No processes to monitor :".
I launch the file using the command : roslaunch ishan_vision uvc_cam.launch device:=/dev/video0
uvc_cam.launch file :
<node name="uvc_cam_node" pkg="uvc_cam" type="uvc_cam_node" output="screen">
    <remap from="camera/image_raw" to="camera/rgb/image_color" />
    <param name="device" value="$(arg device)" />
    <param name="width" value="320" />
    <param name="height" value="240" />
    <param name="frame_rate" value="20" />
    <param name="exposure" value="0" />
    <param name="gain" value="100" /> 
</node>

Can anybody please help?
Thanks

A:

It looks like roslaunch can't find the node, which shouldn't happen if you've:

installed uvc_camera sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-uvc-camera
sourced your ros installation source /opt/ros/<distro>/setup.bash

Thanks a lot. Now, its working. I did not install the uvc camera thats why it was giving the error. Thanks.

sudo apt-get install ros-`rosversion -d`-uvc-camera is shorter version

Dear Sir,
I have installed uvc-camera and have even sourced my ros installation.
However still roslaunch is unable to find the launch file.
Using ROS Kinetic
