Q:

Problem building gscam on groovy armhf

Hi,
I'm trying to build gscam fro groovy on ubuntu 12.04armhf and get a message that quite a few deps are not released. Looking at the status page http://namniart.com/repos/status/groovy.html, it shows that it is not available for GsrcP 433 and GbinParmhf 455. Apparently mine is that version. Since the package is maintained by J. Bohren and R. Toris, I would like to know if the deps problem is indeed the reason it is missing.
Thanks

A:

There's a build of gscam available in the latest set of binary builds of Groovy for ARM. Note that the repository URL and key have changed: http://wiki.ros.org/groovy/Installation/UbuntuARM

Since this link mentions Raring, is this only for Raring or for Precise as well? I'm using Precise.

Sorry; my initial response had the wrong link. Yes, this applies to Precise as well.

Thanks. I have tried to install gscam using "sudo apt-get update" and "sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-gscam" but it still says there's no such package. "sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-g" shows 14 packages, but no gscam. Neither does synaptic. Any clue what's going wrong ?

Can you confirm that you have the updated package URL ( deb http://packages.namniart.com/repos/ros precise main ) in your /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list ?
Comment by hvn on 2014-01-23:
Ok, totally forgot to update that. After updating, it can install gscam with dependencies. And can you confirm that there is a GPG error on the URL because the signature cannot be verified ?

The key has also changed. Please run: wget http://packages.namniart.com/repos/namniart.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -

After running wget, apt-get install ros-groovy-gscam gives the warning that gscam as well as its dependencies can not be authenticated. Is this ok or not ?
Comment by ahendrix on 2014-01-24:
I haven't had this problem on my systems. Did you pipe the output from wget into apt-key add to add the new key?
Comment by hvn on 2014-01-24:
Yes, but I think I have a problem. After running wget | sudo , it gets the key and waits a very long time. Then asks for pw and gives ok. When I try to install gscam, it gives the authentication warning again.
Comment by ahendrix on 2014-01-24:
That sounds like it's adding the key correctly. You may need to run 'apt-get update' after adding a new key.

That worked. Question on the path though: according to http://wiki.ros.org/gscam, to start roscd gscam && cd bin. But this path doesn't exist. I have /opt/ros/groovy/lib/gscam and /opt/ros/groovy/share/gscam, and no bin. Did I miss something ?
Comment by ahendrix on 2014-01-24:
That sounds like a problem with gscam and should probably be the subject of a new question.

On my x86 electric, gscam works fine. On x86 groovy (installed just now) it's the same problem. So it looks like the gscam groovy build is wrong somehow.  Will ask the maintainer.
