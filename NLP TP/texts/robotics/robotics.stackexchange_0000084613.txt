Q:

Path Planning/Rviz/nav stack

Hello,
I am running turtlebot on indigo (on ubuntu trusty) and wish to visually represent the robot's navigation path using a ring of LEDs.  I have not been able to find the line(s) of code that represent the robot's planned path.  Ideally I would like to reference this code to light the LEDs in a way that corresponds to the robots preferred heading.  Does anyone know where in the nav stack or rviz this code is hiding?
Thank you for any help!
Peter

A:

The navstack publishes a path topic I believe, that will show the route it's currently following. If you subscribe to this topic then find the closest point on the path to the robots current location then you'll have a vector pointing in the direction of the next segments of the path.
I don't know if there's a simpler way, but this will definitely work.
