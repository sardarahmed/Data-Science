Q:

Natural language processing in ROS

I am interested in decomposing a user's sentence and recognizing the subject, the object and what the user is saying (declarative sentence or asking for time, place, person etc...)
I found this : www.openrobots.org/wiki/dialogs
It works decently but the project is dead and the last commit was 3 years ago. I wanted to ask if there is already something as a well maintained ROS package. I heard about KnowRob and checked the wiki but they really use a complicated vocabulary and I couldn't understand if KnowRob has this ability of natural language processing or not.

I and my co-researchers have developed chat-bot like scripts using NLTK, the prospects are to develop an interactive robot HEAD (using ROS), have a look here -- http://goo.gl/GjdrWU -- may not be much help though !

Thanks for sharing this, do you have any demo code?

@Mehdi, this is a sample http://mobotica.blogspot.in/2010/08/wall-e-eva-20.html we developed the rest of our work on this !

A:

Completely open ended NLP is still a fairly open problem. Most NLP systems tend to still be application specific.
You might want to take a look at the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) (http://www.nltk.org/) which is a Python toolkit for building NLP applications. While not integrated with ROS, since it is Python, it would be very easy for you to connect your application using rospy.
If you are trying to get audio input, this gets even harder. Right now, the only speech recognition package in ROS that I am aware of is my simple wrapper around pocketsphinx-gstreamer (http://wiki.ros.org/pocketsphinx)
