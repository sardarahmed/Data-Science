Q:

MoveIt: Octomap + Collision + Trajectory = Octomap being ignored!

Hello Community!
Im currently working on a setup with MoveIt and an octomap being updated constantly, which works just fine, but now I need the robot to avoid the octomap points during planning and I just cant achieve it!
The only way I've found so far to display the octomap was to download a Octomap Server, update it with PointCloud2 info and add the PointCloud2 Display at MoveIt, setting its topic to /octomap_point_cloud_centers. This visualization also works just fine, but how am I supposed to take octomap points into account when planning a trajectory? Those octomap points are just being ignored!
Is there a way to display the Octomap with MotionPlanning or PlanningScene? How?
Let me know if there is anything else I can provide to make my problem clearer!
Thank you all!

A:

In arm navigation there was a simple setting in the launch file: use_collision_map if set to false the map was competently ignored. Perhaps there is a similar setting in MoveIt.
