Q:

Why do i get message no such file or directory when i am trying to set my environments on hydro?

I am trying to set the environment setup after installing the ROS full package using terminal. I get the following message:
kadir@kadir:~$ echo "source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
kadir@kadir:~$ source ~/.bashrc
bash: /opt/ros/cturtle/setup.bash: No such file or directory
what am i doing wrong?
P.S beginner

A:

There is still an old entry to /opt/ros/cturtle/setup.bash in your ~/.bashrc. Just remove that line.

No, just the line that contains cturtle.
