Q:

static_transform_publisher: tf vs tf2_ros

When adding a static_transform_publisher to the launch file, we have two options:
Version1: Old style with tf:
<node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="link1_broadcaster" args="1 0 0 0 0 0 1 link1_parent link1 100" />

Version2: New style with tf2_ros:
<node pkg="tf2_ros" type="static_transform_publisher" name="link1_broadcaster" args="1 0 0 0 0 0 1 link1_parent link1" />

It is probably advisable to use the tf2_ros version. Can someone explain, why we don't need to specify a frame rate for the new version? Are there any other benefits of the second version?

A:

For a discussion about static transforms I would like to refer to #q346664, which goes into quite some detail (and links to the relevant wiki pages/documentation) and #q324820.
As to the difference in command line arguments: as explained in #q346664, static transforms are not broadcast periodically.
If there is no periodic broadcast, the period argument is no longer needed.

It is probably advisable to use the tf2_ros version

Yes, and for multiple reasons:

it significantly reduces the traffic (ie: messages/sec) on the /tf topic for typical usage scenarios (where many frames are actually static), and
tf is deprecated (and has been for a long time)
