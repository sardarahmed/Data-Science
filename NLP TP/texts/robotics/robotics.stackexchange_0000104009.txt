Q:

Can't find Apply Force Torque plugin in gazebo garden

Environment:
OS: Linux Ubuntu 22.04
gazebo version: garden
Problem:
When Iâ€˜m following the tutorial here, I can't find Apply Force Torque plugin

Does my gazebo need update or there's something wrong?

A:

That functionality was only very recently merged, so probably the packages haven't been updated yet. If you can't wait for the updated packages, you can compile Gazebo from source. This is not particularly difficult, just follow the instructions.
