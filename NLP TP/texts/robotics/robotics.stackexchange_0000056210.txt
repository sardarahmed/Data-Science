Q:

urdfdom check_urdf

I use rosrun urdfdom check_urdf in ROS Hydro (Ubuntu 13.04) and get:
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named check_urdf below /opt/ros/hydro/share/urdf

A:

It would seem that commit e27ac3ba has changed the directory where the binaries in urdfdom end up in during installation.
They are now installed as 'normal' executables in /opt/ros/DISTRO/bin, meaning that after you have sourced your ROS environment, you can just do check_urdf /path/to/your/urdf in a terminal. You don't need to use rosrun .. anymore.
PS: I'm not sure if this was intended, so I've opened an issue.
