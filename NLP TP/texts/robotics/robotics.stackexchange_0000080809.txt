Probably not something you'll want to hear, but what have you tried yourself already? How much programming experience do you have? If I say: sure, just use different threads / timer callbacks, does that mean anything to you?

A:

http://wiki.ros.org/rospy/Overview/Time#Timer
def update1(event):
    pub1.publish(msg1)

def update2(event):
    pub2.publish(msg2)

def update3(event):
    pub3.publish(msg3)
...

rospy.Timer(rospy.Duration(1.0 / rate1), update1)
rospy.Timer(rospy.Duration(1.0 / rate2), update2)
rospy.Timer(rospy.Duration(1.0 / rate3), update3)
...
