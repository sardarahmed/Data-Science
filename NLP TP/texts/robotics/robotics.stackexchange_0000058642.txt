Q:

problem publishing with rosbridge suite

Hello,
I have run this tutorial (I am using ROS Hydro)
wiki.ros.org/rosbridge_suite/Tutorials/RunningRosbridge
on running rosbridge example.
When I started the HTML page, I noticed that all work expect publishing the /cmd/vel topic. I am getting this error message
[ERROR] [WallTime: 1397113517.026746] [Client 4] [id: advertise:/cmd_vel:1] advertise: init() got an unexpected keyword argument 'queue_size'
[ERROR] [WallTime: 1397113517.035466] [Client 4] [id: publish:/cmd_vel:2] publish: Cannot infer topic type for topic /cmd_vel as it is not yet advertised
Do you have any idea how to fix this issue?
I tested the same code on another Hydro machine and it worked, but on my machine with the same configuration, I had the error above.
Thank you in advance

I will check the problem sometime tommorrow

A:

Refer to the github issue in rosbridge_suite.
It was because incompatibility in rospy between groovy and hydro. Groovy version of rosbridge_suite has been re-released and should not have this error as of now.
