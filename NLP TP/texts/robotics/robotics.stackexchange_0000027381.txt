Q:

No skyx texture on Gzweb

While on Gazebo SkyX works as expected, it doesn't seem so on Gzweb for me. We set it after sunset to show the starry sky on moon, but the sky is all blacked out, no stars, Sun and the earth (as we customized).

I found that the files in skyx folders in Gazebo and Gzweb are slightly different, but replacing Gzweb's dir (gzweb/http/client/assets/media/skyx) with the one from Gazebo didn't solve the issue.
Using Gazebo (2.2.5), Ubuntu 14.04, Gzweb 1.2.0 with the following commit.

ya unfortunately sky is not yet supported in gzweb. It's currently ignoring the  sdf element.
