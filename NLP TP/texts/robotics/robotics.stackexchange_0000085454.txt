Q:

How to change color of turtlesim background using python code

Hi, guys, I'm trying to publish data to turtlesim color_sensor that is trying to display different colors my problem is it publishing data but it's not working. I did call $ rosservice call /clear after running program but it didn't work
 #!/usr/bin/env python

    import rospy
    from turtlesim.msg import Color
      
    rospy.init_node('color_sensor')
    pub = rospy.Publisher('/turtle1/color_sensor',Color,queue_size=4)
    rate = rospy.Rate(50)
    change=Color()
    change.r=255
    change.g=255
    change.b=255
    
    while not rospy.is_shutdown():
       pub.publish(change)
       print  change

it's not publishing those RGB values to color_sensor, even though I am publishing it.i,e Background color is not changing to White(255,255,255)

A:

for changing turtlesim Background color you must set  param not publish via topic you do something like this in your code:
rospy.set_param('/background_b',100)
rospy.set_param('/background_r',100)
rospy.set_param('/background_g',100)

after that you must  call
rosservice call /clear

in terminal or in your code
