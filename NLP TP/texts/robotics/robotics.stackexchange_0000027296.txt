Q:

gpu ray sensor fails to scan vertically

Hi
I recently encountered a problem with the gpu ray sensor. when I create a sensor that has only horizontal scans, the ray detects the object in front of it, but when I add vertical scans it does not.
When I change my sensor type from "gpu_ray" to "ray" the sensor works as expected (detects the object).
I'm currently working on gazebo 1.9.6, with Ubuntu 12.04.
I attached my XML.simple_test.world
What am I doing wrong?
thank you.
UPDATE: I also tried this on gazebo 2.2.3 with Ubuntu 14, and got the same result.

There is an existing issue on bitbucket. Please vote for it if it is of interest to you. Also, note that there is an experimental branch with partial support listed in that issue.
