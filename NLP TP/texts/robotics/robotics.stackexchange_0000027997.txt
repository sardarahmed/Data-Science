Q:

Where can i find list of available colours for gazebo

What are the list of gazebo material colour names which i can directly use with my robot? I have found its answer before this, but now i forgot/not finding in google where i exactly found those names, i should have saved them.

A:

There are a few options for colors:

You can use any color by specifying its RGBA values in SDF, for example:
  <material>
   <ambient>0.46 0.46 0.46 1.0</ambient>
   <diffuse>0.46 0.46 0.46 1.0</diffuse>
   <specular>0.46 0.46 0.46 1.0</specular>
   <emissive>0.46 0.46 0.46 1.0</emissive>
 </material>

You can refer to one of the ogre materials which come defined with Gazebo:
 <material>
     <script>Gazebo/Orange</script>
 </material>

You can create your own ogre material as explained in this tutorial

If you want to use textures which are not uniformly placed on your model, you will need to create a COLLADA file (with Blender for example) which references the texture within it. Here's an example model, the COLLADA file goes in the /meshes directory and the texture goes in the /materials/textures directory. The COLLADA file must reference the texture within itself.

from light map tutorilal i learned to put textures to a models, but if i want to put those textures in a way in which some name or some sign will also be visible in a specific position in model, than how can i do it? I used blender to put colors in model but the colour was not looking exact so i changed the colour sid value in its dae file, so it looked little good but not that much. is their any other way to do this.

What you want to do is to play with texture coordinates. I added another item to the answer explaining that.
