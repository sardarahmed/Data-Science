A:

The last section of the Installation Instructions for Indigo in Arch Linux page -- Community -- says this:

If you would like to contribute to packaging ROS on Arch, check arch-ros-stacks on GitHub (as explained in #1.2), or even [https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Talk:Ros].

The README.md on the linked Github repository has a How to contribute section:

If you want to contribute, simply fork this repository, create or update some packages, and make a pull request afterwards.

Indeed, just fork my repo, follow the instructions, and make a pull request. There's a script that takes care of generating/updating the PKGBUILDs, which you can use if you want to add new ROS packages and maintain them for the AUR.
