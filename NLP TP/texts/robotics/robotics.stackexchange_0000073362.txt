Q:

How to use the functions of Navigation Stack separately?

Hi all,
I am interested in navigation on mobile robots. Following this tutorial I have successfully simulated the mobile robot running on rviz by given 2D Nav Goal. The rqt_graph is as attached.
However I want to test and learn how to use the functions inside the move_base package separately. I have no idea how to get the rqt_graph inside the move_base.
More specifically, if I want to test the global planner(or local planner) alone, which information(topics) I should give?
I am trying to use
rosnode info /node_name

to guess which topics I may receive and which to publish, but it doesn't seem to be a good way.
My launch file is
<launch>
  <master auto="start"/>

  <!-- Run the map server -->
  <arg name="map_file" default="$(find robot)/yaml/map.yaml"/>
  <node name="map_server" pkg="map_server" type="map_server" args="$(arg map_file)" />

  <node pkg="global_planner" type="planner" respawn="false" name="planner" output="screen" />
  <node pkg="costmap_2d" type="costmap_2d_node" respawn="false" name="costmap_2d_node" />

  <node name="rviz" pkg="rviz" type="rviz" args="-d $(find robot)/rviz/config.rviz"/>

</launch>

I think there is still some works to do like remapping the topic names. Could anyone give me some hints?

Please, create a new question from your revised one. The way it looks now is you ask about planners (which has been answered) and then creates another question about costmaps, which is answered by yourself.

sorry, thanks for your advice.

A:

Afaik, move_base always work as a single ROS node, so you cannot do such a thing. The internal components are of two types:

plugins loaded at startup (but cannot be changed at runtime, I think) as the local or global planners, recovery behaviors, etc.
fixed components as the global and local costmaps.

But all the communications within move_base are function calls, no ROS messages at all.
That said, you can instantiate any of these components in your own nodes, for example create a costmap for your own navigation. See Component API section at the bottom of move_base wiki

jorge, I think you meant to link to http://wiki.ros.org/move_base or http://wiki.ros.org/costmap_2d

exactly, thanks!    (fixed)

Thanks for your reply. Sorry for not replying immediately. I spend some time reread the costmap_2d.

In fact, I don’t intend to use the global_planner package alone. My intention is to test every function properly. So if I want to test the global planner, I only need to subscribe the /move_base/NavfnROS/plan and close the marking and clearing function right?
