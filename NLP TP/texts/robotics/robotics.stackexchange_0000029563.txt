Hello,
I am trying to compile vslam as instructed but halting at some error mentioned below:

Comment by tfoote on 2011-02-16:
Could you specify what instructions you are following?

A:

changed  Eigen3 to Eigen in all the following files,
freiburg_kinect-experimental/rgbdslam/manifest
freiburg_kinect-experimental/rgbdslam/src/ node openni_listerer graph_manager
They have made changes recently.
