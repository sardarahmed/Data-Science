Q:

The SetJointPositions function is not working in Gazebo 1.2

Hi all,
I am trying to use set_model_configurations to move the joints arbitrarily in Gazebo 1.20. The problem is that when I set the configuration, the model didn't move at all! I look inside the codes of setModelCofiguration and found that the SetJointPositions function is probably not working. Did anyone notice this problem or I did something wrong? Any suggestions? Thank you!

How are you calling SetJointPositions?

A:

I did something similar in a c++ model plugin.
I have a private member variable of type
private: physics::JointController * j2_controller;

Which is initialized in the Load(physics::ModelPtr _parent, sdf::ElementPtr _sdf) function as follows
// Initialize the JointController with the model pointer
    this->j2_controller = new physics::JointController(_parent);

In, for instance, the OnUpdate() function, I have code that boils down to this:
double angle(0.0);
std::string j2name("j2name");    
j2_controller->SetJointPosition(j2name,angle);

However, my model is dynamic--I'm not sure if this would work to animate a static model.  Hope that helps.
