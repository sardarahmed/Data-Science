A:

I'm not sure about that one, but there is an alternative. leap_motion_controller If you're interested, I'll update the installation instructions.

Yes please, if you can do that, it'd be great.

Done! See the Readme in the package.

You could have tried running your original launch file with output="screen" in the launch file... to possibly see more output on the screen. They didn't give you much to troubleshoot by.

I made it, it works, tried with Rviz and I can see hands. I'm very grateful to you.
