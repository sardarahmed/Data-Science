Q:

Driver for Microstrain 3DM-GX3-35

Does anyone know about a driver for the Microstrain 3DM-GX3-35 or
used the sensor on Linux? This is a Microstrain IMU with an integrated
GPS. The protocol for the 3DM-GX3-35 is different from the 3DM-GX3-25 so
the microstrain_3dmgx2_imu will not work.

A:

If you are only interested in the IMU part then it is possible to set the sensor to AHRS direct mode. Then it will work with the microstrain_3dmgx2_imu driver.

Hi, I am new to ROS, could you please give me details about how to set the sensor to AHRS direct mode? THanks :)

I would like to know how to do this as well. I have the exact same issue. I'm trying to get IMU data into ROS using the 3DM-GX3-35. The existing GX2 and GX3-45 drivers haven't worked, but I haven't tried AHRS mode.
