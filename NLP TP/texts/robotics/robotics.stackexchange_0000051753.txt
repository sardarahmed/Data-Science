Q:

unable to setup chroot environment

Hi i am trying to install ROS in raspbian using source. I want to setup chroot enviornment. I have followed the steps given at ros installation instruction
But when i run this command
sudo cp /usr/bin/qemu-arm-static /mnt/usr/bin/
i get and error
cp: cannot create regular file `/mnt/usr/bin/': No such file or directory.
Please help me!..i am not able to understand the steps to be followed so it may be the case that i am stuck for very silly reasons.

Hey there, I just stumbled upon your question with some other issue, and am not a pro on this myself, but I would think that you did not mount your Pi's SD card to /mnt using
sudo mount /dev/sdc2 /mnt
or probably some other path, like "/dev/mmcblk0p2" instead of "/dev/sdc2" (which is what I am using). You can find which path it is by calling "sudo fdisk -l" once without the card inserted and once with it. Spot the difference ;)
Then try to copy again.
Also, if you just want to use ROS on the RPi, have a look at my attempt here: http://answers.ros.org/question/63705/problem-using-the-provided-groovy-rpi-image/#64027
(darn, I'm still not allowed to post links...)
