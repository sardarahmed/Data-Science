Q:

InteractiveMarkerControl menu mode shows on left click

I have an interactive marker whose interaction mode is MENU. The menu should only display when the marker is right clicked; however, it activates on either right or left click. The menu marker in the basic controls demo exhibits the same behavior. Do I need to specify which mouse button it uses, or is there a bug somewhere? I'm in Ubuntu 12.04 with ROS Groovy.

A:

The behaviour of menu controls was changed in groovy. Use a button control to get the right-click behaviour.

Thanks, dgossow. For anyone with this problem, some of the ROS tutorial code is outdated. See: http://answers.ros.org/question/56085/interactivemarker-with-multiple-interaction-modes/
