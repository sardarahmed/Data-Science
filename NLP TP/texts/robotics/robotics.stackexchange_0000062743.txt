A:

This repository seems to contain updated/catkinized tum_simulator for Hydro.
Edit: This worked for me on Hydro:
source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash
mkdir -p ~/tum_simulator_ws/src
cd ~/tum_simulator_ws/src
catkin_init_workspace
git clone https://github.com/tum-vision/tum_simulator.git
cd ..
rosdep install --from-paths src -i 
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch cvg_sim_gazebo ardrone_testworld.launch

Not all launch files work though.

I met the following error
fatal error: common/Plugin.hh: No such file or directory
#include "common/Plugin.hh"

The above procedure does work for me as well, but i can still not view the ar_drone world in my gazebo, it just does not seem to load/download the different models. Any idea what problem is there?
one of the errors is:
Error [ModelDatabase.cc:408] Unable to download model[model://nist_maze_wall_trip
