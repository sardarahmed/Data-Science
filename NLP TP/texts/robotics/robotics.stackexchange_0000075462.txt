Q:

libpenni2 vs Occipital Openni2 (repository)

Folks,
To use the Asus pro live with my personal projects (using the header files, etc.), what drivers are better, the libopenni2 (that come with openni2_launch ROS package), or the occipital repository? I ask this because I try to use the openni2 tracker with openni2_launch, but it crashes (not always, but from time to time). And I cannot find out how old the libopenni2 files are compared to the occipital OpenNi2 files.

Hi @Pototo. Unfortunately, the openni2_tracker and the openni2_launch cannot run at the same time. If you need both the skeleton tracker and the data (point cloud, image, etc...) from the Asus Xtion Pro Live, you can try this.

There is this repository that I use, but it crashes some times:

Before it crashes, this repository allows me to run openni2_launch and track a skeleton at the same time. I need color image, depth image, and skeleton at the same time unfortunately.

Do you know of any Xtion Pro packages that allow you to display those images? Maybe I can take that code and add it in the cob_openni2_tracker to see if that reduces errors.
