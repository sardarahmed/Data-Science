Q:

Display an image in gazebo

Hello, I wanted to simulate in Gazebo a system using a known target and a camera to compute the pose of the camera itself. I will use the ar_pose package the problem is that I am not able to display the know target. I'have tried creating a mesh (with blender) of the target and apply it to an object but I am having big trouble. First I don't know how to handle the material, I tryed to point, in the urdf, at the material file created with blender but it doesn't work and if I use a standrad material (like "blue") it doesn't display anything.
Thanks for your help!

A:

one example might be a image material script defined as material GazeboWorlds/Face in the materials script with corresponding image and the gazebo model.
