Q:

Autoware: 1.12.0 Download error and dependencies problem

Operating system and version:
Ubuntu 18.04
gcc (Ubuntu 7.4.0-1ubuntu1~18.04.1) 7.4.0
cmake version 3.10.2
ROS distribution:
melodic
ROS installation type:
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-desktop-full
link text
Since I am using melodic I tried to get 1.12.0 version of autoware (I am reinstalling autoware since my ubuntu got crashed and again i am reinstalling everything and i installed everything), since Autoware shifted it from github to gitlab i am following the above mentioned tutorial; and i am facing multiple issues
sudo apt install -y python-catkin-pkg python-rosdep rosdep-$ROS_DISTRO-catkin
[sudo] password for sai: 
Reading package lists... Done

E: Unable to locate package rosdep-melodic-catkin

the other problem is
~/autoware.ai$ wget -O autoware.ai.repos https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.ai/autoware/raw/1.12.0/autoware.ai.repos?inline=false

The package name is ros-melodic-catkin, not rosdep-melodic-catkin.

@gvdhoorn Yes I thought the same and I tried to install but I am getting this ros-melodic-catkin is already the newest version so the package is already installed but rosdep means it is about dependencies right??

yes, so that is not a problem at all.

but rosdep means it is about dependencies right??

I don't understand what this means.

A:

The wiki seems to be updated and has correct commands now.
The commands are now :
sudo apt install -y python-catkin-pkg python-rosdep ros-$ROS_DISTRO-catkin
and
$ wget -O autoware.ai.repos https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.ai/autoware/raw/1.12.0-alpha.2/autoware.ai.repos?inline=false
FYI, current v.1.12 is alpha-2 release. The official release will be on 8 July, 2019 so it might be worth waiting if you want to use stable version. https://discourse.ros.org/t/dates-for-1-12-development-and-release/8513/9
Of course you are welcome to test the alpha release and report issues as well.

I have updated it and was able to download 1.12.0 alpha tag but later I am getting a new issue which I have generated new issue (http://answers.ros.org/question/327117/autoware-1120-build-error/) Anyway I will update to alpha-2 after it is released but in this time I wanted to work using 1.12 alpha1 so that I can get aware of autoware usage. Thanks for the help.
