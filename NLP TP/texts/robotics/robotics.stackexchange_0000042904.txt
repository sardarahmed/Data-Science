Q:

error installing audio_common

I've been following the instructions for downloading and installing audio_common.
I'm running electric on Ubuntu 11.10
I get this error:
$ rosdep install audio_common
Failed to find rosdep libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev for package audio_capture on OS:ubuntu version:oneiric
rosdep install ERROR:
failed to install libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev

I am unsure how to proceed.
