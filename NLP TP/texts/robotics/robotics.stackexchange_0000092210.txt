Q:

Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to show 'app': Operation not supported

When I was trying to configure the NDT mapping/matching algorithm, I clicked on the 'app' icon. But the terminal shows
(runtime_manager_dialog.py:18020): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to show 'app': Operation not supported

Why is this?
My system: Ubuntu 16.04
ROS version: kinetic

Can you please provide more details?
Autoware version? (Commit)
Are you using Docker?

Hello,
Thanks for replying.
I am not using Docker, and btw, how do I check the Autoware version?

If you downloaded the Autoware repo, go to that folder and run git status and post the output here. If you are using the latest version with the install instructions from https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.ai/autoware/wikis/Source-Build then go into your autoware workspace's source folder (~/autoware.ai/src) and into a main sub-folder (e.g. autoware/utilities) and run git status and post the output here.

On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
(use "git add ..." to update what will be committed)
(use "git checkout -- ..." to discard changes in working directory)
modified:   ros/run

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
The output is like this.

Which folder did you do that in? Can you give me the full path to it? Also, can you do git fetch and then git status again?

I did this inside the folder /Autoware.
mist@mist-XPS-8930:~/Autoware$ git fetch
remote: A repository for this project does not exist yet.
fatal: repository 'https://gitlab.com/CPFL/Autoware.git/' not found
mist@mist-XPS-8930:~/Autoware$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:

A:

You are on a very old version of Autoware. The Autoware project has changed URLs a few times but the proper URL for the current version is https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.ai/autoware. Previous URLs include:

https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware
https://github.com/CPFL/autoware

If you have either of these, you will need to update your repository to point to the URL in the paragraph above. Please note that, as of version 1.12.0-alpha.1, the primary Autoware repository has been split up. You can find all new repositories at https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.ai. For install instructions for the latest version, see https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.ai/autoware/wikis/Installation. As 1.12 is not yet ready for release, these instructions do not include installation instructions for older versions - we are working on this. For now, you can do the following to get an older version:
cd ~
git clone https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.ai/autoware.git
cd autoware
git checkout 1.11.1 (or whatever version you want to go back to)
cd ros

For build instructions, see step 4 and below of https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.ai/autoware/wikis/Source-Build.
