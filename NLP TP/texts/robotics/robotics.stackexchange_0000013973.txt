Q:

Do i really need an AHRS for 2D maps?

I am currently making a 2 wheeled SLAM robot that will use an array of either ultrasonic or sharp IR sensors with a particle filter. I also have a MPU-6050 and GY-271 and i am looking to turn it into an AHRS. However, considering that the map is going to be on a 2-D plane, do i really need a full AHRS? Can i not just use a magnetometer to create a compass for rotation readings?

A:

AHRS will yield roll, pitch and yaw values.  In your case, you would only need the yaw reading. 
You could use just the magnetometer for yaw or rotation headings, but I would not recommend it. This is because the magnetometer is susceptible to magnetic interference. If the sensor is mounted on a chassis nearby ferrous metal, this also could be a source of problem. In this case, you would have to cover it with a magnetic shielding material.  
For your information, there are algorithms like complementary filter, EKF and DCM that you could use to obtain the yaw value.
