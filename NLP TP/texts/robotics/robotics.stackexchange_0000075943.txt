A:

You need to source your environment before you try to use ROS.
source /opt/ros/YOUR_ROS_DISTRO/setup.bash or .zsh or.sh depending on your shell.

Also, when you try something within your workspace, you need to source the setup files in your devel folder, same logic as above:
source CURRENT_WORKING_WS/devel/setup.bash
