Q:

webpage to control a ros system

The goal is to build a webpage with 3 image topics[AKA web streams] and 2 client nodes(AKA inputs for the user accessing the webpage) of a ros system.

Is this even possible?
If yes, what exactly do i do? I have no experience in web stuff.

Thanks in advance

For industrial applications and HMIs, flexgui might be an option. It's ROS integrated and targeted specifically at industrial interfaces. The basic variant is also open-source: flexgui_industrial.

Not industrial. Just for a prototype for my project.

I have a ROS system with a couple of cameras, a mobile base & a robotic arm. I have 2 servers one for the base and one for the arm. I need to build a webpage/application which links to this ros system and must contain 3 web streams & 2 user inputs which link to the ros servers(aka ros-clients)
