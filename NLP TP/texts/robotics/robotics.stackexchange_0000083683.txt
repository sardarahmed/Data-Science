Q:

Using rqt_plot functionality with dictionary element in parameter

I've been trying to use rqt_plot functionality that involves dictionary but couldn't get it displayed. Obviously, something is not correct somewhere.
rostopic echo /gazebo/model_states

gives me something like below:
name: ['ground_plane', 'asphalt_plane', 'first_2015_trash_can']
pose: 
- 
position: 
  x: 0.0
  y: 0.0
  z: 0.0
orientation: 
  x: 0.0
  y: 0.0
  z: 0.0
  w: 1.0
- 
position: 
  x: 0.775434
  y: 2.97518
  z: 0.0
orientation: 
  x: 0.0
  y: 0.0
  z: 0.0
  w: 1.0
  - 
position: 
  x: 3.82387818665
  y: 3.40090985756
  z: 0.0500026991437
orientation: 
  x: 5.04793066057e-05
  y: -1.94916170948e-05
  z: -0.00420963773061
  w: 0.999991137972

What I'm interested in is the x-position of first_2015_trash_can i.e. one of the pose information of  the third object. I've tried to do
rqt_plot /gazebo/model_states/name:'first_2015_trash_can'/pose/position/x

but didn't succeed. I've also tried:
rqt_plot  /gazebo/model_states/name[2]:pose/position/x

but doesn't work either.
Any ideas what could go wrong?

A:

You were close but try something along the lines of
rqt_plot /gazebo/model_states/pose[2]/position/x

As far as I can tell, the name parameter tells you what position in the pose array to find the object that you want to examine so there's no need to use it with plotting. So, with my example we'd be looking at the x position of the first_2015_trash_can object. Also, note how I'm not using the :.

@jayess: Thanks a lot for the answer and explanation. But it still not working as the values for all elements give zero values. I guess there is a bug in the current rqt_plot. I have just upgraded the rqt_plot last week.
