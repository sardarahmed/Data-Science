Q:

ssc_interface published from autoware how to subscribe it from pacmod?

I followed this https://github.com/Autoware-AI/autoware.ai/issues/1944 but can not subscribe to the ssc_interface from pacmod.

A:

ssc_interface is designed to produce messages which are consumed by the Speed and Steering Controller (SSC) software from AutonomouStuff. This software then sends the commands to PACMod. There is currently no direct interface between Autoware.AI and PACMod but we'd be happy to have someone develop one! (at least until the end of the year, when we stop accepting new features for Autoware.AI).
