Q:

Installing ROS on Ubuntu 13.04

Are there any clear issues I should be aware of when installing ROS on Ubuntu 13.04 from source?  I followed the instructions but am having issues installing the packages, specifically the two following packages:
E: Unable to locate package python-rosdep
E: Unable to locate package python-wstool
Could someone please help?
Should I downgrade to 12.10?  Is that a better idea?

I know a couple of days ago I read a question where another user was having issues with 13.04 (http://answers.ros.org/question/62467/publisher-sleeping-forever/) -- Obviously, this won't help you in any way other than to let you know that others are experiencing problems..

A:

Only ROS Hydro supports Ubuntu Raring, and that is still in alpha test. What version of ROS are you trying to install?
