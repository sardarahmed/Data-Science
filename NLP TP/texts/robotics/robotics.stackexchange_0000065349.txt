Q:

TK1, ROS and Kinect V2

Hello all,
With the TK1 being a fairly well supported ROS platform, I was wondering how well the USB 3.0 port is supported?
Presumably, I would be using 14.04 and Indigo to get the ball rolling.
Specifically, how difficult should it be to get the Kinect V2 running on the TK1?
Austin might know about this.
Hopefully, we can get cheaper "starter" ROS platforms out there if this works.

A:

I believe with the new grinch kernel for L4T 21.2.1 you shouldnt have a problem with usb3.0. Here is a link where See3Cam (USB3.0) had some successes with the Jetson over USB 3.0, however in the link they are instructing to use L4T 19.3 which I read for most people did not work well. Also take a look on the elinux page for jetson for known usb 3.0 cameras to work. Whether you know or not, make sure you turn off the USB autosuspend feature (you dont have to worry about this if you use the grinch kernel for r21.2.1 because its disabled by default).
