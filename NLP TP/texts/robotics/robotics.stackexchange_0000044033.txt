Q:

how to get robot state vector from gazebo?

Hallo.
I've got teleoperating car-like robot model in Gazebo. Also I have hokuyo lidar on it. Is there any simple method to get robot state vector (pose and twist) in global (gazebo) coordinate system?
I need this for publishing odometry in simulation. I've several methods like laser_scan_matching or adding special p3d-controller, but cannot i use them cause my real robot does ot have lidar and uses another control principles.
Or I need to calculate wheel-odometry like i do on my real robot?

A:

You can do one of the following:

subscribe to gazebo's ~/link_states or ~/model_states,
use GazeboRosP3D plugin from gazebo_plugins or,
write your own plugin to get the specific information you need from your models / worlds.
