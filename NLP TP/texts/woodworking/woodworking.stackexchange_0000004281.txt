Q:

Making a stone sieve out of wood

I would love to make a stone sieve out of wood. The best thing I can think of is to take a piece of wood and drill lots of holes in it. And I would be putting siding on of coarse. What size holes should I use? What could I do to prevent clogging of the soil if any? And maybe somebody has a blue print or a different and better way of making something like this. 

A:

Here's one I made a few years ago from scraps. I believe this is what you're trying to make.

It's 2x4" for the main walls, with a 1/4" mesh grill acting as the actual sieve. The mesh is stapled to the 2x4's, and has a 1x2" furring piece underneath so that you don't catch your fingers on the metal.
The size of mine is 36" x 26" - I built it specifically to fit over the top of my big wheelbarrow. The sifted soil goes into the wheelbarrow, and the rocks and weeds get tipped into another wheelbarrow next to it. 
Not pretty, but functional. Just like me!
