Q:

Securing long boards for edge jointing

What strategies are there for clamping long boards to a workbench for hand planing their long edges? My bench doesn't have a leg vice but does have a tail vice and bench dogs. However, the bench dogs are thin and rectangular so it doesn't feel too secure.

The bench is an earlier version of this one. My dogs are rectangular and I only have 2. There is a dog hole in the tail vice but none in the face vice.
My bench is approx 5 1/2' x 3â€™ and the board I was trying to plane was about the same length as the bench.

Unfortunately, it doesn't look like your bench has any provision for a deadman.  This would allow you to clamp one end of the board in the face vise and support the other end with the deadman.  

I think you could make a passable one by bolting some T-track to the underside of your bench top, putting some hex-head lag bolts (to fit the T-track) in the end of a board, and drilling some holes for dowels into it.  This would be my preferred strategy in the long run.
Another strategy I'd suggest if you just want to get going today is to clamp a handscrew clamp to either end of the board (making sure they're flush with the opposite edge) and then clamp the handscrew clamps to the bench in whatever manner you're used to.
