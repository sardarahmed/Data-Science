Q:

White spots on ash wood

I'd just sanded down the lacquer from my guitar, which worked pretty well. After a control of the surface I saw some white rough spots as you can see in the following pictures:

As far as I know it's ash wood. The spots only appeared after longer sanding these areas. 
Now I have two questions:
1. What have I done wrong?
2. How can I remove these spots?
I looked at this question but it didn't really help me... Thanks for you help!

A:

It's hard to tell from just photos - the lighting and white balance can throw things off. This looks to me like you haven't fully removed the lacquer from most of the guitar, and those whitish spots are where you have finally gotten down to bare wood. Ash, like many woods when sanded, appears whiter than it actually is.
