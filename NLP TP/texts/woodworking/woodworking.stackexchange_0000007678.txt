Q:

Special switch or out of box failure?

I just bought my very first router, it's a DeWalt DW621 (it has a cord, no batteries). I plugged it in and pressed the on-switch, but I'm getting no response from the router. 
Did I forget to remove some safety pin, or is this likely an out of box failure?

A:

I'm not familiar with that specific router, but the instruction manual (page 9) indicates it has a lock-on/lock-off safety feature:

Lock-On/Lock-Off Switch (Fig. 7)
  The lock-on/lock-off 
  switch is located in the
  handle on the right side.
  The router is normally
  locked-off.
  To start the router, press
  the thumb lock and
  squeeze the trigger.
  To lock the switch on,
  squeeze the trigger,
  press the thumb lock
  forward and release the
  trigger. To turn the router
  off, release the switch. If the tool is locked-on, press the trigger
  again and release the switch.

Make sure you press that thumb lock switch when squeezing the trigger.
