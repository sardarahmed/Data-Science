Q:

How to make this setup to break down timber safer?

My dad has decided to turn this:

into this:

using this setup:

When I saw this, my eyes almost dropped out of their sockets.
I am an amateur, but I know that:

Your piece should be flat and stable.
Use riving knife for ripping.
Rip fence should be perfectly parallel with the saw disc.
The 'to keep' piece should be on the side of the fence.
When pushing the piece, apply pressure on the part that is between the saw disc and the fence.

I told my dad, that he has to stop, because his setup is very dangerous, but he reassured me that this is the way he did it the last 45 years and that he is using a 1.5 meter long push stick and not coming anywhere near the saw disc. I told him about kickback, but he said that it never happened to him.
Breaking down wood is something very removed from what I usually do. Hence seeing all the rules broken made me think that they perhaps apply to a different sport. Perhaps I am just overly protective.
Is this setup safe? If no, how can I make it safer?

A:

Taking a stab at "making it safer"
If you built a sled that held the log while it's pushed through the blade with handles that assured no body parts approached the blade it would be safer.
Keeping in mind that safety is not binary but a continuum.
Both of these images are sleds made for a bandsaw (as Graphus says in the comments a bandsaw is the preferred tool) but the idea is the same.

Here's a rig with a circular blade.

The sled holding the log is huge!
