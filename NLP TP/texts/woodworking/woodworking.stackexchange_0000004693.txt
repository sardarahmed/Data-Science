Q:

Setting up a new table saw blade

I just got a new table saw blade (Freud 50 tooth combination, thin kerf) to use on my portable / contractor saw (blade was almost half the price of the saw!). Is there anything in particular I should do to the saw or blade before I begin cutting? I figure I need to check the angle and make sure it's perpendicular to the table, but anything else? 

A:

No, if your previous blade is square then your new one will be too.  It's extremely unlikely for a blade to be bent, especially for a Freud, and even if it is, it'll be obvious as soon as it spins up the first time.
Of course, if your first blade wasn't square then your new blade won't be either, and a new blade is as good a time as any to square your saw :)
