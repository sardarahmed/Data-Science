Q:

What kind of a hand saw guide is being used in this video?

Image from Youtube
Go to about 1:30 in the video to see the saw guide.
I am helping my son build a pinewood derby car, and something like this would be helpful.

A:

I do not know the specific make of that guide but it is known as a hand mitre saw.
For example, from here:

(The one in that image appears to resemble a vintage Stanley mitre box, maybe a Stanley 358.)
There are other styles of mitre guides and boxes, too, the most familiar probably being the little plastic box with angled slots in the sides.
