Q:

How do I remove a liquid deglosser from my cabinet doors?

I put a liquid deglosser on about half of our kitchen cabinet doors, and now I realized what a mistake that was, and want to remove it. 
So far, the only effective means of getting it off have been a heat gun and scraper, but it's taking forever. 
Is there some trick that I can use to quickly and thoroughly get rid of the deglosser residue?

A:

You are now in the process of removing the old finish which is exactly what you were attempting to avoid by employing the liquid sander/deglosser..  
The manufacturers of the deglosser (note it is not deglazer, a product used for leather preparation) specify to use it for preparing a previously finished surface for refinishing with no need to remove any residue - apply deglosser, let it dry, apply new finish. The deglosser is intended to make the new finish better adhere to the old finish.  It's understandable how one would be confused, given that the brand that you selected also makes a liquid paint remover/stripper.
If I were in the same situation (i.e. half way through stripping with a heat gun) I would grit my teeth and finish stripping.  True, it's going take time, but you have a chance of completing the task with a uniform surface preparation and uniform application of finish for all of the cabinets.
