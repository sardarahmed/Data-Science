Q:

Good wooden handle to hung an axe?

I was grinding and sanding this wooden handle for a day or two lately and I nearly finished it, but I noticed, that I filed off a bit too much at the part, where the axe head goes on. I just took a picture, how does it look and I'm asking for experts now, is it still okay to make a slot for the wedge and it will be hung safe and properly?

A:

With some or most axe and hammer heads you have no choice but to make the top portion of the handle a loose fit at the upper edge because of the 3D shape of the eye. And actually what you have there is not too bad at all.
Rely on the wooden wedge1 and the metal wedge/wedges2 to spread the wood at the top to completely or nearly completely fill the space and create a 'dovetail' shape that will safely lock the head in place and prevent it coming off in use.
If you want to you can leave the handle projecting about 2-3mm (1/8" or so) above the axe head, the projecting wood there is able to spread slightly more than inside the eye and this will add a little extra security.

Is it OK to re-use an old iron wedge when handling an axe?

1 The wooden wedge goes back to front.
2 Metal wedges go diagonally or straight across. With 'ring wedges' just pound them straight in along the centreline.
