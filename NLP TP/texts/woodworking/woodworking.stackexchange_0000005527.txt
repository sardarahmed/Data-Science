Q:

Lumber Calculator

I know how many boards I need and their dimensions. Is there some sort of calculator that can tell me how many long boards to buy so that I lower the cost? For example, I need 2 60" 2x4's and I also need 2 20" 2x4's. You might just buy 2 96" boards and get your cut out of that but it might be cheaper to buy 1 16' 2x4 and get it all out of that. I'm looking for a calculator that has that kind of algorithm.

A:

The question is inherently too subjective for any single calculator. There are whole industries dedicated to this, and even then the software must be constantly amended, and customized to each company's specific use and needs. 
Longer material may be cheaper, but that depends heavily on the choice of material, and ability to source the species in those lengths.
Beyond that you must make transportation and tooling constraints. You may not be able to transport a 16' board at all, even if it would be cheaper.
The woodworking software industry is about as fragmented as any, and as a result there are a lot of optimization programs out there that vary across a very wide spectrum, and very rarely are the cheap or free ones very useful.
Even with this, a very high percentage still does things the old fashioned way, cut-listing by hand, or using Excel or some other generic program.
