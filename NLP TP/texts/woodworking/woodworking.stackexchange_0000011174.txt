Q:

Improving sag resistance of MDF shelves

Wood is all 19mm MDF except the back panel and the horizontal boards are wedged between the sides and held by 2 screws on each side. I want to reduce the chance of the shelves sagging over time.
How much weight should the current unimproved construction be able to hold?
I intend on storing all my power tools inside here, so no more than 10kg per shelf. In order to prevent the boards from bending over time the current plan is to stabilize them from below.
How would you stiffen the shelves without wasting too much space?

I know this construction isn't the best but the shelf won't be used for storing Olympic plates. Just a few screwdrivers and grinders etc.

On request I got my SLR + tripod and made some shots. The place is still in a bit of a mess though:

A:

As clarified in the Comments, the back panel is thick enough MDF that fastening in through from the back is viable and that alone will do quite a bit to resist any tendency towards sagging.
If you want to stiffen the shelves still further there are various established ways of doing this for plywood that could be adopted here, e.g. the below:

But the simplest option I can think of, which can be retrofitted to the unit without any need to disassemble, is just to add a central support. This can be full depth back to front, a ply, MDF or solid-wood panel slid into place. Or a single narrow board at the front, either tacked in place with some toenailed brads or held by a dab of glue. Note that you'll want to add a support underneath the bottom shelf as well.
