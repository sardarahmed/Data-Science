Q:

Need help identifying a set of Japanese bench chisels

I ran across an auction of a set of Japanese bench chisels, and there wasn't a lot of info provided (and yes I bid because I'm an easy mark), so I'm trying to gather some details from the photos. The only visible markings are stamped on the chisel itself, and I'm wondering if anyone knows anything about it or has suggestions on where to look for further details.
Here's a zoomed version of the stamped markings with some photo sharpening:

I've sent a note to the auction house for more photos of the storage box or any other identifying info, but I haven't heard back.
Thanks for taking a look!

Thanks to your Japanese Learning stack question, I was able to find the manufacturer. Nagahiro is the English translation according to Google.

Seems like a match to me; the seller site also seems to refer to is as Osahiro (Nagahiro). From what I can determine, Osahiro is the brand, but Nagahiro is the blacksmith and a well known one at that.
