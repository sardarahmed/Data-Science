Q:

How do I cut this corner joint?

I'm not sure what this joint is even called, but I saw it on a youtube.com video where the guy was showing old joinery that isn't used much any more. I'm including a rough drawing I did of what it look like.

As you can see, it's basically a butt joint, but there is a small piece on the edge where he's made a 45deg bevel. They come together to make it look really nice, but I don't know how I'd easily make that cut. He used a compound miter saw, but ours doesn't tilt. Dowels and glue are what hold it together.
Does anyone have an idea? Thanks.

A:

The "top" piece can be cut with 2 passes on a table saw.  One with piece upside down and the blade at 45 degrees, the other after flipping the piece over and setting the blade at 90.  The Side could be done with 2 passes as well if a dado blade is used.  Otherwise it would be 3 passes with the first having the board on edge and hopefully a tall feather board in place.
For the first two cuts pay attention to blade tilt, fence location and don't bind the final piece of wood between the fence and the blade.
Sorry, I do not have tools to show this in pictures.
Another option would be router blades and a router table.  There are bits to make a joint similar to this, which produces the same result.
Also note that the dowels may be overkill, especially if this results in any frame around the top.  They will surely be a pain to align.
