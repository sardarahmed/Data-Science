Q:

What is this plywood joining mechanism and hardware for knock-down furniture?

Just came across a plywood joint mechanism, which I found very interesting as new woodworker. Basically I don't know what it is called and can't find any in our local market. I am attaching the photos here:

Screw 1: This is the screw which goes inside the white bit

Screw 2: This screw is positioned perpendicular to Screw 1 through a hole.

Looks like this when Screw 1 is put inside

Now, could anybody tell me :-
1. What are the name of the screws.
2. What is the mechanism called.

A:

Cam bolt and cam screw connector. Very popular in european style cabinetry.
