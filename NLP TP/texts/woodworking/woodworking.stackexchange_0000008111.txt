Q:

Good joints for a feral cat house

I would like to build a few cat houses for local feral cats to help during the winter and protect them from coyotes. 
I was thinking of using about 1 inch hardwood plywood. What are some good joints to use that provides the best chances for the cat house standing up against a coyote? The cat house will have two levels which the upper level allow the cat to remain safely from jaws of the coyote. 
If there are any other suggestions I would love to hear those too.  Thanks.

A:

You could use 2x2 (actually 1.5 inch square) as an integral frame to join each plywood piece at right angles. With 2.5 inch screws it would be a strong structure.
Keep the entry holes small, and always have a back door available for the little guys. At each entry you could build a "rattle-trap" that makes a noise when the cats approach each door. It would rattle when the coyote approaches, thus waking the cats. Back door exit, remember?
