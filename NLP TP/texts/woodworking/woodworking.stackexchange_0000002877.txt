Q:

How can I create a wood-like pattern in white-painted furniture?

I have some furniture painted in white. I would now like to paint, on top of the current color, a wooden like pattern. Which technique can I use to achieve this?

A:

What you want is called a "wood graining tool":

The basic idea is to use a darker color stain on top of a lighter color.  You rock the tool back and forth to create the knot look of real wood grain.
This is commonly used to apply gel stain to a metal or fiberglass door to give a wood look, but can also be used in other situations.
There are tons of videos and instructions online to use the tool now that you know what its called.  It does take practice, but can give good results.
