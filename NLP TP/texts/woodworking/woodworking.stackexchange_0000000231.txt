Q:

In what situations would I use a belt sander versus a random orbit sander?

I own both a belt sander and random orbit sander.  I've found that as I've worked on improving my finishing technique, I will oftentimes go for the random orbit sander over any other sanding implements.
I am curious if the belt sander has a specific use for which it excels, to the point where it is a more efficient tool than a random orbit sander for the job?

A:

I like a belt sander when I need to really remove some material like paint for example, I think it cuts better. an Orbital I like for finer sanding it offers a lot more control.

A:

I usually use my belt sander for large surface where I need to remove a lot of material, such as an uneven biscuit joint.  To be honest, I also use it when my patience is running low and my orbital or 1/3 sheet sander is not fast enough...
Although, it's not really related to woodworking, I found a belt sander really useful to level an even sub-floor section when installing the flooring. (Such as sanding down an uneven joint between two plywood or OSB sheets.)

A:

I find myself using my belt sander less and less.  I really only use it when I need to remove a lot of material, whether that is a finish or if it is rough.  
I find that for years I only use it if I need 60 or 80 grit work done, or I have a very large area, like a table top where the belt sander will get the job done much faster. But even there, if I go down to 100 grit, after that I use my random orbit.  
I also find the orbit has a more control and I don't have to fight with it all the time.
