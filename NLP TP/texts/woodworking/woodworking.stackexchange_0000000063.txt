Q:

How can I prevent tearout of plywood when cutting it with a circular saw?

Note: This question was closed as a duplicate because plywood and veneer both have similar issues when being cut with a circular saw. Hopefully the answers in both questions can help out.
When using a circular saw, I often find that I rip up the bottom edge of a sheet of plywood after cutting it. Usually my blade is a good 1/2 inch lower than the bottom of the plywood and I use a 24-tooth blade. Should I switch to a blade with finer teeth? Or should I change the blade height?

A:

There are many ways to eliminate tearout in plywood. Some are simple techniques you can apply in specific situations, and others require additional materials or accessories.

Put the "good" side facing down.
If you are cutting through 2 or more pieces of plywood at the same time, layer them so the "good" sides are not facing the outside on the top or bottom. (Note that you should use a blade with fewer teeth and deeper gullets if you are cutting through a thick stack, otherwise your blade may bind or burn.)
Use a zero-clearance straightedge guide (aka "homemade track saw").
Tape over the cut line before making the cut.
Score the cutline with a utility knife before making a cut with the circular saw.
Make a very shallow scoring cut with the circular saw before making your through cut.
Use a very sharp blade with a high tooth count (e.g., 60 or more teeth for a 7-1/2" circular saw).
Put sacrificial pieces of material on the top or bottom of the piece of plywood along the cut line.
Cut to rough dimensions first, then clean up the cut on a table saw with a zero-clearance throat plate.

A:

Using a blade with finer teeth will help significantly, but you can also use a piece of masking tape over the cut line before you cut. Additionally, if you have a piece of sacrificial wood you can put underneath the cut, that would help prevent tearout as well.
