Q:

Why are there hole-less as well as holed sanding discs?

The 3M Cubitron 775L is sold in two varieties - with and without holes. The size, price, and grain being the same, why would anybody want a hole-less sanding disc?
These discs are specifically designed for random orbit sanders and not rotary tools.
An ode to the spiral-shaped hole pattern can be found in the description of both products.

A:

Many (most?) abrasive discs are sold in both unperforated and holed versions, see 1 (PDF), 2a and 2b.
The holes are obviously for dust extraction, but not everything these can be fitted to actually has any dust extraction (including the pads sold for chucking up in drills and for mounting to angle grinders) so it makes sense for those to use unperforated discs. In addition to the holes serving no purpose for any application that doesn't have through-the-pad dust extraction, in straight orbital sanding there's more potential for any edge of the sandpaper to catch and tear, especially when working on or near edges and corners of hard materials such as metals and stone.
Note: Cubitron II is unusual in that there are actually three disk types you can buy, the third being Xtract which is mesh based.
