Q:

Can I stain damp plywood

I managed to rescue some 3/8 interior grade birch plywood I had sitting outside from a surprise rain storm last night but not before it took some water. I had been planning on staining the pieces today.
Around here 12-18% emc is about normal. It is hard to tell if the wood is damp by feel because it is cool and humid today, but the edges exposed to the rain are at about 45%.
My question is: Do I care? The surface appears dry by look. Should I wait for this to all dry out another day or two or can I just go for staining it and trust it? I really want to get this done today.
Its a Minwax oil based stain, water seems to bead up on it while it's drying, so I guess has at least some sort of moisture trapping effect, could staining it while it's damp also affect the longevity? I plan on finishing it with helmsman spar urethane after staining.

A:

While waiting is better, yes, you can apply oil based finishes (as well as water based finishes) to wet wood. Some folks like to wet wood for applying water based stains for evenness of application. Finishes are a moisture barrier which slows the movement of moisture but will not 'trap' the moisture in the wood forever. Since you are discussing plywood, the issue of swelling and shrinking due to moisture is minimized as well due to the cross grain construction of plies. 
Folks use heat and increased air flow to aid drying as well. You can use even volatile solvents to slightly accelerate the evaporation of moisture. (Please use common sense and reasonable safety measures.)  
Having said that, I will note that the harder the finish, the more likely side effects like slight crazing or a few cracks due to shrinking/swelling. Also note, that wood stored outside will have a higher moisture content in any case than wood stored inside. Another issue, is make sure the wood is clean; dirt and gunk of all sorts will lead to heartache when trapped under a finish.
