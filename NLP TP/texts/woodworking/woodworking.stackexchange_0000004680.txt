Q:

How can I recreate this wine rack (ovular holes, proper angle, etc.)?

I have a tall, narrow alcove in my home where I would like to recreate a single "plank" of this wine rack (apologies for bad lighting, was in a dark restaurant):

I will very likely have a local woodworking shop tackle this, but I'm interested to know how the ovular holes in the outer plank were created, as well as how they ensured that the necks of the wine bottles went through the backing supports at the proper angle.  Is this something that should easy to recreate for any professional woodworking shop?  Are there similar plans available someplace?
Also, I know it is probably difficult to tell from this picture, but can anyone take an educated guess at what sort of wood the front planks are?

A:

My guess is the holes were created with a forstner bit. There are lots of ways you could do it, for example you could use a hole saw, but forstner bits in a drill press produce the cleanest holes.
Fortsner bits and hole saws are circular and produce circular holes, not oval (elliptical) holes, but your next observation provides the key to the mystery. The holes are angled. If you use a round bit to cut at an angle, it'll produce an elliptical hole in the wood it is cutting.
The work piece was likely held at an angle when being drilled. If the craftsman was using a drill press with a suitable width to reach the center hole, this would be pretty easy with an angled sled such as this one:

There are plenty of other examples of this jig. A Google image search for "angled drill press jig" turns up plenty of results, including commercial and shop built options.
I am not familiar with the practices of production wood shops, but from a technical point of view I would think most shops could handle this request, assuming they were willing to take on the project in the first place.
