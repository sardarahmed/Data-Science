Q:

Heat resistant finish for beech/oak trivets

I'm making some trivets (beech, oak) as christmass gifts and I'm not sure what finish to use - I'm not really too much concerned about trivet's finish damage - I'm more concerned about finish leaving some residue on hot pots - that would be pretty bad gift.
Trivets are made of beech and oak (probably red oak? - I'm in europe).
What I want from the finish:

to be reasonably durable
to withstant boiling water temperature i.e. 100 C (212 F) without leaving any stains on pots
I don't care about gloss/satin/whatever - those trivets should be more tools than decoration

My most used finishes for small items are:

boiled linseed oil + wax
boiled linseed oil + shellac
oil based polyurethane (this is what I think would be best)

I'm pretty sure wax is out of question - what about shellac or poly? Will they melt?
Also feel free to suggest other finishes you'd think would work.
(I know I can make test boards, and I may end up doing so anyway, but I want to know what you would use)
Edit - what about epoxy?

A:

Actually, in this case my recommendation would be to not put a finish on them, they will work just fine as is, both woods' can take a bit of punishment and still look good just a nice sanding job.
If you really want 'something' of a finish, I'd probably go with a oil finish, but you need to be careful there because many are nut oils, peanut/walnut etc. which can be dangerous for those with nut allergies.  Hot pots and pans could evaporate some of those bits and pieces into the air to be breathed in.
EDT: And it looks like BLO might not be a good candidate, according to the comments, it does not like heat, which can soften it up again (and make it sticky).
