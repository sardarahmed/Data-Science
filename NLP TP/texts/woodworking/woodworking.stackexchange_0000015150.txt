Q:

Is it safe to sand sharp edges off of this manufactured desk?

I bought this desk recently from Amazon. The edge of the desk is a little sharp for my liking so I'm thinking about buying a fine sandpaper (320 grit?) to sand it down a little.
Is this safe to do?  I asked chat gpt and it said it was safe just want a second opinion.

A:

I'm used to similar desks not having the fake wood right to the edge, but instead having a wood-ish colour curve, that also means the edge isn't harsh.  On the one I'm sitting at it's clearly that the plastic veneer on the edges is rather thick (about 1.5mm) and rounded to a nice smooth edge.  The one in your picture looks like it should be similar.

You might try to replicate that effect, but I'd try it on the back edge and corners first. Testing on the underneath edges is also an option although the underside may not   have the same finish as the more visible faces, so may feel different.
I'd also aim to take off the minimum material to just barely achieve what you're aiming for.  Some of these finishes can be very thin; they're the ones most likely to have an unpleasant edge.  To that end (if it didn't look unsightly tested at the back) I'd use a wooden sanding block with the sandpaper stuck to it, and do one stroke at a time along the entire length, aiming for a 45° angle and testing after each one.
Perhaps finish with a stroke or two at 22.5° and 67.5° to make it close to round.  It may just feel like a slight burr on the top, in which case start flatter than my previous suggestion.
Especially if it's more than just a slight burr, you might want to start with coarser sandpaper for the first few strokes.  I'd use either paint removal sandpaper or wet/dry silicon carbide paper, rather than basic glasspaper.  My stash of SiC paper is my goto choice for a lot of non-wood sanding; used wet it can provide a nice finish on metals and plastics.
