Q:

Stabilizer or hardener for handmade wooden canes

I have been using a wood hardener and so far that has been working. Should I be using a stabilizer instead?
More generally put: when fabricating a walking stick or walking cane what is the best product to use to stop the ends from splitting? A stabilizer or a hardener?

A:

If it is a walking stick* as apposed to a cane, one of the traditional ways of hardening the ends is with fire^. CA glue will also work to harden and stabilize the wood. As Graphus said a ferrule is excellent solution and can be decorative.
*A walking stick usually maintains the natural shape of the stick and in my view have the bark removed and may have branch nubs smoothed out and some what primitive looking.
^Heating the ends after initial shaping where some limited charing occurs witch can mostly be removed by sanding or carving.
