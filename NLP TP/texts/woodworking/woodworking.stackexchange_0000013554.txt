Q:

Does it make sense to own a #1 if I already have a good block plane?

I have a decent block plane (low angle, adjustable mouth, good quality all-around).

I just saw a Veritas #1 bevel-up smoother plane which seems to be similar in size and was thinking if it would make sense to buy one or not...

Can it do something that the other one can't? I can't tell...
Obviously there is some functional overlapping, I just don't want to have a... duplicate tool, so to speak.

A:

From what I see this is not really a "no. 1" but merely a block plane with a rear handle. The overall dimensions and width of the iron back this up, especially since they chose to offer this as a bevel-up bench plane1.
Given this is a Veritas plane — so, automatically hugely overpriced over here (although not in the leagues of L-N, but still) — I think it only makes sense to get one of these if:

For any reason you find a block plane so difficult to control that you're already seeking a plane of approximately that size that isn't a block plane.

You don't own a block plane already and you want to get one of these instead.

You want a bevel-up bench plane for a small child2.

You're a completist and have to own every plane in the range. (No judgement, it's your money.)

1 Which are really a solution in search of a problem.
2 And I would give a lot of additional thought into whether this is actually a good choice, given the proven track record of bevel-down planes with cap irons/chipbreakers.
