Q:

Follow pattern at an angle with router?

I'm currently building a set of templates for an Adirondack chair, and have come across a problem that will jump out once I start to use the patterns.
For the back of the chair, the rail needs to be cut at a 6Â° angle, so that it matches the angle that the rear of the chair is at. How would I set up the router so that I can get this angle correct? 
I'm trying to do as much with the router and patterns as I can, because if I use the band saw, I'd have a variance in the final cuts - I want to be as consistent as possible.

A:

Many (most?) adirondack chair designs have flat backs rather than curved backs, making the cuts for that back bar relatively simple since it is just a bevel cut across the edge of a straight board.
Since you mentioned wanting to use a router at an angle, you can get tilt bases for most compact/trim routers. Since you're only talking a few degrees, you could also make a slanted base for a larger router, but if you needed to tilt significantly (e.g., 30 or 45 degrees) the broader base of the larger router would interfere and you would need a much longer bit in order to make the same cut.
Here are a few additional options:

Table saw with the blade tilted
Router table with angled auxiliary tabletop
Jointer with fence tilted
Bandsaw with table tilted
Hand plane
