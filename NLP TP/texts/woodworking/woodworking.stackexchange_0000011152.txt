Q:

Is 1/8" plywood enough to prevent racking or do I need 1/4"?

I'm making a shelving unit from 3/4" plywood. The unit will be 6 feet high by 3 feet wide and I'm concerned about racking. I could use corner brackets on the back, but I was thinking it might look nicer if I backed the whole unit with plywood, providing a back and also the needed stability.
My question is: would 1/8" plywood provide enough stability, or do I really need 1/4"?

A:

Take a look at how backs are used to stiffen flat-pack furniture. It's often nominally 1/8th in. (usually) paperboard, as it only has to hold the fasteners to the back and resist those fasteners wallowing out.
Of course, enough racking force over time can work fasteners out, or wallow out the holes.
You'll notice that flat-pack construction also often has the backing drop into a rabbeted groove around the back. This provides an easy way to square things up as long as you know the backing is square, and it provides an edge for the backing to resist racking beyond the fasteners.
But 1/8 in. plywood will be sufficient in most cases. The assumption is that you would use panel nails or similar fasteners to help keep them from working themselves out.
