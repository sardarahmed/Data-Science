Q:

What wood for inexpensive door casing

I'm replacing the door casing for our old, small house and plan to do a simple craftsman style using boards, probably 1x3s, possibly 1x4s. I plan to paint them white.  
I have a table saw, router, and miter saw.
I did one door in our laundry room, using primed finger-jointed moulding, but was disappointed that I had to sand some of the boards because the primer wasn't smooth.  So, buying primed boards isn't important to me at all.
I'm thinking of just buying boards at Lowes or Home Depot, but I don't want to spend a fortune. So, I'm wondering what wood to use that won't be problematic in the future.  Does it really matter, other than having straight edges and no holes?  Is cheap pine OK, or perhaps whitewood?  
I don't really want to use MDF for a few reasons.

A:

"White wood" is not a specific species, rather it is whatever is available locally and inexpensive.  Typically it will be pine, doug fir, spruce, etc.  It should work fine.
If you're doing complex molding profiles you might consider using poplar.  It tends to work better, holds fine details well, and shows less grain through paint.
