Q:

Single glue-up for an end grain cutting board

I've got those wide and thick Maple boards that I'd like to use to make end grain cutting boards with end grain Walnut and Jarrah inlay. The main body will be made up of Maple. The normal process of creating an end grain cutting board that I've seen so far is done by:

ripping the board into strips.
gluing the faces together.
cross cutting to the target thickness
gluing the edges together. 

Is this process mandatory or cosmetic? Since the main body is made up of a single type of wood, can I just cross cut the board into strips with the thickness I am after and glue the faces together? My main target it to decorate it with an inlay while having the advantages of an end grain cutting board?

Well for that style of board it's mandatory for the cosmetics :-) 
Apart from allowing smaller offcuts to be used up, the standard board construction using small blocks of wood does have a structural reason: each glue joint make the board stronger.
But there's no technical reason you have to make an end-grain board exclusively out of little blocks, rather than longer pieces showing end grain. However, because end grain strips are inherently breakable across the grain you need to be concerned about their length and how they're aligned. And the final thickness of your cutting board is obviously a significant factor here too, a 25mm / 1" offcut from the end of a board is weak enough that it can easily be snapped in half using the fingers, while a 2" offcut from the same board would be much stronger. 

Since the main body is made up of a single type of wood, can I just cross cut the board into strips with the thickness I am after and glue the faces together? 

Definitive yes, with caveats. 
Using longer strips I think you have to stagger the joints (e.g. using 'running bond' pattern) for sufficient strength, as in these examples:
