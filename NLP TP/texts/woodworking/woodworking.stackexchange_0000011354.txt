Q:

Preventing poor groove geometry with plow plane?

I'm using a veritas small plow plane and I'm finding my grooves are a bit trapezoid shaped and not square to the reference face and edge:

Material is Sapele.  This is a longer piece (~48"). Some parts of the groove are better than others.  The ends seem particularly bad.
I suspect part of the issue may be taking too heavy a cut with the 1/4 cutter.  On the Veritas plow the 'wavy washer' doesn't seem to make contact with the outside of the blade to hold it against the bed, it seems to rely solely on the lever for that with the smaller cutters.  This seems to cause the cutter to cant a bit and go sideways.
I'm also going to try an auxiliary fence.
What else can I try to aid in my diagnosis?

A:

It's hard to tell from just the results, but I would suspect that this is a body mechanics issue, not a setup issue with the plane.  (If the issue was that the blade was slanted relative to the plane body and all else was correct you'd still cut a groove straight down, but the side of the cutter would start hitting the corner of the groove.)  Due to their narrow width plow planes are difficult to keep straight up and down.  This model in particular is known to be hard to control due to the short height.
Adding a larger auxiliary fence will help, but in many situations the size of the fence is limited because you still have to clamp the work.
I would suggest focusing on the basics of your body position.  Use a mirror in front of you to make sure your plane handle stays vertical.  Keep your wrist, elbow, and shoulder steady and move from your hips.  Keep your elbow in line with the plane.  Keep your index finger of your dominant hand out on the adjustment mechanisms, and your non-dominant hand on both the plane nose and the work piece (careful of splinters though).
