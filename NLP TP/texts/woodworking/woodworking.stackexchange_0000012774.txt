Q:

How do I disassemble this metal sliding-interlocking fastener on this chair?

I've recently got two lovely wooden chairs, and I wanted to disassemble them to fix their wobble issues and to revamp some dings that the wood in the wood.
I'm stuck on figuring out how to detach these flush interlocking metal joints that they used to join the four legs., and are the main cause of the wobble. It looks like a simple sliding mechanism with two parts that screw into two different pieces of wood, and one slides into the other (see pictures). I've tried sliding the inner part out but it seems to be locked and it doesn't bulge (and I don't want to apply too much pressure and split the wood). I can't see any locking mechanism.

Any ideas on how I can detach these two pieces of wood?
(if it makes any difference, it is a dutch-made chair)
Thanks in advance!

Thanks to everyone who replied! In the end, @Graphus was right. It turns out that sometimes all you need is some WD-40 and good old brute force. The fastener came loose after a bit of convincing with a hammer, and thankfully the wood was not split or damaged further. Success!
