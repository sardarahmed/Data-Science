Q:

How to cut a double rabbet joint (that looks like two stair steps) for tablet holder?

I am making a tablet holder. The tablet rests against a piece of plywood, and is surrounded on three sides by hardwood rails. The hard wood rails need to have a two step rabbet, one step for the plywood base, and another step for the tablet itself. .
In the first iteration of this build, I used a tablesaw to cut the rabbets. My tablesaw has a 3/8" gap around the blade (i.e. no zero clearance insert). Making two rabbets requires four cuts, and making the last cut was particularly difficult because there was not a lot of wood left to ride against the table top and fence.
I am redoing this project for another tablet. How should I go about cutting this stair step pattern? I have a router and a few rabbet bits (some with bearings). Is there a safer and easier way to make this with another tool?

A:

Generally when making small moldings you want to do most of the work with the molding still part of a large board.  They very last step should be ripping it off of the board.  That way you can reference the whole board when you're making the profile.
So in this case start with a 6"+ wide board, joint one edge, cut a rabbet by making one cut with the board on the table and one with it on edge against the fence, cut the second rabbet the same way, then rip off the width of the rail from the board.
