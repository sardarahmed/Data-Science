Q:

Stanley 9 1/4 block plane depth adjuster interferes with lateral adjuster

I recently purchased a used Stanley 9 1/4 block plane at a flea market. I am noticing that the depth adjustment knob interferes with the lateral adjust lever when it is above about halfway up its threads. This creates a "dead zone" in the depth adjustment where I can't achieve a certain depth adjusting the lever or stepping the blade forward a notch.

I'm guessing the problem is one of the following:

Lateral adjustment lever is bent
Depth adjust knob is wrong part (Mine measures 1.007" diameter)

Can anyone familiar with the 9 1/4 (or the similar 9 1/2) block plane help me figure out what's wrong? I don't want to start trying to bend the lever until I can confirm it is the issue.
Note that this is different from this question because the possible depth travel seems correct, I just can't use half the depth adjustment range because of interference with the lateral adjust lever.
UPDATE: Just for fun, here are some shavings it's taking now.

Maybe a plane expert can give you original dimensions, but it looks clear to me this is from the bend that lever would get the first time it fell off the bench to land on that end.
The depth adjustment knob looks right based on how it engages the blade depth lever. Even if it wasn't original I'd keep it as I can't imagine a different size working better.
I'll bet they changed the design in following years for exactly this vulnerability to the inevitable occasional fall off the bench (onto hopefully a wood floor :).
