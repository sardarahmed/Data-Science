Q:

Food Safe Finish for Cutting Board

I made an end grain cutting board for my wife that had various hard woods that were all supposedly food safe.  
Doing some reading and watching videos, I understand that this can vary depending on the type of wood and grain and such, or personal preference.  The woods chosen also have a contrast in various colors, from a lighter blonde look to a dark look.  From Walnut to to Cherry to Oak (I think, it was mostly scrap pieces and hard to remember).
What is a good finish that is food safe for a cutting board and for different colors of wood?  The design is random, not a specif detailed design.
How is this different than using beeswax?

A:

Mineral oil is a food safe finish for cutting boards. Though because it is not a drying oil meaning that it will not harden. It also means that the finish can be washed off. This results in proper care including regular reoiling of the cutting board. You don't get the sheen that you would get with beeswax though you do get a deeper penetration into the wood.
