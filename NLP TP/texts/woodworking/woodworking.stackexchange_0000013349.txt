Q:

Doweled miter joint vs doweled butt joint

I am going to be making a box to store full milk bottles outside.
I was going to make a frame using miter joints, as I have a miter saw. However, I didn't think the joint would be strong enough, so I planned to use dowels to strengthen them. But as I will be hiding the joints, is there any reason why I shouldn't use doweled butt joints instead as they are a touch easier to make.
Miter joints are stronger than butt joints apparently due to larger surface area for the glue, though some claim that the end grain causes the glue to be less effective. But if I'm using dowels, is there any benefit (other than aesthetic) to a doweled miter joint over doweled a butt joint?

A:

As far as I know, there really isn't much difference in strength in either case.  Aesthetics are the big decision.  Which, leaves the simplest is to just use screws (or nails) for the butt joints.
You can also go fancier, with the mitered joints you can then do cuts through the corners and glue in 'triangles' of a different wood which can be used as accents and still help strengthen the corners.

or less lining up than dowels is a spline like this
