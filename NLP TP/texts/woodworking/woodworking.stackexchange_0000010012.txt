Q:

Pocket Hole Butt Joint

I'm building a cart to hold my 60 lbs mitre saw. I'm using 3/4" Sande plywood. I plan on building the box using glued, pocket hole butt joints illustrated below. Keep in mind that I do plan on adding a shelf about 2/3 up from the bottom of the base.
My question is, which is the better design for the cart, given the weight that it will hold. Originally, I was planning on Option 2. However, every video and plan I can find for similar carts uses option 1. To me, option 2 puts less force on the joints themselves and takes advantage of plywood's great compression strength qualities. Whereas, option 1 puts a lot of shear force on the joints. Maybe it simply doesn't matter and that's why I'm only finding examples of option 1. Either way, I want to make sure there's nothing I'm missing anything in either design.

A:

Your initial thinking is correct.  You're much better loading the sides directly than transferring the load through a joint in a shearing manner.
The first method of construction is more typical in cabinetry because the load isn't usually directly on the top sheet, it is on a countertop that spans the sides.  This effectively transforms it into the situation in your second diagram, where the sides are directly loaded.  If you are going to have "point" loads on the top you want the top to be over the sides.
Similarly, if you plan to have a heavy load on the shelf in the middle you'd be better off setting it in dadoes in the sides than using pocket holes.  If this isn't an option then I'd use ledger boards over pocket holes or shelf pins.  Though if you're gluing it in addition to pocket holes it'll probably be fine up to at least 100 lbs.
