Q:

Should the smooth side or the rough side of a urethane bandsaw tire go against the wheel?

I am replacing bandsaw tires. I bought urethane replacement tires. There is a smooth side and a rough side. The manufacturers directions are clear on every step except for this point. The old tires have been on the bandsaw for AT LEAST 25 years and are made of rubber, those two differences make me leery of simply mirroring the current setup.
Does the smooth side or the rough side of the tire go against the bandsaw wheel?
If it matters the wheel is made of aluminum, the wheel itself has a crown, and the wheel has a lip on the edge to hold the tire on.

A:

I wrote to the manufacturer, they replied:

Either way will work.  However I install smooth side in to the wheel.
