Q:

Hand planing punky wood

I have some spalted punky wood blanks I'm turning into a stool seat. How do I stabilise it so it won't tear out during hand planing? It's to big for ca glue, if i use a wood hardener can I then plane it? 

A:

Minwax makes a hardener that will harden up punky wood to a point (your mileage may vary).  I've used it and am a fan, particularly for water damage on a house where the wood is typically pine or fir.

The other option would be to buy Cactus Juice and stabilize with vacuum.  They sell bags to handle odd/large sized wood, and of course, you would have to have some oven to set/cook the resin.  Google Cactus Juice for more information.
