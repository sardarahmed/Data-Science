Q:

Flower Press with 1/8" thick plywood

I am making classic flower presses with children.
We'll be sandwiching from top to bottom:  a plywood sheet, cardboard, paper, flowers, paper, cardboard, and a plywood sheet.
Each corner of the plywood will be bolted and tightened with wing nuts, to press the flowers for drying.
All the samples I see use at least 1/2" thick wood at the thinnest.  But it's pricey for a group of kids, and also heavy.  1/8" thick wood squares are easy to find and much less expensive.  But I'm worried they might crack.
Do you think 1/8" thick wood is strong enough for this type of application?
Thanks in advance!

A:

I'd suggest drilling more holes at regular intervals across the boards and adding clamping points. At least where I come from, flowers aren't all that big, and you can work around the holes. Also, get some fender washers to increase the actual clamping areas around the bolts.
You would make a wood/cardboard/cardboard/wood sandwich, then drill. Make sure you make index marks on all pieces so the the holes will line up properly when you go to clamp. Letting the kids try to assemble and clamp without paying attention to the indexing, then showing them how to arrange things and how easily it goes would also be a great, quick lesson in paying attention to detail.
