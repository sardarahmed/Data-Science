Q:

"Joint" or "Join": What is the name for the place where two pieces of wood are fastened together?

When speaking in my woodshop, I can't quite tell whether people are saying joint or join when referring to the place where two pieces of wood are glued (or nailed) together. I know the practice is known as joinery but in my use of the English language, joint seems more appropriate. Of course, it doesn't help that a jointer is a tool for a completely different thing.

A:

The Joiner* uses a jointer to joint ** smooth surfaces on pieces of wood, which he then joins together to make a joint. The practice of doing so is called joinery. 
Gotta love English!
hat tips to *ewm and **datUser for the additional confusion!

A:

Good question - given that wood working and the language we use to describe it are hundreds of years old, I will assume both words have been used interchangeably here and there. 
In my experience, I have heard it as a joint (being the noun describing two or more pieces of wood stuck together). I felt that I should consult a higher authority, so I went to Joseph Moxon's Mechanick Exercises or Doctrine of handy-works (1703), one of the earliest books on woodworking in English. Thanks to google, I could search the text. 
Moxon is consistent: join is a verb ("these two Pieces are with Glew commonly join'ed together", p.64) and joint is a noun ("...smear the Glew well upon the Joint of each piece you are to Glew together", p.105). I hope that helps.
