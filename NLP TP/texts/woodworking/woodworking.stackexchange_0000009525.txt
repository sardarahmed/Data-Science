Q:

Table saw cross cut on panel

I'm a beginner who wants to be safe here! 
I need to cut multiple boards (let's say 10" x 16") with a table saw. 
My first cut was going to make a 16" rip cut on my 4 foot plywood and then cross cut it to 10" pieces. Now it is evident I could use a sled, or the miter gage for that cut. The longer length is clearly too long to use the fence alone and risk kickback.
Let's now assume that I would like to rip/cross cut those 10" x 16" into roughly 10" x 8" boards. Could I use my fence only? Will it risk kickback? Since it is almost square, is there some kind of safety rule of thumb regarding the risk or absence of risk? I know the 10" edge can be firmly pressed against the fence and it will not rotate, but is it a bad practice?
What about if my previous board was 10" x 24" and I rip 8 inch or even 16 inch boards? 

A:

When you are cutting plywood on the tablesaw, the risk of kickback is proportional to the width/length. Width is the distance from the fence to the blade and length is the length of the work-piece that rides against the fence. I am comfortable cutting anything where the width is less than the length.
Minimize the risk of kickback when breaking down sheet goods. Structure your cuts so that you cut the short end of the rectangle first.
