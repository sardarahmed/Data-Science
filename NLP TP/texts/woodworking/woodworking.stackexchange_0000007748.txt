Q:

What type of hinge is this?

I have a hinge and I'm having a bear of a time replacing it.  It's from an old Bakers box and it's the cabinet/tray hinge and has a peculiar shape.  It hangs down a bit so the door is actually lower than the hinge and it can create a seal.  Here is a link to what the bakers box looks like:  pic of bakers box 
Here is a pic of the hinge.  It's about 1.5" across and .75" wide

Here is the side of the hinge

What is this hinge?  Any ideas where I can find a replacement?

A:

That looks like a "partial-wrap inset hinge". Places like Lee Valley have them.
