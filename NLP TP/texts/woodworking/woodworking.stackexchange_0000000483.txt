Q:

What is a good method for filling holes in wood to try and re-drill them?

I am making a toy car with nails for axles and plastic wheels. The block of wood had a thin, 1/4" groove in for setting the "axles" into for a car.  (about the kerf of a blade). Unfortunately, these grooves are too large for the nails and positioned perfectly for the wheels locations.
Is there an easy compound I can use, and then re-drill to fill the holes to make use of the block again?

A:

@bowlturner gives a good suggestion, but with pinewood derby cars (I'm assuming?) it's going to be really hard to get a dowel to sit well since the slot is at the edge of the wood. I'd probably dado a larger groove where the nail slot is (maybe 1/4 in deep and 1/4 in wide) and cut a piece of wood that size and glue it in. You could try wood filler, but I've had mixed results with that and it almost always looks lame when painted over. And, it will not be nearly as strong as a dado'd piece.
But, whether you use bowltuner's suggestion or mine, the recommendation is basically the same--hallow out the "defect" into a shape that's easily managed, cut a piece of wood that same shape, and fasten it with wood glue. 

A:

In this case I would tend to use a dowel, drill a bigger hole that matches the dowel and glue the dowel in, then recut or drill a hole for the axle.
If it is a long cut, then you could try a small 'wedge' to do the same thing.
