Q:

Bending Wood: is it easier to bend fast or slow growing ash

I want to bend ash for the stem of a canoe.  I am trying to select straight grained quarter-sawn pieces.  Should I select pieces which have faster or slower growing wood?

A:

What is ‘best’? Straightness and freedom from
knots have already been mentioned. Equally, if
not more important is the speed of growth of
the wood. The faster it is grown, the greater the
proportion of summer growth to winter growth.
It is the summer growth that is strong and that
will put up with being bent, while the winter
growth is relatively weak. Wood with say three
growth rings per inch will bend far more
successfully than wood with 10 rings per inch.
