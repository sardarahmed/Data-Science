Q:

Finishing California redwood for a bed frame?

I'm looking at what finish would be best for a redwood bed frame. I would like the wood to look natural, warmish color, and a bit of a satiny feel. I've done a few trials and here is where I stand (see pics):

polycrylic satin looks OK but dulls the details in the wood a bit (compared to others I tried) and I seem to be leaving streak marks
shellac looked better than poly but gets stained by water (experience on a diff project)
wax looked the best IMO, and felt the best but provide no protection (and redwood is quite soft)
Danish oil has a nice overall color but made some parts look grayish and other parts look blotchy (could be I haven't applied it correctly). 

Would you guys have any suggestions?

A:

I suggest the wax! I think it looks best, and it provides enough protection. Redwood used to be commonly used for outdoor building projects that would be exposed to water because it is durable - at least the heartwood is. 
Because this will be indoor, wax will be fine. You may want to re-apply in a couple of years, but in reality, this wood will endure with strength.
