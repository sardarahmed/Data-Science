Q:

How should I protect dyed wood from interior UV light?

I'm making a watch box that I will dye black with Tranfast wood dye. I'd like to follow up with clear glossy polyurethane. However, I don't know how to protect this finish because the dye's label warns of fading in UV light. 
Does the UV light from fluorescent bulbs degrade dyes? If so, will annual polyurethane coatings protect against this damage, or do I need something stronger?

A:

I don't need to worry about interior UV damage.
Soon after posting this question, I realized that CFL's have a coating inside the bulb that filters out the UV light produced from the argon/mercury energization. Plus, user Ashlar noted that none of his dyed furniture has significantly faded after hours in direct sunlight.
