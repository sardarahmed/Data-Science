Q:

What are the downsides of using Home Depot whitewood (spruce/pine/fir) for a sawhorse?

I would like to build a sawhorse and see Home Depot has those cheap “whitewood” 2x4’s. Would it be a bad idea to build a sawhorse with this wood?
Here’s the wood https://www.homedepot.com/p/2-in-x-4-in-x-8-ft-Prime-Stud-058449/312528776
They list the species as “Spruce/Pine/Fir.”

A:

The biggest downside is warped wood. However, if you select carefully (I've been known to paw through 1/2 a stack of lumber looking for straight 2x4s), you shouldn't have too much issue.
Remember, these are saw horses. They're designed for a rough life and to take all sorts of abuse, they're not designed to be fine furniture.
If you discover that they really didn't last as long as you'd like, well, they were really cheap to make, and you've got a nice bit of wood for the fire pit on the next crisp fall evening. And, you'll know that you need to get some better quality wood for your next set.
Or, you might discover that, for the price, they lasted long enough and you might make the next set exactly the same as this one.
