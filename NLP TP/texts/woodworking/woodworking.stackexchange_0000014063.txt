Q:

Will the center have enough support for my custom desk/table?

I'm trying to build my first large desk for my computer setup. My plan is to set a 74" Ã— 42" laminate counter top on top of four Alex drawers and I am concerned about the center of the table sagging or breaking without an apron for support. I drew a top down view of the table quickly and was wondering what I should add for support to strengthen the center if needed.
The countertop,
The drawers, The design
Most of the weight will be located near the top of the table with three monitors. Other than that I'm planning on having just a keyboard, mouse, and maybe some light nick-knacks scattered throughout.

A:

Laminate countertop material is very stiff. 46" is just over 1m and such spans are normal in many kitchen designs. After 1 year of use I expect laminate will deflect, but you will not notice (maybe 1-2mm).
If deflection can be seen after many months easy to install central leg same height as Alex drawers for support.
