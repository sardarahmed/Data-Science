Q:

Repurpose solid beech flooring

I potentially have a large amount of solid beech flooring 20mm thick, 85mm wide and various lengths. I'd like to repurpose some of it to make a work bench entirely from the beech.
I'm inexperienced in wood working generally, but want to experiment a bit, and would like to know if the following are possible/realistic:
1) Can I glue the slats together and make suitable strong table legs and other structural parts, e.g. 80x80x900.
2) If I then cut mortise/tenons in there, will they then be strong enough, or will the wood break up?
3) For the bench top I have considered either joining the slats horizontally with two layers to produce a 40mm thick top, or putting the slats on their side to produce an 80mm top.
4) If I can't find long enough pieces to make the table top, and instead make the top up using overlapping shorter pieces, will that make a strong enough table top?
Sorry if these are very basic questions.

A:

In general, modern wood glue is stronger than the wood it is gluing. With a good glue joint on long grain wood, you should expect no problems. A good glue joint is one where the parts mate well (in case of laminating several pieces together, they should be completely flat against each other, without any gaps), adequate glue is used (coat both parts to be glued) and adequate clamping pressure is applied (this is open for debate, but some sources say you'd need pretty high pressures for hardwood).
As for the table top, your main issue would be with joining shorter pieces together - you can just butt them together, as that would lead to a poor glue joint. You'd want to use a proper joint, either a long scarf joint or a finger joint. Finger joints are easily done on a router table with the right bit.
