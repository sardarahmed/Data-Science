Q:

Crib/cot construction safety norms

I was planning to build a bedside cot for a newborn and I was looking for some safety standard to follow. All I could find were places where these are sold (like https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/search-results/?q=716&standards=Standards and https://standardsdevelopment.bsigroup.com/projects/2017-02678).
The prices are a bit too much for an hobby project and probably there is a lot more information inside than I actually need. 
One piece of information I could find is this: https://www.childsafetyeurope.org/publications/info/product-safety-guide.pdf, which mentions some measurement for safety.
I was wondering if there is something simpler than the whole standard but more informative than the linked PDF for the hobbyist that won't sell but just build for himself. Also these are for the BS-EN-716 but I believe this has been updated in the 1031:2019.
UPDATE: I am from the UK, but to be honest even a US regulation would be fine as I just want to make it safe.

A:

Here is some details I found that are relevant:

The slats and corner posts of a crib should be no more than 2 3/8
inches apart. Wider spacing poses an entrapment danger.
Corner posts should be flush with the end panels (or no more than
1/16 inches higher).
In a safe crib, the hardware — bolts, screws, and the like — should
be firmly secured, with no sharp edges or rough areas and no spots
that can pinch or otherwise injure your baby. The crib's
wood should be free of cracks or splits. (And the entire crib —
sides, slats, and all — should be very sturdy with tight joints.)
For a natural nursery, stick to non-toxic paint with low or no
volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Any crib that has peeling or
cracked paint (even lead-free) should also be refinished.
Make sure the mattress fits snugly against the inside of the crib. To
ensure crib safety, try the two-finger test: If you can fit more than
two fingers — Mom's, not Dad's if he has big hands — between the
mattress and the crib, the mattress isn't a good fit. (The harder it
is for you to make the bed, the better for your baby.) Also, if the
mattress is new, pull off that plastic. Make sure, too, that the
mattress itself is firm.
