Q:

Adapting a 4-jaw drill chuck to hex shanks?

I'm a novice woodworker doing some basic projects. I recently acquired a drill press and a set of hole saws with hexagonal shanks.
The hole saws have a disturbing tendency to come loose from the drill press as I'm using them. I think the root of my problem is that my drill press has a 4-jaw chuck and so a secure grip on the hex shanks is not possible.
Is there a recommended technique for adapting hex shanks to a 4-jaw chuck? Some device I should buy?

A:

Drill presses usually have a standardized chuck connector, such as Morse Taper  (MT) or Jacobs Taper (JT). These are followed by a number to denote the size (MT2, JT3, etc.). You can take your existing chuck out of the drill press (typically using a small wedge driven into a slot above the chuck), verify the correct taper and purchase a replacement chuck with 3 jaws.
