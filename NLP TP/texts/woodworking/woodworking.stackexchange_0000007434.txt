Q:

Can a short tusked tenon be reinforced (with dowels)?

For a craftsman-style table, I'd like to shorten the stubs to refine the look of the table. 
Would driving one or two dowels (blue outline in image) across the tenon allow for a smaller, but equally strong, stub? I'm thinking that could increase the surface of grain that would need to fracture in order for the joint to fail.
If I inserted them along the wedge line, it could also provide a helpful guide when carving the mortise.
I haven't seen any furniture examples of this (yet).

(tenon shape is square, 1 1/8" x 1 1/8". wedge is 3/8" wide).
edit 
Missing detail: the grain in the tenon runs horizontal (topleft-to-bottomright in the photo), perpendicular to the tusk.

A:

Yes, you can absolutely do this. I did it in one project as you can see in the  second picture of this project.

It basically does what you said - increases fracture toughness of the small stub of a tusk tenon by:

increasing glued surface area, and
adding some cross-grain strength to a short section.
