Q:

How do you cut a 4x8 in half without a panel saw?

One challenge of working with sheet goods is doing a really wide cut, for example cutting a 4 x 8 sheet into two 4x4 sheets.
The problem I run into is that I can't reach across a 48" board or panel, so if I am using a rail saw, it is difficult and requires awkward things like climbing on top of the table. Of course, it is easy with a panel saw and frame that holds the board upright, but I do not have a panel saw system.

A:

I lay the sheet on top of a 4x8 piece of 2in pink foam insulation board and then just walk/crawl on top of it while pushing the saw along the track. Unless it's a really delicate material, I've never had any trouble. You could also lay a moving blanket and/or a thicker plank on top of where you crawl to spread out the load and avoid any scratches or damage.

A:

When I was in the trades we use various guides and rails and such to break down sheet goods. When you run out of arm when pushing the saw you just have to reposition yourself safely. What safely means is dependent on how many people are doing the cut and how comfortable you are with the saw.
In practice, what this amounted to is:

You stop the saw mid-cut and reposition yourself and then restart the saw (back it up a bit so it is free to spin up) and continue with the cut.
Have a second person take over from a safe position, restarting the saw in the same cut again.
I don't recommend this, but in some cases I observed people leave the saw free-running so they could reposition their reach and continue the cut. This was very common, actually.
But a stopped and restarted cut with most sheet goods is fine.
