Q:

Do I need to add natural stain before applying polyurethane for natural finish?

I have an unfinished desk and want to keep the natural color of the wood but I want to protect it with a clear polyurethane finish.
I am wondering if I need to (or is it preferable to) add a clear or natural stain beforehand? Is there any benefit to doing that or will applying the polyurethane by itself have the same result if I don't stain first?

A:

No.  The purpose of stain is to alter the color of the wood.  If you don't want to change the color of the wood you should not use stain.
Polyurethane by itself is a perfectly acceptable finish.
