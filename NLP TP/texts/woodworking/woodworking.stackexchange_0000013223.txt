Q:

How is a straight arbor retained and engaged on a drill press?

On something like a drill press, how is a straight shank arbor retained and engaged? I don't see a clear way that this is accomplished from photos.

I think it's meant to be held in a collet or tool holder for a milling machine. The shank is 1/2", which is a common size for an end mill. Here's a tool holder for a 1/2" end mill:

Note that the description for the arbor you linked to says "no drawbar." A drawbar is a mechanism for pulling a tool holder into a milling machine's spindle, so they're clearly speaking to a milling machine-using audience.
