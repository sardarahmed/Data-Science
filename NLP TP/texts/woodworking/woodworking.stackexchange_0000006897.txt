Q:

PVC duct for dust collection: Glue the pipe and fittings together, or will tape suffice?

I am currently installing PVC pipe to act as duct for my dust collector. There will be a central pipe down the length of my shop, with a few branches coming off for specific tools.
So far, I've hung some pipe and connected it together with PVC fittings. I had planned to get it all loosely fitted together, and then go back through and glue it together with PVC glue and primer. But as I've pushed a few fittings together, I started to question whether I need the glue. It occurs to me there are some advantages to leaving it only loosely connected. If I should ever have clog, it'll be a lot easier to unclog if I don't have to cut the pipe apart. Ditto if I ever want to add branches.
Do I really need to glue the PVC together? Can I get away with taping the joints, either with the aluminum foil tape used on HVAC systems, or the X-Treme Tape for Dust Joints sold by Rockler?
I'm using the thinner DWV pipe / ASTM D2729, if that matters. It's mostly 4" PVC, with one 3" run for some smaller tools.

A:

I've had a similar 4" PVC duct system with approx 50' of pipe, a large debris cyclone can, and three gated openings running for years without any glue.  The system is run by a 1.5 HP industrial two bag dust collector and it runs fine.  In fact when I tried to take a portion apart last year I had trouble getting the dry fitted elbows apart from the pipe.  I always intended to glue it together, but the next project kept me from getting around to it!
