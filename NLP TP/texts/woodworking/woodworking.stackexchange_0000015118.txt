Q:

What size jaws?

I have a Nova G3 chuck which by default comes with the 50 MM jaws. 50 MM is just a bit less than 2 inches but fully contracted will not fit into a 2" hole. I bought the 31 MM jaws and they will not expand enough to make contact in a 2" hole. Amazon says the JS-SP45 has an expanding grip of 2.04 to 2.83 even though 45 MM is 1.77". I read that as too big for a 2" hole. Anyone have the JS-SP45 and know what size holes it will fit into?  Thanks

A:

I really appreciate the input but the pretty thin packing ring may be beyond my skill level at this time and the hole indeed needs to be 2". I indeed have all my receipts and returned the 31 mm and 45 mm jaw sets and got the Nova 6019 35 mm jaws which worked just fine expanding into the 2" hole. I will also quit relying on Amazon's description of capabilities and alwasy refer to the Nova website where specifications are complete, accurate and most of all consistent.  Thanks guys!
