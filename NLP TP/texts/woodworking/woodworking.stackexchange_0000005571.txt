Q:

Finishing a narrow cavity

This is a continuation from my previous question on the log box I've been carving. Since then I've carved the handle (thanks for the advice!) and added a magnet closure system for my swivel lid (neodymium rings fastened in place with aluminum nails).
See the pictures below for a look.
I feel like I've got the exterior where I want it to be, but I'm having trouble finishing the cavity to a level where it's visually "clean." I've been working it mainly with hand tools and my Dremel. The interior cavity is roughly 4.25" deep and a about 3.25" across, which means the narrowness limits the work space. 
Will I have to spend an eternity sanding, or is there another way to work out the tool marks?

A:

This is probably going to be tough any way you cut it. I would suggest a combination of curved card scraper and something like these abrasive brushes, possibly mounted on a long or flex shaft to get into the cavity.
