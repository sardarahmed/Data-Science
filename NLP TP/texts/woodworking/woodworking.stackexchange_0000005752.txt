Q:

Spots on live edge after sanding

I have a slab of walnut with two live edges. After sanding down the live edges at 150 to remove bark and prep for finishing, I noticed these spots.

Did I over-sand somehow? Or are these some odd spots in the grain? Should I do anything specific with them or leave them be?

A:

What you're seeing I'm pretty sure is the inside layer of bark, called the "phloem", some of which is still glued (as it were), to the first layer of wood, the first layer of  cells of which are called the cambium layer.  If you keep sanding, the "rings" will seem to get wider, when in fact you are just abrading the phloem away.
