Q:

How do I cut a circle with "stepped" edge in a countertop?

How do I cut out a circle  in exsisting wooden counter top and use the cut out piece as a lid (flush) so it doesnt fall through? e.g. a "stepped edge? Obviously I am not using the correct terminologly, hopefully someone knows what I am trying to say. Thanks in advance to all replies, much appreciate

A:

You can't do exactly what you want.  The problem is that however you cut round the lid, there will be some thickness which you turn into sawdust (the kerf).  If we ignore the difficulty of cutting a stepped edge, it will end up like:

where the solid lines represent the edge of the hole, and the dotted lines the kerf.  The horizontal kerf will cause the lid to drop - so it won't be flush, and the vertical kerf will cause the lid to slip from side to side.
What you could do, is to cut a cylindrical hole (either with a jig saw, or with a large hole saw), line the hole with a contrasting material (aluminium, stainless steel, a contrasting wood, rubber, etc), and fit a lip under the worktop so that the lid fits snugly into the hole.
Alternatively, as Graphus suggests in a comment, use a different piece of wood to make the lid.
Either way, you will need to put a handle in the lid.
