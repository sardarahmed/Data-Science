Q:

What is a commonly available wood that will be strong enough for this thin piece?

I am trying to make a center console for my car.  The piece in question looks like this:

You can see that one side of the smaller cupholder hole was broken just by the activity of handling the piece and using the hole saw.  This is 3/8" OSB and I would really like something half the thickness.  What kind of wood could I buy that could make this piece, be ~5mm thick, and be reasonably strong?

A:

Plywood, particularly high-grade plywood, will be a lot stronger than OSB.
But as Graphus said, you are stretching what wood will do.
Cutting the hole first, then cutting the straight edge (very, very, carefully - perhaps with a router) will certainly help (hole saws are not really precision tools and will often exert pressure on the side of the hole).
Mixing a very fluid epoxy mix, and then getting it to soak into the area which will be very thin when you have cut the edge will help (build a suitable dam with plasticine or similar to give it a good chance to soak in).
Finally, does this breakage actually matter?  I presume the cupholder has a metal rim which will cover the broken wood.
