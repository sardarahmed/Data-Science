Q:

Can I use polycarbonate sheets in a candle holder?

I'm making a candle holder out of wood (yes, that's the tenuous link to this forum; I cannot find an answer anywhere else!) and I would like to know if it's feasible to use polycarbonate sheets instead of glass.  I'd ideally like to use glass, but it's damn near impossible here in the UK to buy the stuff:  the big DIY stores don't do and the online places charge a fortune for delivery.
My main concerns, in order of importance are:

Will the polycarbonate sheets catch alight and burn my house down?
If they don't spontaneously combust, will they deform or 'white-over' with time?

My research has shown that polycarbonate has a fire rating of 1, which means it can be used in schools and hospitals, so I'm assume that item 1. will not happen.  But I'm guessing that if the sheets are close to the candle flame, that item 2. will happen over time.
Has anyone any experience using polycarbonate near naked flames?

A:

Buy glass from your local picture framer.
