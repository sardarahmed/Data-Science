Q:

What are some techniques for jointing boards using a router table?

I've seen suggestions to us a router to joint edges of boards, and some answers here that mention it, but I don't seem to be able to get the necessary precision using a router and table.
I've tried using a router table and a unified fence, also with a split fence. Both did well for getting a nice right angle, but perfect straightness seemed just beyond my reach. Pushing the edges together revealed gaps where the glue is supposed to go.
What are some good ways to pull this off? How do I adjust the bit and split fence geometry to get a nice, glue-ready edge?

A:

You can do this using a router table and split fence if the left side is adjusted forward to precisely match the exposure of the router bit. The idea is to provide outfeed support exactly corresponding to the material removed, just like on a jointer, and similar methodology can be used.
The same can be be done using a single-piece fence too simply by clamping on or applying some material (which can even be tape, in one or two layers, for the ghetto version) to the left side of the fence as described in Make your router think it's a jointer on the Wood Magazine site. I think it's worth noting that this probably under-sells the ease of setup and you will need to run a couple of test pieces to really dial in the accuracy, as covered in the WWGOA's article Edge Joint on a Router Table.
But the method that I think is best overall matches the functionality of the following jig:

It's not immediately obvious what the advantage of this setup is, but in addition to ensuring a dead-straight result it doesn't rely on the edge already being very straight. If necessary this could even be used to straighten a live/waney edge (in multiple passes!) if for some reason you can't saw the uneven edge off beforehand.
