Q:

outdoor preservative

A neighbor has outdoor sculpture (an owl) carved from a tree trunk left at just the right height for the purpose when the tree was felled. It's several years old and well maintained. It's time to apply a next coat of preservative. We don't know what preservative  was used last time.
Recommendations, please.

Thanks to @Graphus (see comments) I found my answer on this site at Ideal outdoor preservative for a wooden ornament
Answering here so the question comes off the unanswered queue and no longer attracts attention.
