Fixing cedar pocket hole failure

I built a cedar above ground planter last summer for my mother-in-law, and one of the sides didn’t hold well. I used pocket screws to secure the sides to the posts - but one broke out (pic below)...
To fix this, I was considering filling the void with some sort of adhesive and then simply placing the board back into place. Once the adhesive cures, it would be nice and solid. But I’m not sure what would work well(if at all). 
What type of adhesive would work for that? Or is there a different approach that would work better?

Use something like Loctite Marine Epoxy applied the way you described but also apply to the butt of the board.
My guess as to why the pocket hole failed, it appears the setup for the guide set the exit points too close to the edge of the butt on the side board and not at the butt's C/L.
