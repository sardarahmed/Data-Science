Q:

What is the difference in thin kerf and 'regular' saw blades?

A ten inch carbide tipped standard blade creates a lot of dust and takes away more wood (needlessly). If think thin kerf blades solve both issues, why not use them as standard? What's the difference between the two?

A:

Yes, a thin kerf blade will create less sawdust and leave more wood on the piece being cut. This is advantageous for lower powered saws, but unless you're making a lot of cuts in a single piece of wood the kerf width won't save you much wood.
The benefit of regular or full kerf blades is that they are stiffer, allowing for smoother cut (as they deflect and vibrate less while spinning and while cutting into the wood).
How much does that matter? I don't know, but I'll bet that differences between specific saw blades play a much larger role than whether or not they are thin or full kerf.
