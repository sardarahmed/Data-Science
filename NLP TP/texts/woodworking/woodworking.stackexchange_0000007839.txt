Q:

Antique Dowel Maker?

I picked this up at a local 2nd hand store. It is 20"x2"x1/2", cast iron. The holes go from 1/8" to 3/4" diameter. Years ago, I helped a friend put a post & beam addition on his home. All Dovetail, scarf joints, etc., with homemade oak dowels. He made the dowels by taking split square pieces of seasoned oak and pounding them thru a large hole in a thick piece of metal he had made, shaving off the outer edges. He had holes decreasing in diameter until it was the 3/4" he wanted. This looks like the same idea. But starting at 3/4" and possibly ending at 1/8", or whichever size was desired. Is this what I think or am I off base?

I added a profile shot to show it's thickness, this looks like old cast iron, I see no marks to identify the manufacturer, is this common to not have a manufacturer on the cast? Is there a way to figure out hold old this is? When did they stop making these out of cast iron?
Thanks for all of your feedback.

A:

It is called a dowel plate, and several manufacturers sell them nowadays - e.g., Lie-Nielsen. You could also make your own, which might be what you have there. You are spot on with the usage - pound a piece of square stock through the holes in decreasing diameter until your dowel is the size you want.
