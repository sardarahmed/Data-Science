Q:

Using a sheet sander vs hand sanding

I have just made a picture frame that is 30" x 9" and 2.5" from the inside of the frame to the outside. 
I was just given a sheet sander and I am looking to sand the frame so it has a smooth finish but I am hesitant on using the sheet sander as I have never used one before. Would it be worth while to use the sheet sander in this case or would hand sanding be a better option? I do have a wide selection of sand paper available to me: 150, 220, 320, 400 grit
I am not looking to remove a lot of material and that's another reason I am hesitant on using the sheet sander as I have the notion that "power tools = a lot of material removal", is this the case or not? As I am a beginner into wood working any advice or tips would be very much appreciated on how to properly sand the frame! 

A:

A sheet sander is often referred to as a Finishing Sander - this is due to the small amount of material that it will remove compared to (for example) a random orbital sander.
You could certainly use this for the flat areas of the picture frame with no risk as it will take a long time (relatively) to remove material.
However, picture frames are often shaped such that there is not much "flat" surface area - if that is the case then you are probably better hand sanding.
Personally, for that size frame I would probably hand sand.  If you are not familiar with sanding it would probably be a good idea to have a quick read up on it - most important is making sure you sand with-the-grain, particularly going into the corners. Depending on the state on the state of frame currently I would run through 120, 240, 300 grits, making sure you have completely eliminated the scratch marks from the previous grit level before progressing to higher grits.
If it is a completely flat picture frame, then there is probably no harm in using the finishing sander once you get to the higher grits.
