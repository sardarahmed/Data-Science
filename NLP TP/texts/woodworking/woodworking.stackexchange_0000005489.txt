How to deal with signs of woodworm in "live edge" wooden slab

I'm building a "live edge" shelf/table, and after I removed the bark, there are several exposed woodworm burrows right under the bark. They are quite deep (3-6mm), so I don't want remove all that wood.
I'm not sure what's the best way to deal with that: leave it as-is, or fill with something (with what?) and sand flush?.   
The finish will be a stain + oil/varnish.

A:

You can leave them for character or fill them as you prefer, it's entirely up to you.
If you want to fill I'd suggest filled/tinted epoxy as it's cheap and easy to do and can be customised to suit. See Large hole filler products, what is available for more info.
Note if you have the least worries about the insects still being active then you should treat the wood with a proprietary insecticide made for this purpose.
