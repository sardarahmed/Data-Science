Q:

What are the specifications for "Morse Taper" sizes?

I'm not sure what Morse Taper size my lathe centers use: MT#1, MT#2 or MT#3.  Does anyone have a description of what the sizes are (lengths, diameters, etc) for the different MT sizes?

The information you seek can be found here.
I've pasted a screenshot below for completeness.
