Q:

Chop saw not square after alignment

I just got a new jointer and after aligning it I took a piece of white oak flooring and face planed then edge planed and the faces were nicely square with the edges but the ends were not. So I went over to the chop saw and took my nice edge against the fence and cut the ends and noticed the edge to end was slightly askew.
So I took my square and placed it against the fence and checked the blade and it was indeed slightly askew. I loosened the angle bracket and adjusted it until the 0 degree detent was exactly square against the blade and tightened back down.

I took another piece of the flooring and chopped off one end and it was perfectly square with the edge.

I flipped the board 180° and chopped off the other end. It also was perfectly square with the same edge.

So now I have two 90° angles from that one edge.
I butted one of the 90° ends against the fence and cut the other edge which should be parallel to the other but it is not. In fact, it is skewed quite a bit and I can't understand how this is happening.

A:

The square I was using as reference was not square. I measured it at 87.6º which would account for the inaccuracy. I found it by using the square against three other framing squares and they were all off. Then I looked at what I was using as three could not all be off the same amount!
