Q:

Styling dovetail box - tails or pins on front side

I am building a box to hold some of my router bits and will use dovetail joints for the vertical sides. I am not sure what to put in front, the tails or the pins.
Aside from mechanical considerations, what are the styling considerations?
So: Tails in front or pins in front?

A:

If it's just an aesthetic decision, it comes down to what you think looks better. For my money, pins are more visually interesting than tails, so I'd face the pins forward (meaning tails are cut into the front and back, pins are cut into the sides).
