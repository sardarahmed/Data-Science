Q:

Sanding/filing small patterns at an angle

I've got small patterns cut out, about 5cmx5cm, from 12mm ply wood and glued together to form 24mm thick pieces.
I need to file down the sides to get closer to the pattern (that I drew on the pieces) as well as having the sides at about 10 degrees tapered. (I'm building a mould and the 10 degrees is the release angle).
My question, as a lazy hobbyist, is, how do I sand down the edge of the ply wood at 10 degrees off square?
(I have a flat hand file, sand paper, mouse sander, table mounted disk sanding machine)
Thank you in advance...

A:

On your table mounted disk sanding machine; build top on the table sloped at 10 degrees.
This only works on convex forms.
For concave parts us a piece of wood at 10 degrees to aim your file.
