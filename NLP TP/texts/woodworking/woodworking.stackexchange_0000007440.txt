Q:

How can I evenly distribute small boards of lumber to make a bigger board?

I'm not the best mathematician, so I want to run this by real woodworkers:
I need a board of red oak 29 5/8"W x 16'L to make a cabinet top and then stain it.  
This is what I'm thinking to make the wood look evenly distributed...
If 1x4 is really 3 1/2"W then 7 * 3.5 = 24 1/2"W - which is acceptable for what I am doing.  
So I need 7 1x4x16, correct?
What bothers me is having to butt joint & glue 7 boards of expensive wood hoping it all comes out flush and level.
Is there a better way?
EDIT:
I made a typo..."I need a board of red oak 29 5/8"W x 16'L"  should have read, "I need a board of red oak 24 5/8"W x 16'L"
Clarification:
The final length is 159 15/16", but local lumbar yard only sells 16' boards.  Hence, I plan to glue-up the 16' boards and then cut to size. 

A:

Edge gluing is a very popular way to get big panels without needing very wide lumber (which usually comes at a premium price). Your calculations are correct, in that you will need 7 1x4 boards to achieve a 24 1/2" wide panel. You'd need 8 and some extra to get the full 29 5/8".
One option to reduce the number of glue joints you'll need is to use wider boards to start with. 1x6s and 1x8s are usually readily available at the big home centers as well as some hardwood dealers, and would reduce the number of glue joints to 3 or 4.
Another option - and probably something I'd recommend whatever you go with - is to practice on some cheaper boards. Pine is a cheap way to practice glue ups, and that will give you the confidence to proceed with oak. You can take one piece of pine and cut it to 1-2 foot lengths and do a practice glue-up with those. If you really are planning a 16 foot long tabletop (and that wasn't a typo!), you may want to do at least 1 full-length practice glue-up as that long of a joint could present some logistical challenges.
