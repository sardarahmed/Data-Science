Q:

Is gluing a long butt joint risky?

I want to attach two 5'6" red oak boards together as part of a table, both 3" x 0.75" at a 90 degree angle, like this:

I was planning on gluing them and adding some pocket screws on the inside, since it'll be hidden.
I'm not sure if this will cause problems in the long run if the boards expand or contract. I'm also not sure if the pocket screws help at all, or if they're redundant as long as I clamp it enough.

A:

The top board will expand left to right, but not significantly in the relatively small area of the glue joint itself. The bottom board will expand up and down, but not significantly in thickness.
You can do the joint purely with glue if you desire - joints were glued only for a long time. Screws can be added but aren't necessary. Think of them as additional clamps for while the glue sets up. The only difference is that you don't remove them when the glue has dried. If you expect a large amount of stress on this particular joint, for example, you expect someone or something to be pushing against that bottom board with notable pressure, then some screws would provide extra confidence that the joint won't come apart.
