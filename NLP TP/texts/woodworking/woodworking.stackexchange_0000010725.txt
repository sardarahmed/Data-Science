Warped Monkeypod Desktop

I purchased this monkeypod piece a couple weeks ago. It is 7.5 ft x 2.5 ft x 2 inches thick. It is composed of two pieces glued together. My plan was to use it as a desktop but Iâ€™ve noticed since I purchased it, one end has warped slightly. This makes it very difficult to put legs on the way that I planned. Before I finish the tabletop or continue with putting legs on, is there any way to flatten this out? In the pictures below, the wood is sitting on my old ikea desk I am replacing.

A:

It's hard for me to tell by the picture, but it looks to me like it's not so much warped wood as the splined joint between the component planks isn't true. 
If that's the case, you might rip that joint out, ensure that the edges are square, and re-join the planks into a truly flat panel. I think I'd try that before planing the whole thing down thinner to make up for a botched panel joint.
