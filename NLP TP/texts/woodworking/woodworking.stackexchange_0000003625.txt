Q:

Can I cut homemade plywood on a bandsaw?

Hey guys so this might be a stupid question but I am just a beginner, but can I cut wood veneer on a band saw.
I glued 5 sheets of wood veneer together to make it thicker and stronger, but it alternates in wood grain direction and in veneer type. I used paperback veneer and 2 ply veneer together. I used a vacuum compressor to keep them flat while they dried. Now I need to cut them into smaller pieces, I'm fairly sure it would be fine to use a band saw, right?
Also I've made 3 large pieces of veneers but one of them came out a bit warped for some reason, is there a way to flatten it even after it's been glued up and thick?

A:

A band saw is fine.  I would recommend that you avoid low tooth counts such as 3 tpi (teeth per inch)  and opt for a smaller/denser tooth blade.  Don't get to aggressive, instead feed it through slowly to get a cleaner cut line. 
In gluing up veneer always keep things symmetrical front to back (including thicknesses of the layers), alternating directions and always provide an odd count of layers (the paper layer does not count). 
Unfortunately if you have laminated the layers and the result is warped, I believe the warp will be permanent.  How much you can correct the warp will depend on how much it is deformed and how thick it is. You may be able to flatten it a bit if you glue it down to a frame that provides a flat surface.
