Q:

Why are keyed drill chucks still available for modern tools?

Barring support for older tools why are keyed chucks still manufactured? Hopefully not just in my own ignorance but I view keyless chucks as just a useful equivalent without being tethered to the need for a key. 
A recent question I asked had a link to http://www.jacobschuck.com/ which hosts this image on their main page:

They both look beautifully manufactured but why bother getting a keyed chuck? Is it a matter of what the tool supports? Seems unlikely, to me, since I would have expected both chucks to be similar in design, in that respect, to be attachable to the same tools.
Either save me from my ignorance or enlighten me as to what I am missing by favoring keyless?

A:

Keyed chucks still get a better grip on any bit. I'm willing to use keyless on my portable drill -- though mine will take a key too, and there are times when I use it. I wouldn't trust keyless on a drill press.

A:

As @keshlam pointed out.  My drill presses both have keyed chucks and it allows much greater torque to put a stronger clamp on the bit.
This is really important for larger bits when you get over 1 1/2" say for keyhole saws or large Forstner bits.  There can be a lot of resistance and I don't think most keyless chucks can do the job.  Even there I've had a keyhole come loose.

A:

Self-tightening keyless chuck have similar clamping capabilities as keyed chucks, but the price premium on those types of chucks are significant. 
For example from the Jacobs site linked, the cheapest 1/2inch self-tightening keyless chucks are $185.
Other than cost, one disadvantage of the keyless self-tightening chucks is that after some extreme high torque drilling, you might need a wrench to unscrew the chuck.
