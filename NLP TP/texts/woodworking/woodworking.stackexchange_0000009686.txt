Q:

Problem with different tins of the same stain

My first time working with stains and I've run into a bit of an issue. I am using timber protect oil based stains in Walnut colour on pine plywood and I misjudged my coverage area with my initial purchase and had to go back for a second tin.
Problem is that despite buying the same product the result between the two finishes is very different (see the pictures below). After opening the second can I realised the first can was too thick to be normal. I went ahead with finishing the stain hoping things would be ok but they have turned out very differently.
How can I fix this so that the colours match? Ideally I would like to match to the second can as it looks better.

Here's what I did
It's been cold and wet here so it was a while before I could get back to finish this. Here is what I ended up doing.

Added a second coat to the lighter sections. 

This was closer but still not identical.

Heavily sanded the darker section once fully dried. 

Allowing it to dry prevented it from gumming up the sandpaper.
This removed the darkest parts but also made it patchy.

Lightly sanded the entire piece. 

This was to give a unified starting point for the next step.

Applied another coat to the entire piece.

Carefully followed the instructions for this step.
Brought entire piece closer to the original darker colour.

Applied a matte clear coat.

Further unified the colour and finish of the piece.
Provided a protective finish.

The end result was still noticeable but not so bad that I can't live with it.
