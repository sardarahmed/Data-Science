Q:

How to make this curved chamfer?

This is about 20 to 30 degrees from the plane.
Can I make this without a CNC ?
I can't find a router bit with this kind of angle, and a bearing at the end.

A:

Make a template of the curve for the top of the board, then insert a templating collar in your router base plate.
The collar will follow the template and you can use any bit you'd like sticking through it to cut a round over, chamfer, ogee, or other profile you'd like.
