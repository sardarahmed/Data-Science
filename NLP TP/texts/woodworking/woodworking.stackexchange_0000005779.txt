Q:

Can you hook up two shop-vacs in parallel to increase airflow through a dust collection system?

I have a PVC dust collection system comprised of 3" piping through my shop. It works pretty well, except I would benefit from a bit more airflow. I have two shop vacs, one of which is pretty much dedicated to this task, the other is just a miscellaneous use one.
If I hook them up to the same outlet on the pipe, can I increase the airflow through the pipe? The pipe will support it (by my calculations) but I am not sure if it is effective by having the two vacs.
I also don't want to stress the motors or cause the fuse to blow continuously, so this is not a 'try it and see' scenario.
Thanks!

A:

This could work, but you would want them setup to run in parallel, and not in series I would think. For example at the end of your ductwork, you have a Y that splits right into the two vacuums. My guess is the stronger vacuum will end up with the majority of your dust. 
However if you set this up with a cyclone, you can still centralize all of the dust collection into a single bin, and still utilize the suction of two vacuums.
The biggest issue I can see happening is if you ever get a blockage, or accidentally close all of your gates, the vacuums will in essence be fighting each other in the closed system, and the weaker one will blow.
