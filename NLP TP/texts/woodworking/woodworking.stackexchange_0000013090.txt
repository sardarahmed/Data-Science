Removal of swan neck drawer handles

I'm restoring a pine table. The two drawers have old drop down swan neck handles which I want to remove in order to properly sand and then varnish the drawers. I've taken the bolts off the two screws on the inside of the drawer - but I can't unscrew the screws as the handle, which hangs between them both, prevents either screw from turning.  I think I'm missing something obvious but can't work it out! How do you remove a swan neck drawer handle?
Thanks in hope!

A:

It seems that the handles are stuck to the finish on the front of the drawers.
They could have been installed before the finish cured or just the force from being tightly attached has somewhat bonded the pulls to the finished surface of the drawer fronts. Years of furniture polish and residue, etc. could play a part in this too, I'd imagine.
You might need to tap the bolts toward the front of the drawer to get the hardware to release from the finish or pry on the pulls a little bit to separate them from the drawer fronts.
