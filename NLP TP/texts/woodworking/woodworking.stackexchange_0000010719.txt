Q:

Design: how to assess table sturdiness?

I live in an apartment in a big city and have no access to proper outdoor space or a shop, but I want to build a simple, big table as easily as possible. My plan is:

1.5" x 3 ft. x 8 ft. Baltic birch counter top: https://www.homedepot.com/p/Allwood-6-4-in-x-3-ft-x-8-ft-Baltic-Birch-Project-Panel-EGB-6-4x36x96/207122109
28" tall by 20" wide metal legs with cross bracing: https://www.etsy.com/listing/588713252/2-pack-2-wide-14-thick-metal-size-range
Buy a drill and screw the legs to the table top.

However, I don't know if my idea will be sturdy enough. I have the space and really want at least a 7 ft. table. Are these legs good enough? Will the table bow in the middle? Where should I put the legs? In general, what are the rules of thumb for building a solid table? My fear is ordering all the parts, putting it together, and realizing it wobbles or sags in the middle.

A:

If I had my heart set on using the 3'x 8' birch top from Home Depot and the steel legs from Etsy, I would get two sets of legs and mount them at right angles to each other as shown in the drawing.

I have placed the legs as near the ends as possible, but you could place them any distance apart, depending on your aesthetic desires.  Of course they should be placed symmetrically and nearer to the table ends than to the table center.
This table will be stable in any direction, and will not sag under its own weight, but, of course, this does not mean that its capacity is unlimited. If a two-hundred-pounder were to decide to sit in the middle of table, a sag could be noted by a critical eye, but it would not be in danger of breaking.
