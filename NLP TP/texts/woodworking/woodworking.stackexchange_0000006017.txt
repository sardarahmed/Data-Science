Q:

Belt sanding belt joints

I was at the store the other day and they had a different belt available. It was a little more expensive. And instead of having tape on the back like I am used to on this new one they removed a good 1/2" of sand then glued it underneath the other end. There was a little gap between where the sand was removed to the other end. So I would like to know what other joints are used for making sanding belts and what the purpose is for doing that joint. Possible benefits from a specific joint? 

A:

Belts joined with a butt joint and taped offer a smoother joint while a lapped joint will tend to have a bump at the joint. The lapped joint tends to be stronger though old belts come apart due to glue failure same as the taped joint does. With the improvements in tape the butt joint is preferable
