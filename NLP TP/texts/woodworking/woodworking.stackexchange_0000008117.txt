Q:

Is There a Drill Grip for a Typical Dewalt Drill?

I recently purchased a 20V toolkit from Dewalt which included a pretty typical Dewalt drill/driver. I noticed that it doesn't have a drill drip though.
I really am a fan of drill grips for a number of reasons and don't really do any close quarters work that would prohibit using one. Are there any grips available either from DeWalt or aftermarket that would fit a typical Dewalt drill/driver?
For comparison, the 20V XR hammer drill has a 360-degree grip:

EDIT 0:
My DeWalt Drill Number Is: DCD780
EDIT 1: These are the diameter measurements for my drill (By a digital caliper):

As Graphus mentioned in a comment that style of drill doesn't really have an area where a grip would normally attach but I thought I'd see how it went with a grip attached to the torque adjustment ring on a fairly similar drill and this is what it looked like:

I gave it a test and it actually worked pretty well because as the drill turns clockwise it's natural to press downwards on the grip which holds the torque control in the maximum / drill position. The actual grip I used was from a Dewalt DCH274 which has a fair range of adjustment so maybe you can buy one of those as a spare part, but otherwise I think any similar grip of a suitable diameter will be suitable.
Also just thought to add the grip from something like a DCD991 / DCD996 in your photo won't work because they are too small in diameter to fit onto the torque adjustment ring.
