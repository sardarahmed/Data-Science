Q:

How to oil/treat a solid beech table top that will be used as a computer desk?

I just got a GERTON table top which is made of solid beech. In the instruction they says:

Apply a thin coat of BEHANDLA wood treatment
  oil. Leave the
  oil to penetrate the wood for about 2 hours. Wipe off surplus oil with
  a cloth or kitchen paper. During the first week of use the table top
  should be treated every second day and after that every third day
  until the surface is saturated (after about 2 months). Then treat the
  surface as required.

But in the BEHANDLA instructions they say:

Apply BEHANDLA with brush or pad in a thin, even film. Leave to
  penetrate the surface for approx. 15 minutes. Wipe off any unabsorbed
  oil with a soft cloth. Let the surface dry and repeat the oil
  treatment 1-3 times in accordance with the absorbency of the wood.

I will solely use the table as a computer desk.
My question is, which set of instruction should I follow?
Also, is there another (better) alternative for my use? The color of the table top is fine as is and I prefer matte surface finish over glossy finish.

A:

I would use so-called Danish oil (I have used Watco for decades).  It has the matte surface that you are looking for and if it gets any dings or scratches, a little sanding will get rid of them and a quick recoat of the surface gets it looking as good as new in minutes.
