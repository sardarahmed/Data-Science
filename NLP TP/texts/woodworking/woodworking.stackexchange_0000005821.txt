Q:

Knots bleeding thru on the deck

The knots on my treated lumber deck have been bleeding thru the solid color latex stain.  After scraping off the mounds of sap, I coated the knots with two coats of amber shellac.
My question is: Can I just apply the solid color stain latex stain over the top of the shellacked areas??  If not, what is the proper surface preparation?
Thanks

Absolutely, paints and most other coatings stick very well to shellac.
But shellac is not a waterproof coating so I don't know how well this will hold up over time.
