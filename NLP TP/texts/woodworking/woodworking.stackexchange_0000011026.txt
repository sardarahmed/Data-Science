Q:

Why don't door rails and stiles split apart?

We all hear the warnings about not going across the grain when fitting together boards, but obviously doors are constructed cross grain, with the grain of the rails going one direction and the stiles going the other. Why don't they split apart as the wood moves?

Those warnings generally mean "don't join wide pieces with grain running crosswise without accommodating seasonal movement," not that you can't ever join parts with crosswise grain.
Almost everything about a typical solid-wood exterior door is designed to allow seasonal movement without splitting:

frame and panel construction: Much of the width of the door is made up of panels that float within their frames and have room to expand. The rails are narrow enough (4-10") that they don't move much.
mortise and tenons: Rails are mortised into the stiles, giving a good mechanical connection. If you think about it, mortise and tenon joints always involve cross-grain connections, but they're one of the strongest joints around. Very wide rails will have two tenons instead of one wide one specifically to avoid a large cross-grain glue connection.
finish: A few coats of varnish or primer and paint significantly reduce seasonal movement.
