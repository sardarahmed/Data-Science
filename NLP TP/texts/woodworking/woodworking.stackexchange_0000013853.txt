Q:

How to make a toy figure as seen in picture?

I'm looking for options to create toy figures as seen in the attached pictures. The figures are wood and between 3/8 and 1/2 inch thick.
What type of saw, or would I need a CNC router to do this?

I’m hoping to make a lot of these so I don’t want to do this by hand. First time trying to make toy figures so just hoping to get some ideas and good advice.

A:

Coping saw. But you don't want to do it by hand.
Scroll saw. A powered version of the coping saw.
Router and template. While a CNC router is nice, it's a bit pricey, where a simple 1/4" collet router and a pattern bit with a bearing will be much less expensive.

Note that the router will cut round corners. The inside corners at his legs will not come out square without additional work.
You may have trouble finding small enough router bits to get into the small areas at his neck and between his legs.

Realistically, if you don't want to cut by hand, you'll want to use a scroll saw. This is the type of work they excel at.
