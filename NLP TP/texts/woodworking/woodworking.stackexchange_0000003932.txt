Q:

Actual KVH sleepers dimensions

I know that for some kinds of lumber there is significant difference in nominal and actual size (for instance 2 by 4).
How is with KVH (dried and glued up construction lumber used in EU)? What are actual dimensions of 60x140x13000mm sleeper?

A:

You can be assured that the actual cross-sectional dimensions are reasonably close to the nominal dimensions with KVH lumber/timber.  Realize that any cross-sectional dimension of wood is going to change depending on the humidity
According to page 7 of this brochure from WOODPRODUCTSfi the actual size is:

plus or minus 1.0 mm for dimensions less than or equal to 100 mm
plus or minus 1.5 mm for dimensions greater than 100 mm.
