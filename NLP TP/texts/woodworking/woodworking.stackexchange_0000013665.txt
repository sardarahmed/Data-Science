Q:

Epoxy sat in -7c for 3 nights should I replace it?

It's normally never below freezing where I live so I never bother bringing glue inside. There was a cold snap around -7c nights for 3-4 days and I have 5 different unopened epoxy tubes that were inside an unheated van. I work on furniture for customers so risking it is not worth it for 50-60$. Would you recommend replacing them?
Thank you.

A:

Should be fine. Epoxy contains no water, so is not damaged by freezing.
Some users rely on this when they mix a large batch, putting one half in the freezer so they can use it later! I have done this with epoxy adhesives and putties with no harm to final product.
If you doubt you can test it. If liquids look normal, it hardens in usual time and you cannot separate pieces without wood itself splitting your epoxy is good. If your resin has become cloudy you can restore it by heating, see link.
"First of all, do not despair, frozen epoxy isn't ruined! Although both your resin and activator are capable of freezing, it's very easy to return them to a usable liquid state."
