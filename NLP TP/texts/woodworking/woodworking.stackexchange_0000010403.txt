Q:

Can anyone explain how this plane could be used?

This plane is listed on ebay as a carriage-maker plane but it does not look like one (i.e.: when I think carriage maker I think a jack plane size that can do rebates).
Can anyone explain why the sole looks like it is protruding and has those strange rounded sides (almost coffin shaped) and that weird metal inset?

A:

Apparently it's a Coachbuilder's Door Check plane.
After searching "felloes rebate plane" (I thought it could be used to make rebates on really large wheel felloes) I found this: http://cornishworkshop.blogspot.com/2007/09/check.html - 

It's a Coachbuilder's Door Check plane, s'what. In this case a "Coach
  Door Smooth" for cleaning up rebates - for some reason called "checks"
  by Coachbuilders. As it's curved it can do concave rebates curving in
  the horizontal plane, which is nice.
