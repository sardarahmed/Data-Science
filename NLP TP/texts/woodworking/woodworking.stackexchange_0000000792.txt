Each time I come across the word dado, I pronounce it differently and it's starting to bug me. Which is the correct way to pronounce dado? Is it:

dado like dad
dado like dot
dado like date

A:

noun da·do \ˈdā-(ˌ)dō
It's pronounced with both a long 'a' as in day and a long 'o' as in oh. Primary emphasis (indicated by ') is on the first syllable.

A:

I've always heard it pronounced "Day-dough"
