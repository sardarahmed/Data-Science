Q:

Wooden Music Box oily and leaving residue on paper. is leaking residue toxic? bought in Salzburg, Austria from market vendor

i was hoping to gift this to a friend, but I don't want to give something that has a substance that could potentially be toxic! Why is it greasy when it's just wood, and is the oil toxic?

A:

There are a few likely contenders for the oil used on this but given the construction my money would be on it being a non-drying oil, specifically mineral oil or liquid paraffin (very similar to the base for baby oil, just a little thicker). 
If it's finished in a known wood-finishing oil (e.g. linseed oil or tung oil) it's unlikely it would be weeping like this after only a couple of days post-application except in unusual circumstances. 
But there are a few rule-in, rule-out things you can look at to try to narrow it down.
Smell
A good starting point is the smell. If it's mineral oil there could be no odour from the oil at all and if it has a characteristic smell it's likely something else. Both linseed or tung oils have a smell but they're impossible to describe really (in chemical circles they're said to have a "characteristic" odour, which means you know it when you know it!) but very broadly linseed oil has a sort of 'nutty' odour. Tung oil is sometimes said to have an unpleasant or disagreeable odour (this fades upon drying) but that's also said of linseed oil which many people including me really like the smell of! 
Colour
Another thing is the colour of the oil, mineral oil being clear as water while almost all oils of vegetable origin are some type of yellow or orange. Linseed oil can be particularly dark (orange-brown) and tung oil is a lighter version of the same sort of colour.
