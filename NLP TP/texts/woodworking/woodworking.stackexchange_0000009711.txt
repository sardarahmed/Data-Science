Q:

Flush trim pattern router bit

I am attempting to replicate router cuts 
 
I made a template and am having difficulty finding router bit that works.
My template sits on top of the triangle. I tried using a flush cut pattern bit and the depth is set correctly. That works fine but the top bearing seems to hold cut 1/4 inch from where I want the cut.
It does not seem to cut flush with my pattern. The resulting cut is too narrow. What do I need to do?

A:

My guess is that you do not, in fact, have a flush cut bit, but rather a hinge mortising bit, such as the Freud 16-560, that is designed for templates that are slightly oversized.

You can either get a proper flush trim bit, get a different bearing for the bit to make it cut flush, or modify your template to account for the offset.
