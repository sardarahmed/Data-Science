Q:

Considerations for using smaller diameter blades on table saw?

I need a 1/16" kerf for a project.  All the 10" blades I can find that thin are into hundreds of dollars.
Meanwhile, I see thin-kerf 7.25" Freud Diablo blades selling for under $15.  These say they're rated for 10,000 rpm.  (My saw says no-load speed is 4,800 rpm.)
I don't need to make deep cuts, nor am I doing high volume.  So other than reduced cut depth, and heat concerns with extended cutting, is there any reason not to put one of these smaller-diameter blades in my 10" table saw?

A:

I use 7.25" and 8" blades on a 10" table saw all the time, with no problem. You will have less depth of cut, of course, and also a reduction of rim speed,which will slightly increase chances of tearout, and slightly reduce risk of burning, both to a negligible degree under most conditions. Go for it.

A:

It's common to use 8" dado sets on 10" table saws.
The main disadvantage of a smaller blade is simply that your maximum cut depth is reduced. 
There is also going to be a reduction in the speed at which the teeth meet the wood, and increase in torque. (Circumference is pi*diameter, so this is linear with blade size for a given RPM). That may affect cutting behavior, but I'm not sure what the effects might be. 

A:

If you are doing through cuts, your table saw's stock riving knife will not be close enough to the back side of the blade to prevent kickback.  To address this, you can create a custom throat plate with an appropriately-sized and -located  splitter.
