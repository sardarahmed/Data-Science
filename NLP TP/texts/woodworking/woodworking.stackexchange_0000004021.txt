Q:

How to make a wood gear?

I want to know how I could make wooden gears at home without the need of a CNC or a laser. What tool should I use, what are the steps to making one?

A:

All you really need is a template and a way to shape inside corners.
Shaping the inside corners can be done with a file, a strip sander, a bandsaw,...
To create one you make the template of the gear you want glue it to the wood and then remove wood up to the line. With a bandsaw you can first cut out the outside circle and then cut out the spurs. you could also use a drill to remove most of the material between the teeth.
