Q:

Sanding with lathe turning

When sanding with the lathe turning, should speed be increased as finer grit is used?
What speeds should be used for sanding according to grit being used?

A:

Ah an interesting question.
The first part, 'Should speed be increased as a finer grit is used'
Generally once I've finished turning a piece I do increase the speed a bit for the sanding and I sometimes increase it a bit more when I'm getting really fine sanding almost polishing it.
However, hard numbers unfortunately are difficult for several reasons.  the first and biggest issue it that as the size of your work piece changes so too does an 'optimal' speed.  On top of that some pieces will just fly apart if spun at the faster speed smaller pieces handle with ease.
I have a variable speed lathe and can just adjust the speed with a turn of the dial and I have a habit of moving it up and down as I'm working on it.  For me unfortunately it more what is the fastest SAFE speed to turn this piece.
Making it even harder for me to give you any speed ideas is that the eye that monitors the speed on my machine comes loose quickly and give me no reading, and I have long since given up trying to keep it set.
If you have a lathe like a 5 speed, then my recommendation is generally bump it up one gear after you are done turning.
The single biggest thing I have found for speeding up the sanding process on a lathe is actually not the speed it is turning but the direction. My second lathe I vowed would have a reverse, and it does, it's my favorite feature closely followed by the dial variable speed.
By being able to sand it in reverse you are sanding against the shearing action of the chisels and when you have some tear out it really does sand faster.  I tend to switch the turning direction as I sand, I generally let it run both ways for each grit to get the nicest fastest finish out of the piece.
