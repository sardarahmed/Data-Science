Q:

What are the different styles of Japanese Saws

Pretty much just what the title says. I would like to know the different styles of Japanese saws and what each one is designed for. I am aware of Dozuki and Ryoba but I will assume there are others. 

A:

Dōzuki (胴付(鋸))   A type of backsaw. The Japanese means "attached
  trunk", thus a saw with a stiffening strip attached, i.e., a backsaw.
Ryōba (両刃)   Multi-purpose carpentry saw with two cutting edges. The
  Japanese means "double blade". There is a cross-cutting (yokobiki)
  blade on one side and a ripping (tatebiki) blade on the other.
Azebiki (あぜ引き)   A small ryōba saw used for cutting into the flat
  surface of a board rather than from the edge. The blade has a convex
  curve which can begin the cut anywhere on the surface.
Mawashibiki (回し引き)   A thin saw used for cutting curves, the Japanese
  version of a keyhole saw. The name means "turning cut".
