Q:

Using a Planer on wide but short stock

I want to make a chess-board style end-grain cutting board. I only have a bandsaw, a Jointer and a Planer. The first step is easy: I cut strips of two wood species and joint and plane them so they are 40mmx40mm. I then glue them together to get a striped board. Now I need to crosscut that into strips again (each strip is then striped).
All the tutorials I found use a table saw for this, which creates a glueable surface. I don't have that.
I can do these cuts on the bandsaw, but after that, the strips need to be planed to create a gluable surface. I cannot just run them through the planer lengthwise, because that would be across the grain. I also cannot run them through the planer width-wise as they are too short (40mm).
Can I maybe clamp these strips together and run them through the planer as one piece? With F-Style clamps?

A:

If I understand correctly, you are missing a step. You should plane the "striped" board after the first glue-up but before the final round of saw cuts. The top and bottom of the striped board will form the glue surfaces after making the final cut and tipping each final striped strip onto its side to orient the end grain facing toward what will ultimately be the top and bottom of the cutting board.
