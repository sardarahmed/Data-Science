Q:

What are these wooden posts?

I am starting a tinker group for kids.
I have seen these wooden posts pictured in a number of tinkering setups, since they have pre-drilled holes and can be connected relatively easily by young children.  But what are they?! Someone I know said they are used in furniture building?

Thanks so much for your help!

A:

These are known as Gridbeam
They are made from reclaimed wood and they also make an aluminium variety.

We hand manufacture wood Gridbeam™ from 100% recycled douglas fir in
  Northern California. Our location gives us access to the highest
  quality recycled wood from nearby NorthCal Lumber, the largest wood
  recycler in the United States. 
Our beautiful, straight grained, old growth douglas fir has the
  highest strength to weight ratio of any structural wood and does not
  dent or crush like softer woods.
