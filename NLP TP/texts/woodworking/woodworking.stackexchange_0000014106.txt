Q:

Using a tabletop as a shelf?

I am wanting to install a shelf above a washer and dryer. Seems like a lot of the DIY videos involve buying 3/4 plywood and cutting it to size and then various other steps to take it from the rough state of plywood into a finished product. Most of the tools needed I don't even have, like a miter saw. I had the idea of possibly using a table top like the one shown below. It is 23.6"D x 59"W x 1.1"H, the exact measurements I need and it weighs 38 lb.

The shelf would be placed in a corner. So one short side of the shelf would be floating while the other two would be supported. Considering that I would install appropriate 24 inch brackets that can hold 250lb each, spaced 16 inch apart is there anything that makes this a bad idea? Besides the fact that it is engineered wood, and would bubble if moisture remains on top for a long time?

As long as you provide sufficient support, considering that it's described as "solid particle board," it should work well enough. 24" does seem very deep for an overhead shelf, but if it's what you want, great.
That said, consider that $139 is a lot to pay for what amounts to a slab of particle board. A 4x8' sheet of melamine covered particle board costs less than a third of that, and you could get a piece of butcher block countertop in close to the size you need for about $50 more.
