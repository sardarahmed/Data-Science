Design for Disassemblable Corner Joint for Guitar Speaker Chassis

I am working on the design for a very large speaker chassis (approx. 9' H x 6' W x 2' D). Based on this very large size I'd like this to be able to disassemblable into panels for storage. The chassis design will be pretty standard, 4 walls with inlaid front and back panels:

What is a good design for the corner joints I could use to allow this to disassemble? I need it to both be strong enough to hold the large cabinet together and look reasonably polished. Would something where I cover the 4 corner seems with L shaped angle irons potentially work?
My current plan for finishing is to use something like this Granotone speaker paint: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Z5SNJ1F/?coliid=I276S8TRG9J0S1&colid=1227IC8E2NVMS&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it&th=1

A:

How would you attach those angle irons, with nuts & bolts? Then why not do as suggested in a comment and just screw/bolt the thing together in the first place.
To be honest, though, at 9 feet (3 meters) tall and 6 feet (2 meters) wide, I'd think some extra strength from some angle iron at the corners wouldn't hurt.
Are you expecting to put the angle iron on the inside with threaded holes that the bolts run into, or on the outside with clearance holes through the iron and threaded inserts in the wood to accept the bolts? I'd think bolting the iron to the inside "permanently" to the sides, then removable bolts into threaded iron for the front/back may be your best bet.

Since you've now indicated (in a comment) that you're interested in the type of corner joint that will look good, I think that's entirely up to you.

A simple butt joint, when covered in paint will be just fine. (I didn't click the link, but in my mind, "speaker paint" has a texture to it that will hide the edge laminations.)

A miter joint will work nicely, but leaves thin edges that could be dinged up during storage & handling and may not last long.

A lock miter would be very strong but could be difficult to disassemble.

The options are unlimited, and it really comes down to how much effort you want to put into it, and how concerned you are with damaging the look during disassembly and storage and what the potential for damage is with the specific design you choose.
