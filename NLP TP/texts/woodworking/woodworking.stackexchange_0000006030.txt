Q:

Cutting a spherical depression in wood

I am trying to create a smooth spherical depression in wood that, the depression is 1.75in in diameter and 0.5in deep. I have access to a drill press, fixed router, and some chisels but I am not sure about the best way to go about achieving this depression in the wood (I am working with cherry) any suggestions about how to achieve this? The shape I am hoping to achieve is attached in the link.

A:

If you want to create this with the tools you mentioned you'll need a "core box" bit.  This is a plunging router bit with a spherical profile.
To determine the size we'll need to determine the radius using the formula:
r = h/2 + w^2/8h
Plugging in h = 1/2 and w = 1 3/4 we get an answer of 1 1/64".  Since core box bits are typically sold by diameter you'll need a 2 1/32" bit.  If you're ok with something close you could probably use a 2" bit.
I'd be VERY careful with this operation, though.  Plunging a 2" bit can be quite dangerous.  Make sure that your workpiece is well secured and you have your router very stable.  Honestly I wouldn't personally attempt this operation.
