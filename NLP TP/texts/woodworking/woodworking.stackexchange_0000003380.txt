Q:

How do you use "v-nails" on picture frames?

I have tried using v-nails when making picture frames, but didn't have much luck. I tried using a hammer, a hammer+punch, and finger pushing.
There must be a trick to this.

What are the tricks to getting v-nails to work on picture frames like the pros?

A:

Rockler has a V-Nail Installation Tool that should be right up your alley:

I'm sure there are other stores where you can get these, but this is the first one I found.
