Q:

Do I need the front apron piece in a desk with a 3/4" plywood top?

I'm planning to make this desk for a person who has asked to leave off the front of the apron. She's very short and has difficulty with most desks being too high, and the ones that aren't too high don't have enough clearance underneath.
Will a 3/4" piece of plywood hold across a span of slightly under 3 feet?
And would the answer to this be different if I edged the plywood with 1 inch of hardwood (walnut)?

A:

3/4 plywood over a 3' span is likely to be fine as long as she does not  sit or climb up on it, or leave heavy objects near the edge for long periods of time.
I am sitting at a desk, as i right this that is 3/4 plywood spanning 6' and it is fine. If i put a straight edge on it i think i may see a sag of about an 1/8", with out my heavy arms resting on it to use the keyboard, but it will flex significantly if press down on it.
I think it will be fine but since you have not built it yet you may want to   go with either a thicker ply, thicker solid wood or butcher block.   A
Aesthetically i think it will look better on the thick base.

And would the answer to this be different if I edge-banded the plywood
with 1 inch of hardwood (walnut)?

The thicker walnut hardwood would add stiffness but not take all of the flex out of it.
