Q:

Should I resaw before or after gluing up thin panels?

I want to make some thin (1/4-3/8") panels out of hardwood rather than plywood. My panels will be up to 8" wide, so I may need to glue up two or three boards to get the width I need. I'm starting off with 3/4" thick material, so I'll need to resaw the boards in half at some point. 
Should I glue up the panel first and then resaw it to the desired thickness, or resaw the individual boards first and then glue the thin boards together? Not sure exactly what wood I'll be using, but it will likely be maple, walnut, or cherry, if that affects the answer.

A:

I would resaw first. An 8" resaw is going to take lots of skill and luck to achieve.  If the 8" board is only slightly out of plumb (an issue of skill) at any point during the cut, you will very likely end up with a place where the thickness goes below 1/4", necessitating a do-over.  If you make a resaw on a 4" board, the effect of a bit of jiggle out of vertical would only be half of what would happen in the 8' cut.
Saw, thickness plane, then glue.  Finally, sand or once again thickness plane to final dimension.
