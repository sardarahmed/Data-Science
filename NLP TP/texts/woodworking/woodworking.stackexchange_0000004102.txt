Q:

UFP treated woods for raised garden bed

I have a raised garden bed using wood logs that have 'UFP Treated' tags at the end. I am using my raised bed for growing vegetables. 

What does 'UFP Treated' mean? 
Are these board safe to continue to use it for my vegetable garden bed?

A:

UFP Treated means that the wood is pressure treated with chromated copper arsenate (CCA) to make it less susceptible to rot. This technique comes from building boats, piers, carports, ... anything that is exposed to the elements and has been around for quite some time. 
Opinions as to the CCA being poisonous in planting application such as yours vary greatly and there are researches showing (presumably legitimate) data in any direction. Articles that i read recently are this, that and that. I based my opinion mostly on them which lead me to build a planter for my (very nice and likable) grandmother using treated wood.
One thing that you could do is treat the "treated wood" further with some food safe, oil based finish as this will seal the arsenic to some degree. You'd probably touch that finish up every couple years, the frequency being dependent on how much elemental exposure your planter gets. Here is a quite interesting thread to really safe finishes :).

A:

In the United States, since 2003, the availability of CCA pressure treated wood has been scant.  EPA does not allow its use in residential applications, so it will be hard to find at your local lumber retailer, be it big box or small yard.
That being said, pressure treated products are readily available but with less threatening EPA approved chemicals.  The "UFP Treated" tag should have specific information on its reverse side.  
If the tag doesn't say CCA or Chromatic Copper Arsenate, you are good to go with the bed that you have made.
