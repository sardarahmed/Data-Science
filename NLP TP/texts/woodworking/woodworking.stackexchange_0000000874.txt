Q:

Does dropping boards really relieve internal tensions?

A Fine Woodworking article I read a while back has a picture of Steve Latta dropping boards onto concrete.
The caption reads:

Drop relieves stress. For larger doors, like those on armoires, Latta
  actually drops rough parts on the floor! The impact releases internal
  tensions and lets the parts finish warping before final dimensioning,
  he says.

I thought there was an accompanying video but I couldn't find it with a brief search.
I have a great amount of respect for any professional woodworker, but to me this seems really sketchy. Is this true, and if so, how would you explain it to a 5-year-old using pictures? Are there any studies which have measured and confirmed or debunked this claim?

A:

I find this really hard to believe.. if dropping a piece of lumber did 'relieve stress' then there should be no stress in it by the time it makes it to your local lumber distributor-- it's been dropped numerous times between tree and your shop.
Are we sure the original publish date of this article wasn't April 1? ;)

A:

Stress is only relieved by either bending or cracking. If dropping cracks the wood in the right way, then stress is relieved. You could potentially relieve internal stresses by encouraging it to bend in the right way, but that seems risky - how do you know which direction to go, and how far?

A:

If a board were to lose its internal stresses by dropping or for any other reason it would take on a new shape and be warped, twisted, curved and in need of reshaping. If you have ever ripped a thin strip from a wide a board and ended up with a something resembling a steam-bent shovel handle, you have witnessed the process of relieving stress in wood.
