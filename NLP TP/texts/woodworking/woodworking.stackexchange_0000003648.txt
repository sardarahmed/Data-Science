Q:

How heavy a piece of wood can my lathe handle?

I have the Jet 1642 EVS.  One of the nice features that I bought it for is offbed turning, the head stock moves and I can turn bowls and platters greater than the 16" diameter bed limit.
However, I paid a lot of money for this tool and the few times I've looked I have not been able to find a weight limit for the size/mass of a bowl blank I can mount on it without damaging it.
I have a large hunk of ash, it was from a tree ~32 in diameter.  Split in half and rounded with a chain saw (haven't done this part yet) I estimate the blank will still be ~100 lbs.
That is a lot of weight.  So before I cost myself $500 in lathe repairs (which could buy some nice NEW tools) Can anyone tell me or find what a reasonable weight limit is for outboard turning of large bowls?

A:

That was fast.  I broke down and called Jet tech support.  The information was not in any of their product information and the support person needed to ask Development.  I mentioned that the piece I was wanted to use was between 100-150 lbs. Development said that lathe could handle 200 lbs. easily, he didn't even have to look it up.  So 200 lbs. is well within the range of the lathe.  So while I don't know what the upper limit actually is, I do know it is much larger than I am currently planning on using.
