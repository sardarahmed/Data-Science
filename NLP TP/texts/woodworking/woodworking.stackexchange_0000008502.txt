Q:

Is this a bad cerusing job?

I ordered a side table from a reputable manufacturer. The table was supposed to look like this:

However, when I received the table, it looked like this:

The white on the side table that I received is way too dominant and makes the table, in my opinion, off-putting. The person who sold this to me is saying that the white comes from cerusing and will vary based on wood grain, but I find it hard to believe that there wasn't some measure of bad workmanship involved. Is it possible that the stain underneath the cerusing was baddly applied / sealed in a way that made the white penetrate more deeply? Here is a closer look at the finish on my table:

A:

A finish technique like this is expected to have a high degree of variation based on any number of factors, including pore size, grain pattern, ring spacing (i.e. growth speed of the tree), etc.  I don't think you can really fault the manufacturer for this type of inconsistency.  It doesn't look like there's anything wrong with this finish per se.
(Honestly, though, to me this looks more like a difference in the lighting or photographic settings than a difference in the finish.)
If all you want to do is make the white less vibrant I'd try a wash coat of shellac with a darker aniline dye in it.
