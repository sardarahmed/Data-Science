Q:

Can I spray "brushing lacquer"?

At my local home improvement store, they only have spray cans of lacquer and brushing lacquer(Minwax clear brushing lacquer). I'm thinking it would be cheaper and faster if I could just use the quarts of brushing lacquer in an actual spray gun instead of buying a bunch of spray cans.
I am trying to get a thick coat of lacquer over stained wood panels.
What makes the lacquer for brushing instead of spraying?
And is there any problems that might arise from using brushing lacquer directly in a spray gun?

A:

Yes, you can spray "brushing lacquer"--although depending on your gun, you will most likely want to thin it first with lacquer thinner.
Keep in mind that spraying is not necessarily faster than brushing. You will have to spray more coats to equal a single brushed coat. Also, with spraying there is more waste, since a fair amount of the atomized finish is overspray or floats away in the air and never makes it onto the workpiece.
Anytime you spray, remember to properly clean your gun when you are done for the day.
