Q:

Are there any accessories that work with a corded 1/2 inch collet DeWALT router and a cordless 1/4 inch collet DeWALT palm router?

I have a DeWALT Cordless Trim Router (model DCW600B). I'm wanting to cut some dovetails for the first time with a router. I just purchased a PORTER-CABLE Dovetail Jig with Mini Template Kit (4216) to get started. Unbeknownst to me, that doesn't work for anything but "mini-dovetails" using a 1/4-inch collet router like the DCW600B I own. So I need to purchase a 1/2-inch collet router. In the DeWALT Ecosystem, that's the 2.25 HP DW618 or its smaller 1.75 HP DW616 brother.
In the DeWALT ecosystem, are there any shared accessories that there's a good reason to stay with DeWALT when moving from a cordless trim router to a corded router?

A:

I asked DeWALT and they have this question in their FAQ, "What accessories are available for the DEWALT DCW600 Cordless Compact Router?". This question is relatively new. DeWALT answered with the following (which I attempted to exhaustively audit),

DNP612 Plunge Base Does not seem to work on non-compact.
DNP615 Dust Does not seem to work on non-compact.
DW6913 (Router Edge Guide, Fine Adjustment, Vacuum Adapter) FITS BOTH
No idea what they're talking about Edge Guide Collection Adapter For DNP612
Duplicate Plunge Base For DNP612
No idea what they're talking about Plunge Base DNP617
Centering Cone (which seems to be DNP617): Fits 1/2 and 1/4 inch collet
DNP613 Round (base plate)
No idea what they're talking about DNP617 Dust
DNP618 Does not seem to work on non-compact.
No idea what they're talking about Edge Guide Sub Base Collection Adapter For Compact Router
No idea what they're talking about Fixed Base For Compact Router
Duplicate of above? Fixed Base

So it seems like the one accessory which may overlap wireless and wired as of 2022-03-13 is

DW6913 (Router Edge Guide, Fine Adjustment, Vacuum Adapter) FITS BOTH
