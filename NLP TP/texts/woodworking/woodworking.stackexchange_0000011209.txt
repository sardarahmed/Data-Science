Q:

Notching and dimensioning a lot of 2x lumber to a specific size

I need to cut 32 of these:

They're 2x8's, each a foot long, with a corner removed.  I'm hoping to cut them safely and efficiently.  I thought about running them across the table saw, maybe 3 or 4 at a time, for the short side of the notch then using a jig saw for the rest but that seems like a slow way to go and I'm not sure it's the safest.  Is there a better way to do this?
The first drawing is upside down for its actual use.  Here's how the pieces will be installed:

A:

There are a lot of ways to do this, but personally I would do stopped cuts on the table saw.  I would definitely not try to stack multiple pieces though.  (If you have access to a high-powered bandsaw that might be a better choice.)
For the longer rip cut I would use the fence and clamp a stop block to it to prevent overshooting your line.  For the crosscut I'd use a crosscut sled if available or else a miter gauge.  You should also be able to set up a stop block for this.
You'll probably need to finish each cut with a jigsaw (or band saw if available) since the circular tablesaw blade won't be able to fully get into the corner without overshooting on one side.
Also, you should be aware that the short leg of the L will be fairly weak due to the grain orientation.
