Q:

Chair repair advice

I have a vintage Rock'n'Rest chair that has met with an unfortunate perch...a family member sat on the arm and now one of the rear joints is loose.
It is a mortise & tenon joint and it all appears to be intact inside, it just is loose. It doesn't look like there was any existing glue so I wasn't sure if I should put in some Gorilla Glue or similar? I don't think I should take it all the way apart as all of the other joints are fine. I'm very much a DIY beginner so any advice would be really appreciated.

If you want to keep that chair in good working condition, take it to a professional furniture restorer.

In a mortise and tenon joint, the glue is applied to the tenon and the inside of the mortise. It's not usually applied to the part of the joint that you can see without taking the joint apart.

so I wasn't sure if I should put in some Gorilla Glue or similar?

Don't do that. In most chairs, this one included, the connection between the rails and the rear legs has to be very strong. As Ashlar explained in a comment, just adding a little glue to the part of the joint that you can see isn't going to provide the necessary strength. Also, right now that tenon has nice clean shoulders, and once repaired, the joint will fit back together tightly. If you add glue there, that glue will eventually have to be removed to get a good fit again.rock.n.
Somebody with experience is really going to need to take the joint apart (which will also mean taking the corresponding joint on the other side apart). They'll then look at the mating surfaces to see whether they can be reglued. Often, when a joint like this breaks, it's the wood that breaks, not the glue, so the joint might need more repair than just scraping off the old glue, adding new glue, and sticking it back together.
