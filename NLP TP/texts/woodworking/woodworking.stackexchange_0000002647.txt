Q:

Can 160-year-old wood still have sap?

I bought a dining table and it was claimed that the table top was made from reclaimed wood from a 160-year-old Douglas Fir log.  The table top is still seeping out sap.  Is this even possible from something that is 160 years old? I think I'm being ripped off here.  
I'd like to hear from your experience/expertise please!

Sure, it's definitely possible.  Sap doesn't just disappear from a piece of wood because it's old.
One might think that over that long of a time, the sap should have dried up a little.  If it was kept in a cooler place and brought into somewhere warmer, the sap could start to flow again.

What I would do to "prove" this claim is look closer at the wood itself.  If it's supposedly a 160-year-old log, it should be old-growth.  If it's old growth Douglas fir, the growth rings should be much closer together than what you would see in new-growth wood.
For example, if you go to your local big-box lumberyard and look at a 2x4 stud, you will see very large gaps between the early- and late-wood rings, sometimes as large as 1/4"!  This is because new-growth trees tend to grow very fast in their mostly treeless canopy (assuming the area they grew was clear cut), whereas old-growth trees grew very slowly in a canopy choked by other, larger trees.

A:

It could be the 'reclaimed bit.  By reclaiming the wood, one possibility is that they had to resaw the timbers to boards.  It might have started out as 8" x 8" timber or some other large dimension.  This is actually quite likely, and the 'new' cuts are now exposing new wood.
Even a significant planning to straighten and clean the boards could cause a similar reaction.  
So just by leaking sap does not preclude it from being old wood.
However, I can't guarantee that it IS 160 yo either.
