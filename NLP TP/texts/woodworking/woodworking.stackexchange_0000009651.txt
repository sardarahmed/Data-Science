Q:

Replace porch boards (2x6) with composite

In 1993, my front porch was built using 2x6's for the decking, mounted perpendicular to the front of the house. After too many years of painting, replacing porch post's and rail balusters, I'm ready to go with composite, but know of two issues.

The composite boards are .94" thick, but the 2X6's are 1.5". Where the boards go underneath the siding "J" channel, and the front door, there will be a .56" gap. Do I add a piece of moulding, shim the joists under the decking, or some other idea?
If I mount the new boards perpendicular like the old, the length will be 6' 2", resulting in some serious waste of composite. I looked at a neighbors porch and they ran one board on the outside parallel with the house, and that looked good. Or, if I tried to run all boards parallel with the house, now I need to replace/redesign the joists so they run in the correct position.
Thank you for any suggestions you have!

A:

You could just stick a bit of trim underneath the J channel to make it look nice. 
To your length issue, I'd either try to source 20' lengths, or tweak the design to let you use 12'. You could do this by making a picture frame around the perimeter. (This would require a bit of blocking at the house and outside, but that's not hard to do.)
