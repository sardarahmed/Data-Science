How to cut a straight 10cm section out of a 20cm post

I want to cut a cuboid section out of a 20cm post.

My only thought is to make lots of cuts and then go to work with a chisel.
Are there any alternatives?
Update...
Went as far as I dared with a chainsaw

And then used a chisel

But I still think this is a worthwhile post.  Maybe there is still a better way?
That was a test - the real ones are oak 
Thank you to everyone for contributing.

A:

When I have made similar removal of wood I use my skill saw and make a LOT of parallel cuts so it is easy to clean out with a chisel, 10cm is a bit more than my skill saw could handle, however, I would still set it as deep as possible, make the cuts and then use a different saw to finish making as deep as I needed.
