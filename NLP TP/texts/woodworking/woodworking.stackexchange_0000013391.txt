Q:

Separated wood 15 minutes after starting glue up, reapplied glue, and re-clamped, will the joint fail?

I'm making an end-grain cutting board.
While gluing my (18) strips of wood together, I dry fit the pieces, glued them, and clamped them.
As I was finishing tightening the clamps, I noticed that the boards had all tilted slightly relative to each other, creating a slight saw-tooth pattern along their edges. I decided to unclamp, and attempt to straighten the pieces.
It was difficult to loosen the pieces at this point, and I gave up after separating just two pieces (one joint). I wiped some of glue off, which felt tacky at this point, and applied plenty of new glue, and reset and clamped everything.
It had been between 10 and 15 minutes between when I initially applied the glue, and when I reapplied and re-clamped.
I'm planning on cutting to re-square it and remove the tilt, but I'm worried that the joint I separated and re-glued won't form a strong bond. Is this something I need to be concerned with?
I was using Titebond III wood glue.

A:

Maybe good, maybe weak. Impossible to say in theory, you must check to be sure.
Once you make offcut test it, if wood can separate on glue line joint was weak. If wood breaks joint is strong.
