Q:

Is it possible to convert Ikea crib to an adult sofa/couch?

I was planning to buy a second-hand Ikea Crib and turn it into a couch. However, the crib's maximum load is 50lb - which is way too low for any fully grown people to use. Is it possible to add reinforcements and increase the maximum load to at least 270lb? If so, how/what methods can we use to reinforce it?

A:

I suspect the answer to the question in the title is yes, but not a good one.
The crib is obviously made for a very lightweight occupant and the limited amount of strain they can introduce :-) and as such the scale of the pieces, and IMO very critically the way everything is fastened together, is based on this. The requirements for an adult-size single chair are far greater, much less a sofa expected to take two or more adults and all the shifting about they would do over the expected lifespan of the piece.
Accordingly, as I say in the Comments, I'm sure the advice you'll receive from nearly any source is that you'd be much better off building a sofa with similar styling from scratch so that:

the main structural components are scaled appropriately for the expected loads and purpose;
the joinery is chosen from the outset to be strong and durable enough (as in all conventional chairmaking).
