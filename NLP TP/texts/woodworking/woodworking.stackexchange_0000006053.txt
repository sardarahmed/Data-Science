Q:

What wood type is suitable for a childrens toy?

I'm a GCSE student and for my exam I have to design a children's toy and I wanted a durable, non toxic and cheap wood for some of my designs that could be thrown around and be put into children's mouths without being damaged but I'm really struggling to find a one as different websites have different information. 

A:

Take a look at what woods are commonly used for children's toys, and you'll see that a lot of the things made to be mouthed are made of maple or beech. These are both hard, fine grained, and are less prone to causing irritation. Because they are hard they don't dent or scratch easily. The fine grain means that even if they do splinter, they wont form large shards which could cause injury (unlike oak, for example). And finally, they have almost no smell, color, or chemistry that could even potentially cause problems (unlike walnut, cedar, etc).
