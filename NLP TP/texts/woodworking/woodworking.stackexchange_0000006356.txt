Q:

What is the difference between flush trim, pattern, and template router bits?

I see router bits marketed as flush trim bits, pattern bits, template bits, but they all seem to be similar in design. The cutting edges are exactly lined up with a bearing, so that an exact copy of a piece can be cut.
For example, Rockler sells a flush trim bit:

and a pattern bit:

and Amazon sells a template bit:

They all seem to be identical in function (although the linked pattern bit is shorter, so it can't cut as deep of a copy as the others can), so is this just a marketing thing? Rockler's flush trim bit I linked is even listed as a "Pattern flush trim bit".

A:

A flush trim bit has the bearing at the bottom of the bit.  This is so that it can trim a layer of laminate (i.e. Formica) that has been attached to the top of a smaller substrate (i.e. MDF or particle board) flush to the substrate.  
A pattern or template bit has the bearing at the top of the bit (between the shank and the cutting blades.)  This is so that it can follow a template attached to the top of a larger workpiece, cutting the workpiece to match the template.  I believe that the terms "pattern bit" and "template bit" are interchangeable.  
Your first picture is incorrectly labeled.  That is a pattern/template bit, NOT a flush trim bit.  
Also worth mentioning, some flush trim bits have cutting surfaces on the tip of the bit to allow plunging it through a laminate.  (These typically have a flat reference surface instead of a bearing.)  This is useful if you've laminated over a hole in the substrate that you want to remain open.
