Q:

How can I paint furniture so that it can be stripped later?

We have an old cherry table that my wife wants to paint. I'm not keen on painting stained wood, but I want to keep her happy. Is there a way to paint stained wood to make it easier to strip again later on?

A:

Paint it with a waterbased paint*
These are usually much easier to strip at a later date than oil-based paints, which in the present day are usually some type of enamel even if the labelling doesn't describe them as such.
There isn't a huge amount in it but a more-matt paint (semi-gloss down to fully matt) will generally strip slightly more easily than a gloss paint, as the former have a more 'open' surface. So if you don't mind that the table isn't full gloss when painted there is a slight advantage later on.
Paint it with oil paint
I mean linseed-oil paint specifically, not any old oil-based paint. Without a resin component (this is what turns oil paint into an enamel) plain oil paints remain much more responsive to solvent stripping, almost permanently.
There are some additional points worth touching on.
Clean the surface before painting
Normally you'd want to clean the table thoroughly and lightly sand/scuff it to promote paint adhesion, but here I'll specifically advise you to skip the scuffing. You still need to clean the surface well so that any contamination, especially furniture polish or wax but also possible residues of cleaning agents, are removed as these could lead to defects in the paint film. 

Since the wood is already stained it is likely also varnished or lacquered so I don't see any benefit to going the extra mile and using a barrier coat. If the table were bare wood however it would be well worth giving it a single coat of shellac before the paint went on.

*But not milk paint! Milk paint is famous for just how difficult it is to remove once cured â€” most conventional paint strippers have zero effect on it.
