Q:

How to cut Plexiglas on a table saw?

I'm building a router bit box to store all my router bits of various sizes (¼ and ½). I want to have a see-through closing lid.  In order to do so, I will frame a sheet of Plexiglas (1/8" thick) in wood.  I couldn't find a sheet with dimensions close to what I need, so I bought a bigger one.  I now need to cut it to length.  I wonder how should I do it on a table saw.  I don't need a perfect cut.  All four edges will be hidden by the wood frame.
I've searched a bit online and people are suggesting a high teeth count blade.  I'm thinking of using a cheap circular saw blade of 7¼" with 100 teeth or so.  Will that give me an appropriate cut?

A:

Plexiglass works well with a craft knife too. If you score it a couple of times with a straight rule, it should snap cleanly along the break.

A:

Although you do want a high tooth count for a higher-quality cut, an ultra-high tooth count can be detrimental. With a 100T 7-1/4" blade, you'll have to cut more slowly and may burn the plastic.
If using a 7-1/4" circular saw blade, use a high-quality 50-60 tooth blade, which will perform similarly to the 10" 80T blade that Aloysius Defenestrate's local plastics company recommended.
To help protect against chipout at the edges, you can either tape the cut line or you can sandwich your Plexiglas between two thin pieces of sacrificial plywood or MDF.
Assuming your plastic is, indeed, Plexiglas (acrylic), you can polish the edges with a torch. Do NOT use a torch on the edges of Lexan (polycarbonate), because you'll just melt it. If you aren't sure which type of plastic you have, acrylic is bright when you look directly at the edge, while polycarbonate is dark when you look directly at the edge.

A:

The people at my local plastics place would say yes. (Their specific suggestion was 10", 80T.) They also said feed fast, though not so fast as to be unsafe.
