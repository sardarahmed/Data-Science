Q:

Can I get two parallel sides of a board with only a jointer?

I'm building up my woodshop and currently have a jointer (4" wide), a table saw, and a miter saw. I really wish I had a planer, but my budget is a little tight right now. In lieu of that, I'm trying to figure out any way to reliably use the jointer to get two parallel sides on a board. Normally, I'd flatten out one side with the jointer then move over to the planer to get the other side flat and parallel to the first. Is there a way to accomplish the second step just on the jointer rather than with a planer? Right now, I'm working mostly with 1x4 boards.

A:

Assuming a tablesaw with a tall enough blade and fenceâ€¦
Flatten one side on the jointer, run twice (bottom half, then top half) through the tablesaw, then flatten the sawn side nicely on the jointer.
Use featherboards and of course push sticks as needed.

A:

It is also possible to create parallel faces using a router although it becomes much more work for larger pieces due to the small size of router bits.
First create the base face using the jointer, anchor the piece to a flat benchtop and straddle the width of the piece with two rail boards, slightly higher that the workpiece.  Using as wide a router bit with a flat bottom cutting edge and the router's wide base you can now route a new face that is parallel to the bottom. IF the work piece board is wider than your router base can span you may have to create a wider base for the router.  You can clean up the face with hand planes or sanding.
