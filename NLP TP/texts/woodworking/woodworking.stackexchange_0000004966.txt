Q:

Identifying tree species

I was walking out on a trail near my house after a recent storm and found a tree that had been uprooted due to the storm. I plan on cutting up the tree to use it for some turnings but when looking at it I have no idea what the species is. 
I seem to always have trouble at identifying tree species and was wondering if anybody has any resources/knowledge in the field that they can offer to hopefully help people like me that struggle with this task for the future.
In addition to that if you happen to be able to identify "my" specific tree species that'd be great. Sadly when I found it all the leaves were already gone so I only have pictures of it's bark. Also the tree was found in the Pacific Northwest Washington area (not sure if that helps or not).

A:

Bruce Hoadley, "Identifying Wood: Accurate Results With Simple Tools" is my go-to when you just have a hunk of wood.
However, your tree has neighbors with leaves/needles... it's very unlikely that it's the only one of its species in the area.
I'm going to go out on a limb (* see what I did there?) and say that you've got some sort of spruce/pine/fir.
