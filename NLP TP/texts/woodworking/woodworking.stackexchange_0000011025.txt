Q:

Levelling off a surface for veneer

I've been making a pretty basic case from plywood and would like to apply some veneer.  Unfortunately, one surface needs levelling out because the plywood was a tiny bit warped.  I don't have pictures to hand but can upload some if needed.
My plan is to apply wood filler then sand it down... but maybe there's a better way?  Thanks in advance.
EDIT: The warp is not huge (a couple of mm at the worst point) but it's present on the top surface, which butts up against the side.  So, at the point where the warp is at it's worst, the side piece sits slightly proud.  I could sand down the side piece.  Sounds like that would be a more robust option, but perhaps less aesthetically pleasing.

thanks for all your thoughts and suggestions.  In the end, partly because of the tools I had at my disposal, I just gambled on using a filler â€“ in this case, Big Boy Body Filler.
Aside from the fact that the filler smells bad and creates horrible fine dust when being sanded, it went quite well.
My veneering skills are now the limiting factor.
