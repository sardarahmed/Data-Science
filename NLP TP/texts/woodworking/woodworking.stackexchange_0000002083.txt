Q:

Type of wood glue-up used in some Ikea furniture?

Some Ikea furniture, such as the Norden table series, uses a distinctive type of striped wood for the large flat surfaces.  These surfaces appear to be many pieces of approximately 1–⅜ × ½ inch slats of wood combined together into a larger piece.  What is this type of wood and how is it made?
To be clear, I'm not looking for the species of tree the wood came from, but rather the name and manufacturing technique used to make this sort of composite structure.

A:

This is called a butcher block. It comes in two types - edge grain (like in the Norden tables), where the surface shows the edge (long) grain of the pieces of wood:

And end grain, where the surface shows the end grain of the pieces of wood:

Butcher block is made from small pieces, which are glued together. Since wood glue is stronger than the wood it binds, there is no need for any more fastening of the wood pieces. A butcher block in general is a more economical way of creating large wooden surfaces. 
An end-grain butcher block is tougher than an edge grain, since the end-grain is tougher.
Butcher block construction is commonly used for cutting boards and for kitchen counter tops.

A:

One thing to watch out for: butcher-block veneers, and plastic laminates with this pattern printed into them, also exist. Of course these have very different durability characteristics than real butcher-block. Ikea is somewhat notorious for veneer-over-MDF construction; I would hope they were clear about what you're buying but you may want to ask
Similarly, butcher-block construction's durability will depend upon what wood is being used. Again, you may need to ask.
(I have an old tabletop in my basement that looks like butcher-block on one side and a completely different construction on the other, and I have no idea yet what's between them.)
