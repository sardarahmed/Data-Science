Q:

Recommendations for securing a high torque drill with a larger bit

This is not a major problem, but I recently encountered an issue in which I was drilling a medium sized hole, about 1.5", in a small piece of treated wood. The bit was a fairly new and fairly sharp spade bit. I clamped the wood, but the electric drill kept yanking itself out of my hands. When I was done, my hands were sore and the hole was so ragged as to be almost useless. I've searched various places for the answer, but I am not sure how to word my request so as to get the information I want.
So I guess the question is this: How do I secure an electric drill sufficiently to make a smooth hole? Is my only solution a drill press?

A:

It sounds like you're running your bit too slowly.  Spade bits are pretty sensitive to low speeds.  A faster speed (and less feed pressure) will result in less material being removed with each pass.  This, in turn leads to less force on the wood, resulting in less tearing of the fibers.  This tearing of the fibers, instead of cleanly cutting them, is what causes the ragged hole, and the ragged hole is what causes the catching.
If your spade bit has a "snail" (a lead screw that pulls the bit into the wood) you won't be able to slow your feed.  I don't recommend this type of bit for woodworking.
Another possibility is that you're not maintaining a consistent angle while drilling.
