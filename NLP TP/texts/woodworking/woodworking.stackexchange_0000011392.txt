Identification of vintage wood lathe tail stock with 1/2-20 threaded arbor

I have inherited a wood lathe (Spiegel "Precision Bilt" Model 87B630).  The tail stock uses an 0.81" (assuming this is 13/16") diameter keyed shaft, and the live center screws into it with a 1/2-20 thread.  I am trying to source a drill chuck to mount on the tail stock, but I don't know how to describe what I'm looking for.  The shaft is definitely not tapered and is prevented from rotating by a set screw and keyway.  I believe the lathe dates from the 60's.  Was this a standard design that is no longer used, and if so, what it is called?

A:

After a bit of research, I found that many impact drills also use a 1/2-20 thread to attach the chuck.  I guess that due to the nature of what you're doing with an impact drill the chuck has a limited lifetime, so they're made to be easily replaced.  Once I had that figured out, it was a simple matter to find one.  (I happened to find mine on ebay).

Here it is installed on my vintage lathe:
