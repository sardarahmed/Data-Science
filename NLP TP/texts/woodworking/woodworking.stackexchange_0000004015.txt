Q:

What are my options when laminating wood with butt joints?

I plan on starting to laminate soon. I was hoping to just do long pieces with each piece of wood would be as long as the the entire work. However, after looking at my stock, In order to get the best thickness I have to cut up the lengths to account for some warping. 
I see on some lamination finger joints are used. I am just working with pine and don't have the means to do efficient fingers joints. I want to do just butt joints as the face of the wood should bear most of the burden. 
Do I actually need to "glue" the butt joints together before laminating them to another piece? Do I work like I would a normal whole piece and just laminate the whole thing with clamps on either end?

A:

One sure way to join end-to-end pieces in a lamination is to use scarf joints (also called scarph joints).

You can readily cut the joints by making tapered cuts on your table saw by using a commercial jig 

or by using a homemade jig.

Of course, there are many different commercial offerings and, likewise,many different ways to construct your own.  I like the homemade version shown here because of the clamping feature, which makes it easier and safer to use.  It would be a good choice for your projects since it sounds like you are planning to make many cuts in the process of making your laminated members.
You can glue the scarf joints and the laminations in one fell swoop, but it will be cumbersome and tricky to hold everything in position, apply glue and set the clamps.  Better would be to glue the scarfs, then do the laminations.
Ideally the face laminates would be one piece, but the scarf joints will work perfectly well.  There is little concern with regard to the inner layers, especially if you stagger the scarfs so they do not overlap.
