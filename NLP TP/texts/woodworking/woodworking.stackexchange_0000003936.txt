Q:

What is an electric planer (hand tool) good for?

This may be an opinion question...
Someone recently gave me an old electric planer similar to

And I'm wondering whether there is any task where it would really have an advantage over other tools such as hand planes, a thickness planer, a belt sander, etc.
LATE ADDITION TO THE QUESTION: How would one of these do for the frequently-asked question about initial paint removal from boards being recycled? The blades are certainly a lot cheaper than those of a "lunchbox" planer if the paint makes a mess of them. On the other hand, it has little to no dust collection, which could be hazardous if there's lead in the paint. Just a thought...

Electric planers are coarse tools for coarse work.  As such, you won't see one used by a fine furniture maker for anything beyond the rough dimensioning of stock (removing gross amounts of twist, waney edges, etc.), if indeed he/she uses one at all.  I might use one for removing a dirty surface of a board prior to running it through a powered planer/jointer, just to save the wear on my planer knives.
Usually these are used by job sites for rough dimensioning of things.  For example, I used one once to trim the protruding tops of some deck joists prior to screwing down deck boards.  If you have a stud that's just a bit too wide to fit in a space, trim it down with an electric planer.  And the list goes on.
Historically, the job of the electric planer was done by a scrub plane.

I'm not sure you're going to find a ton of woodworkers using these for fine woodworking or furniture construction, but they are commonly used by construction workers/general contractors for things like shaving down doors, evening out floor joists, etc.
