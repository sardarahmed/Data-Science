Q:

Edge joining three 6' 2x10" and 4 sturdy hairpin legs for a dining table, is it sturdy enough?

I'm planning to do my first dining table. I know most of my research tells me that well clamped glued edges can support the table.
The thing is, I plan to use hairpin legs so the weight will be distributed at the corners but I'm thinking maybe I should reinforce the bottom?
Note: I don't have a fancy table saw to probably create some sophisticated joinery.

A:

It should be strong enough. The boards should have square and straight edges, most construction lumber is not. The lumber must be straight, dry, and of good quality. SEE: comments above.
You could just assemble it just using cleats on the under side with no glue just screws, this would be the simplest method.
