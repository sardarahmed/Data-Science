Q:

Why is 48" too deep for a workbench?

One article on workbench design said the following was a basic mistake of first time builders:

Building the DIY workbench too deep

There are many reasons that workbenches plans aren’t 48” deep. The
  workbench is a lot less useful if it’s that deep. Here’s a hint, the
  benchtop should be less deep than your casework to make it easier to
  work on the casework.

They don't really explain this too well. What are the "many reasons" 48" is too deep?
I am building a workbench that is not just for woodworking but metalworking tasks like supporting tools such as a 3-ton arbor press. Also, I may be working with 4x8 sheet goods.

A:

How many things are you building that are more than 24" deep?  Too deep of a workbench prevents you from reaching the back of whatever you are working on.  I can only think of a few things I have built ever that were deeper than 24", and almost everything else would have been a pain to build on a wider bench.
You mention supporting tools such as your arbor press.  My experience has been that while it seems like a good idea at first to put those things on your bench, it doesn't work all that well.  The work surface should be as open as possible, to allow for the most versatile use of the space.  If you need to mount tools to it temporarily, look into a system that uses hitch receivers to 'plug in' different vices and presses on an as needed basis.
Finally, depending upon the types of projects you are doing, you may want to consider totally different benches for metal work vs wood work.  I wouldn't want to work on a nice piece of hardwood furniture on the same bench I used for repairing a chainsaw and welding.
