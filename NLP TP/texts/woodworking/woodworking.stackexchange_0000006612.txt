Q:

How well does Walnut take stain?

I'm making a coffee table and want to use either Walnut or Chestnut. But here's the deciding question/factor because I know that Chestnut takes stain relatively well. But how well does Walnut take stain?

A:

Yes, Walnut does accept stain and dyes well in the sense that it does not suffer from blotchiness nor does it specifically require pre-stain conditioners.  It is obviously a dark color to begin with which does limit the range of stain colors you can apply to it.
I know it is generally frowned upon to stain walnut, but case in point, I did a project where I ended up with a lot of sapwood throughout and the coloring of the project was really inconsistent. I ended up applying an alcohol-based dye to the wood to generalize the color across the project.  I also filled the grain, and used a stain in the grain filler to better match the color.  I was happy with the results.
