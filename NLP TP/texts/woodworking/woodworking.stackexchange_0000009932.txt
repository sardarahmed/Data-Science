Q:

Threaded inserts

I have a pedestal dinette table and the top is held in place by 4 threaded inserts into wood the screwed in place.  My problem is the threaded inserts will not hold and before you know it the table tops rocks up and down and from side to side.  How can I get the inserts to stay put?

A:

Epoxy will work as mentioned in the comments. There are two other possibilities I can think of. One is to drill out the area where the threaded inserts are and glue in a dowel. Once that glue is cured, drill the proper hole to fit the threaded insert. This is a good general solution to many situations where a screw no longer holds. The other option is to find a threaded insert with a matching inside diameter that has a larger outside diameter.
