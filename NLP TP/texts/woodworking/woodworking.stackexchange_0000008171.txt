Q:

What is this hand tool with handles similar to a spokeshave? It has different selectable profiles around the edge of a disc

Can anyone identify this? Woodworking tool?

A:

This looks like a beading scratch-stock.
Beading is a decorative detail added to the edges of boards to make them less prone to damage and to hide gaps in joinery or around doors.  This tool creates them by scraping the workpiece with the metal blade.  This is not a "cutting" operation because the blade is held perpendicular with the workpiece.  In this case there are several different profiles that you could choose from by rotating the metal piece in the center.

A:

I found it! - Windsor Beader Type 1 - 1885
