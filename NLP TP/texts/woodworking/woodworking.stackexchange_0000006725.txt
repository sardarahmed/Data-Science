Q:

Are these work desk joints strong enough?

For my first woodworking project I'd like to build a polygon shaped, heavy duty work desk. I've modeled the desk with all necessary pieces in Fusion 360. I wanted my mortise and tenon joints connecting 100x60mm rails to 100x100mm legs to have 50mm deep tenons with pegs for strength, and my 90 degree joints accommodate this. Unfortunately due to the polygon with 135 degree angles, I need to adjust my interior joints to 30mm deep tenons without pegs. Making matters worse, I don't have room for the mortise on the outside 135 degree legs so I can add additional rails where the table top sections join.
Will these joints be strong enough?
I've linked to the 3D model in the text, but for those unable to load here are some renders:

A:

This design is plenty stout and has lots of extra strength built in to cope with material inconsistency and intermittent stresses put upon it. Those are excellently beefy pegged mortise and tenon joints in good proportion to the project. This method of joinery has been the gold standard for hundreds of years of solid furniture making and if built with even a minimum of care, this desk will likely outlive you and some number of descendants.
