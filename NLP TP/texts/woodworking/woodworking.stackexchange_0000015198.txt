Q:

White spots after sanding off stain

First woodworking project here, sanding a table that had previously been stained to get it to be smoother. I worked my way up from 120 to 220 and then lightly sanded with 320. Now there are these funny white spots everywhere that sort of resemble skid marks. The white spots are slightly raised. Any idea what it could be? 

A:

I agree with graphus's statement that it needs more sanding to get ride of those marks.  I would add, to save you a lot of sanding time.  If you have a hand plane such as a smoothing plane, you can remove those marked much faster than sanding.
