Q:

Design considerations for garage storage shelf

I am considering building garage shelves based upon a design I found online. The shelf will hold storage bins and boxes.
This is the design plan:

Does this plan have any obvious design flaws or other considerations?
My shelf will be 15' long. I was thinking 3 legs, so both ends and one in the middle which would be at the halfway point.
I like this design because typical garage shelf designs I've seen have 2x4 frames with plywood shelves and the 2x4 frames end up taking up 3.5" of space that cut off the space you can use to put in boxes.
Thanks in advance for your input.
Here are some photos from the design plans.

Overall it's a good solid design and it's pretty common, other than often it's plywood for the shelving material.
I only have 1 concern, 7.5' of span is a long span not to have vertical supports.  even for 2x4s.  I think you'll get a lot of sag.  I suggest 1 of 2 different solutions, either have 2 sets of supports (every 5 feet) or turn the 2x4s 90 degrees if the 2x4s are standing on edge they won't sag.
