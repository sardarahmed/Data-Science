Q:

How to freshen wooden box

I have an old Chess set which has been in storage in what would appear to be less than ideal conditions. (Photo taken with flash.)

One half of the box (on one side only, ie the half that is not shown in the image is as fresh as the left side here) is very dull looking. Other than the colour there is no obvious damage. I do not know what has happened to it.
What is the easiest way to achieve uniform appearance?
Edit: the "damaged" side was uppermost I believe, and there were other things on top. I did not notice excessive amounts of dust around it. Wiping with alcohol does not have any effect.

A:

I would first clean the whole thing up with mineral spirits (not alcohol) and then try something like feed n wax on it.  Definitely test this only on a small section (preferably a non visible section) first to see how it looks compared to the existing finish. 
Alternatively I would recommend a natural danish oil.  I think any colorless oil finish will darken the damaged side enough to blend it right into the non-damaged side, and danish oil has the advantage of also being a varnish so it will provide additional protection from water.
Either way whatever you use, you should try to test it on a small area that is not easily visible to see the results before finishing the entire piece.
