Q:

Make tongue and groove on table saw versus router

I have some finish carpenters joining hardwood panels together with tongue and groove joints. They have access to a basic cast iron router table, heavy duty Bosch router, and high-quality tongue and groove shaper bits. However, they prefer to do the work on the table saw.
They say they get more repeatable results from the table saw. They say it is hard to control the height of the router bit and it can vary slightly from run to run, and it is hard to recover the exact correct height when changing bits. With the table saw they do a fence adjustment, which they claim is easier and more reliable than trying to set the height on the router bit.
Is this preference for the table saw reasonable or is there a reason why the router should be preferred?
Note that all the joints are along the sides of the boards. There are no end joints.

I've done both and they're both fine.  A router lift and a fence with micro-adjust will get you results just as good as a table saw.  If they're working with a cheaper router base mounted under a board style router table and a clamp-down fence it'll be a pain though.
Like most things in woodworking, there's more than one way to do this effectively.  Personally my favorite is to use a slot-cutter on a router table.  That way you don't have to stand anything up on edge.  But if they're more comfortable with the table saw I wouldn't second-guess them.  In general it's frustrating to be micromanaged.
