Q:

Can you identify the screws used in my folding chairs

I have several teak folding deck chairs to restore. Some screws in a sheath(?) are missing. I took a complete sample to a local, national brand tool and hardware store. The store did not stock it and had no advice on where to find it. I left without asking exactly what to call this multi-part screw as I continue my search. 
See picture the pictures below

What am I looking for?

A:

It's called either a 'Sex Bolt' or a 'Binding Post Bolt'.
