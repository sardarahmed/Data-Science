Q:

How do I rip a 1 x 6 equally with a 45 degree bevel?

How do I divide a 1x6 equally to make two 45 degree edge French cleats?

A:

Lots of good information in the other answers, but if your OCD is firing up, set the 45 degree blade to rip a smaller chunk closer to the fence (say, 2.5"), then run the offcut through the saw again at that same fence setting. Easier than math, and accounts for multiple slightly different width boards.

A:

You don't have to divide the board equally to make workable French cleats. 
If you need to do multiples that match just pick a fence position that approximately divides the boards you're starting with, write down that setting so you don't forget it, then rip each subsequent one the same as the first. Attach the same wider or narrower piece to the wall each time.
