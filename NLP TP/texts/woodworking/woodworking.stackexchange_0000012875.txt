Q:

Retain smell of wood on a tool and also protect it?

I recently cut down a (dead) pinyon pine and I'm using part of it to make a handle for a hammer. While working with this wood the smell of it is out-of-this-world amazing.
Once the handle is finished what can I use to protect it such that I can still smell the wood?

A:

You can't.
It doesn't matter if you put nothing on it the smell you got was because the wood was being worked and in common with other species that smell lovely during processing — including genuine rosewoods which can have a sort-of rose smell and various resinous conifers which give off that piney/turpentiney odour that some love and some don't — you can expect it to diminish to the point that you can't smell it unless you put your nose right on the wood, and perhaps even then you might need to scrape it or sand it to release the aroma.
Even with wood that's used for its smell, species like cedar which are packed full of particularly aromatic compounds, the odour only lingers if the wood is left unfinished, and in a confined space — the same wood used to line a blanket chest, if left out as loose boards will not have a noticeable odour after a fairly short time.
If you're particularly enamoured of the smell I suggest you horde scraps of the tree and sand or plane a little of it every time you go into the workshop :-) For a more permanent solution you might look at essential oils to see if one or a combination give you something close.
