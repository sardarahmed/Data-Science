Q:

Why does my router have countersunk holes on its bottom plate?

My router has countersunk holes in its base. What am I supposed to attach between the bit and the base?

A:

The large countersink that surrounds the bit is for guide bushings for template work. The smaller holes are probably for the auxiliary fence attachment.
