Q:

Homemade belt sander belts (3X18)

I got the idea of looking to see what it cost to make homemade sandpaper belts for my belt sander would be. For me less than a $1 per belt. Math being about $30 for 20-25 Yards of sandpaper (roll) and $10 for epoxy. Around a good belt is $2.50 and cheap is $1.50 (cheap ones are not to fun...). I have seen a little video on this which is the reason I say epoxy. This person did a 1/2" over lap after filing the sand and then clued with epoxy. Clamping the epoxy is very flexible but I would not know what epoxy to use. And if epoxy is a good choice. Note: Roll on sanding paper is on a cloth like my current belts. So my questions being,
Q1) What glue would be best (Or Cloth tape?)?
Q2) Is 1/2" overlap ideal?
Q3) thinking a 20 degree cuts for the joint.
Can not think of anything else but anything on making these would be great. People do it and stuff, but I can not find how to do it! 

A:

There are many different resources, or how to videos doing  quick search, but here is where I would start.
Make Your Own Sanding Belts - FastCap

The key points are he is using pieces from drum sander belts, but whatever you are using should work the same.
Mark your length on each end of the strip, then overlap them so the two marks line up, and then cut the angle on both ends of the paper at the same time with a single cut. This way the angle doesn't matter, and the straightness of the cut do not matter. They will match up perfectly.
Then use FastCap speed tape, double sided tape on the back side over the joint, using enough to extend each direction from the seam a couple of inches. Trim the excess flush on the edges of your new belt. Then once you put it on the sander, use a roller on the taped portion of the belt to ensure a good bond with the tape.
