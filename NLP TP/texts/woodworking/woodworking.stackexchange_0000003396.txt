Q:

What are the limitations of a pocket hole jig?

My tendency is to grab a pocket hole jig for everything. But I'm sure it's not always the best choice.
What are the limitations of a pocket hole jig?

A:

There are really 3 factors on whether or not to use a pocket hole jig.  

Aesthetics - Can you hide/fill the joint?
Strength - There are a few good writeups on the relative strength of pocket holes vs every other joint - https://woodgears.ca/joint_strength/pockethole.html is a good one. 
The last factor is what I like to think of as wood fever. There is a certain mindset that seems to think that bringing metal to a joint which can be done purely in wood is a sin, and Saint Underhill will come and smite you for doing it.

Personally I love pocket joinery. Its tough enough for all my projects (especially if supplemented with glue) and does not consume huge amounts of time tweaking the fit.  I have seen Norm Abrams use it repeatedly and as far as I am concerned if its good enough for him it works for me.
