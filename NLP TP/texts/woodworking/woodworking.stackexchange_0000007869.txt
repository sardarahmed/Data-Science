Q:

Thickness of back-panels, horizontal planks and vertical planks

Our walls are made of Reinforced Cement Concrete (RCC) with a thickness of 15 cm.
The walls have 15mm gypsum plaster on both the sides.
We are doing interior design - installation of wardrobes and modular kitchen.
The installations are made of teak wood. No ply wood is used.
What will be the suitable thickness of the following considering the wall thickness of 15cm Reinforced Cement Concrete(RCC)?

The back-panel used in wardrobes and kitchen
Horizontal wooden planks
Vertical wooden planks 
Doors of the wardrobes and kitchen cabinets

My carpenters are simply suggesting 1½" inch for every board. I am of the opinion that

¼" (6mm) for back panel
1½" (37mm) for load bearing longer panels and outer most vertical panels
½" (12mm) for all other horizontal and vertical panels. 

would be enough. I would like to confirm what is prevalent in the industry.

A:

There is no way I would use 37mm teak for the unseen back panel of piece of furniture.  Personally, I would use plywood or hardboard; certainly 6mm solid wood would be fine (and for the kitchen cupboards in particular, I would consider using a cheaper wood than teak).
Your carpenters seem to be grossly over-building the furniture.  I wouldn't use more than 12mm for any of the vertical panels.  Horizontals are more complex - have a look online for plans of the sort of furniture you want.  My gut feel is that 37mm (or possibly even 50mm) for the worktop would be right; for shelves in kitchen cupboards 25mm;  For the bottoms of drawers, 12mm or possibly thinner.
