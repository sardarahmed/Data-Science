Q:

Where are the dust extractor classes officially defined?

I'm trying get definitive information about the three dust extractor/vacuum classes (L, M, H).  I searched a couple of government agencies related to occupational safety and nothing turned up (or I got thousands of results because it logically or'd my search).  I'm looking for the actual document/specification that defines these classes (and the agency that authored it).
To be clear:  I'm not looking for "a" definition of these--I'm looking for "the official" definition/spec.

A:

After a bit of research it appears that the definition you are looking for is included in appendix AA of European Standard DIN EN 60335-2-69 link here.
This chart, which I found here points the way.
Unfortunately, the standard itself costs about 400 US dollars, so it's difficult to confirm.  The information I've gathered indicates that the classification level (L, M, or H) is based on the allowable exposure level over a defined time period, which in turn is based on the characteristics of the dust (toxicity and particle size).
