Circular Saw Throws Wood at End of Cut

I bought a circular saw recently. I noticed that sometimes as I finish a cut, the saw throws the free end of the board forward a couple of feet. Most of the time, the board just drops as expected, but every now and then, it gets projected. It doesn't seem like a huge deal, but I was curious to know if there is a technique to prevent this.
The wood I am cutting is SPF. I believe I've usually seen this happen when I am cutting off smaller pieces, from 2" to 12" in length. I am making crosscuts across boards that are 2" to 3" wide, and I make the cut in about 1-2 seconds.

A:

I learned this technique from my house-builder father from a young age: Do your cross cut (or any cut) normally but pause very near the end of the cut with the saw still running. Then focus on keeping the saw straight and zing the last bit. Use plenty of follow through as you shoot the saw away from the cut and the waste piece drops to the floor.
