Q:

How can I control the "reddening" of Red Alder as it dries?

On the top is a freshly turned Red Alder bowl.

As it dries, the alder bowl turns splotchy red.  Different bowl redden different amounts.  How can I control the amount the bowl turns red?  Ideally it would either not turn red, or completely turn red.

A:

Streaming the alder for 15 minutes in a vegetable steamer prevented any reddening. I think I'd also get a different color if i used more aged wood. Thanks for the suggestion @encnerwal!
Update: oxalic acid will remove all reddening and vinegar will remove most.  The bowl ends up a bit more of a yellow color overall.
