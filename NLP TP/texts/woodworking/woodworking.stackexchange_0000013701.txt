Q:

Fastening handle to 1/8 inch plywood

My students are making plywood shields / Coat of Arms.  I'm hoping to cut costs as much as possible.  So my plan is to use strips of fabric or fake leather to make an arm band on the back. My question is: Could I staple-gun fabric to 1/8" plywood, or would there not be enough material for the staples to catch on?  1/4" plywood raises the cost by 50%.
If the staple gun wouldn't work, does anybody have suggestions on how to attach some form of handle solidly to the back of 1/8" plywood?  Ideally, we wouldn't be drilling through to the front of the shields. Thanks in advance!

A:

Contact cement.  I use Barge brand.  It is used to glue soles on shoes.  Should be plenty strong for your application if you let it cure to full strength before applying too much stress to the bonds.
If you are willing to drill through, then you can use hollow rivets to give some mechanical strength to the bond.  Rivets are were one of the main ways of fastening metal for a long time.
