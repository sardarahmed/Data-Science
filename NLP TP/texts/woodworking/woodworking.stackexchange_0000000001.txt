Q:

How do I sharpen a chisel/plane blade?

I'm getting started with woodworking and am looking to refine my technique for sharpening chisel/plane blades. Currently, I just have a cheap double-sided water stone, but am now looking to get a "proper" setup which will hold me moving forward and then also refining my technique. Any suggestions?
Edit:
Specifically, what type of water stones and diamond stone do I need, should I get a honing guide, what else is must have vs a nice to have, etc. Then what process do I go through to "correctly" use these tools.

A:

Sharpening is a lot trickier than one would expect. In order to have a sharp blade you need to have two polished sides meeting one another: the back of the plane iron (or chisel) and the bevel. A couple of tips really helped me as I was sharpening. 

Sharpen up to 8000 grit. I used to have harbor freight stones and they only went up to 1000 grit--not nearly enough. 
Keep the back flat and the bevel at 25 degrees (or whatever degree it uses). A honing guide usually helps maintain the bevel, but if you don't have one, rock the plane iron until the bevel snaps level, then drag across the stone. 
You know you're sharp when you can pare away at end grain on a soft wood (e.g., pine or alder). 
Continually check the "reflectivity" of the meeting edges (i.e., the back and the bevel) to make sure the surfaces are polished. Look at @Peter Grace's image toward the meeting edges--that's what you're looking for is a window-like reflectivity at the meeting edges. 

Good luck!

You mention that you have a sharpening stone.  One improvement might also be to make an angled guard that you run atop the stone that helps to impart the proper chisel angle.  Something like the below might help to ensure you get a razor-sharp edge at the proper angle.
