Q:

How to mount a router plate in a cabinet top?

I plan on installing a router plate in a custom cabinet top for my shop. I can either route the edges to the depth of the plate to create a recess for a flush table top/plate surface or use plate leveling screws.  
 
I am a bit concerned about the leveling plate screws staying firmly attached to the underside of MDF board with the stress from the router operating and only having support at the corners, whereas the recess ledge design will provide uniform support. The leveling screws will offer finer tuned height adjustment to match the cabinet top surface but I wonder just how much finesse is needed. I have read of people adjusting the top late alignment to several thousandths of an inch and wonder if that is necessary or merely obsessive?  It seems that gluing some thin cardboard or other material to the underside of the plate would also serve as adequate shims. IF you have a router cabinet, what has been your experience been?
BTW do you screw down the plate or simply let it rest in the top cutout?

A:

Permanent mount?  Route it in, get as obsessive as you want on the depth adjustment and epoxy it in place.
You can use leveling screws as well, again if permanent , I would apply thread lock on the final stage of alignment to keep secure.
I do not recommend "cardboard" shims, it will continue to compress over time.  Use sheet metal, foil, etc.
