Q:

What is a hardware attachment for dowel rods that allow for running wire through the ends?

I made this tensegrity cube using dowel rods and eye screws. The eye screws were hard to install and didn't work well due to twisting and coming loose. I'm imagining a cap like hardware for dowels that allow you to attach other things. In this case running wire through them. Do such "caps" exist?

A:

Try this location (there may be others, but this came up almost immediately when I Googled "dowel caps".) for a selection of plastic dowel caps with eyelets. (see below from the afore mentioned link Unfortunately, at this location they want to sell them in quantities of 1000's.  I'm certain you can find sites that will sell to you in smaller amounts.

Functionally it should do the job for you.  It makes me consider doing some tensegrity constructions of my own.  Hey, I'm a child of the 60's. Myself, I would probably consider using wooden caps, but that's up to the designer/creator of the project.
