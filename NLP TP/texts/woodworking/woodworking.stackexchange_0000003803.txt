Q:

How to bind wooden pieces together, but detachable

I want to bind these pieces together, but not a permanent one. I want to be able to like pop one out whenever I want. Kinda like a Lego bond.
I thought of putting magnets on them but couldn't find a suitable one and I just can't think of any other nice solution. Any idea?

The Idea here is to cover part of my wall with this
I want to be able to change it over time and give it a new look
They are only needed to be attached to each other like a brick wall in the shape you see in the picture (one going over the half of two others)
It's necessary to have any extra metal or stuff used other than these pieces to be out of sight
I don't want to be forced to take it all apart to change the shape

A:

You could try Lincoln Log™ style

A nice DIY write up at Lumberjocks
At least they are still made of wood.

You could use round magnets like those found here.

You'd want to make the hole with a Forstner bit, and hold them in with epoxy. I'd suggest keeping the magnets away from each other until the epoxy has completely set to ensure they don't pull each other out of their holes.

You could try Tinker Toy™ style and make or buy the small connecting dowels.

On a sad note, it seems that Tinker Toys are now made out of plastic instead of wood. I'd vote for this option simply for nostalgia's sake.
