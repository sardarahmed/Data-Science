Q:

What is the type of wood that is often purchased in bulk at the hardware store?

I live in the central part of the United States. When I go to a local hardware store (such as Menards or Lowes) there are wooden boards of different thicknesses and length just labeled "Untreated Lumber".
When I go to the hardware store and purchase an untreated 2"x4", what sort of wood type am I purchasing?

A:

Dimensional framing lumber is often referred to as SPF which stands for Spruce, Pine and Fir. 
You will likely also find cedar and pressure treated lumber in the green or brown variants
