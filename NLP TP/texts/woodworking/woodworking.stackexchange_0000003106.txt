Q:

How do I exclude a cutpath area in VCarve?

I'm using a VCarve and a ShopBot CNC to attempt an excluded area from being milled. Regarding the image below, I can only figure out how to remove the outer area in red, as the green area is in the cutpath of the red area.
How can I create pocket cutpath with excludes an area within it?

If someone has enough points to add keywords, CNC, and VCarve would be useful terms.

A:

Figured it out after watching a Youtube video. In short, two vector paths need to be selected for the pocket cut path (a starting and ending vector).
