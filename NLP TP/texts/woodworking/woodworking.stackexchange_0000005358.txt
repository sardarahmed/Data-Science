Q:

Hot Hide Glue Guidelines

The instructions for my hot hide glue pearls say to keep the temperature at 60°C.

How forgiving is the holding temperature? If you overheat the glue, at what point will it break down and lose its "glueyness"?
How long can you cook it for? 
How many times can you reheat it (and add more fresh glue)?

A:

I contacted Lee Valley, where I bought my glue. This was their response:

Holding temperature should be maintained accurately when using hide glue. Overheating it can lead to a decrease in its overall holding strength.
Generally speaking, the glue can be held at temperature for a work day, then refrigerated overnight. You’ll have about 4 re-heating cycles before the glue starts to break down, at which point it should be discarded.
