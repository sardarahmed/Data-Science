Q:

How to use a router to cut a thick wood board

Having purchased a trim router just recently, I'm practicing some simple woodworking.
At the moment, I have a 4 feet x 4 feet plywood board (3/4 inch thick) that I want to separate into 4 square pieces of 2 feet x 2 feet (approximately, plus or minus an inch-ish accountable to kerf).
Should I go for it with the router using a Straight bit like this one? If so, how do I cut so deep as the board thickness (3/4 inch)?

A:

If you are in a pinch and your router has a plunge base, you certainly could cut all the way through the plywood with a spiral or straight bit, using a straightedge and cutting in 1/8" deep passes. Make sure you have sacrificial material on the underside so you don't cut into your workbench or floor on the last pass.
That said, the work will go a lot faster and easier with a table saw or circular saw.

A:

Something else to always consider when using routers is that the bit is rotating perpendicular to what a saw blade would be, so when making a linear cut like you are describing, you would be surrounding the bit with material, forcing it to cut essentially on three sides. This is very taxing on both the bit and the router, and can be dangerous if you aren't used to it.
If you don't have a table saw, or a very good circular saw, you can use a jigsaw or handsaw to break down the wood into rough sizes (maybe 1/16"-1/8" oversize) and then use a straight edge and your router with a flush trim bit or a collar to get a clean and straight cut.
Routers are very versatile and useful tools when used right, but very dangerous and can lead to disappointing results when not used right.
