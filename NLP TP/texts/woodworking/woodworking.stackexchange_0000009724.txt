Q:

Will waterproof toolbox prevent rust

I have quite humid workshop and I would like to protect some smaller tools like chisels and hand planes without waxing/oiling them. 
There are some waterproof toolboxes(for example https://www.screwfix.com/p/stanley-fatmax-28-waterproof-tool-box/53892). Do these prevent all moisture from getting in or does it only protect from some accidental spills/rain etc?
My idea is to throw in the tools together with some silica packs and after few months of storage opening the toolbox, finding the tools in pristine condition. Will it work or will I be disappointed?

A:

If a toolbox is waterproof, it is generally also air tight, which would prevent water vapor from entering the box once it is sealed.  The water vapor already in the box could cause rust, so that is where the silica packets come in.  They will remove the moisture from the air.  If the box isn't fairly air tight, that dry air will be replaced with moist air until the packets can no longer absorb the moisture, at which point the tools will start to rust.
So, with the sealed box, and a sufficient amount of the silica, it should prevent rusting during storage.  A light coating of light machine oil wiped clean followed by paste wax or a product such as Protec Tool Wax or TopCoteÂ® table and tool surface sealant works well also.  Avoid silicon based products on hand tools as they can cause issues with the finish on your work piece.
