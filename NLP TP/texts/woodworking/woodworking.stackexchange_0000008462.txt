Q:

Wood Lathe Safety Drive Center: Correct Usage?

I'm just starting to learn how to use the skew chisel in spindle turning and after watching one of Alan Lacer's videos I decided to invest in a safety drive center, shown below:

He had his students actually practice dig-ins with the safety centers to see what causes the dig-in and to change future behavior to avoid them. The dig-in with the safety center causes the piece to stop turning (with adjustable "cut-offs"), which is different than what you would see with a spur drive. It seems like a good way to learn. 
I do have a question on its use. I know the tension of the pin can be adjusted via the hole on the side of the drive. Do I want any portion of the pin exposed between the cup on the end of the drive and the wood? Or do I always want to tighten the tailstock (which has a live center) such that the cup of the safety center in the headstock presses flush against the end of the wooden piece? 
Thanks for comments/direction.

A:

Friction drives allow the tail center to adjust the tension and allow or constrain spinning of the drive in reference to the blank.  
The drive is actually the outer rim, not the inner point.  The inner point is more for registering the blank and within reason, any tension is probably appropriate as long as the tail stock provides enough tension to turn the blank.
