Q:

Can I repair this bent part in my thickness planer?

I've just discovered a bent part in my thickness planer and I'm wondering if it's repairable. 
The part is the slightly orange part, between the blades and the in-feed roller:

As well as having a visible kink in it, it now sits so low it blocks wood when trying to feed it through. Can I do anything about this? Maybe bend it to follow the curve of the cutter head? Any help is much appreciated, thanks!

A:

This looks to be the shroud the helps direct woodchips out of the exhaust port.
My guess is that it either something got caught on it while you fed it through or something hit it from kickback when you were planing.
If you're precise enough with a hammer, you should be able to remove the shroud from the planer and beat it back into straightness.  Use a metal vise (or really any semi-robust piece of metal) as an anvil to hit against.
If you don't trust yourself to do this, you might consider taking it to a machinist.  They should be able to straighten it out no problem.  Otherwise, if you know your make and model, you should be able to contact the manufacturer for a replacement part.  Be prepared to pay quite a bit for the part, though.
