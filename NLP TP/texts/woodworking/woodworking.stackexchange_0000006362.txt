Q:

Do I have to treat the wood before I assemble it?

I am planning on making a sofa. I have my tools and my wood. Do I have to apply any type of treatment to the wood before I assemble it? I mean at the end I'm going to be stapling textiles on it and adding pillows and cushions.

A:

Since a sofa will almost surely be an indoor piece of furniture, completely protected from the weather, you are fine leaving it untreated. Every commercial sofa that I have seen the inside of is constructed of untreated wood.
