Q:

Is there a way to hide the adhesive line from iron-on edge banding

I applied iron-on edge banding to the edges of a piece of veneered MDF. The edge banding and the veneer on the MDF are both walnut. The adhesive on the back of the edge banding is white and is quite visible against the dark walnut. I'm not planning on staining before applying finish.
Any suggestions for how to hide the adhesive line?

If the banding is thick enough, you could use a string inlay tool to cut a narrow groove where the adhesive is. Then inlay some stringing (very thin strips of wood) to fill the groove. You could use more walnut if you just want to get rid of the line -- the stringing should mostly disappear.
