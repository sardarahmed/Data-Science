Q:

What type of wood can I use to achieve this finish?

I’m relatively new to fine woodworking and I’m building something that needs a color/finish like this piece
Any ideas what kind of wood, stain, etc this might be or what I could use to mimic it? The wood is a relatively grainless looking wood from that picture.
Originally I was thinking of using poplar because it’s cheap and I have a bunch laying around but I’m not so sure that would produce a similar look.

The web page for that piece tells us that it's made of "Solid + Manufactured Wood" using "Okume veneer, wood and engineered wood."

or what I could use to mimic it?

The piece appears to be heavily stained or glazed, so there's not a lot of grain showing. If you're going to do try to match that, then it probably won't matter much which closed-grain hardwood you choose.
Matching an existing finish can be tricky, so you'll probably need to experiment some. Pick the wood that you're going to use, and then make up some samples so that you can try different options.
