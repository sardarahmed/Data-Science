Q:

What is the weight limit for shaker pegs?

I am looking to build a simple wood coat rack and would like to utilize shaker pegs to hold the coats.  I am a bit concerned with the strength of the individual pegs, especially during the winters (i live in the Midwest United States).  Does anyone know how much weight each peg should be able to handle (assuming its properly secured)?
The ones I am looking at are 3 1/2 inches long.  I think the insertable length is 1 inch.

A:

How much weight they will bear is dependent in part on how they are installed - as with any wood object, the grain orientation matters. Arranging the grain to be vertical will be strongest.
In practical terms, if you hang coats (even heavy ones, multiple, and/or with junk in pockets) rather than use them for gym equipment they are likely to be just fine if they are at all well made. Those look to be a bit bigger than the ones that have all that sort of stuff hung on them in my hallway. 
They were originally designed to be able to hang (lightweight) chairs, mirrors, cabinets and lamps as well as clothing from. 
  
The usual problem, rather than breakage, is that the hole they are in deforms or loosens and the pegs fall out. Few vendors seem to have opted to thread the peg and hole, which I think helps with that problem. Wedging from the back can also help, but requires mounting the pegs to the board before the board is mounted to the wall (or some creativity in wedging.)
