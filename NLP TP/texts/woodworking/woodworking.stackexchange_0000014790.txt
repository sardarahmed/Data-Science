Q:

Cutting a stack of paper into a shape with a router

Apologies if this is not the right forum, but it seems to be a place full of people who would know how to do this.
I have a stack of a paper like material (papyrus, if it makes a difference) and I need to cut it into a particular intricate shape. It is very error prone and tedious to do this with a knife, so what I was thinking is that I could get a two metal or wooden forms corresponding to the shape, then put the stack of paper between, do a rough cut around the edges, then lock in place with a vice or something like that, and then using a hand drill with a suitable bit, run around the edge of the form to cut the paper to correspond to the required shape.
I'm not particularly handy, but I am looking for some advice. Particularly:

Is this a workable approach?
Is it safe, or am I going to lose a finger or eye in the process?
What sort of drill bit should I use?
Is there a better way to achieve the same end (without spending thousands of dollars on a bunch of expensive tools)?

At commenters request here is the shape (roughly 7" wide and 8.25" tall):

Is this a workable approach?

I don't think so. I think a spinning bit is going to give you a fairly rough edge, and it also won't get into the inside corners that your shape has.

Is it safe, or am I going to lose a finger or eye in the process?

I'd think so. As long as the stack of paper is clamped tightly between two pieces of plywood it should work about the same way wood does.

What sort of drill bit should I use?

You should not use a drill bit. Drill bits are designed for drilling holes, so they mainly cut only at the end and in a direction parallel to the bit's axis. A small router, like a trim router, would be tool to use if you want to cut sideways, and you'd of course need a pattern bit or flush trim bit if you want to follow a pattern. But again, I don't think that'll give you the results you're hoping for.

Is there a better way to achieve the same end (without spending thousands of dollars on a bunch of expensive tools)?

The right way to do this would be to use a press with a custom steel rule die. Having one of these made is probably pretty expensive, but there are videos on YouTube that demonstrate ways to make your own. A hand-cranked hydraulic press could work here; you can get one at a place like Harbor Freight for under $200 new.
