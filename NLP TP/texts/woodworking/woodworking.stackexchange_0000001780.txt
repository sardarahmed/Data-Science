Q:

What's the best way to widen a butcherblock countertop?

I'm very handy in general, but I'm new to wood working. We're installing butcher block countertop. we've pre-ordered sections that are 8' x 25" x 1.5" thick.
I've done tons of research, and I'm basically all ready to start. Overall I'm feeling confident, but I just have one concern:
On one section i'd like to widen it to 45". Is it best to join this section together with a few pocket hole screws using my Kreg jig (plus glue)? Or would it be better to use miter bolts, which is the same thing I'll be using to join together my corner cuts.
Any other advise would also be great. Thanks in advance!

There's no best here, but there is definitely a good enough and that is using glue only. Just glued together the joint should be as strong as any joint in the existing material.
With the following assumptions: 

the surfaces are prepared properly — flat, very smooth (also see Note bottom);
sufficient glue is applied — there must be squeeze-out and ideally it should be over the entire span of the joint;
firm clamp pressure is used — high clamping pressure is vital for a proper glue joint to form using conventional woodworking adhesives.

Note: if the material has good square edges it might be tempting to glue them directly but if there is finish on them it must be removed beforehand. Even if the edges are unfinished you shouldn't attempt to glue them as-is. For a good glue joint to form mating surfaces should be freshly worked (ideally less than two hours prior to the glue-up for maximum joint strength). So at minimum scrape or finely sand them, although a pass with a finely-set plane would be ideal here.
