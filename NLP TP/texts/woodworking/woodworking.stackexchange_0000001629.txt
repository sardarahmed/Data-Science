Q:

What can cause a table saw to make this rattling/clacking noise?

I've just put my used Powermatic 64 Artisan's Saw together. When the belt is attached to the motor, it makes a sound that seems like something is unbalanced. When the motor spins freely without the belt attached, the sound goes away.
I have uploaded a video to youtube demonstrating both of these sounds: https://youtu.be/55UqASDmyec
Is the sound that the saw makes under load of the belt (note: there is no blade in the saw yet) normal, or is there something I need to look into? If so, what?

A:

It shouldn't be making that sound. The first unloaded run is how the saw should sound, even when it's loaded.
Have you inspected the belt for flaws? The frequency of the "rattle" seems a little high for a single nick, but if there are a few in a row, I could see that being the problem. 
My other thought is that you've got a bad bearing somewhere. My first guess would be the saw arbor, since it's not rotating when the belt is off. Rotate it by hand and feel for roughness or excessive play.
If it's not the arbor bearings, it may actually be a motor bearing. Unloaded, the rolling elements may trace a different path on the bearing races. When the cantilever load of the belt is applied, it may slightly change how the rolling elements circle the race and come into contact with a spalled portion of the race.

A:

I replaced the belt, which was worn and nicked, with a new V-drive belt from Grizzly. 
That helped a lot, but there was still a clacking sound coming from the motor. I found that I had not installed the pulley wheel correctly. Specifically, the key was too far forward which prevented the set screw from clamping down on it.
I have posted an "after" video on youtube to demonstrate the way a table saw should sound!
