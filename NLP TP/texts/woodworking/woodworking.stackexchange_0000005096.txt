Q:

Make one end of a board thicker than the other?

I have a 1"x8"x3' solid composite board that I need to cut diagonally through the 1" dimension to compensate for an unlevel underlying surface. Is there any way to do this?

A:

The best way to do this would be to put it on a slanted sled and run it through a planer repeatedly.
How you make the slanted sled is up to you.  I would consider cutting a series of wedges from plywood and gluing them to a flat piece of plywood.  You could also use shims (like for hanging a door) and nail them down to a piece of plywood.
Regardless of how you build the sled make sure that the piece you're planing is fastened securely to it (being careful not to allow your planer to hit any metal fasteners).
