Q:

Can I put a 25 gallon fish tank on an amazon basics desk?

I have a desk from amazon, it says it holds up to 200lbs. Not sure what the tank weighs when full, I’m just wondering if y’all think it’ll hold the weight with some extra support in the center maybe?

A:

With gravel and the glass , pretty close to 250 # . Not that much vertical stationary load : I would be concerned more with lateral movement . Significant lateral bracing is required. Some day someone may lean against it or someone may bump it. I see some diagonal bracing but I am not impressed. Full disclosure; I have built several stands , likely stronger than need be , and welded braces in commercial steel stands that I did not trust. I just started thinking , I doubt there are commercial 25's in the US, highly likely it is a 29 ( so 290 # all in). Some chance of a deep 20 . A 29 is 18" deep , a deep 20 is 16 " deep. Rough dimensions as my tanks in those sizes are stainless frame because they are old.
