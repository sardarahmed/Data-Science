Q:

Why keep gaps in siding of outdoor furniture project?

Below you can see a picture of a patio prep cart that I'm building for my brother. I would like to make a few design changes to the plan but I'm not sure if it would have some unforeseen negative effect down the road.

What I would like to do is implement some Tudor house design features since he just bought a Tudor home to start his family in.
One way I would do that is by painting the trim a traditional Tudor dark brown and paint the panels a more cream color.
In order for that to look nice, I think I would have to do away with the 1/4" gaps between the boards. Or maybe just use a piece of plywood. But, I'm worried that maybe the gaps are there on purpose, maybe allowing the cart to have airflow is needed? 
Can anyone tell if eliminating the gaps between the boards on the siding might somehow hurt the integrity of this patio prep cart? If it makes a difference, I plan on using cedar for this.

For those unfamiliar with the Tudor style of house (as I was), here's an example:

For the hinged door on the left side, it likely doesn't matter too much if it's made a solid panel.  I'm assuming that anything that would be kept in that cupboard long-term would be non-food and thus not caring if it had ventilation.
For the side with the fridge, I would just make the back of the cart vented to allow the fridge waste heat to escape.  You could maybe make it latticed like a trellis to dress it up a bit.  Then, you can have a solid side panel to match the hinged door.

Eliminating the gaps should have no impact on the cart's integrity.  If you allow ventilation out the back for the fridge, it shouldn't cause any issues with overheating of the fridge, either.

Yes there could be a pronounced effect without specific steps being taken to compensate. 
If you look at the orientation of the boards on the door and the visible side panel this places the longitudinal grain horizontal. The major axis of wood movement is perpendicular to this (across the width of a board, most in flat-sawn, approximately half as much in quarter-sawn). 
When the boards are attached with a 1/4" gap, this is sufficient spacing to ensure that each one moves independent of the others. But once you close up the gaps the panel can then act as though it's a single board 30" across or whatever the height is here. For any species of wood the expansion and contraction for a board that width will be significant.
To get an estimate of the expected movement for cedar specifically (I'm assuming you mean western red cedar) I used the wood shrinkage calculator on Woodweb. Plugging in some reasonable numbers expansion from driest to wettest could be nearly 1/2", which as you can imagine must be accounted for or problems will arise.
For this to work on this cart each panel would have to be attached much as you might the tabletop on a side table, where the fasteners will allow movement in a chosen direction (in this case downwards). See previous Answer for more on how you might do this.

Or maybe just use a piece of plywood. 

Using a sheet of plywood instead would eliminate these concerns.
