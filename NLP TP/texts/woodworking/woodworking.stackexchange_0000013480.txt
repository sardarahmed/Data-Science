Q:

What is this metal bar in the front of the jigsaw?

Sorry, just one more novice question about my dad's old Bosch PST 50 AE, before I buy new blades, bear with me....
What is this?

...and is it supposed to be like that and look this way? Or is it broken?

...is it not in the way of the blade?

A:

That appears to be ref. 52 in the parts diagram, simply identified as "Pin" (part no. 2 603 105 051).

But in the manual for a similar vintage model (view here on Manuall.co.uk), this is identified as the Contact Guard, possibly a last line of defence in case the user breaks, discards, or chooses not to use the sliding plastic guard.
Thankfully your jigsaw still has the plastic guard and it looks like it is in good condition so you won't have to rely on the pin.
