Q:

Alternatives to grip tape on a longboard

Making my first longboard, and I'd like to put some art on top of it. On most skateboards (like Carver for example - see pic 1) grip on the top side of the deck is achieved by using a grip tape. On other boards though (like Globe for example - see pics 2, 3) some other technique is used. It looks like it's grains of sand + glue or lacquer, which is great because you can apply colorful art on top of it.
Any one has an idea how to create such grip on the longboard's deck? How to create grains? What type[s] of glue to use?
Thanks
Carver with grip tape (not what I need)

Globe, colored, with grip that is sort of see-through (what I want to achieve)

Globe, closer look

A:

Try a good paint shop, there are numerous non-slip aggregate additives for most finishes. If you intend to use lacquer or varnish on the deck they shouls have something.
