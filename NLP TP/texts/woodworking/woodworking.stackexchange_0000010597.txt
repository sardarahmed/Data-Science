Q:

What does "Depth Control = No" on a table saw mean?

I'm looking to buy the Skilsaw SPT99-12 table saw but I noticed on the sale listing it says "Depth Control = No".
Does this mean I can't adjust the blade up and down? 
Will the blade stay in place during a cut if it is adjustable?

A:

I went to the skill saw website page for that saw
I can not find the phrase  "Depth Control = No" in the specs.
It displays a photo that clearly show the blade adjustment crank handle.

Will the blade stay in place during a cut if it is adjustable?

Yes, once you set the blade height it will not change or move up and down while you make your cut. It will only move up or down if and when you turn the adjustment crank.
I am not sure why the page you were looking at had that "no" reference for depth of cut but this is a normal table saw with an adjustable depth of cut feature. Perhaps it means no depth of cut gauge or indicator ?
It is nice portable saw. Send one to me.
