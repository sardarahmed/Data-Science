Q:

Best wood species for direct soil contact?

I am about to create a number of raised planter-boxes where i can't separate the wood and soil with plastic. So, in order to create something that will last for as long as possible I have been trying to collect information about which wood species will last the longest with direct soil contact.
I have found a fair amount information about Robinie, oak and some hardwoods like Cumaru, Jatoba and Ipe as wood species which will last a long while with direct soil contact.
But I expect that someone must have made some structures comparisons and tests, that I just have been unable to find. Can someone either tell me which species of wood will last the longest in direct soil contact. Or, even better, provide some structured study that I can take a look at?

What is the best wood species for direct soil contact?

The Forrest Products Laboratory has a lot of information on wood durability.
Here is a chart from one of their reports titled "Above and in-Ground Performance of Naturally Durable Woods in Wisconsin"

Based on this data Eastern Red Cedar is a winner.
By way of comparison to treated lumber here is a chart from a report titled "Long-Term Durability of PRessure-Treated Wood in a Severe Test Site"

The AWPA is the American Wood Protection Association. They have arrived at a set of standards for treated wood for specific situations. This standard is used by many lumber providers.  
Here is a graphic illustrating the applications and the rankings.
 
UC4B rating would be the winner for treated lumber.
