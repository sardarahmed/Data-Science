Q:

Cross Cutting Large Boards (4x8) Stock?

I occasionally get 4x8 sheets of plywood for projects, and I've heard that I should never use the rip fence for cross cuts because the peice that is being cut can get trapped in between the sawblade and the rip fence and cause kickback. 
I can't see a way to avoid using it though, as my miter gauge doesn't have enough track to travel all the way to the base of the board. Should I use the rip fence to cross cut these types of boards, or is this mroe of a task for something like a circular saw?

A:

If you are cutting large 4x8 panels you are not really cross cutting in either direction.  You do not want to use the miter gauge.  The problem is having adequate support to properly feed the panel past the blade using the fence.  To do so you need adequate support for the entire plywood panel on front, back and side of the table saw.  For the side and back this can be accomplished with run-off tables.  They can be either full tables (mobile is useful for other shop tasks) or tilt up platforms attached to the table.  Support in front of the table cannot obstruct your travel as you push the panel forward.  I use support arms that mount to the fence rail as shown in this project image from Lumberjocks.com.

With this setup you are performing a regular rip cut, and not a crosscut.
