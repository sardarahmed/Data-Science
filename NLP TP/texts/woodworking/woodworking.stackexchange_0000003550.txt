Q:

Ideas for removing fire blight 'stain'?

Chopped down a small tree that recently died and began shedding bark due to what appears to be fire blight.  I'd like to use the stock for a project once dried, but a significant section is stained almost black.  I've tried household bleach on a small section and it's marginally effective.  Any other ideas?
Thanks! 

A:

There are multiple types of "wood bleach", which invariably use one or more common bleaching agents. They can be used to bleach wood in specific ways (e.g. removing native colour or dark staining from iron) but I suspect this might be a permanent colour change and nothing at all will change it, just as in the black lines in spalted wood.
Personally I would embrace the change in the affected wood and value it for being nearly black.... people can go to great efforts to get wood black!
