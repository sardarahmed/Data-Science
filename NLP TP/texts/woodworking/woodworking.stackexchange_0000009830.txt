Q:

Repair split wood at hinge on blanket chest?

I'm looking for some advice. I am refinishing a gorgeous blanket chest but the wood has split at one of the hinges.
It seems a previous owner may have tried to repair it, but it is not solid. The typical fix I read about is wood glue, etc. But I am concerned it won't be strong enough. Any advice? 
My post-fix plan is to use torsion hinges (the other 2 mortises are in good shape).

And here is what it looks like after the cracked piece fully split off:

A:

What I have done with good success is to use a thin CA glue (it comes in different consistencies, get the thin).  Allow the CA glue to fill the cracks as much as you can, then place a clamp on the board and squeeze the cracks closed.  It is very important to apply enough pressure to close the cracks, as CA glue does not work well filling gaps.
You have to work very quickly, so have everything set out and ready.  Test the clamps first to be sure they are sufficiently strong to close the gaps.  Use some blocks on the work piece to prevent putting dimples in it with the clamps.
