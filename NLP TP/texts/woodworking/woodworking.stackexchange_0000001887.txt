Q:

What's an appropriate wood type for making toy blocks?

The wife wants to create custom painted toy blocks as a gift for a friend. The block will be approximately 3 inches per side, or whatever dimension is convenient based on the wood I purchase. I plan on cutting them using table saw.
What type of wood is appropriate for this project? Ideally it would be available at a big home improvement center, but I'm open to other options if they have significant advantages.

A:

The big box home improvement centers in my area don't stock nice lumber thicker than 3/4". 2x pine lumber, sure, but nothing you'd want to use to make a kids toy that might go in a mouth.
I would recommend hard maple for its properties:

Dimensionally stable
Clear grain (not likely to produce splinters)
Takes paint well
Check resistant  (holds up to being slobbered on)
Will last for more than one generation of kids.  

A:

Actually 2x4's could be perfectly fine for this, depending on what you are actually looking for as an end product. They come in thicker dimensions and are a softer wood.
If you are looking to make something more like this 

Then I'd go with a hard wood.  Oak, Maple are both good woods to use.  I would look for a species that they have in both regular lumber and matching dowels.

A:

I have made many blocks using birch.  It's a durable hardwood, not as heavy as maple and generally more affordable.
As reasonable as 3" cubes might sound, you might be very happy with 1 1/2" cubes which would be a size for which you could easily acquire wood.  You would buy 2" boards and by the time you get them planed smooth you will be looking at something close to 1 1/2".  Also, small hands will have trouble grasping 3" blocks, and when those wee hands grow a little, the 3 inchers can become heavy, dangerous missiles.
It is interesting to note that the traditional Tinkertoys were made from birch.
