Q:

What is this lathe tool that helps me copy a turned object?

I want to be able to make very accurate 'copy' of a lathe turned project such as legs on my lathe. I seen this tool on YouTube and have no idea what this is called but looks very useful. But the flaw is you need them holes and some bolts. But I may be able to make the hole needed to do such a thing. 
I am sure there are other tools or methods of doing this. And I would like to know what would be the best thing to go with. This one seemed to be a great choice. If anybody can find a link where to get something like this please include it. Or how to make something like it. I am willing to build something if need be. 
Basically I want something that will help me make a copy of a turned object.

A:

That looks quite similar to the CopyTurn - which, as you'll see, is $385 AUD.
Anything substantially less than that and you'll find it's something cheap/homemade/flimsy like this or this
Everything else will be solid, will attach to your lathe, and will be up in that $300 range, or much higher.
