Q:

How can I protect the part of my piece I don't want painted when painter's tape won't stick?

I'm building a dog house for my backyard and have put a water seal on the floor and porch, since those will be most exposed to the elements. Now I need to paint the walls and went to put painter's tape over the parts I don't want painted, but the tape doesn't stick to the sealed wood.
What are my options here?

A:

Back before quality painter's/masking tape was available to the masses, my dad always used a painter's straight edge for cutting into corners and wall/ceiling junctions:

They're available in different lengths (this particular one comes in 12" and 24" sizes) and are much faster and easier to use than painter's tape... especially when it doesn't stick :)
