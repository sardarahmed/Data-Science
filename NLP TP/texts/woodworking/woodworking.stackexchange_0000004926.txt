Q:

Using right angle clamps

I am having trouble using a corner clamp for my 45 degree miters. I try my best to align them and tighten them but the wood is always moving out of place. 
What is the best method or just how they are used in general? I just can not figure out how to get a tight, corner joint.
Update v1.2: This is the type of clamp I have.

Update v1.3: I forgot to say, this image came from google. Do not know what site but image of the same thing (just different angle shot) from HomeDepot

A:

I would invest in some of thise: Collins Miter Clamps
I bought a set a little over a year ago, and I'll never do miters without them. They are especially great for trim work.
