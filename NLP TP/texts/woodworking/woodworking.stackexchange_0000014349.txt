Q:

What kind of respirator do I need to safely work with varnish, polyurethane, and oil-based stain?

I like building small projects for around the house, but I don't like exposing myself to the harsh chemicals of finishes.
What sort of respirator will give me protection against these chemicals so I can safely work with them?

A:

For normal chemicals and finishes, most tradespeople will wear a half mask (3M are readily available and popular) with an OV (organic vapor) cartridge and at least P95 filtration. (Filtration since you mention the "building" part of small projects.)
You need to size them to fit (fitting instructions come with units -- generally, you should be able to plug the ports and not have the mask leak).
You can get ones with replaceable filters and ones that are non-replaceable. Prices vary, but I imagine the initial cost of the non-replaceable is lower, but of course they become landfill after the cartridge is done.
If you get into more obscure chemicals/acids/ etc, you'll (almost certainly) be able to find a replacement filter that'll suit the application.
Edit, to address lifespan… turns out, it’s complicated. This, from 3M, seems sensible, if perhaps (understandably) careful. 3M doc on OV reuse
