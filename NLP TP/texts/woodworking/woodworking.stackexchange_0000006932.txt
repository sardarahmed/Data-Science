How to remove paint in dent of guitar

I've sanded the body of my guitar but there are still some dents with paint in it. It's ash wood. My question is how I can remove the paint in these dents?

A:

There are two ways: chemical, and physical. 
chemical: use paint stripper. if there is still finish left on the body you'll want to test this in an inconspicuous spot to make sure that finish isn't affected undesirably by the stripper.
physical: get in there with blades and picks to pull out the paint. 
You'll ultimately probably need both - using small stiff brushes and picks in combination with the stripper.
