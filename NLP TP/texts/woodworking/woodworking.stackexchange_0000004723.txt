Q:

How to avoid damaging the ends of mortise holes when chiseling?

I've watched a couple of videos of making mortises.   
What technique should I use to remove (bulk) waste from the hole without damaging the ends of the mortise hole?   Clearly levering against them will bruise or dent the wood.  I'm really looking for a technique which allows me to reliably clear the debris without risking damage.   I'm especially looking for answers more specific than "be careful".
Edit: I'm not talking about the paring stage, I'm talking about bulk waste removal.

A:

First, as Aloysius says above, you should stay away from the ends of the mortise during bulk removal.  1/16 of an inch or 1-2mm should be sufficient.
Now, when you have done a bunch of chopping, and you have chips clogging the mortise, you need to clear them out, as you said.  Use a bench chisel that is one "size" below your mortising chisel.  For example, a 1/4 inch if you are doing a 3/8 inch mortise.  Guide the chisel with the thumb and forefinger of your non-dominant hand as you work it into the chips.  Then, still lightly pinching the chisel, rest your non-dominant forefinger on the board and use it as fulcrum as you lever the waste out of the hole.  The chisel should not touch the end of the mortise if you do this correctly.

A:

Don't lever. Pare straight downward into the opening, taking it in multiple passes if necessary, and letting the chisel act as a wedge to do the work.

Paul Sellers is a master craftsman, author of several books and some very good video tutorials.  He does several on cutting mortises - this one probably being most relevant to this topic.

I've learned a lot from watching his videos, still dont have the skill to implement the lessons very well as yet - very much a novice at this.
