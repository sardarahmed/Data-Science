Q:

Spray on Lacquer for Vertical Surface

I have a rectangular speaker cabinet (basically a box).  Can I use spray lacquer and spray all sides at once?  Otherwise I have to account for a lot of overspray. 

A:

Sure. You'll want something to rest one side on while it's drying.  You can buy those triangle things like these:

or you could use some scrap plywood squares are drive a screw all the way through it.  This way you you can finish the whole thing and let it dry without resting a side fully one a surface.
