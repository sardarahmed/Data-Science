Q:

Making a 8 Sided Wooden Pyramid

I am trying to create an 8 sided pyramid out of a solid piece of cherry that is 1" thick. The size of the base of the pyramid can be seen in the attached photo: (all dimensions are in inches)

So far I have tried cutting away at it with various chisels but I have been at it for about 3 hours and am not close to finishing one side... Does anyone have any better methods to achieve this 8 sided pyramid that I am looking to make?

A:

With handtools you typically want to follow a "coarse, medium, fine" workflow.  The coarse step will get generally close to the line, medium will refine that to hit the line, and fine will fine-tune and surface your piece.  It sounds like you're trying to skip the coarse step and go straight to medium.
Your coarse work should be done by either a saw or something that can take very deep passes.  Depending on the situation this could be a drawknife, scrub plane, or something that can split the wood along the grain like a froe.
Personally, my workflow here would be to layout the design for a triangle on the endgrain, then use a panel saw to get within 1/8" of that, then use a #4 set fairly heavy to get to the lines.  I'd then start over doing the same process on the other two faces.
