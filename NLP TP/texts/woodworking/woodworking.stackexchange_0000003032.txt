Q:

Lightest woods that would be strong & stable for 2 components of DIY Wall Stall bar?

Lightest woods that would be strong & stable for components of DIY Wall Stall bar?
Maybe this list can help you help me in shortlisting. 

Reference list of possible woods available but may not be complete/
  comprehensive:  :
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Indian_timber_trees

I am guessing both of these could be made of different wood, each with different strength/ hardness/ flex/ weight. 

Wooden parallel bars/ rods/ dowels 

Are less thick than the frame & probably need greater strength, rigidity & less flex  

The Frame holding them 

Made of thicker, wider & bigger pieces of wood, adding more to the weight, so a lighter wood would be better  
Can this be made from plywood? 

Which woods would you recommend for 2 components as a good/ best possible combination? 
Dimensions & Location:  

Typical standard width is - 34" - Just the space I have now.  
If there's no negative impact, I may consider going upto 38". 
Indian City that tends to be humid & tropical - If its a factor let me know & I can post more details. 

Additional Context: Why am I asking for the lighter wood combination? 

These will be removable / mountable from the wall, so lighter is better.

Sample Stall bar: 

A:

Just make the verticals out of run of the mill fir construction lumber, 2x2s or 2x4s, or 4x4s, (or whatever if metric, sorry!) and buy some thick dowels, maybe 2", for the horizontals, whatever's in the hardware store dowel rack (or order online). A 2x6 for that back piece on the wall. I wouldn't over think it. You'll be able to hold an elephant up with it regardless. I wouldn't worry about the weight either, the differences between different woods will be virtually negligible compared to what typical wall mount strategies support.
If fir is not available, just use whatever typical construction wood is available locally. Anything, really. Every wood in your list from the comments is more than sufficient. The differences in density will amount to just a few lbs/kgs range with the small amount of wood you are using.
If you do want to get your overengineering on, though, check out http://www.wood-database.com. You can compare densities, bending strengths, and stabilities of woods there. Your requirements are pretty low, so I would just stick to wood that is readily available in your area instead of finding and ordering more exotic woods (unless you are going for aesthetics or conversation topics).
