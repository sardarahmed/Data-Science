Q:

Glue and orientation of 2 sheets of plywood

I have 2 pieces of 5-ply birch plywood, and I want to glue them together to create a 10-ply piece.
My question is, does it matter which way I orient the two pieces? Should the grain be perpendicular, parallel, or does it not matter?

A:

The layers of plywood are already alternated, this is what gives it its strength and warp resistance.  Ideally you would place the layers perpendicular, but I don't think you'd see any negative effects if two of the layers happened to be glued together in the same direction.

Per Wikipedia:

Plywood is a sheet material manufactured from thin layers or "plies" of wood veneer that are glued together with adjacent layers having their wood grain rotated up to 90 degrees to one another.

If you were to shave off each subsequent layer of a piece of Baltic birch plywood, you would undoubtedly find that the plies are oriented 90 degrees to each other.

My question is, does it matter which way I orient the two pieces? 

Absolutely not.  Baltic birch plywood is known for its good dimensional stability, which is mostly due to the ply arrangement as discussed.  Gluing two separate pieces will not result in any contradiction of grain orientations, thus you will not have any issues with differential shrinkage wanting to pull the piece apart or split it.
