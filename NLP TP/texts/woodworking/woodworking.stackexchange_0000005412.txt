Q:

What joint should I use for this 45 degree angled brace?

What joint should I use for this 45-degree piece? It provides lateral support to a table leg, and there are two (one on each side of the upright piece in the picture). The bottom is a 3-way mortise and tenon. I'm reasonable comfortable making those now, but cutting the tenons on the 45 could be a bit challenging, especially since I'd have to do 16 of them for the whole project.

A:

You can just use butt joints here. Since this is part of an overall structure the joints will be strong enough in service.
You can reinforce them if you prefer*, but it shouldn't be needed if the pieces mate well, enough glue is applied and you clamp well during your glue-up.

*With nails or screws or dowels or biscuits or splines or Dominos or floating tenons.
