Q:

How to make round walls with big radius

I'm trying to think of a good way to make this:

But the round sides with the massive radius stumble me. The only way I can think of is cutting many half circles from plywood and then gluing them together to reach the depth of the desired piece. But that seems a bit like an overkill, is there something I'm missing?

A:

Laminate from veneers that are thin enough to bend the radius cold
Solid wood kerfed on the inside face
Steam bent solid wood

But my best bet looking at the style of that piece would be many partial circles cut from MDF glued in stacks, sanded, and veneered on the surfaces. Overlapping shorter segments would make more efficient use of the material than full half-circles.
