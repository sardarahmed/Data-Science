Q:

What would be the best way to bevel an oval table top?

I'm building an oval dining room table and I'm looking for ideas on the best way to add a 30deg. bevel to the top. The top is 42" x 76". The top will be solid 4/4 Ash. 
I was thinking maybe a belt sander? I added an image of the top below. Thanks!

To expand upon @keshlam's answer, you're going to want to purchase a chamfer or low angle bevel bit.  Amazon (among others) sells a 60-deg bevel bit (pictured below), and chamfer bits can be found at just about any woodworking supplier.

You will notice that this bit has a guide bearing on it, which is crucial for the bit's function in this type of operation.
My advise to you would be to make this bevel in lots of shallow cuts.  If you try to hog off the entire bevel at once, the results will not be pretty (and actually a little dangerous).

I was thinking maybe a belt sander?

A belt sander would work, yes, but it will not be anywhere near as consistent, convenient, or quick as using a router.

A:

Common solution would be a router with an edge-guided bit.
