Q:

Routing a through dado in a small piece of wood

First of all, I might have used wrong term in a question title, not sure if what I need to do can really be called "dado". Feel free to correct me in that case.
Here is what I need to do:

Speaking about the left and right pieces of it, there is a thing which I referred as "dado" - some material removed to create a slot with a rounded end.
I'd like to ask you - what is the best and easiest way to do it? In which ways the way I'm going to go (described below) might be improved?
Here is my plan - use a router table with a straight bit and cut it with several passes in such way:
1) Set a small material removal (let's say 1mm above the table surface).
2) Set up a stop block on the left part of the fence not to cut through.
3) Set a feather stops before and after the bit to prevent kickback (as the detail I'm going to cut is quite small)
4) Enable the router, push the detail through from the right side until it reaches the stop block
5) Disable the router, only then remove a piece, rise the bit a little bit and repeat routing. Repeat this until I cut through.
I'm actually asking this question because I'm completely new to power router and not sure which operations are safe for me and which of it are safe for detail I'm working on.

A:

I'd cut the radius with a forstner bit and then use a table saw (or miter saw) to cut the straights. Once that's done, bullnose the edges by following with the router. 
Full-depth cuts with a router are challenging and tend to result in burn. Plus, it's somewhat difficult to get a very straight line that way, especially on a small workpiece.
