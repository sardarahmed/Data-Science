Q:

What are these white fibers emanating from the inside of my lignum vitae lidded box?

Several months ago I turned this lignum vitae lidded box. The first thing I noticed after completing it was how quickly the wood changed color in the sunlight, going from a just-turned honey brown to a very dark brown in only a couple of hours.
I finished the box's exterior and interior in the same way, going through the grits up to 600 and then finishing with mineral oil and beeswax (or possibly carnauba/beeswax mix, I don't recall).
Now, after three or four months being indoors (on a table by a sunny window), I opened the box to find the inside surface covered in fine, silky white fibers:

...as you can see from the photo above, the fibers aren't stuck strongly to the surface and bunch up easily when touched by a finger:

I sometimes finish pieces with 0000 steel wool (but I don't recall finishing this one in that manner), so I held a strong magnet to the fibers to see if they would react, but nothing happened. Here's a closeup of the fibers after I wiped them out with a rag:

...from the way the fibers bunch, it seems more like a spider-silk material than a cotton-fiber material, but either way I'm puzzled. Why would this only appear on the inside, and not the outside, of the box? Will it keep growing back after I wipe it away? Has anyone any ideas what might be happening here?
Thanks in advance!

A:

From my comments, which seems borne out by the last comment from the OP:
These fibres look more like crystalline structures than anything organic. Both paraffin and beeswax contain largish crystals. Though, if the wax has been de-oiled or processed in the right manner those crystals can get really small. Just a guess here, but it looks like the conditions were fine for thin layer of finish to stay wet enough to super-saturate. Once those first crystals were able to grow undisturbed they would have continued as long as the conditions for saturation remained.
