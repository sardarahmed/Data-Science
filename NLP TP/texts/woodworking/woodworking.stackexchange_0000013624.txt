Q:

How to mount angled shelves in a cabinet?

I'm starting to plan a record player & typewriter display unit for my office. I've built some of the other furniture in my office; some bookcases & a wall-mounted desk. I've got a basic set of tools (drill, impact driver, circular saw, table saw, jigsaw, hammers, etc.) but nothing fancier than that.
Most of the design I have sorted out, but there is one thing that I'm not sure how to accomplish once I start making sawdust. I'd like to have two shelves that are at an angle to show off the typewriters (and a Tandy 102) a bit better.
This is what I've got in SketchUp so far:

The two yellow squares are records, the blue boxes are the typewriters. The empty spot is where I might put a receiver, or some other collectibles.
My plan is to build all of this out of plywood. I'm still figuring out how thick I want to have the outer part of the display cabinet, it's probably not going to be the 1.5 inches in the image above (feels like that'd be too heavy to get up the stairs!).
So I'm wondering about mounting the shelves at an angle like in the image. Could I get away with just using shelf pins, or should I do something a bit more permanent?

3/4" plywood is very strong :)
But probably 1/2" plywood would be ok for expected load! See video from The Honest Carpenter.

Could I get away with just using shelf pins

Much modern kitchen storage is made from weaker material than plywood, with shelves held by pins. Based on loads these shelves can hold without problem yes you will get away with just using shelf pins.
