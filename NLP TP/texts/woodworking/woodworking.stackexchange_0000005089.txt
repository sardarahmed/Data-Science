Q:

Can I cut wood with a blade for aluminium?

I got a power miter saw, it came with a default blade which is cool, but has too little teeth and the cut is not very clean. I want to buy another blade with more teeth, and I was offered a blade for aluminium which has almost twice as many teeth, but I'm not sure if I'm going to have unexpected problems with it down the road?
In general, is it a good idea to use blade for aluminium to cut wood?

A:

I've done this successfully with my hand mitre saw, though the cut may not be as much cleaner (than with the blade you have) as you expect. 
I often use metal-cutting blades for wood on my jigsaw. On melamine-coated chipboard you get a much nicer cut than with the finest wood blades I can easily buy (which aren't very fine). Blades for metal also seem to stay sharp longer when working with chipboard. 
In both cases you have to watch out for clogging. This would be even more important with a power mitre saw as the blade could overheat very quickly with a clogged blade. You would also have to take it easy against jamming.
