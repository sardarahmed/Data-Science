Q:

How to replicate cedar texture in Bondo or wood filler?

My small garage door has a rough cedar surface. My car slid into it on the outside and put some vertical ruts in the garage door. I'd like to fill the ruts with Bondo or wood filler and then use a small piece of cedar to press into the Bondo or wood filler repairs to give them a cedar-like texture. Am wondering whether to coat the cedar block with oil if some sort so it won't stick to the Bondo or filler so it can make another impression along the rut. What do you suggest to accomplish this?
I have been unable to find answers online.

A:

I think that trying to push a piece of cedar into the filler will leave you with an inverse of the pattern you're looking for and may well stand out almost as much as the gouge itself.
Without a picture, it's hard to say, but I'd imagine that you could hand-sculpt ridges and valleys into the hardening filler to make the patch nearly disappear and that it won't be as difficult as you'd think.
