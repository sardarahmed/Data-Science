Q:

Prevent warping but allow planing

I'm getting ready to make a desktop by gluing up thirty 72"H x 1.5"W x .75"D boards of alternating Maple and Mahogany. I'll be gluing the boards on there faces for a final desktop that's ~6' wide and ~1.5" thick.
My original thought was to alternate the direction of the face grain as I glued them up to help prevent warping. Once I get ~12" (16 boards) glued up I want to run it through my planer to level it up perfectly. My concern is that I had a friend tell me to take care when running a board through a planer to take note of the direction of the grain and to make sure the blades were removing material like so:
O ->
/////////
Instead of like so:
O ->
\\\\\\\\\\
Well if I alternate my grain, I'll have every other board going the wrong way. So do I protect against warp, or use proper planing technicque?

A:

I have glued up similar wood slabs without being overly concerned about grain direction.  Regardless of grain direction the individual boards will control the tendency to warp of adjacent boards to the point where warping should not be a problem in a desk application.  If you had a condition where either the top or bottom was regularly exposed to more humidity and temperature differences than the other then it might be possible that the slab would warp as a whole.  
The reason for running the grain through a planer in the direction your friend suggested was to avoid tear out where wood fiber deeper from the surface is pulled out by the planer knives.  The risk of this occurring is greater near knots or in patterned wood grain specimens such as with curly maple where the grain directions may be more vertical to the flow of the material through the planer.  It is a good idea to align the boards to flow as suggested, but when that is not possible then resort to very shallow plane settings so that the knives cannot get a grip on the poorly aligned wood fibers.  This means more passes, but it will usually work just fine.
