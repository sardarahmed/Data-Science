Q:

Using a normal bench vise for a drill press?

I'm aware that there is a separate type of vise specifically for drill presses, but the workshop where I'm at are a little short on budget and I'm wondering if a normal bench vise like this one 

can be used for a drill press as substitution for the specialised one. Also, does anyone know whether it's difficult to unmount a bench vise from a bench? Many thanks.

The problem with using a vice like that on a drill press is that it is difficult to keep the work piece in the same plane as the table of the drill press.  If the piece is canted then your holes will not be perpendicular.  
Personally, I have a couple of vises for my drill press, but never use them for wood.  I more typically use a clamp or just a fence.

There is no reason why it can't.  The only thing is for the "regular" bench vise, you will have to make extra checks that the piece you are drilling is presented to the drill bit at the correct angle since the regular vise does not have indents for plumb/square.

Also, does anyone know whether it's difficult to unmount a bench vise from a bench?

Without knowing how the vise was mounted, we can't really answer that.  If it's just bolted or screwed on, it should come off fine.  If it's welded, good luck.
