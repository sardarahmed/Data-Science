Q:

Would poplar or alder be good for a desk?

I'm planning on building a desk soon and I am going to make the top of it out of 1x6 planks that I am going to join together. Would poplar or alder be strong enough for a lot of writing with something like a poly finish or maybe an epoxy top? My other option would be spending more and get some red oak.
I want the top to look nice too I don't just want cheap wood that won't look good stained.
I was going to get the wood form a local Lowes or Home Depot so I'm kind of limited to oak, spruce, pine, fir, alder and poplar but I know there are some local lumber yards that I could shop at too.

A:

You can build a desk out of most any wood if you design it well.
A desk is more than just the top. Spend some time thinking about and drawing pictures of your desk to make sure it will fit your need and not be wobbly.
Poplar and alder have been used successfully to make desks.
Here is an example of a desk made of poplar

They both take stain well and can be made to look very nice.
You are right to worry about scratching and denting. Both woods are very soft. They will dent and scratch easily. Unfinished poplar can be scratched with a fingernail. My personal rule is - always build things I care about out of something about as hard as oak.
If you have a single sheet of paper writing with a ball point pen on poplar with a poly or epoxy finish I'd be nervous. Best to have a nice desk pad or glass top for writing on any wood table.
