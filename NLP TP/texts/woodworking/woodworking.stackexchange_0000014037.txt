Q:

Another router profile - which bit to use?

The photo is a square slice through a 6 x 6 post which has this shaping done each corner. I am replacing the post and want to reproduce this. I need a bit because the routed part of the edge is about 10 foot long.

I've been hitting  the local stores etc, and the nearest we can find is a beading bit - but those have square flats and a basic bead/roundover - where as mine seems to be two coves with a 90 degree bead. I've also checked the entire range of Diablo profiles online.
I can't believe this was a custom bit, as it was done in the backyard by the people who erected the arbor as part of landscaping the yard - and I doubt they shelled out for that.
If I can get the "class" of bit (e.g. bead, roundover) defined, I can then work out the size I need.
