Q:

How can I make this cribbage board peg compartment?

I'm making a peg cribbage board and want to make a peg compartment with a sliding door. 
It looks almost like it would require a Dremel tool, but was wondering if anyone has any techniques for accomplishing the task. 

A:

I would use a 1" diameter straight cutting bit on a router table to make the main compartment body. You'll have to raise it up into the workpiece to avoid having an open end on the compartment though.
 
For the slot, you can just use a slot cutting bit or set with a bearing guide to follow the edge around.
 
If you think you'll have clearance issues with the bearing and nut, you could always get a top-bearing slot cutter instead.

A:

This could be easily cut with a T-Slot Router bit

A:

I did a little search and found ISCAR has a set of T bits that can cut slots from 2mm - 5mm.  The cutting end can be removed and replaced with different thickness cutters giving you the option to have many different sized slots with one bit.
Though after further looking it is really designed for metal cutting, it might work.

I've seen several others and most seem to be for cutting metal and none seem very cheap.  
Another option might be to use an angled router bit like those for dovetails. Then you can make a piece like a wedge and slide it in.
