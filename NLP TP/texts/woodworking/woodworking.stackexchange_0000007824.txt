Q:

What is this sliding cabinet door with "shades" called, and where can I find info on it?

I remembered I saw a video/picture about cabinet equipped with a sliding door, just like window shades was installed vertically all around the cabinet. You can slide the window shades like door (made from many pieces of wood) to open the cabinet. But I couldn't find the link anymore. Please direct me to the link if you happen to know it. Thanks.
Edit: Here is what I can find that is close to my recollection: https://image.rakuten.co.jp/ffws/cabinet/d_item9/s0500602_img05.gif
The sliding bellow in the above gif file seems a little bulky to me. I hope the leaves of the bellow is much thinner. 

A:

Are you referring to a "tambour door"?
