Q:

Arcade Coffee Table drawer

I was wondering if you happen to know what kind of hardware is used on the drawer for this Coffee Table Arcade. Here is a picture of the drawer as it is being pulled out.

Then fully engaged

You will notice that the controls are raised while the drawer is being pulled out.
I do some woodwork, and also design joysticks and MAME installations, and I was interesting in achieving the effect of this drawer, but i'm still in my learning curve and would like some indicators.

A:

The retracting control console may be a lot simpler than it looks. For example, you could simply route some diagonal grooves in the sides and insert (stainless steel) dowels into the side edges of the console top, near the rear.  The dowels follow the diagonal grooves in the sides, so when you pull out the console, the controls are raised and when you push it in the controls are lowered.  Here is a rough rendering of what such a design may look like:
