Q:

What is luster?

I've seen finishes (and finishing techniques) described as providing a lot of "luster". I can understand matte, which is similar to satin, and that sheen is akin to gloss. But what do people mean when something has a lot of "luster"?

A:

Let me preface my comment by saying that quite a bit of the terminology used in woodworking is used loosely or informally, so one person's understanding of and use of a word may not match another person's precisely.
As far back as I can remember knowing it, lustre in this context was used merely as another word for shine (this is in British English). Dictionary.com's listing for the word notes that it is chiefly British and gives as the first definition: 1. reflected light; sheen; gloss. 

I can understand matte, which is similar to satin

In the coatings industry satin would normally mean a sheen level somewhere between matt and gloss. Matt and satin gloss levels do vary from one product to another however, meaning it possible to find a matt varnish from one manufacturer and a satin varnish from another that have approximately the same gloss.
Note since this keeps on getting 'corrected': matte (American English) = matt (British English).
