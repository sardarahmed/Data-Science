Q:

Winter and my tools

It is getting cold here in Wisconsin, winter is coming. I have always taken in my battery tools. Because most people should know that lithium and freezing temps, do not mix very well. But what about my other corded tools? Do I need to bring those inside. keep in mind, at this time I don't own my own place, only 17, so I am out in the shed, and there is no heat and open building (we have one cow on the other side). I am wondering if the freezing temp will screw up any bearing or, anything. Thoughts?
Quick edit: We no longer have the cow. 

A:

Your corded tool will be fine. For storage make sure the tools are kept dry and shielded from dust and dirt (from caring for the cow perhaps). If you use the tools when they are cold it is best to let them warm up a bit before use instead of plug in and cut. Take precaution bringing cold tools into warm spaces as condensation can become an issue.
