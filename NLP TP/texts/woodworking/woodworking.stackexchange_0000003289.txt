Q:

Can I put wheels on a bunk bed?

I can't find any information about safety related to having caster wheels (the kind that can swivel) on a bunk bed.
The only concern I have is if the child leans against the wall while on top and the bed pushed out. Allowing the child to fall between the bed and wall.
This risk could be reduced with casters that can lock.
I want to have wheels to make it easier for my wife to make the bed.

A:

My dad put plastic caster wheels on the twin beds he made for my brother and I as kids (granted, these were not bunk beds).  On carpet, the wheels made enough of a dimple that it took a bit of pushing to get them to move out of the dimple.  On wood floor, it will be much easier to push.

The only concern I have is if the child leans against the wall while on top and the bed pushed out. Allowing the child to fall between the bed and wall.

This is a valid concern.  You could mitigate it by adding a railing on the wall-side of the bed, or possibly tying the bed to the wall when your wife doesn't need to change the sheets.  If you live in a seismic area (looking at you California), tying a bunk bed to the wall might be a good idea anyway.
From a purely mechanics point of view, adding casters won't make the bed more tippy than if it had plain legs.  It would just feel more unstable since it can move side to side.

This risk could be reduced with casters that can lock.

Depending on the floor you have, this might not make a big difference.  Plastic sliding on wood has a pretty low coefficient of friction.  It will be harder than if the wheels weren't locked, but not much.
You could also use some sort of chock block to keep the wheels from moving, similar to what you should do to a car when jacking it up for maintenance.
