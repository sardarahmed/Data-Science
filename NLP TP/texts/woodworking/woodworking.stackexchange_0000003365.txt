Q:

Is there a collection of good reference signage for saw blade types?

I participate and organize within a makerspace. Though I read up on woodworking and have some familiarity, I don't always remember details myself as woodworking isn't my main focus. This seems to be an issue for other members of our space too. 
One of our top problems is people using the wrong blade type for the wrong cutting action due to lack of experience and taking a best guess or thinking they know when they have misremembered. (such as rip-cut blades vs cross-cut blades)
I would like to have reference materials to hang on the wall as a quick guide to remind people of different types of blades, show what they look like, and their various uses. 
Is there a collection or resource for some good graphical guides or signs that can be hung up as a quick reference for types of saw blades?
Do people have such graphics they can post here?

A:

For bandsaws I just use this page from the MSC catalog, it is basically just a chart of thickness and TPI. There are also a bunch of other useful product guides in that catalog, like for drills and stuff. I'm sure other vendors or supply companies have their versions of this too.
