Q:

Should the inside of a drawer opening be finished?

I'm making a small cabinet/table/thing. It includes two drawers at the top, and solid sides. These are traditional drawers sitting on wooden runners, and the sides of the drawers are a close fit to the sides of the cabinet. I was going for the "piston fit" style drawer - can't say I made it exactly that accurate but it's close enough for the question.
The piece is nearly ready for finishing but I'm not sure whether to finish the inside of the solid cabinet sides, or the underside of the top.
I've searched this site as well as Google, but I can only find information on whether to finish the inside of the drawers themselves (it seems generally they're not finished).
If it makes any difference, I'm probably going to finish this with standard polyurethane.

A:

Generally speaking, the interior of the cabinet is not finished unless it's on display. So portions behind doors or just open would be finished, but portions hidden behind drawers would not be finished.
You may, of course, choose to finish yours, but yes, any contact surfaces will have the finish rubbed off reasonably quickly.
If you go take a gander at your local antique shop, you'll notice that very few, if any, of the cabinets have finish inside the drawer areas and most are no worse for wear because of it.
