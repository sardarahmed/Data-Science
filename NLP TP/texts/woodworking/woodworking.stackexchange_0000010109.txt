Q:

Separation in Butcher Block

Had an email today about a board that had started to split. This was a new board. We're wondering why this failed so badly - the only other time I've seen a stringy separation like this was when heat was involved, but our exposure to these failures is limited so I wanted to get feedback.
Glue is Tightbond 3, joints were let to set for 24 hours, we lightly oiled it (good coat on both sides, let it soak in) and put some beeswax/oil mix on before it left for its new home. The owners said that they had only used it a couple of times when the crack started to appear, and that they had not let it sit in water.
We do live in a very humid area, but the wood had been.. what's the word, "equalized?". Basically we let it sit for a few weeks before actually doing anything with it. We had mostly finished the board and let it sit for almost three weeks before giving it a final sand and oil, unsure if that may have been related.

We finally got the board back in hand. @GraphussupportsMonica's comments seem to ring true - this board is severely water damaged. It feels like sandpaper, all the oil and wax has been ripped out of it, and it has numerous joint failures. So, alas, it was no match for a dishwasher. We feel.. foolish.. for agreeing to replace without inspecting first, but it is what it is.
