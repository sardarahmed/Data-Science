Q:

How are vacuum hose sizes measured?

I need to buy an adapter to make my shop vac work with one of my hand tools. But as I'm shopping, I realize I'm not sure what exactly I need to buy. I'd like to understand how vacuum hose sizes are specified so that I can measure what I have. 
For example: on my shop vac, the end of the hose measures 2-1/8"ID x 2-1/4"OD, and the end of the attachments measure 2-1/4"ID x 2-1/2"OD. What is the correct way to refer to the size of this hose? 

A:

Ridgid's Shopvac accessories come in 1-7/8" and 2-1/2" sizes. So from this we can deduce that Ridgid, at least, uses the outer diameter of the attachments. The sizes you describe match what Ridgid refers to as 2-1/2". That's just Ridgid, of course, but mostly I see this consistently. YMMV.
Some general strategies to help you:

Take a quick look at the web site of the manufacturer for your equipment, or a vendor that sells accessories. Look at the size options they offer. That will give you the list of sizes they use to refer to your products.
Take a ruler with you when shopping.
If purchasing online don't be afraid to ask about the product (e.g. Amazon lets you post product questions, and for popular products they generally receive answers quickly; and most vendors have at least some form of product sales support). 
If purchasing online, you can often go back to the manufacturer's web site with a model number and find more detailed specifications on a product there.
