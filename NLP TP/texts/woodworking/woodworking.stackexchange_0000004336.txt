Q:

What is the best way to slice CHUNKS of wood?

Here is a photo of the floor I plan to install in my barn house. I have a great source for the wood, but it is all in "chunks" that are approximately 9"x11"x14". My (old) table saw blade doesn't raise high enough to easily cut even halfway through, my 12" miter saw won't accommodate them, I don't have a band saw (but might have to buy or borrow one), and I can't cut consistently enough with a chain saw. Is there an option I'm overlooking?

A:

Here are several options that come to mind:

Cut smaller pieces
Get a bandsaw with resaw capacity of at least 9" (many 14" or larger bandsaws either come stock with 11-12" resaw capacity, or can be upgraded with a riser block)
Use a saw with a significantly larger circular blade
Cut as deep as you can on both sides, then finish the job with a hand saw
Use a chainsaw mill (aka Alaska mill)--basically a guide for your chainsaw. It will require a fair amount of cleanup but it will be much less than if you make the cuts freehand
Have someone else with larger or more appropriate equipment cut the pieces for you--either hire a sawmill or make a new friend, perhaps someone in a local woodworking club.

As Ashlar semi-jokingly noted in a comment, you could use a handsaw exclusively, but that would not be a fast or easy task, especially if you want to crosscut the pieces as illustrated in the picture.
