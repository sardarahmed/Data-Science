Q:

Screws back into a splitting pole

The pole in this image holds up a regular mail box. You can see where the 4 screw holes are. This pole is cemented into the ground and has been untreated for over 10 years. This is in Phoenix Arizona so hot and dry most of the time. I've given this pole a heavy drenching of boiled linseed oil and will leave that to soak in for a couple of days.
How can I EASILY repair and reinforce those holes and cracks in the wood? I was thinking of using a syringe and injecting wood glue into the holes and cracks and then clamping the brace in place after reattaching. I also thought of spraying Gorilla Glue in there because the blast of the spray would penetrate deep.
I know that there are other solutions like rebuilding with wood. I wanted to keep this one simple and specific and try and work out a good solution that will make those holes reusable in those positions without moving where the mail box brace goes.

Frankly, that post looks like it has served its days. I would replace it.
However, to try and extend its life, I think the simplest solution would be to drill out the existing holes, glue in dowels and re-drill to accept the screws. Use an exterior grade wood glue (such as Titebond III) or even construction adhesive (like Liquid Nails or PL-Premium). Note that the holes for the dowels don't have to be particularly accurate.
I would caution that your application of BLO might prevent a good glue bond for any repairs. You might have to wait several weeks for the BLO to fully cure before glue will adhere to the wood.
An alternative solution that doesn't require gluing or reinforcing the existing holes is moving from screws to through bolts of similar diameter. Simply drill the existing holes all the way through. Don't forget to use large washers on the wood side.
