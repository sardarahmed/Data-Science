Q:

Does this butt joint with a beveled profile have a name?

I am trying to come up with a joint that I can use for a frame that will have beveled inside corners, where I can cut the bevels cleanly on my router, and that isn't a miter (I don't want the 45 degree seam, I want a 90 degree seam).
The only joint I can really think of is this (inside bevel on horizontal piece not shown because it's not really significant to the joint):

My question is: Does this joint have a name? I know I've seen it before, but I couldn't find anything in image searches, and unless I overlooked it I don't see it on this huge list of joints, either.

A:

It is a coped joint.  You make it by cutting the adjoining piece at a 45 degree angle, then using the cut line as guide to remove the area below the line.

Here is an image of how to do it.

A:

Making frames like this is typically done with a "Stile and Rail" router bit set.  The bits come in many different configurations and can vary wildly in price, but this is how door and window frames are made.  The additional tongue and groove provide a lot of extra strength that your diagram doesn't show.
They come in many different profiles, and the image below is just a random sampling sold by http://www.mlcswoodworking.com (no implied endorsement - never used them).
As Graphus pointed out in a comment, this really isn't a coped joint.  I'm not sure that it has a name other than "stile and rail joint".
