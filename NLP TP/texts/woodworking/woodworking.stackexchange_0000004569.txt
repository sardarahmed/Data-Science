Q:

Will PVA glue add some thickness to two and more pieces of plywood?

I have 5' x 5' sheets of baltic birch plywood having a thickness close to 3/4" at 23/32" so it's missing 1/32".
I want to glue 4 pieces together using yellow PVA glue.
I'm currently designing a multi-station workbench with 3"x3" legs (3/4 x 4 = 3") but since the material is 23/32 the total thickness would be (without gluing) 23/32 x 4 = 92/32 = 2 7/8 so I'm missing 1/8 !
However does glue add some thickness between the 4 pieces? I'm counting on the fact that it would result in getting close to an overall thickness of 3"... am I right?
Thanks!
Update:
Trying to fit posts with rails, all of them consisting of 4 pieces joined together. Each piece, before being glued together, is cut with the necessary shape for either a mortise or tenon.
This match is easy:

This one I am not sure:

A:

using the proper amount of glue will not fill in the remaining 1/8", not by a long shot. The thickness of each layer, once fully dried, should be microns, not even hundredths on an inch. 
In general, I would caution you against trying to calculate these sort of dimensions beforehand, and just use the actual workpiece dimensions as you progress with the project... it'll be much less frustrating! variations in dimensions on (or even greater) than the order of glue film thickness can be caused by humidity changes, so what's the point?
