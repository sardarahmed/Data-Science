Q:

What's a reliable measure of wood hardness?

The terms hardwood and softwood are often used, but I struggle to find a reliable definition.
Is the wood's density sufficient as the distinguishing feature?
Is it the only one?
As oil is known to harden a wooden surface, is it possible to create a (in terms of density) hardwood-like surface on a piece of softwood? Is it even possible to get softwood that's harder than (relatively soft) hardwood this way?
Crucial edit
When I asked for hardwood and softwood, I had the German terms “Hartholz” and “Weichholz” in mind. It turns out they do not translate one-to-one: In English, according to Wikipedia and ON5MF's answer, the distinction is made by the type of tree from which the wood is harvested. That corresponds to the German terms “Laubholz” (wood from dicot angiosperm trees, = hardwood) and “Nadelholz” (wood from gymnosperm trees, = softwood). The differentiation in “Hartholz” and “Weichholz” differs from that in a way that it takes the wood's “hardness” as the distinguishing feature, and I wondered how exactly this is measured and defined. So, additional question: Is there a similar differentiation in English?
tl;dr: How do you measure a wood's hardness?

A:

Technically hardwood comes from angiosperm trees, softwood comes from gymnosperm trees.
So (mostly) if the tree has leaves it is hardwood, if it has needles it is softwood.
This means that some 'hardwood' species can be a lot softer than 'softwood' species.
Examples of hardwood: beach, oak, birch, balsa (which is very soft)
Examples of softwood: spruce, pine, fir, cedar

Per your edit, you appear to be looking for e.g. Janka hardness, a standardized measure involving indenting a wood sample with a penetrator and measuring the force required to indent a standard amount.
