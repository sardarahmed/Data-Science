Q:

How can I attach a solid table top to perpendicular cross rails?

I plan to build a coffee table following plans in Fine Woodworking. In the article, the author uses a plywood top, but I already have solid lumber that I'd like to use.

The author of the article simply screws the cross rails (blue) to the top (yellow), but for a solid top this is not ideal.
How can I attach these rails to the table top in a way that allows the wood to shrink and expand with changes in humidity?

A:

You can use screws, but in a slightly different manner.  Instead of simply pre-drilling a hole and screwing the screw, you can use a router to create a slot with a countersink or counterbore bit.

This slot will allow wood movement of your solid top while staying securely attached on your cross rails.

A:

Tabletops are often attached to the frame and aprons using tabletop fasteners such as these, which allow for some wood movement:

This is what they look like installed:

A:

The wood in your top will expand and contract in one direction, while the cross braces will expand and contract perpendicular to that.
There are a couple of different products and techniques that would help.
For a set of rails like the ones in your picture, consider 'figure 8' fasteners.

You create a shallow depression with a forstner bit or similar on the rail top, such that the figure eight fastener can rotate a bit when screwed down (not extremely tight, but not loose either.) These allow expansion in two directions if done correctly.
Another option are oval washers like these:

They allow expansion in one direction.
