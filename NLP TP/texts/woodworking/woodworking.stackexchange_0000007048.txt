Q:

using one application for design and milling wood project with CNC

Here is the full scenario for any project, have failure every time :

design 3D model with sketchup 
measure the size and try to convert it into 2D shapes with some vector applicatins ( like Adobe Illustrator ) 
import the vector into Vectric Aspire
nest shapes into the sheet 
re-check then plan several times
set the right tool-path and cut the material
problem with sizing every time specially on dado cuts and joints

I think the problem is switching between these applications , so the human errors is unavoidable.
The question is : are there any applications for doing all these steps with one software . 

A:

It would appear that you are agreeable to learning new software. One product pops into my alleged mind when you ask for a "do it all" type of program.
Fusion 360 is free for students, hobbyists and for business that produce below a certain level of income (or is it profit) using the software. For the DIY fellows and gals and hobbyists, it is required to renew the license yearly, a minor task.
F360 is capable of creating 3D models, perhaps not as easily as SketchUp but reasonably easy to learn. Dimensioning is a feature incorporated into Fusion 360 as well as parametric modeling.
Another aspect of F360 is that it is a fully functional CAD/CAM package and you would be able to generate your tool paths directly from your work/models.
There are many resources for learning Fusion 360. Lynda.com provides tutorials and YouTube is loaded with instructional videos.
Our local library has a license agreement with Lynda.com to allow patrons access to their resources at no cost. 
I've viewed for entertainment purposes a number of YouTube creators who use Fusion 360 to generate tool paths for their CNC wood router with good results.
