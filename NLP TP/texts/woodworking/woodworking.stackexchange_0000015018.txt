How to Protect melamine panel dining table from water and wear

I have a dining table from Mobili fiver with the following material specification:

How can I protect it against water damage and regular wear and tear. I want some kind of clear/non-glossy finish. I thought polyurethane could work, since it does well for my other plywood furniture. But I am not sure. Any recommendations?

A:

As the Comment from @JanSpurny says, melamine IS the protection. If you think about it, if this is sold as tabletop material it should already be suitable for this application. As the PDF you linked to says:
"Melamine surfaces are among the most resistant of those used in the furniture and furnishing industry."
Melamine (or more accurately, melamine laminate) is rather famous for how tough it can be â€” amply demonstrated by the thick melamine-coated chipboard/particleboard now used so commonly for kitchen countertops. Assuming they're not abused, these can withstand decades of hot plates, food and water spills, and regular cleaning (even multiple times a day) with almost no sign of wear.
The Achilles's heel of this material generally is the joins between the face laminate and the edging material, so be careful along the arrises and the corners. Other than not cleaning using anything abrasive the only particular care I'd take personally would be to make sure I didn't leave liquids puddled right at the edge.
