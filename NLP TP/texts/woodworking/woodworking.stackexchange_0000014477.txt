Q:

What is the difference between "wood veneer" and "plywood" wood?

Both wood veneer and plywood both use layers of nautral wood stuck to engineered wood. What is then the difference between them?

A:

First a bit of foundation to answer upon:
Sheet stock is manufactured flat material consisting of a thicker layer of common wood called a "substrate" and at least one and very often both sides covered by thin layers of fancier wood or plastic called "veneer".
The substrate can be multiple layers of wood turned 90 degrees each layer and glued together. This kind of substrate is called "plywood". Or it can be ground-up wood sawdust with resin glue and called particle board. If the sawdust is ground to very fine dusty particles, then glued with resin, it's called "fiberboard": medium density grinding makes the substrate called MDF.
"Wood veneer" is the outside layer of a piece of sheet stock that is very often a high-quality but thin sheet of wood glued over the substrate. It can be stain-grade oak, cherry, ash, walnut, mahogany, etc. Or it can be paint-grade poplar, birch, etc. Other forms of veneer could be metal, like aluminum, or plastic, like melamine.
So "wood veneer" and "plywood" don't compare: they are two different parts of the sheet stock. "Plywood" is one of the different kinds of middle of the sheet stock. "Wood veneer" is one of the kinds of outside layers of the sheet stock.
