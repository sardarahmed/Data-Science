How to sand out splinters

I am attempting to create a reasonably smooth finish with no burrs or splinters on a softwood 2x4. No matter what I do there are still thin layers of wood that splinter off, especially near some knots.
I have chiselled then rasped then used a plane then a cabinet scraper and finally 100 grit with a random orbital then 120, 140, and 220 but there are still little “flakes” that run along the grain that catch and splinter.
I have tried sanding with the grain, across the grain and diagonal. This is Home Depot quality construction grade softwood so I’m not expecting miracles but there’s got to be a technique I’m missing.
The reverse face of the board took very well to sanding.

A:

There's a reason we don't make a lot of furniture out of construction grade pine in North America. Not only is it grown fast with no regard for how it works with hand tools, but it is kiln-dried in a manner that allows it to be sold and turned into stick-frame constructions fast. Few are going to try and "finish" it.
It sounds like you've done what you can. About the only advice I can offer is to get it close enough and then finish it with a few coats of a non-penetrating finish (i.e., one that hardens on the surface, consolidating the fibres) to make it artificially smooth. This often involves wet sanding to "raise the grain" so that these sort of flaky sections can be lightly sanded down to some extent.
