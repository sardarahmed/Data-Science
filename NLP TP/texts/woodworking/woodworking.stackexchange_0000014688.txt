Q:

Why didn't sanding get these scratches out?

I'm sanding a piece of white oak (originally flooring, if that matters, although this isn't for use as flooring). I have done this in what I think is the correct way: starting with 120 grit, then 220, then successively finer grits, down to 3000, to get a really smooth surface.
The wood is perfectly flat, so I used sandpaper gripped in one of those sanding blocks with a soft pad, and I moved in random orbits as best I could by hand.
The initial coarse sanding left very faint scratches that were not removed by subsequent finer passes:

Why would that happen, and how do you prevent it, and is there any way to save this piece?

A:

Random orbits are only a good strategy when a machine is doing it. So in the future, sand with the grain.
To fix this, start at about 80, and work your way back up through the grits. Don't skip grits too quickly. (In other words, get the cross-grain scratches out with the 80 before you move up. You'll never fix issues like that with finer and finer grits.)
This might be a matter of opinion, but mine is that you're wasting time going past 400. Maybe your application really wanted 3000, but I'd love to know why.
