Q:

Makita RT0700C plunge base, is the plastic guard detachable?

I didn't find anything on this in the user manual. If this is similar to my previous router (Bosch branded), you would think that it simply rotates when you need a clear view of the router bit.
I tried to detach it by pulling (gently) on the top, so that it rotates along what I think are hinges on the bottom, but it's really stiff, judging from the high pitch sound it's making when it snaps back. If I pull harder, I know it's going to either rotate, or break, and I'm not taking any chances.

A:

This is a compliant mechanism. You have to squeeze it slightly like this

in order to slide it up:

The two V-blocks at the back are supports for the rails of the parallel guide.
