Q:

How do I completely disassemble a hand plane to clean it and then reassemble it?

I have a block plane that I picked up from Lowes a few months ago.  I took it apart recently to clean the blade but when I tried to put it back together I was unable to get consistent results when passing the plane over the wood.  There was significant tear-out, leading me to believe I may have put the blade in wrong?
I've looked for comprehensive instructions on how a plane is disassembled/reassembled but have not found a good canonical source of this information.  Can anyone provide some details in this regard?

A:

For mere assembly, please see http://www.tooltrip.com/tooltrip9/stanley/stan-bpl/edsheets.pdf These are the instructions created by Stanley Tools years ago and apply generally to all 'vanilla' hand planes.
The steps for tuning the plane are many depending on the use you have in mind. Generally, they include:

flattening the bed, 
ensuring that the frog sits well,
flattening the back of the iron, 
honing the edge of the blade,
ensuring the cap sit well on the blade, and 
adjusting the depth of cut.

There are several sources to track down. The first ones that comes to mind are by  author Christopher Schwarz. He has a youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAYcwubAO2E regarding the setup of a brand new plane, a book on hand planes, Handplane Essentials, which covers setup and a dvd, Super-Tune a Handplane. There are others, just he sprang to mind immediately.
