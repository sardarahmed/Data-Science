Q:

Used paint stripper on interior trim, wood now looks stringy. Is this repairable?

This trim is 60 years old and had at least 6 different layers of paint which resulted in it being difficult to see the delineation between the multiple layers of trim.
I used smart strip. It worked great, but it also seemed to damage the wood and make it look stringy. It's way past fuzzy, it's hairy.
How do I fix this? Can it even be fixed?
Will it be sandable once it's totally dried?
Or is the only solution to paint some glue on to secure the fibers, add wood filler to the damaged spots, and then paint over it?
At this point I'm thinking the easiest thing to do is remove the trim, and let it dry thoroughly in the sun after using the citric acid neutralizer.
I'm thinking that removing the trim from the wall will make it easier to work on and hopefully fix it, especially that small curved piece on the inside.
My spouse thinks that this was installed by a professional trim carpenter and that we'll never be able to reinstall it correctly if it's removed.
Hiring someone is not an option.

A:

I can't say for sure, but I strongly suspect that a good hand sanding (start at 60, work your way up) will fix all that ails you. Wear gloves to minimize splinters. And if it doesn't produce the results you want, you really aren't any further behind.
As a general statement, removing and reinstalling trim can cause problems. Old wood can be brittle and prone to breaking. You'll probably have plaster damage that then needs to be remediated. You might discover twists/warps that were previously held in check by nails.
