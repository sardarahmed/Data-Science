Q:

Miters on window casings shrank with cold weather. How do I fix this?

Last winter I started replacing the casings on the doors and windows in my house and have continued this off and on over the summer and fall.  When the weather  turned colder this fall, the miters on all the casings I completed in the warm weather opened up. (See below photo).   The ones I made last winter are fine, as are those on interior doors regardless of when they were put together, so Iâ€™m pretty sure this has to do with wood contraction in the cold.
What is the best way to repair these miters?  I was thinking of squirting in wood glue with a needle applicator, then filling and painting. Bad idea?
Also, what could I have done to prevent this in the first place?
Many thanks!

A:

It's not so much wood contracting in the cold, as wood contracting when it loses moisture. Depending on where you are, summer is probably more humid than winter.
I'd hit it with a bit of spackle and repaint. If you want less of this in the future, glue the joints thoroughly and backprime the trim. (Backpriming slows moisture loss/gain.) Some people will even use biscuits, but I'm not a huge fan.
