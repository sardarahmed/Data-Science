Q:

Using a left and right shooting board to square the ends of a board

I'm a beginner hand-tool only woodworker and am trying to square the two ends of a 3ft long, 2.5" thick board of cherry for a floating shelf.
I've succeeded in squaring one edge, one face, and one end. Now, I need to square the opposite end.
Normally I would score a line across the grain, saw off the waste, then fine tune the end with a block plane until it's square to the reference face and edge. This take a lot longer than the first end, which can be done efficiently on a shooting board.
Then it dawned on me, what if I just got a second shooting board?
This would allow me to quickly and accurately square both ends. How hard is it really to shoot both ways with a sharp plane blade?
The other option I can see is to flip the board end-for-end on a single shooting board. However, this means the reference face won't be against the shooting board. I can do my best to make the opposite face co-planer to alleviate this, but that's a lot of work for non-showing faces.

A:

It is normal to flip board end for end to shoot last end. But because you are making a floating shelf squareness of this end does not matter, you can turn board over.
