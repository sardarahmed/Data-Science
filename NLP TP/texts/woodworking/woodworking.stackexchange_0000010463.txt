Q:

Is this ostrichwood?

The lady at the lumber dealer said this was ostrichwood. Is she pulling my leg?

A:

Wood ID questions are off-topic, but in this case we seem to have made an exception. I think it is clear from your very good picture that this is not ostrichwood.
You don't say where you are in the world, but given the grain structure this looks like emuwood.
Provide a picture of the end-grain so we can be sure, or just take a look at a quarter-sawn end: ostrichwood has two "toes" running down the grain, whereas emuwood has three.
