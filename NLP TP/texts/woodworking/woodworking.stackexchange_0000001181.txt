Q:

Where to find hardware for awning mount?

I'm looking into building an awning, but having trouble locating some of the materials. Where would I find the hardware in the picture below? I need a somewhat decorative piece of metal to mount the awning to the wall. 
I also thought I would be able to find plans for building an awning like the one pictured. Is there a good resource for finding plans for woodworking projects, or do I just need to put in the work to create one myself?

A:

That looks like a custom job to me.  Thought it doesn't look to hard to copy.  The hardware also looks like it could be custom made.  
The awning has three boards on the bottom, then the pergola boards across.  Then one board on each end of the pergola boards to 'hide' the ends. Last a board across the front to hide the ends and make it look like solid squares on the ends.
With just one screw holding into the brick, I would guess that most of what holds it securely to the wall is at the top end.
