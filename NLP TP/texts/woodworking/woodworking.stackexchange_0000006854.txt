Q:

Is there another name for these heavy duty cam-style clamps?

I have a Porter Cable dovetail jig that has clamps for holding the boards. (Other brands have similar clamps.) These have wide bars supported only at the ends, so there is room for a wide board to pass through. The clamp is actuated by a lever, with cams on a tube that spans the clamping bar.
The description refers to them as "Heavy Duty Cam-Style Clamps".

I am designing a CNC router, and would like to have a similar clamp on the end of the table holding the board upright within cutting reach. I have not been able to find kits or parts to replicate this type of clamp. Searching for "Cam Style Clamps" or variations finds many clamps of other types that are not suitable.
Is there a specific name for this type of clamp that is distinct from other cam-actuated clamps?
Alternatively, are there other types of clamps that are effective for holding wide boards in a vertical position at the end of a work bench or table?

A:

Another name for cam-style clamps is eccentric clamp, named after the eccentric circle principal that it uses -- the rod goes through the black plastic cams closer to one end than the other, so when you rotate the rod, the portion of the cam between the rod and the clamped surface increases, providing clamping power.
But, searching for that doesn't get me any particularly great results for vises like the one on the dovetail jig. I did find this article, which explains how to build the same style of vise using cam clamps -- hopefully that helps.
