Q:

Can I put more than one extractor on a dust collection system?

I'm about to install a proper dust extraction kit in my workshop. I've been wheeling my dust extractor or vac around to each of the powertools but I've got some pipes, junctions and gates that I'm going to route around the shop to allow me to leave my extractor in the corner (before I move it to an external lean-to).
But occasionally —even in a small shop— a 1.5HP extractor isn't enough. It's possible I might want two lines open at once when routing or planing. That's going to cause some pretty sluggish air, even down at 2½".
But something occurred to me this morning. Why can't I just add my vac to the line? I could easily spur in a t-juction at the same end as my extractor. I could even add another extractor one day.
So my question is, can you gang up multiple vacuums in parallel? My vac and extractor have completely opposite airflow profiles so do I have to consider CFMs and static pressures?
And for the sake of thinking this through, what about putting the two suction devices at opposite ends? Without any real thought, I think that'd just cause a big blockage in the middle but maybe the different profiles mean it'd actually work much better.

A:

I had the same thought when I was setting up my system (since I have two units). I did quite a bit of research and came to the conclusion that using two units in parallel is not a good idea. The two units will be working against each other and it could end up damaging one or both of the systems.
It would be better to setup the second unit on a separate "circuit" of pipes. This way, you limit the length of pipes that each system is pulling from and therefore increase the effectiveness of each unit.
