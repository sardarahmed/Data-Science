Q:

What is the name of that milling technique

I remember a wooden pot-coaster: one side had lateral grooves milled and the other side had the same grooves, but in orthogonal direction. The grooves were deep enough that the grooves met in the middle, producing a matrix of rectangular through holes.
Does this pattern have a name?

A:

Waffle is how I've commonly heard this pattern referred to.
