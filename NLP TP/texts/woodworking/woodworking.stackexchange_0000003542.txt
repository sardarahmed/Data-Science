Q:

Trying to identify this antique woodworking tool

I am trying to find out what this vintage woodworkng tool is called. It holds a small file. It seems to be cast iron. It does have screws to open & change files. Any ideas? PAT. Jan. ? 1891  No makers marks.

A:

You have there what's called a saw jointer.  The one below is very similar.  The site linked as the source says it's similar to a Stearn's model, so that might be what you have.

(source)
These are used to joint (flatten) the teeth of a hand saw to one level.  After jointing, one would then sharpen each individual tooth such that the points are now at the same level as just jointed.
Here's a YouTube video that shows the sharpening process in great detail.  You can see the author explaining the use of a homemade jointer at 26:16 and use it at 51:39.
