Q:

Why a zero clearance insert?

I sometimes see woodworkers talking about a zero-clearance insert for their table- or band-saws. 
What is it? And why/when should I use one?

A:

To prevent small pieces from falling into the gap. 
To serve as a backing to minimize chipout on the back side of the cut. 

I can't think of a time when you wouldn't be better off using one. However, sometimes it's sort of a pain to make one for every blade, or in the case of a Dado set every blade combination... So it tends to not be used for non critical cuts sometimes. But again, I can't imagine it not helping for any cut. 

A:

A zero clearance insert is an insert which exactly matches the width of the blade. You can make one by slowly raising the blade through an un-cut insert.
The advantage is as aaron says, they prevent things from falling through the hole, and more importantly, they reduce chip-out by ensuring that the piece has support and thus chips won't tend to get pulled away from the board. It's not perfect though, so if you care, still put in your sacrificial piece. In general, the less open space you have under your piece, the more control you have over it when cutting. 
You should always use an insert that leaves as little gap around the blade as possible.

Let me add a couple things:

Here's two references for making one: Mattias Wandel's method, and Woodmagazine's method. And here's what it looks like:

They're typically made out of plywood or MDF to prevent wood movement.

Others have mentioned that they're used for two reasons (1) to reduce chipout and (2) to prevent pieces from falling through the hold. Let me add a third: to improve dust collection. When you have a zero-clearance insert, it leaves less room for sawdust to spill onto the table (and directs it down the dust chute). Or at least that's what I've heard.
