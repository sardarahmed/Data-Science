Q:

Chip out outside side of track saw cut?

I'm considering a Makita track saw. I wondered if anyone sees chip or tear out on the non-track side. I understand that festool has an insert (Festool 499011) which the blade cuts through, so something is contacting both sides of the cut. Does the Makita have something similar?
My main reason is that I'm going to attempt a continuous grain pattern, so I'd like to make one cut but have both sides useable.

A:

I don't think Makita has this feature. Also, it does not really help on the Festool machine in my experience.
A good technique is to not cut completely with the first cut but only the first 1 or 2mm. Then, make sure the track is in the same position and make the final cut. My Mafell MT55cc has an extra setting for this kind of cut which also moves the blade 1/10mm to the side; so for sure no tear out!
Also make sure to use the correct blade for cutting. In general, less teeth if you cut along the fibres and more teeth orthogonal to the fibres.
