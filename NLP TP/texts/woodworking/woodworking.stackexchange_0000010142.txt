Meat Grinder Table Design

I am considering building a table for a meat grinder out of wood and then covering it in something to make it last longer. The basic idea is that the grinder would sit on a higher section and then there would be a lower section where I could set a lug for the meat to fall into. The problem is I want to make sure that it is easy to clean such that blood and water don't ruin the wood. I was thinking about getting sheet metal and screwing it to the faces, but was curious if there was a better way to protect the table. This will only be used a few months out of the year, but needs to hold up. I have also thought of putting several coats of outdoor polyurethane, but I am not sure how that would hold up to being hosed off over time. 

A:

There is "Butcher Block" type of finish (a kind of food safe mineral oil I think). It is used for cutting boards and the like. I also use it to coat wooden utensils, they hold up well in dishwasher too. 
It should be reapplied occasionally.
I don't know if it is rated for outdoor applications though.
