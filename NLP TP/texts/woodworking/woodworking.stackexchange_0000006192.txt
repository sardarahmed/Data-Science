Q:

Is it possible to make a combination tool?

I've seen add-ons for turning a dremel rotary tool into a router or drill press, though I question the soundness of its use for large woodworking projects. 
Would it be feasible to construct a rig to allow a heavier duty drill press to "flip" under the table and function as a router? Or to rotate 90Â° to the horizontal and operate as a lathe?

A:

This is what the Shopsmith brand tools are known for. They sell tools in a couple of different configurations, such as the Shopsmith Mark V or the Shopsmith Mark 7. Different configurations allow you to set up the tool and use it as a variety of different shop tools, depending on what is supported by the particular model:

Table saw
Lathe
Drill press
Disc sander
Horizontal boring
Router
Shaper

The pros of having such a multitool are price and shop space. The most obvious cons is the time to switch between tool configurations. Another downside is that any tool that tries to do more than one job tends not to do any of them as well as a dedicated tool. And another con is the same as the first pro: its cost. It's true that you pay less for the multitool than you would for the full set of dedicated tools. But since it can do so much, it is still fairly expensive. It might be cheaper to buy just the one or two dedicated tools you are most likely to use.
As always, there are trade-offs. Shopsmith has been selling their multitools since the 1950s. Plenty of people have used them and found them to be perfectly serviceable for their needs. If you have a small shop and are looking to maximize tooling for the space, and if you don't mind the tool changeover time, then multitools like this are something you might want to consider.
