Q:

How to secure these 2 stair handrails together.

Enclosed are pictures of the railing. As you can see I have attempted to use a miter cut to join the 2 railings together. I was also thinking about mitering the other railing so the angled one could fit right in. I was wondering what the most secure way would be? Thanks

Probably either would be fine. 
As it sits currently all you'd need to do to make a firm connection would be to glue and fix the joint. You could even fix it with nails but I'll discount those :-)
Screws
One screw is probably sufficient given the nature of the installation, but use two side by side if you feel the extra strength is needed. 
You need to drill clearance and pilot holes first of course. Then after lightly sanding the mating surfaces to ensure a good glue bond, glue the joint and drive the screw/screws in. 
No need for clamps as the screws will supply the clamping force.
If you want to make the glue joint a little more secure you could size the end grain surface prior to applying the main bonding glue. 
Plug the clearance holes with face-grain plugs if you want the fixings to be hidden, but I don't think this is a must-do since the drilled holes will be hard to see given their position.
Dowel
As an alternative to screwing you could use one fat dowel or two narrower ones, again driven in from below into drilled holes. Leave the dowel slightly over-long and it will plug its own hole, simply saw off the excess and pare any remainder with a very sharp chisel until completely flush.
