Q:

Installing a solid wood tabletop on this steel frame

I would like to screw this solid wood tabletop (the long one in the back, it's beech wood)

onto this steel frame.

The slab's dimensions are going to be 200 x 80 cm. I read that "wood moves", so I would have to screw the table top on in a way that allows for movement.
The problem is that none of the methods that I've read about that allow for movement are compatible with the screw holes facing up in the frame.

How can I solve this? Should I worry about movement for this type of tabletop at all or can I just screw it fixed?
Here's another photo of how the wood is supposed to look after it's been oiled:

The over-sized screw holes will certainly allow the table top to expand and contract without splitting.  
Even if the changes across the grain take up the slack allowed by the larger holes, the frame itself will likely flex enough to allow for the wood movement without splitting.
I think the whole project is a winner - go for it.
