Q:

What kind of plane is this?

I just bought a wooden plane but I am new to hand planes and couldn't identify it.
It seems to not fit in any category known to me (shoulder plane, bullnose plane, chamfering plane etc.)

...

Later edit: the gap between the iron and the "frog":

Caused by the misalignment of the top vs bottom of the resting area of the iron

A:

Although the manufacturer call this a Stepped Rabbet Plane this is a bullnose plane. 
Although their forms vary all planes with the iron bedded at a typical angle* and mounted in such a way that it's the leading part of the plane are in effect bullnose planes, intended for planing directly into a corner or the end of a stopped housing/dado.

*Generally 45° or thereabouts. Similar planes with shallow bed angles of 20° or below (the iron mounted bevel up) would be classed as chisel planes. Both types are intended for much the same kind of work.
