Q:

Glueing hardwood

Good day,
I'm trying to fix a small table, using cold glue. It seems the glue doesn't want to "take" on the hard-ish wood.
I've cleaned it with a damp cloth. The glue lasts a few months and then the thing comes apart...
Any advice?
Update:

A:

I'm not familiar with that brand of glue, but assuming it's reasonable quality and there's nothing wrong with it (moisture, too old, etc) and has been applied properly the glue is should hold extremely well and for decades.
Make sure the wood doesn't have any coatings (paint, oil, dust, etc) and is held firmly with clamps while the glue dries. If you don't have clamps or just want the job done quickly, nailing or screwing the timber in place while the glue is wet will also work (once the glue sets it will be far stronger than screws or nails).
Also the "edge grain" of timber will glue with much more strength than "end grain". There are techniques you can research to mitigate this if end grain gluing is the only option, but generally it should be avoided.
There are other glues that can be used with paint, but you have to know the chemicals in the paint to find a suitable glue.
