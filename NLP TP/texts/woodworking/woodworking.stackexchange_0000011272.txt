Q:

Wood screws versus GRKs

I have some built in cabinet designs that are all-hardwood designs with structural members getting screwed into the framing of the house. The structural members are expensive hardwoods like Wenge. They are visible, but the places where the screws fasten into the framing are hidden.
Naturally the carpenters are going to want to use a single pilot hole and use GRKs to fasten them.
I am thinking of insisting on stainless steel wood screws, even though it means drilling two different diameter pilot holes plus the countersink, the reason being that the wider diameter of the wood screw will give a more secure and dimensional screwdown than the skinning GRKs.
Are GRKs perfectly adequate for this or is my impulse to use SS wood screws better?

A:

GRK makes lots of screw sizes, and there are lots of stainless screws, many of which are less strong than similarly sized GRK.
My guess is that the strength of the fastener is never going to even be an issue.  There are thousands of kitchen cabinets held up by the cheapest screws imaginable.  Typically with a built-in, the cabinet itself is supporting all the weight and the screws just hold it in place.  This makes the choice of screws even less an issue.
