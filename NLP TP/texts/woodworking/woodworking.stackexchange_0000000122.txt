Q:

How do I calculate the amount of downward force a nail will support?

I have a project in mind that creates a removable panel ceiling, made of wood, in my finished basement. Part of the current design is fastening boards to the 1950's ceiling/floor joists that the ceiling panels will be suspended from. I want to use finish nails installed with a Pneumatic nailer.  The wood will be stained a light color.
How do I calculate how much a nail will support? I don't want to use too few nails and have the ceiling fall down, and I don't want to use more than is needed. 
Smaller & fewer = more attractive 
vs 
Bigger and more = stronger.

A:

Expanding to an actual answer.
Typically finish nails are, as indicated by the name, for finishing touches. I.e. trim, face materials, etc. They are not structural, and are often used in conjunction with other stronger methods. 
As I understand you question there are a couple of options

Counter-sink screws periodically to provide additional structural support. These can be capped with parts of dowels that match the wood type to hide them.
Use a strong adhesive, and add finish nails for support until the adhesive dries.
Look into a tongue and groove method, combined with adhesive and nails (which can be hidden in the grooves).

The big issue you are having to overcome is gravity (I still haven't found a way to negate its effects!)
