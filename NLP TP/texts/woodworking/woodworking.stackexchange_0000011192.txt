Q:

Will a french cleat system work against bare studs?

My garage isn't finished; there's bare studs.  I want to set up a french cleat system to store my tools.  Can I do it directly against the studs?  Or do I need to hang drywall or a sheet of plywood first?

A:

I think this will work fine.
Make sure you use a spacer, of the same material as the cleats, on the bottom of any storage units so they sit flat on the wall (studs) so the bottom does not teeter in.
One issue is; For any storage unit that is narrower then the stud bays, the bottom of the unit will not have  studs,"wall", to rest against. You will need to have a spacer on the  unit wide enough to bridge the studs or add a furring strip in between the studs for a smaller bottom spacer to rest against.
There are many YouTube videos on French Cleat Tool Storage.

A:

A french cleat relies on the cleat itself- placing a furring strip to further support is a belt and suspenders approach, at which point your cabinets could be screwed to those studs that are exposed and supported by the support strip. I prefer cleats as I tend to work by myself, and they make it easy to hang a cabinet solo. Your cleat will work fine on open stud framing.
