Q:

Joining cross supports to workbench legs

I'm new to woodworking and I'm in the process of building myself a workbench for my garage. The workbench is divided into three sections. Each side will have space for storage and the middle will be left empty as I intend to be able to sit at the workbench. This space leaves space for my legs when sitting at the bench.
I've assembled the top and have cut the legs to length. The top is made from 94mm x 44mm smooth planed timber and a sheet of 18mm hardwood plywood. The legs are 69mm x 69mm smooth planed timber. I also have one more length of 94mm x 44mm which I intend to use as a brace along the whole back side. The two side sections will be boxed out with plywood to provide storage space and rigidity. The horizontal leg supports will need to be able support this plywood and anything stored in there.

I'm thinking ahead to how the horizontal supports with join with the legs and not too sure what the best option is. How should I join the supports to the legs in the circled areas? Are screws sufficient or maybe dowels? I've had a look at different types of wood joints but can't think of one which wouldn't end up with me cutting almost all the way through the leg to facilitate both the front and side supports.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

Honestly I'd use a cross lap joint like

You can do it from both direction, and yes it looks like you are cutting away all the beam but I've used this for my construction of wood racks, that hold a couple thousand pounds of wood.
Though most ways to do the joinery will work just fine, even butt joints if you can do a good job of nailing or screwing them together, because unless you are storing the weights from a weight lifting set ( and I mean a LOT of them) on the shelves even the butt joint is more than enough (with the right fasteners).
Metal L-Brackets would also work.
