Q:

Sticking two desktops together to make an L-shaped desk. Will this pattern for legs support the weight?

Sorry for the terrible paint drawing. I'm looking to stick two desktops together to create an L-shaped desk. I honestly have no clue what I'm doing, I've barely done any woodworking in my life, if you would even call this woodworking.
If I placed legs where the red circles are, would this desk setup be viable? The desk will only ever have a moderate load: a few monitors and a PC and maybe a printer.
Also, should I screw some kind of joint to the desks where the blue square is?
I'll be glad to answer any questions for clarification.
Here are my materials:

A:

You might need two more support legs in the back about half way between the existing corner legs.
You will want to also have bracing in the joint. I would do something bigger than your little square. I diagramed two options. Red or Green. You can wood or plate steel for this.
