Q:

Reuse planks of an old garden house

In my allotment garden there is an old garden house, which needs to be torn off. The house is approximately 30 years old and the planks are varnished. The wood varnish is already peeling off. I don't know whether the wood has been treated with other wood preservatives.
There is no evidence of mold or damage from woodworm and the planks are looking pretty ok for being that old.
For our vegetable patches we want to build a very simple border by embedding boards halfway into the ground. Of course I will remove the wood varnish first.
Now, I'm concerned that possible wood preservatives will be washed out of the wood by rain and absorbed by plants.
The house has not been maintained for at least 10 years.
Do you think it is save to use these planks for our vegetable patches?

A:

It's highly unlikely that the wood was pressure treated for a "dry" use like sheathing.   And, it would be very unusual to use an after market preservative in that setting, beyond the varnish.   So it's almost certainly just wood with some varnish on it.  Safe for the use you propose.
Putting it into contact with the ground as you propose is going to end in disappointment, however.   It's highly likely that it's pine, and 3/4" of pine stuck in the ground will rot off in a year or two.   Hardly be worth the trouble of putting it up, from a landscaping point of view.
