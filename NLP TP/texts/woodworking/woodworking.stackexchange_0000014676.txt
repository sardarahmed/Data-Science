Q:

Do I need a back for a 96"x20"x12" adjustable shelf?

I am building an adjustable shelf 96"x20"x12" (H x W x D) adjacent on both sides to an inside wall corner, anchored to wall - does it need a back?
Since this will be kind of tall and slim I will probably install a fixed shelf board in the middle to make it more stable and rigid.
This shelf will be used to store boxes with smaller tools, larger tools etc. etc.
It will sit 1" away from each wall because there is electrical conduit on that wall. Since it is at the top I might chose to cut the side panels to allow them to get closer to the wall and eliminate the gap at the back.
As mentioned I will use some furniture anti-tip brackets to make sure it is secured.
Do I need a back board for these shelves? My concern is the stability and rigidity of the entire structure, not that things will fall through the opening at the back.
In case I decide to install a back what is it regularly used for? The material is 5/8 melamine, side panels pre-drilled.

A:

If it's anchored to the wall, nope.
Backs on freestanding units serve two functions (arguably three on a bookshelf or dresser), but the one that concerns us here is that backs add rigidity. Without any diagonal bracing the open box of the four sides of a bookshelf or chest of drawers can be very prone to racking. Once you fix a back in place it makes it essentially impossible for the thing to rack since it has to either tear the fasteners free or rip the back apart. Even backs of very modest material like 1/8" (3mm) hardboard can be effective in preventing racking for years of service, even for items moved repeatedly.
The only reason to add a back here is aesthetics â€” do you mind seeing through to the wall behind? If you don't mind, no need to bother with a back unless you think it will aid in the installation of the unit into the corner as a single piece.
