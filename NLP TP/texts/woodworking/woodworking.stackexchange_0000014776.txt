Q:

Dowel diameter reduction

im making a fire staff. My friend bought me a 1 ยน/4 diameter, 58" long dowel but I need to reduce it to 1". I have no equipment, (pretty sure homedepot doesn't accept returns that have been cut to order), perhaps is there a place that could whittle it down? This stick already cost $16, looking for cost effective and efficient way to reduce  1/4" down the entire shaft. Any ideas?

The easiest, most cost effective plan will be to just go buy the right size. My Home Depot has a 1"x72" hardwood dowel for $7. Turning your 1.25" dowel down to a consistent 1" on a lathe would:

be difficult
require a lathe with a very long bed
surely cost more than $7
