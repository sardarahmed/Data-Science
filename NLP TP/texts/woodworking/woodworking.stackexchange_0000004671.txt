Q:

Are any big shop tools manufactured in the USA?

Where a tool (or any product) is manufactured can be a bit broad, so hopefully this isn't off-topic, but are any of the big woodshop tools (table saw, jointer, band saw, etc) made in the US? Let's not consider accessories like blades, but rather the bulk of the tool itself (motor, table, support structure). 
ETA: I'm interested in consumer-grade machines, not industrial. 

A:

Shopsmith (http://www.shopsmith.com/) is one that comes to mind. http://www.stillmadeinusa.com/tools.html#Woodworking may have others.
