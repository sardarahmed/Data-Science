Q:

Hand plane blade lower on one side

I'm a woodworking beginner trying to restore a Stanley no 5 and have run into problem with the blade hanging lower on one side.
I'm not sure if it was originally like this or something I did - I've flattened the sole, squared and sharpened the blade, and ran the frog over sandpaper a few times to remove dirt.
There are no noticeable issues with the mouth, it looks nice and square.
I think this may be something to do with the frog?
Any ideas?

A:

You say Stanley no 5 so your plane is a Bailey pattern, which has a lateral-adjusting lever on the frog. Changing the angle of the cutting edge is the purpose of this lever. Push it towards the corner you want to pull up.
Here's how the lateral works as shown by instructions in Stanley documents:

P.S. If your plane is a very early model, "pre lateral" as it is called, or if the lever is broken from the frog you can still adjust. Using a small hammer hit lightly the side of the iron with the projecting corner.
