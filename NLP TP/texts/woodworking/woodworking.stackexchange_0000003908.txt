Q:

Is this small hand tool with a heart-shaped end a woodworking tool?

This tool is about 5-1/2 inches long including the handle. The tool has a "V" shape. The outer metal sides of the V are beveled on top, with sharp outer edges. The V is bent about 15 degrees or so at the point where its two sides join (and join with the top piece).
It was found with some other tools of my parents. I don't recall seeing it used though. I'm guessing it could be sharp enough to be a small plane for woodworking, or a carving tool.
