Q:

Looking for a type of vise that would fit on a cnc table

We have a CNC machine with an aluminum t-slot table and I'm looking for some type of small vise that could be secured to the table to hold very small work pieces. We have a variety of hold-downs and cam locks for larger work pieces but they don't do a good job with tiny pieces. 
The machine can only clear something about 4 inches tall and clamping a bench vise to the end of the table doesn't work because the gantry can't reach the end of the table.

A:

There are a variety of options out there similar to what you are describing.
These are the first two that come to mind:
Rockler Hold Down Clamp

Bessey Hold Down

A:

The obvious thought would be to clamp a clamp to the table -- perhaps a small wooden handscrew clamp, or something homebrewed from threaded rod or from bolts and threaded inserts.
Presumably you would want the jaws to be wood or some other sacrificial material, so if your programming goes outside the bounds of the piece being worked on, deliberately or by error, you don't destroy the bit.
