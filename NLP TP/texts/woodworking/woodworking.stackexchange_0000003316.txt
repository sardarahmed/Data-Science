Q:

What is this brace bit cutter tool exactly and how is it used?

I was liberating some old hand tools from my grandfather's shop again, before grandma throws them in the garbage, and found some more interesting things. This time I am sure that this one is a woodworking tool!

It looks like a tool that's a tapering tool that could be used to make tenons on chair legs or something similar. It seems clear that it is meant to be used in a brace. Seems hard to try and cut a tenon though as I would think the tool would easily drift. 
Following is the only markings on the tool as well as a view from the bottom that shows the blade. 

What do you think this is called and more importantly what is it used for?

A:

Hollow auger
U.S. Patent 203,384 is for a "Hollow auger" or more specifically for improvements to a hollow auger.  "What's a hollow auger?" you ask.  Well, as @Keshlam suggested it is a device for cutting tenons on chair rungs or spokes as demonstrated by a similar device on a You Tube video.  It's a device that, rather than drilling a hole, it drills what fits into a hole.
The patent claims that the improvement is that this version of the hollow auger is adjustable so as to "obviate the necessity of using a separate auger for each sized tenon."
I will leave it to @Matt to figure out exactly how this one works, but it will require a brace for turning the cutting mechanism and a vice for holding the workpiece.
With tongue in cheek, I suggest that this device might also be an answer to my question from several months back: How can I make my own dowels? 

A:

This tool is a tapering tool for chair, or table legs.
How to use:
With the leg in a vise, square end to one side, the tapering tool is brought slowly and carefully (adjusting from the square end) down to the foot end one layer at a time. It is adjusted using an adjustable hand wrench.
I am old-school (75 years old) and I used this tool when I was a youth of 12 years.
