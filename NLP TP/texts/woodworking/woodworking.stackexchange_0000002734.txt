Q:

What method or tool is available to make the following type of hole/indent in a piece of wood?

I would like to make a sphere like hole in a piece of wood like the image below. Is there a special bit or tool to do this?

A:

You're looking for a round nose bit, like the one pictured below.

It also looks like the edges of the hole are rounded over, for which you'd also use a roundover bit.

You could also take care of rounding the edges with sandpaper or a file/rasp.
