Q:

What is "matrix gluing" (as opposed to "surface gluing")

A friend of mine is interviewing for a chemist position at a glue factory. As part of the interview, she has been asked to prepare a short presentation on the difference of "matrix gluing vs surface gluing" (translated from German "Matrixverleimung", I don't know if it's the correct jargon in English).
We have found many explanations of "surface gluing", where you join flat pieces of wood together.
However, we cannot find definitions of "matrix gluing" anywhere in the internet, nor in scientific literature.
So: What is matrix gluing?
My assumption is that it has something to do with the production of things like medium-density-fiber board (MDF) or press-board, or other types of panels made from wood splinters/fibers.
However, we'd like to be certain, since a job-offer could depend on it. Links to definitions, or other search terms we should be using would be appreciated!

A:

So, after the interview, we now know for certain what interpretation they were looking for.
"Matrixverleimung"/Matrix gluing does indeed refer to structures like pressboard/MDF/etc. where the wood-fibers/chips are embedded in the glue, as opposed to connected by the glue in "surface glueing"
Any manufactured wood where the glue itself provides a non-negligable part of the bulk of the material is said to be "matrixverleimt" (matrix glued)
