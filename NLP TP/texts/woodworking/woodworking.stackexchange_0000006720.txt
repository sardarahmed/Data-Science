Q:

What Length Pocket Hole Screws Are Generally Used?

I'm about to start using pocket holes to join wood together, but I'm not certain as to what length pocket hole screws are used for general joinery/fabrication. I'm interested in making things like small tables.
What length screws are used for general fabrication? Is there a significant difference in length vs holding power? What length is good for building things like a small table (Around 1m^2 area)

A:

The answer depends on how much wood you need the screw to go through in the stock that you drill the hole in, plus how deep you want it to penetrate into the receiving stock. There's no single answer to give, but here's a big chart from Kreg that breaks down different common scenarios and the suggested screw length:
