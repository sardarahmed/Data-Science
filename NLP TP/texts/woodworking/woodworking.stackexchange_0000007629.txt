Q:

Joint all sides square?

Can you use a jointer, using the fence, to plane all four sides of a wood piece, into four, plane, square and parallel to each other? I mean each side square to the adjacent and all sides parallel to non-adjacent sides.
Do you really need a thickness planer for this or using the square fence on the jointer would be enough?

A:

No, you cannot.  This will make the board square, but it will NOT ensure it doesn't taper.  With the jointer you can only make each corner square.  You can't make the opposing faces parallel with each other.
For example, imagine you're milling a board that tapers from 10" wide at one end to 5" wide at the other.  You'll start by face jointing, then joint one edge.  When you go to joint the second edge the board will rest on the infeed table, but the first edge you jointed will not be parallel with the table.  One corner will be 5" from the table, and the other will be 10" from the table.  If you make full passes you'll remove material evenly until the second edge is straight, but it still won't be parallel with the first edge.
