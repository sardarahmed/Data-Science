Q:

Should I pick the darker colored wood at the lumber yard?

When I compare softwood like douglas fir, I try to pick wood that is straight and doesn't have too many knots.
When I find several pieces of wood, should I then go for the darker colored wood?
I assume the darker colored pieces are more likely to be heartwood and they should be more rot resistant no?
Thank you.

I don't think that's necessarily a valid assumption. As far as I know, heartwood is generally darker than sapwood, but if you're picking through the lumber at your local home center and one board is darker than another, it's likely that they're just from two different trees, or one has been lying around longer, or one was on the outside of the bundle when it rained during transport, or something like that.
In any case, any differences in rot resistance related to the color of the wood are likely to be pretty unreliable. If you need rot resistance for whatever you're building, buy material that's actually known to be rot resistant, i.e. either pressure treated lumber, or cypress or other species that are naturally rot resistant.
