Q:

Use a fence with a router bit with a bearing?

I was putting a roundover on some pieces and used my router table. The table has a fence, and the 1/8" roundover bit I used had a bearing on the bottom (top with the router installed in the table). I didn't bother setting my fence very accurately, just got it within 1/4" or so. My father-in-law asked a couple times if I was sure I didn't want to set my fence properly. I figured the bearing would keep the bit from cutting too deep, and went ahead with the cut with the fence not flush.
Was I making a dangerous cut or otherwise operating the router in an unsafe manner? Is it preferred to use a fence instead of the bit's bearing?

A:

It's preferable to use both. The fence, lined up with the bearing, protects against the workpiece slipping up and over the bearing, and provides a place to mount featherboards to help keep the workpiece flat against the table.
