Q:

How to fix Ikea wooden lamp

The wooden legs of my Ikea Lauters lamp came loose and I need some advice how to fix it.
This is how the lamp looks like - you see the wooden legs:
The 3 legs each have a wooden "peg" that enters in a hole in the wooden disk and also a hole through which a screw connects to a nut that was fixed in that disk:

My problem is the nut that was inside the disk came off and there's no way to fix it back in the wooden disk. You see, the outer "teeth" of the nut must have eaten the wood away:

Any ideas how to fix this? I'm a total newbie. One solution would be to glue the nut and the leg but I don't know what glue to use.

A:

There are a few different ways to go about fixing this.

replace the 'disk' with a new piece of wood and drill all the holes etc to 'recreate it'.  "Most work"

drill the hole out (maybe with a forsner bit) and glue in a plug of the same size as the drilled hole, then redrill the smaller hole and reinsert the 'insert'

fill the current hole with glue and sawdust, after it sets, redrill the pilot hole and reinsert the insert (least effective)

Use epoxy to 'glue' the insert back in.  Make sure you have a bolt in the insert so the insert doesn't get filled with the epoxy or alternatively, fill the hole with epoxy then redrill it and put the insert back.

I would personally tend toward #1, but #4 would be a close second, and depending on materials, and tools available, #4 becomes much more appealing.
