Q:

Can one apply dark shellac over light shellac (satisfactorily)?

I’ve darkened the color of my shellac by adding dye. I’m quite satisfied with the new color.
I have a piece brushed with several coats of the same shellac flakes without dye, and i thought i’d be able to move expertly enough to apply new darker layers over it, evenly. Is this a futile enterprise?
I’m at two coats of the darker stuff, but new layers are fusing too deep, and shades are melding.

Is there anything i can try before getting back to the wood (sanding or spiriting away)?

A:

Some finishes, especially catalyzed ones, will be impervious to further coats which will build up in layers. In other finishes, especially solvent based ones like shellac and most lacquers, the solvent in subsequent coats will dissolve the underlying layers to some extent depending on several factors.
I doubt you will achieve layering your different tones via brushing; brushing prolongs the contact time and offers some agitation, both of which encourage the new layer to mix with the old. The best way to achieve this tonal layering would be spraying thin coats under warm conditions. When I do "wash coats" of shellac on guitars the coat will be dry to the touch in seconds.
I'd say, lacking spraying capacity, you are best off removing the existing finish and applying coats of only one tone.
