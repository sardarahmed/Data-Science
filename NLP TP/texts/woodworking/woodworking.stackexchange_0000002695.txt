Q:

What are suitable indoor storage options for wood

What are some suitable storage options for wood indoors. Specifically for wood planks ranging 8 - 10 feet long by 10 - 18 inches wide. The thickness is anywhere from 1 - 2 inches. I am looking for some options that will not take up a lot of space but also will not just result in an unorganized pile of wood. I have a utility closet in my garage that is roughly 10' wide x 12' deep and about 10 feet high. 
I am planning on making my own lumber in the future with trees from my land so I would need to be able to hold more than 20 planks. 
EDIT: The walls/ceiling are finished but I would be ok with drilling into the walls and using studs if the storage option requires it.
