Q:

Need a fireproof/weatherproof solution for fire pit table top

I'm working on a project that I'm hoping won't go up in flames... literally! It's a table top (made out of wood) for a fire pit. I planned on protecting the bottom with this High Heat Ultra Spray Paint, but I'm not sure what kind of finish to use for the top. Normally I would use Thompson's Water Seal for outdoor furniture, but I believe that finish isn't fire resistant. Is there a finish out there that would protect this project from catching fire when placed over a smoldering pile of ash?

A:

Use Cumaru hardwood (aka Brazilian Teak or Golden Teak).  My internet searching seems to indicate that this wood has a Class A fire rating and is as resistant as concrete to fire.
This link includes a number of results from test data backing this up.

The type of testing that these hardwood decking and siding species were tested for is commonly referred to as ASTM E84-10 "Standard Method of Test for Surface Burning Characteristics of Building Materials". This fire testing standard was established by ASTM International (formerly known as American Society of Testing and Materials). A Class A fire rating using the ASTM test method is the equivalent of a Class A fire rating from the following test methods and agencies:

ANSI/NFPA No 255 from the American National Standards Institute/National Fire 
  Protection Association
IBC 8.1 from the International Building Code
UL 723 from Underwriters Laboratories
