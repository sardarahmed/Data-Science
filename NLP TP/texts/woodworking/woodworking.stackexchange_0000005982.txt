Q:

Making layered thin stock (complex shape) flush?

For my project I've ran into a issue that I am unsure how to resolve. 
I am making legs for a stand. These legs (finished) are approx. 3" thick after face-gluing three 1" boards. Each board was cut using a template and 1" long flush-trim bit in my router. 
This resulted in many of my complex shape, cut almost perfectly. Unfortunately, each piece of this layer cake is still slightly imperfect and not totally flush after gluing. 
Apart from purchasing yet another expensive specialty router bit, how can I make this "thick" stock totally flush once more? The picture attached shows my legs waiting to be glued, but you get the idea.

A:

Spindle sander, drum sander, belt sander (using both the flat and the end drum parts.) Some parts of those will require a spindle or drum, on casual examination. Should help getting the router-burn marks out as well.
Rasps or microplanes of various shapes may also be useful. As would a plane if you're up for sharpening it, as most people these days are evidently not.
With a block plane you can plane the flat parts and the convex parts (to some extent.) If you want to plane the concave parts, you'll need more tools, such as a round-bottomed spokeshave. If you are dedicated to not buying any more tools, you may have to spend a long time hand-sanding with sandpaper on blocks or wrapped around dowels.
