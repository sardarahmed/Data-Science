Q:

How do you prevent screws or other metal from falling in the hole on your router table?

Our community workshop router table also ends up being a work bench much of the time. A router has been broken in the past by someone accidentally knocking a screw in the hole which landed in the router motor housing, then later turning on the router - crunch.
Since then I have used a small wood cutout with a magnet on one side to prevent this happening again, but its difficult to take on and off and is easy to lose.
Basically the goal is to easily/quickly plug the hole, make it removable, and ideally keep the plug from being lost.
Anyone have a better suggestion?

A:

Use a blank insert for your router table insert plate - assuming you have one. There is one pictured in this set of five. (shown below)
