Q:

Can anyone identify this tree?

I have a tree on my property that looks like it's not doing too well this year, leaves are very scanty, and may have to be cut down.  I'd like some help identifying it, so I can determine if it's worth sawing it into boards for woodworking.  It's a tall hardwood about 40-50' in height.  The leaves are maple-like (at least to my eye) but very large.  Last year they were quite abundant, and typically about 6-8" in diameter.  The tree also produced spherical seed pods last year, about quarter-sized. The seed pods are smooth, not spiny. The limbs have a wavy sort of shape to them.
I'm located in eastern Maine (the Bangor area).  One relative suggested it might be tulipwood, but nothing I've read online about tulipwood mentions the seed pods.  I haven't seen any blossoms, but that might be because it's in poor health.  (I bought the house in September so I wouldn't have been around for last year's blossoms.)

Depending what you mean by "smooth" for the seedpods, sycamore is my best guess, though the bark is not nearly as classically peely as is typical. But the leaf is a dead ringer, and it's sure not tuliptree.
