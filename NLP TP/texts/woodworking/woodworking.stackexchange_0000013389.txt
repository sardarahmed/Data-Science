Q:

Finish for a soap mould?

Background :
Hi,
Wood is often used as a material for trivets, it has a low heat transfert coeficient and do not alter or suffer from temperatures as high as 100°C. (& probably often more for trivets)
Because of this properties, I am using it to make a saponification mould, which will recieve visquous liquids ranging from 50 to 80°C.
I want to apply a finish to the wood, namely Tung oil (also called abrasin oil), to stop it from absorbing too much of the liquid, and to prevent the solidified liquid to stick to it too much. (even though for this purpose, a supplementary release agent will probably be applied each time, on top of the permanent oil coating)
Question :
I wanted to have a hint of an average value for maximum temperatures an oxydation-based solidified oil on wood can handle before changing properties / degrading ?
If no such value seems available,  do anyone know from experience if they become tacky or tend to turn back to a "liquid" form at temperatures around 80-100°C ?
Thanks for the insights !

A:

From images available online soap moulds are not finished.
If exposed to liquid mixture wood will not absorb more soap after first time so no need to seal for that reason, and exposure to water is not a problem for bare wood. Mould will last many years if dried between uses, same as wooden drying racks for plates or laundry.
But from my researches lining wood moulds seems normal, so mould may remain dry!
From How to Find a Soap Mold That’s Right for You:

If you want to make melt & pour soap in a wood soap mold, I would definitely use a silicone liner. Melt & pour soap is too thin when hot and will seep through the seems of the freezer paper.
