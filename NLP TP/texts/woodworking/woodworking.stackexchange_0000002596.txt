Q:

Will painting the edges of plywood hide the layers?

If I paint the edges of an oak plywood sheet, will it hide the layers well enough to not show through the paint?

If you're asking whether you will only see a flat, smooth base below the paint (like you would expect when painting drywall), the answer is no.
No matter how well you sand the plywood edge, you will still get some of the layering/imperfections that show through the paint as shadow lines or will be visible as slightly differently-colored area when viewed in a raking light.
There is one way that I know of to mitigate this effect:

Fill the edges of the plywood with a wood filler to take care of any little dings, scratches, gaps, or craters that might not be readily visible.
Sand the filler back to flat after it's dried/cured
Paint the edge with a flat primer to make an even base coat (like what you might do for a house's wall)
Sand the primer back to flat, reapply primer (repeat as often as necessary to achieve a uniform, flat base)
Paint the edge with the color of your choice

This will likely remove enough of the plywood edge that it will stand up to casual scrutiny.  If you're very detailed in your woodfilling and sanding, they results will be even better.
