Q:

Woodshop and fiber insulation

My basement shop area currently has open floor joists above it, with insulation batting between them. (Yes, I know current theory says insulating there is of minimum value, but for sake of discussion ...)
Hand tools, and even small power tools, don't throw enough dust that I've had to worry about this. But as I scale up and start to get more serious about dust collection,  it occurs to me to wonder...
How much risk is there of enough sawdust settling in that insulation to compromise its non-flammability? Do I need to speed up the decision about whether to install a ceiling or remove that batting?  
(I suppose I should note that the insulation in this case is a fireproofed cellulose -- the batting equivalent of blown-in. Much more pleasant to work with than fiberglass.)

A:

I don't believe anyone actually tested how sawdust contamination affects flammability of glass-wool or cellulose insulation.
Just installing a vapor barrier on the bottom will help prevent dust accumulation on the insulation.
