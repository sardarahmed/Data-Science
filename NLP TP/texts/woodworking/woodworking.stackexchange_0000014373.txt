Q:

Ideas to split coat rack in two for mailing?

I'd like to mail this coat rack (about 6 ft high) but would like to split it into 2 pieces by cutting thru the staff.  That would make it easier to mail, but then I need a way for the recipient to put it back together.
I was thinking about putting neo magnets on both sides of the cut, but I don't think that would be strong enough.  Any ideas?

A:

Have you considered mailing it with a carrier that allows large items?
There will be people in your country selling things like skis, tile trim strips, bicycles etc - and they'll probably be happy enough to tell you who they ship with if you ask nicely.
There's a cost premium for mailing items that can't go through an automated sorting system, but they'll still get there - and why cut up the coat rack to save $20 on mailing costs?

A:

You could cut it where you want to and use a dowel screw to attach the pieces afterwards. You'd drill appropriately-sized holed in each section and tighten them onto each end of the screw.

This would allow the two pieces to be disassembled/reassembled as needed.
