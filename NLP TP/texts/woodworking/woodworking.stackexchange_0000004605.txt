Q:

What are these profiled wooden objects with brass end caps?

I'm clearing my mothers basement out and came across these two items. They look like old wood working tools / templates to me so I thought I would ask you guys. 

A:

It is an antique Beech Wood & Brass Sash template. 
In short they were/are used as a template for creating (miter/coping) the framing around windows where glaze is used.
