Q:

What is the name of the second tool

Can somebody please help me out by naming the second tool in the row of tools in this image ? Thank you

A:

Aha! I found it deep in the recesses of my alleged mind, and on The Google too. It's a rebar wire twisting tool. A length of wire with loops at each end is wrapped around an intersection of rebar. The tool passes through the loops and is spun to rapidly secure the rebar together, preventing it from shifting during the pour.
An auction posted to eBay also suggests that it is a rope twisting tool for the farm.

Uh oh, not a wood working tool!
