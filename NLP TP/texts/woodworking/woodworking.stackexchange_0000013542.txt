Q:

Would this TV stand made almost entirely of 3/4 in birch plywood withstand the load?

I'm currently doing a TV stand, pretty new to woodworking. And I was wondering if this would be able to hold the weight of the TV + soundbar? Let's say 40 kg / 88 pounds. The TV base is about 99 cm/39.3 inches wide 25 cm/9.9 inches depth.
The TV stand is made using 3/4 inches birch plywood.
This is a rough sketch of it.

So basically 2 meters wide, 56 cm tall (+ legs). Supported by 5 walls: edges, middle, and 2 walls 40 cm away from the center. (As seen in the picture). The walls are 3/4 thick.
Basically:
Edge wall - - 60 cm - - Wall - - 40 cm - - Center wall - - 40 cm - - Wall - - 60 cm - - Edge wall.
Edge wall - - 23.625 in - - Wall - - 15.75 in - - Center wall - - 15.75 in - - Wall - - 23.625 in - - Edge wall.
Everything, except the legs is 3/4 in birch plywood.
The legs are just mostly for looks. They are wood planks, 8.8 cm/3.46 wide, about 2 inches tall. They are going to be distributed like this.

And at the top we are also using some screws to secure the walls in place (and glue). 5 screws by wall, separated by 10 cm/ 3.94 in along the "wall"

I have been wondering if this is going to withstand the load...  I'm going to use some bricks to test the load once the tv stand is done and wait a week or two, just to be safe. But what do you think?

A:

If you build this right I think you could safely park a motorcycle on top of it. And no, I'm not exaggerating. A (very large apparently!) TV and soundbar should not pose any risk whatsoever.
As already mentioned in the Comments 3/4" / 18mm birch ply is strong, assuming it is decent quality very very strong. And glue-and-screws construction is also a strong and reliable way of putting together plywood projects. So you're lining yourself up for success already.
In addition, in case you're not aware, the back can add a very significant strength component to cabinetry. By fixing firmly to a back panel (even a relatively thin one) you effectively lock the entire shape which prevents racking, barring the fasteners snapping, tearing free or ripping out chunks of plywood.

A:

3/4" plywood is VERY strong.  I have some on a shelf in my shed holding my turning wood, I used full 4'x8' sheets and I have several hundred pounds on it.  no dipping.  I also have some 1/2" plywood on 32" wide shelves and it does a pretty good job.
So yes.  A top only 19" wide with even less support than you are planning would have no problems with a an 88 lbs TV.  It should look pretty nice when you are done.
