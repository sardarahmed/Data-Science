Making biscuits cuts by hand

A good answer from my question on joinery talked about using a biscuit joiner. While this is a great idea a biscuit joiner is not in my top 5 of tools to acquire. I do have a variety of, recently inherited, hand tools that may do the job.

If you aren't going to buy a biscuit joiner for making the cuts, an alternate that is easy, is to 'tongue and groove'.  Run the board over a table saw or use a router bit to make 1/8" or 1/4" grooves centered along the place you want to join, then cut a strip the same thickness and slightly less than the width of the two cuts added together.  Glue it all up and it will be much stronger than biscuits, the biscuits are a faster easier way to do this.

One hand tool that I found that could do this is a router plane. A good looking example comes from Lee Valley
