Q:

Why does sanding make my patterned plywood project look dull?

Below is a pattern plywood cutting board I am making. I have observed through multiple projects that after sanding the surface becomes dull in tone and the layers of the plywood lack definition and sharpness. The portion circled in red is unsanded and the portion circled in blue has been sanded. You can see the dullness of the sanded area.
I notice that if I raise the grain by moistening the surface that the definition is restored, but upon sanding again it will dull.
Why does this happen and how can I avoid it?

A:

This appears to be sanding dust. It's typical for wood to lose its luster when sanding as the sanding dust clogs the surface of the wood, making it look dull. A brush, compressed air, a tack cloth or a cloth damped in mineral spirits (as water would raise the grain) can all be used to remove the sanding dust.
With that being said, there is a difference in how wood looks between cutting and sanding - sharp cutting tools (hand planes in particular) can leave a finish on the wood that's hard to replicate with sanding (even to very high grit), as the wood fibers are cleanly sliced instead of being abraded. Adding a finish on top of that tends to reduce the difference, and leaving a piece unfinished will dull the look from use and handling.
