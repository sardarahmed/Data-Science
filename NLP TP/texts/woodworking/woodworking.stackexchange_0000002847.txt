Q:

Can I use lacquer over an epoxy resin?

I put an epoxy resin on a table top and it looks awesome except for a few spots that bubbled or had dust fall on it. I would like to sand the top down smooth/level and put a thin layer of lacquer on top. I would like to use spray lacquer. Will this stick? Or should I use a different method. I am limited to about 2 days to work on this table before it needs to be used for the holidays.
Update (Seven years later):
The good news is that the table is still in use today! However, I have had some issues with it, and I'm not sure if it's because of the combination of epoxy and lacquer or because I applied it incorrectly. The main issue I've had is when I clean it with a cleaning solution (mild antibacterial). It seems to create a white haze that sort of peels off when I wipe it. Kind of like when you peel off a sticker and you have to scrub to get that sticky stuff off after. Once it's wiped off and dry, you can't tell there was an issue. Again, this may be due to user error.

A:

Lacquer can stick to epoxy. How secure the bond is depends on a few factors but if you provide a textured surface for a mechanical bond to form — as you do when you sand — that gives the best chance for a reliable result. 
I should caution that people have had very mixed results trying to repair/restore the surface of epoxy with varnish and lacquer. At worst apparently the scratches remain clearly visible in the epoxy surface underneath the topcoat, they don't get 'wetted' by the topcoat as they would if you were applying over a layer of the same finish. 
Normally this would mean I'd recommend you do a test or two but you don't have the time so I would either live with the blemishes for now, or just bite the bullet and go for it with the lacquer and hope for the best.
