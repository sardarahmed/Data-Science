Q:

Best way to correct splotchy stain job on MDF?

In making a new tabletop for wife's sewing table, I cut some 3/4" MDF and applied a base of Minwax Pre-Stain Wood Conditioner, and then Minwax Dark Walnut Stain. 
After letting it sit for a day, I noticed some areas that could go a bit darker. Fatal mistake: I used the bottom-of-the-can remnants from a couple of older cans of the same stain that I had kicking around, and clearly didn't mix well enough - now I have some nasty looking dark streaks/swirls. 
What would be the best way to recover from this? I know MDF is cheap and time is pricey, but just as a knowledge base thing, it'd be good to know if there's a way to re-establish a consistent stain via sanding or some other method.  
I also have a can of Minwax Clear Satin Polyurethane spray at ready, with the consideration that it would be a suitable finishing coat for the purposes of a work/sewing tabletop - if that's not a good idea it be great to know too.

A:

Unfortunately, the only way to correct uneven stain is by sanding to bare wood (in your case, MDF) and reapplying the stain. There isn't a way to rescue the stain. Sanding doesn't just lighten the stain, instead it strips the stained wood off. And once you've done that, it's also not possible to re-stain the stripped area and blend it evenly with the other stained areas. So the whole thing has to come off before you can put new stain on, I'm afraid.

That said, in these cases it's often much faster to use a card scraper instead of sanding. A quick google search confirms that you can use card scrapers on MDF, with the usual caveat that MDF dulls a tool's sharp edges faster than wood. See this answer for more information on how to use a card scraper, and the pros and cons of scraping vs. sanding.
