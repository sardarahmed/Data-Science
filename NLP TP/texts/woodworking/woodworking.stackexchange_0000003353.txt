Q:

What are advantages of hide glue and when should I use it?

The majority of all my work has used conventional wood glues with an occasional application of gorilla glue for certain exterior situations.  I confess that I know little about hide glue and its application. Can anyone shed some light on how and when to best apply it?

A:

My only experience is with liquid hide glue.  It is also available as a solid that needs "assembled" before use.  I believe it's biggest benefit is it reversible.
