Q:

How to make a 3/4" flat bottomed hole?

I recently bought a 1/2" 2 flute end mill bit, which fits in my table top drill press (1/2" chuck). I'm making perfectly flat bottomed holes (won't be seen in the final project) that go almost all the way through hard wood, so I can't use a forstner bit (because of the center tip). So far, the end mill bit has been working. However, I need to make a bunch of 3/4" diameter holes. That's been tedious since it means making 4-5 holes for each 3/4" hole (clamp, make hole, move a little, clamp, make hole....).
I can't seem to find an end mill bit that has a 1/2" shank but 3/4" cutting diameter. I did see this post about using a plunge router bit on a drill press though I haven't seen a router bit that looks like it'll cut a flat bottom. Also, from that post, people recommended a fast speed for the drill press, though the instructions on the press recommend slower speeds for hard wood. So I'm confused at that too.
Welcome any thoughts - thanks!
Edit: I also just ran across this cleaning router bit - could that work?

A:

I have used forstner bits where the the center spurs are removable for (presumably) just this sort of job.
See

and

I would start the hole with the spur in place, and then remove it once the hole is established. You will definitely need a drill press for this.

These were all great suggestions, thank you! I wound up getting this table top surface planing bottom cleaning router bit which has been great. 
1) Make sure it's really clamped down tightly.
2) Take small bites, both to keep the bit cool and to clear out debris.
This worked so great I haven't tried filing down a forstner bit - when I do I'll report back.
