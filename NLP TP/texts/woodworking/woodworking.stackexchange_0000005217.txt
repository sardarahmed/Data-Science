Q:

What is damaging this finished oak surface?

I have a lovely oak table; most of its surface looks as pristine as the day I got it, e.g.:

Parts of the table surface are getting damaged -- the finish is wearing off and the pores of the grain are exposed and feel pitted to the touch, e.g.:

Any ideas why this is?  It looks like the areas where this is happening are the areas that get the most sun (through a skylight, not directly overhead), but I haven't seen sun damage like this.  Perhaps somebody else has?
I can rule out water damage or heavy use -- the table is lightly used and wear doesn't seem to be a factor as some of the most used parts look the most pristine.
Any suggestions for an intervention, short of or including refinishing?

A:

To me it looks like damage to the finish from sunlight.  Red oak seems to do this more often.  Not sure why.  Maybe sunlight interacts with the tannin's or the pits don't let the finish cure evenly across the surface.  
Either way, I've seen lots of old red oak furniture that has that wear pattern, and it's much faster to appear on items that have sunlight able to beat on them.  It is possible that using a grain filler before putting on a finishing coat could help prevent this from happening.
