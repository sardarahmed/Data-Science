Q:

How to lower large equipment down the basement stairs

I'm expecting a new member of the shop family to arrive soon and as any expectant father I'm worried about delivery.
I have a 250lbs+ band saw that needs to be lowered down a single flight of stairs into the basement, and I'm trying to figure out the best approach to doing this.
I'll update this with a diagram shortly. 

A:

Back it down with a stair walker:

A:

Some friends and a case of beer moved my entire shop from the garage to basement.
