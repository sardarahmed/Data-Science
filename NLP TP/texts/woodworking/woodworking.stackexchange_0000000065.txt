Q:

How should I dispose of sawdust safely?

My workshop is more accurately termed my garage, with a small table saw, radial saw and a router table that I built. I don't have a central dust collection, and only the radial saw has any dust collection built in.
When I do any projects, I end up sweeping up a pile of sawdust. Most of my projects involve plywood of various thicknesses, poplar/pine up through oak for hardness. I don't work in anything harder/exotic (Such as purpleheart, cocobolo, etc). I know that it can be used as mulch, but I don't really have any plants that would need mulching. 
How can I safely dispose of the bag or two of sawdust that I generate when working on a project?

A:

One good use of sawdust is to make into a fire starting device.  Sawdust is quite flammable, and obviously has a lot of surface area.  
WARNING: Be safe. Certain glues (such as may be used in plywood), most finishes, and most pressure-treated woods may be dangerous to burn, due to the release of poisonous chemicals. Be sure that you are only burning wood that is definitely not toxic.
This article from Wood Magazine explains how to make them; basically, put them in a cup of some sort (such as a muffin tin) and add paraffin wax or some other flammable substance (I've seen homemade biodiesel used, for example).  Then let it dry into a cake.  It will then be a good fire starter for a campfire or your fireplace.

If you do composting in your garden, sawdust is good to add to your compost bin. You will need to balance it out with enough "green" items to compost it though, so it will not work for large quantities of sawdust.

A:

Well it is good for mulch and finding neighbors that could/would use it is one option.  
You could always join your local Freecycle and post it on there.  Someone will likely want to come pick it up.  
Some places might take it as they would regular yard waste, leaves grass clippings etc.
Of course this is for primarily clean (non-treated) sawdust.
