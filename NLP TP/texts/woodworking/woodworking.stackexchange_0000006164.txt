Vise Alignment/Mounting

I'm almost ready to mount a face vise on the workbench I built, and it didn't come with instructions, but I see it has holes to attach it into the bottom and/or the front of the workbench top.  The workbench top is approximately 3.5" thick, and the faces of the vise are not that tall.  

Should I attach it from below, screwing into the bottom of the workbench, allowing the threaded screw and rods to be visible if you look under the bench, and also screw the rear face into the front of the bench?  This would make the tops of the vise faces a couple inches below the top of the workbench.  Would I then add wooden jaw liners that are taller than the vise faces to end up with a clamping area that is flush with the bench top?
Or, should I attach it by drilling into the front face of the bench top to make holes for the screw and other two rods, and ignoring the bottom mounting holes, to get the vise faces flush with the top to begin with?  It seems like a drawback here would be that if I need to plane the bench top flat in the future, I would end up with a vise now mounted slightly above the top of the bench.

A:

It's perfectly ok to have the vise mounted lower than the benchtop for exactly the reason of flattening the benchtop later. Also, it is common to drill or cut dog holes into the benchtop in-line with a vise so you can use bench dogs (pegs) to increase your clamping capacity far beyond the typical 4-8" of an inexpensive vise. The vise pictured in your question does not have a dog built in, but you could add a jaw liner with removable dog(s) or buy a vise that does have a pop-up dog.
