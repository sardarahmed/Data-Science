Q:

Using Tung Oil and Polyurethane on Maple?

I am getting close to completing a desk I am building. This has been a very ambitious project for me as this is the first time I have ever built any furniture (shelving not counted) and this is a height-adjustable sit/stand desk.
I am at a point where I want to start finishing the wood (which is Maple). I have access to a ton of Tung oil my dad picked up for dirt cheap. I also have some polyurethane. I want to seal the wood from water and give it a nice finish. My thoughts were I would use a few layers of Tung oil and then a layer or two of polyurethane.
I was talking to my dad today and he suggested that I use one or the other, but not both because tung oil is actually a finishing product and will seal the wood for me.
Is this true? Or does my original plan make sense? I am also open to suggestions. I believe he said he even had a bunch of linseed oil I could use.

A:

As clarified in the Comments above, you appear to have "Tung Oil Finish" which is not tung oil but a commercial blended finish*. As your dad indicated it is intended to be a standalone finish and provides decent protection, certainly enough for what I'd expect a desk of this sort to need (not like a coffee table for example) in a hard wood like maple. 
But you can add further protection to the working surface by applying some polyurethane on top should you want to. The two finishes should be entirely compatible so there are no problems layering them this way.
Straight polyurethane will add a scratch-resistant surface coating that is significantly more water-resistant, especially to things like hot coffee.

*Which probably contains zero tung oil, how's that for misleading labelling?!
