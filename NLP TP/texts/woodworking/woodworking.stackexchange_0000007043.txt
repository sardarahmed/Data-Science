Q:

Can I stack wood finished with Danish Oil while it cures?

This is my first time using Danish Oil. 
I'm putting in a pine ceiling and wanted to finish it with this because I love the look and because, it being a ceiling, I don't have to worry about too much wear and tear.
Problem is: I have about 700 square feet to cover (that is a lot of boards). In order to apply and store them correctly, I need a huge space. 
Can I stack these on top of one another after I apply the oil?
I would:
A) Apply oil to several boards. 
B) Wait for it to penetrate.
C) Wipe off excess oil.
D) Stack and store so I can move on to the next set of boards. 
It's step D that I'm not sure about. Will it damage the finish if I do this?
Any other advice is welcome! Thank you all so much.

A:

No, stacking will lead to visible marks. Possible effects include dents (or indented stripes from board edges), extra-matte areas, patterns matching the overlying material. Even you don't notice the effect directly, you will see it in raking light (or worse, you will see when installed as a ceiling above the windows). Thinner coats will help but that leads to more coats. You can have the boards vertical for drying, which helps in the space issue for drying. Depending on the finish, polymerization takes time to become hard and evaporation of solvents also takes time (leading to a slight thinning of the thickness of the finish). Both are easy to impress or mark. If you like, do some small-scale tests. Even when your fingernail can't mark the surface, prolonged contact will mar the finish. Good luck.
