Q:

Why is a 1x2 nominal planed to 0.75x1.5?

I know that a 2x4 is actually 1.5x3.5 because the 2 and 4 refer to the rough-sawn dimensions. But when planing a rough 1x2 and other 1 inch nominal thickness lumber into S4S, why do they only take 1/8" off each surface in the 1-inch dimension? Even on that size board mills take 1/4" off each side in the larger dimension.

A:

This has been answered elsewhere on the Internet, though there seem to be a few different stories running around.
The one I currently believe is that nominal 1" is actually 1" unsurfaced -- but what you buy as construction lumber is typically s4s (surfaced 4 sides). That means some wood has been planed away. To make that predictable, the convention was established that 1/8" could be removed from each side of a 1" thickness. 
Yes, it's weird. But that"s how the industry has decided to label things. It's much like the fact that hard drives were often measured in metric base-10 gigabytes rather than the power of two that programmers normally would call a gigabyte -- annoying but there really isn't much we can do but be aware of it.
