Q:

Does a door make a reasonable workbench top?

I want to build a bigger workbench than the one I have now, and in my basement are several old doors (flat hollow-core doors, no panels or windows or anything) left by the previous owner. My idea was to take off the doorknobs and mount the door on a frame made of 2*4s; I'm figuring the door will be flat and stable. Any reason not to do this?

A:

Hollow-core doors would not make a very good workbench top.  The surface layer is very thin, either 1/8" material like a soft skin Masonite material.  Very easy to drive your fist through it.  Would not take hammer blows, pounding, etc.
I did purchase two hollow-core doors to lay on portable saw horses. I can lay plywood on the doors and use the gap between the two doors as the opening for the saw blade. This provide full support for the plywood sheet on both side of the cut. Doors are light, easy to set up and put away.
