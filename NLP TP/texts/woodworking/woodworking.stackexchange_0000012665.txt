Q:

How to cut bevel lengthwise along rafter

I'm planning a garden office where the roof is angled diagonally, so one corner will be lowest, the two adjacent corners will be mid-height, and the final corner will be the tallest.  The gradient of the roof will be in the range 1:10 to 1:12.
For this to work, the rafters will need to have a bevel along the top.  This is so that the rafters, which will be 2x6 timber, can sit vertically on the frame, but accommodate the roof boards which will be at an angle.  They'll already have the right angle end-to-end because they'll be sitting on frames.
How could I cut a bevel along the length of the rafters?
Options I've considered are:

A track saw
A hand plane
A band saw

I have a track saw and a hand plane, but I'm not sure if these are good options.  I have a router, but I can't figure out how I could use it to make a bevel.  I guess I could use a table saw, but I don't have one, and I'd prefer not to have to use one unless it is the only way.
I haven't managed to find any description where someone has already done this.

A:

A table saw would be the easiest way.
Since you don't have one, a track saw should manage fine. It's accurate and easy to setup (as opposed to a regular circular saw). My main concern would be if it can handle the cut in a single pass (both in terms of power and of avaialbe depth of cut). If it has enough depth of cut, doing in a shallow cut and then a deeper cut will work as long as you're careful not to move the track between cuts (clamp it if you can). If it doesn't, you'd need to make two opposing cuts that would be hard to align well.
A hand plane can work, but would be a lot of work, especially if you have many boards to bevel.
