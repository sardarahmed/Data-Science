Q:

Thin wood (~12mm) for drawer boxes

I'm replacing some drawers I've had for a while that were built with the Hafele metal side and slider system.

I will be making these new drawers with wood as I'm upgrading the slides to full extension ones, however I like the width of the drawers I currently have as afforded by the thin metal sides.
I know it will be technically possible to build drawer boxes with 12mm instead of 18mm ply/mdf but I'm wondering if they will be 'strong' enough for my purpose?
Does anyone have experience of doing this, or know of any resources like Youtube video that show this?

A:

Since your concerns seem to be centered around the thickness (or thinness) of the material, let me start with the fact that I've built "plenty" of drawers out of 12mm (1/2") material using several methods and they have all proven to be very strong. Much of my shop furniture and the cabinets in my wife's studio were built with 1/2" thick plywood drawers and 1/4" bottom panels. They have held up quite well over the years.
Preference for Plywood over MDF
Plywood is much stronger than MDF because it is made of actual wood layers, or "veneers"; the grain of each layer runs 90 degrees to the layers above and below it. MDF is made from fine wood pulp and glue like cake batter that gets pressed into a sheet. Because of this, plywood is more durable. Also because of this, plywood holds screws much better than MDF does.

"Quarter-Quarter-Quarter" technique for making drawers of 1/2" sheet stock
This technique is specifically designed to use 1/2" (12mm) plywood to make drawers. I've built a "gazillion" drawers using this technique. The name relates to a quarter inch being 1/2 of the half-inch material thickness. I suppose in your case you would be pursuing a 6-6-6(mm) technique....
Essentially you want to cut a dado/groove half the thickness of your material located half the thickness from the end of your drawer sides and take away half the thickness of your drawer ends to form interlocking grooves and tabs which, when glued together form strong drawer boxes.

The beauty of the "system" is that you can set up a table saw or router table once and do all the cuts without changing the setup.
This video demonstrates it like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3pMyNPfi0  Not only easy to do, but very durable. Here's the same, but with it explained for different stock thicknesses: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQXHzvJNsoA
