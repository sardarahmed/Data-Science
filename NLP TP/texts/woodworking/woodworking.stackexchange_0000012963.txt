Q:

Is there a drill holster that is not attached to a belt?

I am in the process of building a second floor to our container home which includes the mindless task of screwing thousands of screws into sheets of OSB.
So far I have only used drill holsters or pouches that attach to your belt or the ones that come with a belt like contraption.

I find them both very inconvenient in terms of carrying and picking up the screwdriver quickly and they keep pulling on my pants.
I would love to have something similar to a camera strap like these ones:
​​
That allow me to:

quickly switch between adjusting the OSB board and screwing in the screws
lift the screwdriver above my head without it being constrained by the contraption
doesn’t restrain my movement too much and doesn’t dangle around uncontrollably
cherry on top if it has something to attach one or more bags for the screws

Does anyone know if such a thing exists and what it's called?

A:

Makita drills (and I'm sure others do as well) come with an optional hanger so you can safely hang it upside-down when you are up on a ladder. It is intended to slip into a belt (not the fancy holster you show) but it'll go anywhere that hook can conveniently fit.
When I was in the trades those up on the ladders would rig up a receiver for that hook on the ladder itself. If you can find a way to hang such an awkward mass safely using a home-brew harness you can try that. I've never seen any after-market harness -- we'd just wear a minimal pouch-and-belt and hook the drill into that or hang it from the ladder. Some guys even had a lanyard attached to it so they didn't drop their precious tool (or brain their less-precious co-workers).
