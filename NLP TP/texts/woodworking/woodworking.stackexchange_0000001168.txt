Q:

Can I use a plungable router bit on a drill press?

I'm currently working on a cutting board.  With a core box bit, I made rounded grooves close to the edges of the board.  I would like to have bigger grooves on the corners.  I'm thinking of using a bigger core box bit on my drill press to make the four corners.  I'm trying to avoid my plunge router due to possible side movements while plunging.  I would hate to scrap my work at this point.  On my drill press I have no need of moving the board to make a groove, just a "plunge". 
In short, can I use my plungable router bit on my drill press for a simple "drill" application.

I've heard of people using a router bit in a drill press, but I've never heard a reputable source recommend doing it. Personally, I wouldn't try it myself. A drill press runs 10-100x slower than a router, so I wouldn't expect a smooth cut on the drill press.
A better solution to the problem would be to use the router but clamp it in place to prevent lateral motion.

A:

You are trying to make a hole with a hemispherical bottom.  I would remove most of the material with a regular drill, them switch to the box core bit.  First, of course, try it out on a piece of scrap wood of the same type as the cutting board.  
If you are just making a large diameter dimple, no need to pre-drill. 
Run the drill press at its maximum speed and lower the drill slowly to minimize tear out.
In either case make sure your board is clamped in position.
