Q:

How can I get this effect and what is it called?

In the photograph the machine has a silver edge on the outer panels, but I have seen it in all colours.
How can I achieve the same effect with my panels?

A:

A Google search for "metalic edge banding" comes up with several options.
There is the flat, glue on style that goes on like any other wood based edging:

There is also aluminum (or other metal) T-rail style that presses into a slot routed or cut into the edge of the piece:

Note: Not affiliated with either company, just the first couple of examples I found.

A cursory search comes up with T-Moulding. Knowing that I can then find pseudo chrome T-moulding for arcade cabinets. Not advocating any particular product but showcasing an example. The one pictured in your question is likely plastic to help it conform to the curves of the case however I could be wrong.

Should be easy enough to install by using a slot cutter and a router.

You can look at a blog post about a user doing just that.
