Q:

Discoloration under label on cherry

I have this piece of cherry (American) heartwood. It had a sticker on it. When I peeled it off there was a lighter area underneath. It is not residue from the sticker (I scrubbed it with xylene), the wood is discolored. I am not sure how deep it goes but I was unable to affect it with heavy sanding.

My question is: What caused that? Was it some chemical in the glue? The paper? Trapped moisture? No oxygen, or blocking sunlight? 
I'm not concerned about getting rid of it (that piece lives in the scrap bin now) but I'm curious about the chemistry behind that discoration.

A:

I would guess that the color difference is from the sticker blocking sunlight -- cherry can darken pretty quickly in the sun:
Cherry with one spot covered
Half of a sheet of plywood covered
Since you don't care what happens to this particular piece of cherry, I'd leave it out in the sun with a different spot masked and watch the effect.

Black cherry is well known to darken due to sunlight exposure.  In fact, this is made use of by furniture makers to darken the wood and artificially "age" it.
Consider the image below of a cherry door panel.

You can see the diagonal stripe where the door (for whatever reason) received less sunlight.  If this door is left in the sun for a few more days, fully exposed, the colors will even out.

I'm curious about the chemistry behind that discoration.

It's a simple reaction between the ultraviolet rays of the sun and the wood itself.  Most woods undergo a similar reaction (purpleheart turns from purple to brown, osage orange turns from bright yellow to dull orange/brown, yellow pine turns from yellow/tan to a rich brown, and many others).  If you're looking for a chemical equation, I'm afraid I can't help you there.
