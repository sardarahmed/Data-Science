Q:

What should I do about a router base plate opening that is too small?

My DeWalt DCW600B 20V MAX XR Brushless Cordless Compact Router came with a D-base base plate with an approximately 1.5 inch opening. This is slightly too small for my 1/2 inch roundover bit (see picture). What should I do?

grind out the opening larger? I am concerned this will cause plastic to stick out so the base is no longer smooth, thus making it hard to slide the router across the wood (and possibly scratching the wood)
buy another base with a larger opening? So far, the only bases with larger openings that I have found have 3 screw holes instead of 4, and my router does not have 3 holes that are spaced like this. Example

A:

This is a good opportunity to make yourself an additional base with a bigger opening. Drill and countersink the holes to match the router casting.
It’s pretty obvious from the pics, but the extra length lets you do hinge mortises without the router tipping in as you get to the sides.
The plexi/lexan is 1/2”, so doesn’t flex. The downside is that the added depth reduces reach, but in years of use that’s happened maybe a couple of times.

Edit to say that you can absolutely open up the existing hole on the existing base, per the excellent advice of @graphus. The downside is that if you ever want to use a router guide bushing, you'll have to purchase a new base.
