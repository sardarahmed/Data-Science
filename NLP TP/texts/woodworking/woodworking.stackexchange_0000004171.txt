Q:

How to treat floor-facing edge of OSB for a stool leg?

I'm making a bar stool from OSB. I do know it's a very questionable material choice, but it fits my aesthetics, and I'm willing to try my chances.
I'm going to varnish and sand all people-facing edges , as suggested on DIY SE.
I'm still concerned with the edge facing the floor:
 
How do I prevent chips from coming off the outer layers when the stool is shifted around?
What would be better(less labor and material cost, longer lasting) given the choices below?

Round the edge, so that no outer chips would be subject to
lateral forces from friction with the floor. If I go this route can I avoid renting a router and do it with a sander? What's the radius I should be aiming at?
Put on PVC edge banding.
Just have few extra layers of varnish.

The first thing that comes to mind is a nail-in furniture foot like this:

However, that doesn't really fit with the aesthetic of your stool, and probably isn't what you're after. I would imagine that the nail would be difficult to drive straight into your thin OSB, probably wouldn't hold forever, and the foot itself would be considerably larger than the leg. 
And, now that I've shot down my suggestion... I thought I'd just throw it out there.
The long game comes into play (thanks Matt!): 

Sand the floor contact surface nice and flat
Round the edge slightly (sand paper should be sufficient)
Make a felt "runner" for the bottom of each leg so that it slides along the floor
Attach it with glue and a few small ring-shank brads with the heads sunk below the level of the felt.

The ring-shank helps prevent it from popping
The counter sink prevents it from scratching the floor
