How to fix a gap in plywood screwed joint

I've knocked together some plywood to make a shoe rack and I've messed up the cuts.

There's a gap that I thought I could live with but I'd like to try and fix if possible.

Notice the slight bulge?
I thought I might get away with using clamps to pull it together but I'm worried I'll end up ripping the screws out when I release the clamps.
Short of replacing the top shelf or shortening the middle and bottom shelves, which I'd rather not do, is there something else I could try?

A:

This looks like a problem commonly encountered when the clearance hole in the first board (the one on the outside of the joint - in your case the vertical piece) is not wide enough. This hole should be at least as wide as the widest part of the screw threads. The true pilot hole in the second piece should be sized appropriately for the screw and type of wood. 
The screw basically should not be grabbing into the first piece - the head of the screw should simply apply force sideways (in this case). All the grabbing should be to pull your horizontal piece against the vertical piece. Does that make sense? 
You might be able to solve this problem by backing out the screws, clamping the pieces together tightly, and rescrewing. Otherwise, you'll have to widen the holes in the vertical piece somewhat. Be careful when you do this to keep the holes approximately centered.
