Q:

First two backsaws - what to choose/buy?

I'm a beginner, I've recently taken up woodworking as a hobby.
I have a hardpoint tenon saw that I'm just not getting on with.   It sticks a lot in the (primarily soft) wood I'm working with.   I have a multipurpose hardpoint panel saw that works well, but I won't be using that for joinery.
So my plan is to buy a couple of backsaws: one rip-cut tenon saw, and one dovetail saw (either cross-cut or, if the teeth are fine, rip-cut is likely OK).   Does this sound like a good plan?   I like the look of Pax saws but their dovetail saws are 20tpi.   I'm concerned that I wouldn't be able to hand-sharpen the teeth of a 20tpi saw.
Please criticise and improve my plan.

A:

For good general purpose use, as a beginner, get a carcass saw (~13 ppi, crosscut filed, with a little depth to it - 2 inches or better.)  It will serve you well for many purposes, and will be easier to start in the cut than a rip-filed saw.  When it fails you in some way, then you can start building your inevitable collection :)
