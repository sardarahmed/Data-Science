Q:

Is there anything wrong with using a 3 degree router bit to make a bevel?

There was a question asked on reddit recently from someone that was trying to create a bevel on a door for as little money as possible which was accompanied by a lot of hate/negative feedback.
After watching this carpenter use a 3 Deg. router bit to make a bevel here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUNRI-UpSvw
It seems this could be a perfectly acceptable way to make a quick bevel in a tight spot. After I did a bit more digging around I found a bit that looks exactly like the one the content creator used in the video above.
Carbide Tipped Patternmakers 3 Deg x 3/4 Dia x 2-1/8 x 1/2" Shank.

Essentially this bit can handle any door up to 2 and 1/8 inches.
I decided to do a bit more digging around and actually called the company that designed this router bit to ask what they thought about using this to create the 3 deg bevel for a door. They told me the only thing that would really be required would to place a piece of wood under the door. So that the wheel can spin on that instead of spinning on the actual side of the door to get the full 3 degrees required.
Can anyone think of a reason why this is not an acceptable method to create a 3 degree bevel for a door allowing it to swing freely into its frame?

I don't understand Reddit reaction. Cutting bevel on edge of board or panel is what such bits are for!
Maybe some objections are based on specific design of door where nails are known to be used, but for traditional door construction only one "gotcha" I can think is breakout at end of cut. This is easy to avoid by using climb cut for last 2" (5cm) or clamping on sacrificial piece to support edge of board.
