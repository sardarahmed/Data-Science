Q:

Need advice how to fill a screw hole in plywood

I am renovating my childhood wooden rocking horse. I took it all apart, sanding it off, will be priming and painting it later.
Even though it spent over 25 years in a damp cellar, it's in great shape.
However, I have a problem with the head. The head is screwed down to the seat. However, it seems that my dad did some sloppy repairs back in the day, using oversized screws, which made a huge gap, made the screw holes too loose, and destroyed the wood around it.
I am looking for reliable ways to fill this hole, bring the shape to what it originally was, and have it ready, so I can screw it together again (and it will hold) to the seat.
These screws take quite a load, because when a child is swinging he's holding on to the head of the horse.

A:

Alternatively, have you considered remaking / replacing the head?
After considering feedback and your desire to put the horse back into use it might not be possible to satisfactorily repair the original head and have it safely handle the loads of a playful child.
It appears the piece is a single piece of plywood; a piece of baltic birch of equal dimensions should be easy to cut to match.  The decorations look like they might be permanent marker, and the patina could be partly matched with some sanding with steel wool or a fairly fine sandpaper on a soft block.
While it wouldn't likely be a perfect match it would be stronger than the original piece and remove the concern of it detaching or being re-broken.
