Q:

Douglas fir stair treads spots not staining?

I made these stair treads out of reclaimed Douglas fir. The wood is gorgeous! Some of the stairs stained amazing and a couple have these much lighter spots where the wood didn't seem to take the stain?
Did I mess up with my process or is this just how Douglas fir works? How  is it suppose to look? First time working with reclaimed wood.
Process:

Sanded 80 grit- I read not to go higher than 80 to help the grain pop?
50/50 denatured alcohol/shellac 
Minwax gel stain coffee

I love the markings and chose the darker color with the intention of getting them to stand out. I edited my pics and circled the spots I’m talking about. It’s these spots that came out even lighter that I don’t know about.

A:

In my judgement, from seeing your pictures, I would not be concerned about the spots that you have highlighted as being lighter. Those spots appearing to be in areas where the wood has become smoother due to the sanding process. The overall look if you stand back and consider what character the used lumber offers I would just accept those minor  light spots as just another part of the character.
After all if you had wanted a more perfect and consistent finish you would have planed these boards down to a smooth finish that removed all the original circular saw marks and random scratches and gouges. And even then fir will still have variations in the way it takes stain!
