Q:

Good wood for beer pong table

I'm looking for the best wood recommendations to build a large quantity of beer pong tables in the cheapest way possible. 
For those who don't know, beer pong is a party game in which a ping pong ball is thrown from one side of the table to the other trying to place the ball in the opponent's beer cup so that the opponent has to drink the whole cup. 
The wood/plywood must be easy to cut, lightweight, cheap and easy to handle with. Any recommendations? I'm going to make 10 first and then more.

A:

15/32 (1/2") construction plywood is really cheap at North American big box retailers. The surface is rough and thus makes the game harder. If you're not into challenge, you can get smooth ply for about double.
2x4s can make the base -- a rectangle for the apron; legs screwed inside that rectangle, and then braced (angle, or another rectangle in the middle) for something sturdy-ish.
