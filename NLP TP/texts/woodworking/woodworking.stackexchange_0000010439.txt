Q:

Is a 20 ft by 12 ft workshop a good size for a woodworking shop?

I'm in the planning stage of building a shed. I would like to be able to use a table saw and various other tools (drill press, router table, compound miter saw, etc). Would a 20x12 shed be big enough? I would like room to grow a little but space is a limiting factor.

Yes! You can do woodworking in almost any sized space, but 20x12' is practically king-sized compared to what some of us have. There is no reason you can't have a shop in a corner of a garage that you share with a car, or a part of a basement.
My advice is to start slow. Don't buy equipment just to own it. Have your projects earn that equipment. Start with hand tools and some common useful power tools. Use those tools to build some tool storage and work areas. Learn how to design to maximize your workspace. Figure out how to put stuff on wheels.
There are scads of "small hobby wood shop" sites on the internet and YouTube. See what others are doing. There are all kinds of free plans out there that you can use to turn almost any small space into a functional shop. There has never been a better time to dive as deep as you want into woodworking! Don't let some notion of square footage and the dream of what tools you want tomorrow interfere with the chips you can make today.
