Q:

Chopstick repair?

I have a nice pair of custom red wooden (cedar maybe?) chopsticks I took home as a gift from an event last year and about one inch completely broke off of one.
I have both pieces, as it was a clean break. What is the best way to repair it so that I can continue to use it and still maintain some sort of strength/integrity?

A:

If can you properly orient the broken ends together, use a two-part epoxy adhesive. 
This one will cure a room temperature without needing any extraordinary clamping.
Food-safe, two-part epoxy
