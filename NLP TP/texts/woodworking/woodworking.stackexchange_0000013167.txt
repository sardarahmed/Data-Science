Q:

What's the name of this type of wood panel?

Question. This is made by, I think, gluing many moderately sized pieces of hardwood.  What is it called?

Appandix.  Reason I'm interested about this is to consider using it for doors instead of simply table tops.  I see them as cheaper alternatives to single-piece timber, while still being maintainable (e.g. can sand and repair) and strong.
I think if the pattern is horizontal, such doors will blend nicely with stone walls like the one below.

A:

The commonly used name for it is "butcher block", however it really isn't. True butcher block is glued up the same way, but you see the end grain on the horizontal surface instead of the long grain.
It's a "glue up", but if you're searching for it by that name, you probably won't find it, it'll probably be listed as "butcher block".
To be honest, I haven't gone shopping for doors lately, but I've never seen a glued-up door like this. I don't know if that's due to strength or the fact that you may be one of 7 people[1] to whom this would appeal as a door, but they don't seem to make them. I don't know of any reason you couldn't or shouldn't make a door this way, but they're not common.
It might be less expensive if you were to make it yourself, since you could use smaller pieces of lumber to start with, however, for commercially manufactured doors, this would actually probably cost more because there's significantly more labor involved in cutting, surfacing and gluing all those little pieces than there is in traditional door manufacturing. If you're DIYing it, you bear those costs as well, but we tend to give a zero-cost factor to time when making things ourselves.
