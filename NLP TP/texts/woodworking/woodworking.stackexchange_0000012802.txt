Q:

Can a 23g nail gun satisfy all of my needs?

I'm looking into buying a nail gun to help when assembling my projects - holding them in place while glue dries or I have the chance to secure with screws; the only issue is that I have no experience with nail guns so I'm not exactly sure which avenue to go down.
I understand that all things 16 gauge is a no-go when it comes to finer woodworking, so it comes down to 18 or 23 gauge. Naturally I would like as few holes to fill as possible however I am unsure of the viability of using a 23 gauge nailer for all of my needs.
For context, I am a hobbyist with no workshop - I set up an occasional table in the garden that I try to put as few holes in as possible. The things I build are never too extravagant and I never usually go above 18mm plywood/MDF.
Any help/guidance would be much appreciated.

You are bound to be disappointed by the limitations of a 23g pinner. (Headless or not.) Pins just don't have the holding power. Plus, you're paying a premium to get one that'll handle long (>1-3/8) pins. And they break faster than an 18g gun.
18g, on the other hand, is a workhorse. Baseboard? Yup. Casing? Yup. Holding things in place while the glue sets? Mostly. Holding the tiny return piece on the end of the stool while the glue sets? Nope. (That's where the pinner comes in.)
Everybody is different, and your needs can vary. You'll probably end up with both guns eventually anyway.
In my world, my 18g guns come out at least 20 times more often than my 23g.
PS, @graphus is right that you don't need a nail gun.
