Q:

What is the name of this way of Joining?

I am working on a piece where it would be really interesting if I could regulate the distance between two pieces (in order to achieve a better securing of the piece).
By scouring the internet I found a great solution but I am just not sure how to implement it and it is giving me a headache trying to figure it out.
Basically, you have a threaded rod that spans two pieces and by tightening the nut you would bring the piece above closer or farther away. Something like this:

or

Is there a name for this so I can look more into it? Is it a simple threaded rod which is fixed on one side?
Thanks for any help

A:

It appears that one of the possible terms is turnbuckle jack screw. The link connects to a site that sells both metric and SAE versions (link is metric). The kit linked includes the required left hand threaded nut and the right hand threaded nut and the screw itself, of course:

The nuts described by David D in his answer do not appear to be available in left hand thread versions. The Google provides plenty of links for T-nuts (RH), nut inserts for wood (RH) but no LH versions of either. As the kit provides one left-hand nut, one could consider to have a fastening plate brazed or welded to the nut, or to cut a recess into the surface, or devise another method of securing the nut provided.
