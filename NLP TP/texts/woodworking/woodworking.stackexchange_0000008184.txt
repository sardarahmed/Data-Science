Q:

Make room for wires in wooden block

I have a wooden frame like this with some LEDs powered by a battery.

I'm looking for a way to create a hole (4mm*4mm*80mm) to hide the wires from battery to LED on the back.
Anything, including the name of the tool to do that would be appreciated.
PS. Yes, I'm a rookie

A:

It sounds like you want a groove into which you place the wires. These are probably the most common ways to do it:

Glue it up - instead of removing material (usually harder for novice), just build the frame piece out of 3 pieces, with two smaller pieces separated and creating a channel on the back side. 
Table saw - this is a ripping operation. You can use either a dado set or multiple passes with a regular blade. This is technically possible with a handheld circular saw, but to do it you'll need to mill out the groove before you cut the frame member off a wider piece of lumber.
Router or router table. Similar to table saw operation. 
Using hand tools - plow plane. Easier to do if you create the groove before sawing off the frame member from the wider piece of lumber. You can do it with a router plane, but it will be a long arduous process.
