Q:

Router planing jig problem - tracks

I put together a simple router planing jig - everything seems level, but as I pass the router over this test board, it leaves a track (as pictured).

You can barely feel it, and hitting the board with an orbital sander real quick seems to touch it up, but I'm concerned that the board will be no good for an end grain block that it is destined for.. though it looks like it might be flush enough. 
The bit I'm using is a 2 inch wide bowl bit (flat on the bottom) though I've tried a larger bottom clearing bit and it had the same issue. 
So, question - is this to be expected using a router as a planer? If not, is there something in particular that is causing this? 

A:

I get the same tracks, and they come out pretty easily with the orbital as you mentioned. This happens as small variations in downward pressure will occur when making passes with the router sled.
One option is to "fix" your router in the sled then simply move the sled itself instead of moving the router up and down a channel that runs the length of the sled. Of course, you'll need a wider sled to plane wider boards, but it will do a better job of alleviating these tracks.
Here's an example of what I'm talking about: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbBrbUK2cek
