Handrail Installation (Interior Stairs) using Kregg Jig & Screws

Good afternoon.  I'm installing some new newel posts and a new handrail for our interior stairs.  For attaching the handrail to the newel post, it appears the typical installation calls for rail and post fastener.  However, instead of the rail and post fastener, I'm considering using Kregg Pocket Hole Jig with 3-inch screws.  I'm installing a square handrail and will be painting it.  I'm thinking 2 screws (top and bottom) of the handrail to attach to the newel post would be adequate.  I don't see any posts of anyone doing this so I'm a bit hesitant, but I don't know why it wouldn't work nicely.  Can you think of any concerns with this approach?

A:

Well, codes in North America typically call for railings to withstand 200 pounds in any direction. Personally, I doubt that a couple of pocket screws are up to that. I'm very open to differing opinions, though.
Perhaps you could install a couple of sturdy dowels and rely on the pocket screws to pull the railing to the post, rather than (potentially) bear the force alone.
