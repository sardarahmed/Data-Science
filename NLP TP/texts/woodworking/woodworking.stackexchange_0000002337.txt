Q:

Best knockdown joint for loft bed?

What is considered the strongest knockdown joint when putting together a loft bed? I'd like to build a very sturdy and kid resistant loft bed for my son. If anyone knows of a really nice plan I can adapt please let me know that as well.

A:

I'm not sure if this would apply to your design but I have found these types of fasteners very useful when making a take-down bed frame. They hold very well and provide an easy method for take-down.
