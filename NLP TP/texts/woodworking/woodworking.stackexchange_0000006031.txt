Q:

Didn't let wood dry between coats of stain & poly. How to correct?

I attempted my first ever woodworking project this weekend and thought it was going smoothly until I realized I was supposed to let the minwax oil based stain dry for 4-6 hours between coats. 
I had read the first steps in the directions that said to apply, wait 15 mins, wipe off excess and then immediately repeated with coat #2 and shortly after with the minwax polyurethane as well. 
Now it's sat over night and an oily residue that can be wiped off easily has come to the surface in several spots. This is what made me re-read the directions and realize my HUGE mistake :(
Do I just let it continue to sit? Should I wipe it off? How do I correct this?! It's a huge farmhouse table built out of common board, whitewood & douglas fir. 
Thank you!!! 

A:

your best bet for most even tone is to wipe off as much as possible using paint thinner/mineral spirits. Evaluate what things look like once the solvent you used has dried. If the color looks even/good, wait for the actual stain oils to dry, then apply the top coat of poly. 
If it doesn't look good, wait for what's on there to get good and dry, then sand it back to clear wood again and start over. 
edit: if there is a lot of semi-dry poly residue, scraping off the poly is more efficient than waiting for all of it to dry then sanding. However, scraping softwoods doesn't tend to work well, so once you're through the poly layer I'd finish sand as you did before. 
As a note, stain isn't mandatory (neither is finish for that matter, although it's generally greatly recommended). I mention it because a lot of beginners assume all wood has to be stained.. the staining is for color only, and is absolutely optional and your preference.
