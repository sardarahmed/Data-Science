Q:

Supporting a workpiece during staining / finishing without damaging finish

If I am staining or applying any type of finish to a piece, and have to turn it upside down at some point or set it on something to dry, what can I set it on that won't mark the finish?
A limited selection of failed strategies so far:

Setting on pointy edge of aluminum angles - marks finish; or pulls a line off if finish is still tacky
Setting on pointy edge of wood triangles - same as above.
Setting on wood spacers - spacers soak stain out of piece, worse depending on what type of wood the spacers are
Cloth barrier - cloth soaks stain and finish out of piece, sticks to piece
Wax paper barrier - somewhat ok, often still pulls bits off of tacky finish or stain or leaves scuffs on finish

Everything I've tried so far either rubs or soaks up the stain and/or finish on the piece.
Even when e.g. stain doesn't seem tacky, if I leave the piece on wooden spacers overnight when I come back in the morning their are inevitably lighter spots where the spacers were and stain on the spacers.
Short of an antigravity chamber or strong enough magnetic field for levitation of wood, how can I support a work-in-progress without damaging it?

A:

Finish one side, let it dry, finish the other.
Or hang it from a string (as some folks do when spray-finishing cabinet doors).
Many people do use nail points or other nonabsorbant supports. Many plastic objects are marketed for the purpose... The point (sorry) of all of these is that if there's any marring, it's a tiny dot which becomes completely invisible if you're laying down multiple coats.
I'm sure there are other solutions.
