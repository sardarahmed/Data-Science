Q:

Problem in the shank diameter of trim router bits

My router supports 6mm shank bits. However the bits that I have are 6.35mm shank diameter.
Can I safely and reliably change the collet of the router to accept a 6.35mm tool without compromising safety?

A:

6.35mm is exactly 1/4".
While the two are very close in size (I mean 0.35mm - how bad could it be?) when you have a chunk of metal spinning at ~20000RPM, it can get very bad very quickly. Your question about safety is very valid.
Can you change to a 1/4" collet?

Yes, if your router supports changing to a 1/4" collet.
Otherwise, NO.

If your router does not support installation of a 1/4" collet, then do not attempt to do so. It will be far cheaper to sell/give away/trash the unusable 1/4" bits than it would be to repair the damage to flesh caused by the bit coming loose and careening around the room.
