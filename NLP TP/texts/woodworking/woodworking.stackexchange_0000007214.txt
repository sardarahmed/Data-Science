Q:

How do you tell whether a piece of furniture is veneered?

What are good telltale signs of solid wood vs veneered furniture that you can identify from a picture?
For example, the hutch below?

A:

This looks like plywood to me.  It's pretty hard to tell without a better photo, but here's what I'm seeing...

The panel on the left of the photo appears to be three bookmatched sections, but I can't quite tell if they're close enough to be veneers.
The front edge of that panel appears to be edge banding, but without a higher resolution image or a shot from underneath the curve (where end-grain would be exposed) it's hard to tell.
The bullnose profile on the writing surface is applied as a separate piece from the panel.  If this were solid wood you'd just roundover the panel.
The pulls look like they are separate pieces instead of being carved directly into the panels.
