Q:

When and who was the first mathematicians to prove rigorously that $\sqrt[3]{2}$ was impossible number?

The purpose of the question is to understand why the number $\sqrt[3]{2}$, that was proven rigorously by ancient Greek is an impossible number (even at infinity), by their three famous impossibility problems,
this one was simply the impossibility of doubling the cube,
But, much later and oddly after many centuries, particularly (in the middle ages), mathematicians fond $\sqrt[3]{2}$ also at infinity, and they widely accepted it as a real number, which would imply the invalidity of the most famous Ancient Greek rigorous proof!
Of course it so clear to even a school student that $$a^3 = 2b^3$$
in positive constructible numbers is impossible equation, thus $\sqrt[3]{2}$ is also impossible number as a result, this was the basis of Greek famous rigorous proof
I had chosen this number $\sqrt[3]{2}$ in particular since it was the oldest famous number that encountered the Greek with a tremendous challenge that is still valid!

A:

Gauss considered the algebraic background behind straightedge and compass constructions, and from his work it is clear that e.g. $\sqrt[3]{2}$ is impossible to construct, as it can't be expressed via a finite number of sums, products, and square roots starting with $1$.
That it can't be constructed with some random selection of tools doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
