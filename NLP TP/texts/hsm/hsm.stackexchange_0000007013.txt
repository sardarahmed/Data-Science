Q:

Invention of matrix symbols

Who first did use the symbol $\begin{bmatrix}   1 &   2 \\   3 &   4 \end{bmatrix}$ for a matrix and similarly $\begin{pmatrix}   1 &   2 \\   3 &   4 \end{pmatrix}$?
Why do these two conventions exist independently  to the present day?    
Were whenever efforts made to unify the symbols?

A:

See Earliest Uses of Symbols for Matrices and Vectors.
The first similar symbol seems to be the "mixed" one used by Cayley into his “A Memoir on the Theory of Matrices” (1858).
A following reference is M.Bocher, Introduction to Higher Algebra (1907), page 20-21.
The "squared parenthesis" notation is due to Cullis, Matrices and Determinoids, 1st ed. 1913.
