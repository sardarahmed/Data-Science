Q:

Is there a biography of Ramanujan for mathematicians?

Like many mathematicians, I have long been fascinated by Ramanujan's work and also by what little I know of his life. I would like to learn more, but have found the standard book on this subject (Kanigel's The Man Who Knew Infinity), while well-written, to be lacking in mathematical depth.
Is there an account of Ramanujan's life that places it in the context of his mathematical work, and actually discusses his results (and where they came from) rather than describing them poetically as "formulas of a genius never seen before" or similar phrases that serve to mystify, rather than illuminate, what is actually going on?

A:

You could find the original manuscript by Ramanujan in the following work.

Srinivasa Ramanujan: Notebooks of Srinivasa Ramanujan. Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bombay, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg, 1984.

This work contains 390 pages of scanned version of Ramanujan's lost notebook.
The two famous book series which contains proofs and added details of Ramanujan's work are:

Bruce C. Berndt: Ramanujan's Notebooks. Springer, 1985–2005. (five parts)
George E. Andrews, Bruce C. Berndt: Ramanujan's Lost Notebook. Springer, 2005–2013. (four parts)

At last:

M. R. Murty, V. K. Murty: The Mathematical Legacy of Srinivasa Ramanujan. Springer India, 2013.
An online collection of Ramanujan's problems and papers is here.

A:

The English mathematician Hardy, who was close to Ramanujan, authored "Ramanujan: Twelve Lectures on Subjects Suggested by His Life and Work".
