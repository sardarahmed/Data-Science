Q:

What letters are used in this paper by Halin (1976)?

I was trying to read an older paper about treewidth by Halin (1976). He used different hand-written labels, obviously SÃ¼tterlin:

I assume the hand-written letters to be (from top to bottom and from left to right) "F*(n)", "C*(n)", "D*(n)". No I am poring over the next letter. Is it an "Y*(n)"? Or a "H*(n)"? Or even a strangely-written "E*(n)"?

A:

It's clear to me that the letters with * are capital Fraktur forms of F, C, D, and H, respectively, corresponding to the lower case "S-functions" f, c, d, and h, respectively.
I like this cheat sheet, which gives the handwritten forms of the letter shapes.
