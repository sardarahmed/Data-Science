Q:

What is the historical reasoning for electron orbital names?

Electron orbitals are referred to as s, p, d and f. I have read that there was a Latinate basis for this, but never found anything more specific. (Obviously, the discovery of electron orbitals by Bohr et. al. post-dated the fall of the Roman Empire by nearly 1500 years, so I realize that any such naming convention, if ancient Greek or Latin, would have been inspirational rather than originally sourced.)

A:

The basis is actually German, not Latinate. They stand for:
scharf (sharp),
prinzipal (principal),
diffus (diffuse), and
fundamental (fundamental).
You might be interested in this, The Origin of the s, p, d, f Orbital Labels, which is a short essay by the historian of chemistry William Jensen.
