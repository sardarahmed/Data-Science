Q:

Why was the cubic specifically so hard to solve?

I'm a huge fan of the history of Algebra and, recently, I've noticed a bit of an oddity. Degree one equations have been known (and solved) for as long as human history. For degree two equations, we have also known the general solution since many, many years BC, since pretty much the moment people have begun to actually study and develop mathematics.
However, when it comes to the cubic, it took literal millennia for a solution to be found, only happening around 1500 AD in Italy. One would perhaps assume that the quartic would, therefore, take some considerable time to solve (maybe not millennia, since math's growth has been more or less exponential, but many years nonetheless). Not only was this not the case, the quartic was solved in the exact same timeframe as the cubic, with a couple years removed.
So my question is: why did it take so long to solve the cubic when it took so little to solve the quartic?
The solution of the cubic stuck around as an open problem for far longer than the other degree polynomial equations, and I just can't see a reason for this... Maybe the real question is "why was the quartic so easy to solve", which I am also curious about.
Does anyone have any insights as for why this is, or any sources for further reading? I've read a few Math History books, but none of them could clarify my question.
Thanks in advance!

There is nothing special about cubic. I think the right question is: why the quadratic equations are much easier to solve than cubic and quartic? Well it's pretty obvious, is not it? Quadratic is indeed very easy to solve. There is a natural way to explain intuition behind the solution and there is nice geometrical interpretation. Cubic and quartic are just on the next level of difficulty.
If you want a more deep answer, then I can argue that one needs symbolic algebra to solve cubic and  quartic, but to solve quadratic equation one doesn't actually need algebra (although today in schools we teach quadratic using algebra, Babylonians did not know algebra, but can solve problems that involves quadratic equations). It's not coincidence that symbolic algebra was developed in XVI century by the same people that contributed to solving cubic and quartic equations.

The primary reason is that you have a roadblock: you absolutely need complex numbers - even for real-valued solutions - unless you go the route of using trigonometry and/or hyperbolic functions. The simplest example of the roadblock is directly connected to the ancient problem of trisecting the 60 degree angle. Write down the cubic for the cosine of 20 degrees (obtained via the triple angle formula, using the cosine of 60 degrees):
$$4c^3 - 3c = \frac{1}{2}.$$
Now, use the "Cardano" formula, and you'll quickly see the problem. In fact, there's no way to express the real root to this in terms of the four arithmetic operations and square and cube roots, without using complex numbers.
The other roadblock was negative numbers! Del Ferro solved all equations of the form $x^3 + mx = n$ before 1500 ... but only with non-negative coefficients $(m,n)$. Why? Because there wasn't any notion of negative numbers around yet!
Both complex and negative numbers came onto the scene together, not separately; because once you start talking about numbers like $-1$, you're also going to be asking questions like what $\sqrt{-1}$ is.
In the early 1500's, Tartaglia said "I have a secret"; Cardano said "Cough it up" and Tartaglia bound him to a (word-of-mouth) non-disclosure, but Cardano said: "Publish it soon or I'll end-run you" (by propping up and upgrading del Ferro's solution). Cardano's publication allowed for both negative numbers and their square roots, but left the square roots of negative numbers uninterpreted.
All of that is the account given over on the Wikipedia article Cubic Equation.
A real root to $x^3 + 3Ax + 2B = 0$ is $x = C - A/C$, where $C^3 = -B + \sqrt{A^3 + B^2}$. So, with the cosine of 20 degrees, $A = -1/4$ and $B = -1/16$, and the cosine of 20 degrees is $C + 1/(4C)$, where $C^3 = 1/16 + \sqrt{-3/256}$ ... oops. There's your problem. What's the cube root of a complex number, expressed in the form $x + i y$? How do you get the $(x,y)$ parts for $C$? Well, that involves solving a cubic equation. Guess which one?
It's the Casus Irreducibilis Impasse. According to the linked Wikipedia article, the proof that it actually is an impasse was established in 1843. So, in 300+ years' retrospect: that's your roadblock. You're forced either into complex numbers (never mind negative numbers) or - in this example - into trigonometry.
I had a similar problem, when in high school. I asked my 11th grade algebra teacher what the solution to the cubic $x^3 + x + 1 = 0$ was, and he said "You need to learn calculus for that". So, the following week, I went back to him and said, "Ok. I bought a \$5 calculus book from the bookstore, carefully read through all of the sections, did all the exercises, and learned the material, but I still can't solve the equation" (in closed form). Curiously, I never got any answer from him on that, since he was too busy fainting at the time, for some strange reason. About seven months later, the following year, I asked my third semester calculus assistant professor in college, and he finally coughed it up. So ... all that running around just to find out what the closed form solution to $x^3 + x + 1 = 0$ was. And it's not even one of those Impasse cases.
