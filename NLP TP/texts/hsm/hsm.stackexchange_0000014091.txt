Q:

Looking for reference for quote

In graduate school, I remember hearing or seeing the rough quote:

Good mathematicians know one branch of math. Great mathematicians
know two branches.

I'm sure I am somewhat misquoting it, but does anyone have a reference/citation for this quote?

A:

The correct quote is attributed to Banach: â€œGood mathematicians see analogies. Great mathematicians see analogies between analogies."
Ulam, S. M. (1976). Adventures of a mathematician. New York
Note: I used Google Books to find this quote with "Good mathematicians" and "Great mathematicians" as search terms.
