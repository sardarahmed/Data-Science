Q:

History of measure theory

Is there a book anybody here can recommend on the history of measure theory? Or, maybe a book that contains the history of measure theory?
Most books that are supposed to cover this material, i.e. books on the integration theory that lead to the measure theory, explain the integration quite well, but barely mention the measure theory.
The reason I want to learn the history of measure theory is to better understand the theory itself. So, I want a book that goes beyond just the history of measure theory, and also delves into the mathematics of the theory. The things I am most interested in are the definitions, like $\sigma$-algebra, and measurability, and the rationale and the evolution of these concepts.

A:

Yes, there is such a book. 
MR0264015 Pesin, Ivan N. Classical and modern integration theories. Translated from the Russian and edited by Samuel Kotz. Probability and Mathematical Statistics, No. 8 Academic Press, New York-London 1970 xviii+195 pp.
The original Russian title, literally translated is: "Develpment of the notion of Integral". I read the book, and can recommend it.

A:

The book Lebesgue's theory of integration: Its origins and development by T. Hawkins.
