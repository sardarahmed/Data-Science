Q:

Who were the attendees to the SGA3 seminar?

Here is a photograph of the audience of SGA3 (as noted by Mateo Carmona).

Other photographs may be viewed from the homepage: https://agrothendieck.github.io/
Grothendieck is facing the audience. I recognise Dieudonne at the left in the front row, Mandelbrot (?) in the second row, Chevalley to the right of Mandelbrot, but no one else. (Corrections after comments.)
Does anyone recognise the others?

A:

Only one left (of those visible) to be identified. The man in the middle of C. Chevalley and P. Samuel.
The seminar is not very likely to be SGA 5 but SGA 3 ("Schémas en groupes") by M. Demazure and A. Grothendieck (some day between 1962 and 1964).
