Q:

First appearance of tensor product symbol $\otimes$

I was asked recently if the tensor product symbol $\otimes$ had been used before Bourbaki's publication on multilinear algebra in 1948 (a draft of this document can be seen at http://sites.mathdoc.fr/archives-bourbaki/PDF/040_iecnr_049.pdf starting on p. 10). I was unable to find any earlier usage, so that leads to my question:

Who introduced the symbol $\otimes$ for use in tensor products?

A:

Keith:
The earliest usage we have been able to find is in a 1936 paper by Francis J Murray and John von Neumann, entitled "Rings of Operators"(Annals of Mathematics, Vol. 37, pp. 116-229). Paul Halmos later used it in the earliest published version of his "Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces," published by Princeton University Press in 1942 (see Appendix II-Direct Products).
