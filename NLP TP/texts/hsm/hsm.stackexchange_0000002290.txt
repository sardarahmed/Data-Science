Q:

Why was the reduced Planck constant introduced and when?

When was the reduced planck constant $\hbar= h/2\pi$ first introduced and what was the reason behind introducing such a constant? 
I know that $E=\hbar \omega$ and $p=\hbar k$ and writing again and again the $2\pi$ in $E=(h/2\pi)\omega$ $p=(h/2\pi) k$ etc. must really annoy the physicist of the time. However there are alternatives to these quantities namely $E=h \nu$ and $p=h/\lambda$. What was the reason preferring $\omega$ and $k$ over $\nu$ and $\lambda$ at the cost of introducing a new constant 

A:

As none of the answer on physics give the historical significance of the introduction, I'll give it a try.
Bohr first introduced $\hbar$ as the quantum of angular momentum (when $h$ is the quantum of action). Bohr believed it to be the angular momentum of each electron in an atom. Despite this being false, both Heisengberg and Schr√∂dinger parallel work on quantization rules for electron (circa 1925) kept the reduced Plank constant as the fundamental quantum of angular momentum. For this reason, Heisenberg was familiar with $\hbar$, and he stated his 1927 uncertainty principle in terms of $\hbar$ rather than $h$, ensuring a bright future to the constant, that is sometime named Dirac constant because Dirac was the first one to use the notation (Bohr referred to it as $M_0$).
Note that some physicist believe it to be the angular derivative of the (not reduced) Planck constant.
