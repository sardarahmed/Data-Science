Q:

Which mathematicians died very young or in a tragic way?

When I first thought of this question, I wanted to ask: If you could give one mathematician his remaining life until an average age for the time he lived in, who would you choose? However, this question is a bit too subjective for SE. So I decided to modify it to: Which mathematicians died very young or in a tragic way?
Two obvious candidates are Galois and Abel. I included more detail about them in an answer. But I'd like to know whether there are more examples. 

A:

Maryam Mirzakhani, the first Iranian and first woman to win the Fields medal, died of breast cancer in July 2017. She was only 40 years of age.

A:

Ã‰variste Galois (1811 - 1832), aged 20, was killed in a duel. He is known for Galois theory and he wrote his most notable results down in the night before the duel. You can also find more information about him and why he was killed in this question.
Niels Henrik Abel (1802 - 1829), aged 26, died of tuberculosis. He is mainly known for proving the Abel-Ruffini theorem, that had been open for hunderds of years, but also for several other results. However, he was barely recognized during his lifetime and because of that he was very poor. He died two days before he got a letter that he was appointed as a professor at the Berlin university. 

A:

Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887 - 1920) died at the age of $32$, according to Wikipedia the cause was:

A 1994 analysis of Ramanujan's medical records and symptoms by Dr. D.A.B. Young concluded that it was much more likely he had hepatic amoebiasis, a parasitic infection of the liver widespread in Madras, where Ramanujan had spent time. He had two episodes of dysentery before he left India. When not properly treated, dysentery can lie dormant for years and lead to hepatic amoebiasis, a difficult disease to diagnose, but once diagnosed readily cured.
