Q:

How the Cross-Ratio appears in the Work of Pappus?

The cross-ratio of four collinear points $A,B,C,D$ in the Euclidean Plane is defined by 
$$(A,B,C,D) = \frac{AC}{AD}\frac{BD}{BC}$$
And the wikipedia article states it already appeared in the works of Pappus of Alexandria. Since I can't find any geometrical interpretation for this ratio I am really curious to know how Pappus constructed it, and what his intuition was for it; as I understand, in his epoch constructions of that kind were only made using straightedge-and-compass.

A:

It appears in the demonstration of Pappus's hexagon theorem as a tool in the demonstration.

given one set of collinear points A, B, C, and another set of collinear points a, b, c, then the intersection points X, Y, Z of line pairs Ab and aB, Ac and aC, Bc and bC are collinear, lying on the Pappus line

(illustrations from the wikipedia article)
(Note: Pappus' proof is invalid in the case C,c and X are colinear, but the theorem is true nonetheless. )
