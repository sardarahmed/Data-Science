Q:

Who was the Northern California pioneer of genetics?

I was telling a friend about a pioneer researcher in genetics who did his work in Northern California around the late 1800s. I was thinking this was in Marin, Sonoma, or Napa County.
When I tried to remember the name I drew a blank. My first thought was, "Gregor Mendel?", but of course that's not right.
I may be confused and it was Mendel I was thinking of, and I just mixed up California with eastern Europe. But is there someone who fits the description I mentioned above?

A:

This was almost certainly Luther Burbank. He was a horticulturist who started in Lunenburg, Mass and moved to Santa Rosa, CA in 1875. 
Burbank developed hundreds of fruit, vegetable, and flower cultivars . His most famous contribution is the "Russet Burbank" potato, which is the most commonly grown potato variety in the US today.
Although his methods weren't particularly "scientific" (poor record-keeping) and he didn't practice "genetics" per se (the term hadn't been invented yet), his experiments were inspired by Darwin.
