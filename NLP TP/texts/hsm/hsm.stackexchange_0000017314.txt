Q:

Is there a resource about integer constructions and motivations?

I have an assignment about the foundations of mathematics.
I am trying to compile a list where I get common construction of integers and a small writing about the constructor and their explanation.
For example, I have the ordered pair construction by Dedekind, and his explanation via his principle of “generality”, where he writes that definitions appearing in a restricted form can be extended to avoid arbitrariness.
What about the original constructors of other constructions, where can I read about their commentaries?

A:

Yes, there is a good resource: it is the book called Numbers,
by 8 authors (Springer, 1991). The first chapter of this book written by K. Mainzer is dedicated to the history of constructions of integers and rational numbers.
