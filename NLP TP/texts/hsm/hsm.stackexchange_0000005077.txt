Q:

when did polynomial coefficient matching start for solving equations?

Coefficient matching feels rather natural when solving equations and checking dimensions, however in footnote 2 to "Two alternative derivations of Bridgman's theorem" (Berberan-Santos M N, Pogliani L, J. Math Chem 1999, 26, 255-261; p256) it's mentioned that Descartes shifted from line/area/volume ideas to the basic number line view.
Is this where the idea of coefficient matching between the terms when solving polynomials began, or was it already well established for pure number polynomials?

A:

 Thomas Harriot, 1560-1621 matched coefficients when generating formulas for sums of powers of positve integers.
"Gathering like terms", is, of course, an obvious technique, and was also used in the geometric derivations of these formulas. The link provided goes to the middle of a long article on the history of these formulas; Harriot appears to be the first to use symbolic notation, which allowed him to focus on the coefficients. Descarte, Fermat, and Bernoulli are all later.
