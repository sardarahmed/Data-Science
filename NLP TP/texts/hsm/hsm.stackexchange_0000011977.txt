Q:

Did Kolmogorov complexity influence the development of communication complexity?

I was reading a wikipedia article about communication complexity and it seems to me that it bears some resemblance to Kolmogorov complexity.
Was the founder of communication complexity influenced by Kolmogorov complexity?

A:

As pointed out by Conifold in the comments, the answer of the history seems likely that Yao was surely aware of Kolmogorov complexity at the time, but that the introduction of communication complexity was more motivated by communication between agents or processors than any connection with Kolmogorov complexity.
That said, there are some relations between the two concepts, for example:

Vereshchagin Randomized Communication Complexity of Approximating Kolmogorov Complexity (preprint of full version available here)
Kaplan & Laplante, Kolmogorov complexity and combinatorial methods in communication complexity
Mora, Briegel, & Kraus, Quantum Kolmogorov complexity and its applications
