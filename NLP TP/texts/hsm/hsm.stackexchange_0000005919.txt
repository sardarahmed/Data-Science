Q:

Is there evidence for mathematics in Sub-Saharan Africa before modern times?

I am preparing a series of lectures on the history of mathematics. Of course my lessons contain already sections about Egyptian and Arabian mathematics. But I don't know about mathematics in Sub-Saharan Africa except the famous Ishango bone. Are there topics or hints to literature available? Modern achievements would also be welcome.

A:

I've seen mentioned before, and played only a couple of times, a game in the Gebet'a or "Mancala" family of games.  This family of games dates back at least until 700 BC.  You could go through a brief history of these games.  They seem like a good bet, and I could definitely see how they'd have enough depth to be studied mathematically.  That might be too focused though, I don't know.
