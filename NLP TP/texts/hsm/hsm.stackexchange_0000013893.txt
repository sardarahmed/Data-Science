Q:

What books did Lavoisier read?

I am interested in Antoine Lavoisier's intellectual formation/background.
Is there any available list of the books which Antoine Lavoisier read, especially ones on science/mathematics/philosophy (even if only a partial list)?

A:

There is online a Panopticon Lavoisier which is a tool for searching the Archives de l’Académie des sciences, Fonds Lavoisier.
 The link to "library"
is introduced thus:

The catalogue of Lavoisier's library was published in 1995 by Marco
Beretta (Bibliotheca Lavoisieriana. The Catalogue of the Library of
Antoine Laurent Lavoisier. Florence: Leo S. Olschki). In 1998 a new
collection of books bearing Lavoisier's bookplate was found at the
Bibliothèque de l'Institut. The digital catalogue of Lavoisier's
library includes all the new findings and, in a few cases, the
digitalization of some title. In the guided visit to the data-base the
books are arranged alphabetically by author.
