Q:

Who discovered that the electromagnetic tensor is the curvature of a connection?

I can not identify clearly who was the first one to realize that the electromagnetic tensor is the curvature 2-form of a U(1)-connection. Looking at Weyl's work, it seems that he came pretty close to it in 1929 but I can not find any clear indication that he realized that $A$ was a connection and $F$ its curvature. I can not see any clear statement about this until Wu and Yang's paper in 1975. Could anyone help me?

A:

I still have only a partial answer to the question. Looking at Trautman's lecture notes published in 1970 (https://doi.org/10.1016/0034-4877(70)90003-0), it is more than clear that he knew for sure that $A$ was a U(1) connection and $F$ its curvature. Lubin's work in 1963 (https://doi.org/10.1016/0003-4916(63)90194-5) is rather technical and seems to already point towards that direction. However, going back as far as Utiyama's work of 1955 (https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRev.101.1597), right after the work of Yang and Mills, it seems that he generalizes the work of Weyl (1929) to non-abelian group in a very technical way, comparing the affine connexions and the gauge fields without truly identifying them as a the same mathematical/geometrical structure. Any complement to this would of course be welcome!
