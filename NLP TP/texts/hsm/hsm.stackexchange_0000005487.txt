Q:

Are the works of J.E. Littlewood in ballistics stored somewhere?

I watched the movie 'The Man Who Knew Infinity' and read the biography of J.E. Littlewood in Wikipedia. He worked on Ballistics in WW1. 
Were those works were stored somewhere? I have checked on the internet; but haven't found any.

A:

Littlewood described his WW1 work in Adventures in Ballistics, 1915-1918 published by Mathematical Spectrum magazine in two parts in 1971-72. Unfortunately, they store only first pages online, so you'd have to get paper copies. 
Littlewood's contemporaneous papers, Formulae for Direct Fire and Anti-Aircraft Trajectories and Range Tables were published by War Office in London, 1917, which would be hard to get, I imagine. But they are discussed in Barrow-Green's “Anti-aircraft guns all day long”:Karl Pearson and computing for the Ministry of Munitions in Revue d’histoire des mathématiques 21 (2015), p. 111–150, which is conveniently cached by Google, and apparently reprinted in Pearson Papers (cited here), which might be easier to find.
