Q:

Biography of Galois in English

Note: This was first posted at Mathematics Stack Exchange, from which I was redirected here. Forgive me if this violates any crossposting rules I'm not currently aware of.

Currently, I'm starting work on a project about Evariste Galois. While I'm familiar with the basic details of his life — French, revolutionary, genius, headstrong, dead — and those details paint an amazing picture of him, I have not been able to find a comprehensive biography of him in English.
Unfortunately, my command of French is  poor and, thus, reading any biographies in French would be out of the question at this time. I was hoping you could point me to an authoritative biography in English, if such a thing exists, and if not, to compilations of his personal correspondence or the like.
Thank you for your help.

You can see : 

Laura Toti Rigatelli, Evariste Galois 1811–1832 (1996).

Peter M. Neumann (editor), The Mathematical Writings of Évariste Galois (2011); there is a general Introduction as well as specific introductions to the  original papers : all in English.
