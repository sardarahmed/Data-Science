Q:

Who knows Frank Irvin?

In a German book by Helmut Kracke I found Frank Irvin mentioned. Irvin proved in 1916 the convergence of the harmonic series when all terms containing a 9 were omitted. I would like to include Irvin in my lecture but could not find anything about him except a mentioning of his name in AMM 1915 concerning the solution of a problem.
I would need the dates of birth and dead and possibly a picture.
Note. From the material contained in the answer supplied by Michael E2 I have seen that the original work is due to Kempner (1914) and already described in Wikipedia.
