Q:

Who first wrote down $S^6$'s standard almost complex structure? And who first proved that it is not integrable?

It is well known that $S^6$ admits an almost complex structure, inherited from its manifestation as the space of unit imaginary octonions. This almost complex structure is also well-known not to be integrable, i.e. not derived from a genuine complex structure. 
Both of these facts were known by the early 50's, as mentioned e.g. in the introduction to this paper by Calabi, which contains references (numbers 8 and 23 for its existence and numbers 7, 9 for non-integrability). 
I suspect that the existence might have been known for some decades by that time, since it already appeared in a textbook (the above-mentioned reference 23) and is a relatively easy linear algebra-type result. Perhaps Cartan wrote it down already? 
Regarding non-integrability, I suspect (for no particularly strong reasons) that it was only discovered around 1950 (the references Calabi gives are from 1951), but I'm not sure.

A:

According to this arxiv paper by Atiyah, existence and construction dates from 1947; non-integrability from 1951.
Here is Atiyah's history: 
Ehresmann 1947: Introduced the notion of almost complex structure
and showed that the 6-sphere admits an almost complex structure, but
explicitly points out that he does not know whether it has a complex
structure.
Hopf 1947: Proved that $S^4$ and $S^8$ do not admit almost complex structures.
Kirchhoff 1947: Uses octonions to construct an explicit almost complex
structure on $S^6$.
Eckmann-Frohlicher and Ehresmann-Liberman 1951: Independently
prove that Kirchhoff’s almost complex structure on $S^6$ is not integrable
to a complex structure.
Borel and Serre 1953: Prove that $S^{2n}$ admits an almost complex structure
if and only if $n = 1$ or $3$.
Hirzebruch 1954 and Liberman 1955: Remarks that it is still not known
whether $S^6$ has a complex structure.

EDIT
Regarding your request for sources, here are my “mixed results”.
Ehresmann’s 1947 introductory results can be found here : Ehresmann, C., Sur la theorie des espaces fibres, Colloque de Topologie Algebrique, C.N.R.S., Paris (1947), pp. 3.
Borel and Serre’s non-existence result for even dimensional spheres can be found here : A. Borel, J.P. Serre Groupes de Lie et puissances réduites de Steenrod Amer. J. Math., 75 (1953), pp. 409-448

For Hopf’s 1947 result, I cannot locate the original paper, however the source is identified in Robert Green and Shing-Tung Yau’s Differential Geometry
 as H. Hopf, Sur les champs d’element de surface dans les varietes a 4 dimensions, Topologie Algebrique, Paris 1947, Editions CNRS. 
The original paper giving Kirchhoff's construction is not easy to locate.  Possibly from A. KIRCHHOFF, C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris vol. 225 (1947).
I am not able to source the non-integrable to a complex structure result.
