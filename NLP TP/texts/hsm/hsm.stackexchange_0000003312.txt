Q:

Cartesian coordinate system in Newton's work

In the english translation of Newton's work "Enumeratio linearum tertii ordinis" by C.R.M. Talbot, we can see in a figure the depiction of a Cartesian coordinate system pretty much as we know it today: two perpendicular axes labeled X, Y intersected at the origin O. Is it possible that this figure corresponds to some of the original Newton's drawings? I cannot find it in the latin edition.

A:

The standard way we represent Cartesian coordinates with orthogonal axis is not present into Descartes' La Géométrie nor into Newton's works.
An early occurrence of the "basic" definitions are in :

Colin McLaurin's A Treatise on Algebra (1748 - two years after his death); see page 297-on:

§2. We are now to consider quantities as represented by lines. [ page 301 ] So that, if $AP$ represent $x$, and the prependicular $PM$ represent the corresponding values of $y$, then there will be as many points ($M$,) the extremities of these perpendiculars or ordinates [...].

The modern representation (as usual), is due to Leonhard Euler into his Introductio in analysin infinitorum, (1748), Tomus Secundus.
See page 3 for an "elucidation" of function and page 4:

Sit igitur $x$ quantitas variabilís, quae per rectam indefinitam $RS$  repraesentetur, atque manifestum est omnes valores determinatos ipsius $x$, qui quidem sint reales, per portiones in recta $RS$ abscindendas repraesentari posse. [...] Vocantur аutem haec intervalla $АР$, ABSCISSAE. Atque ideo Abscissae exhibent variabilis $x$ valores determinatos.
[page 7] Portiones autem Axis $АР$, quibus determinati ipsius $x$ valores indicantur, vocari solent $ABSCISSAE$.
Et perpendiculares $PM$, ex terminis Abscissarum $M$ ad lineam curvam pertingentes, nomen $APPLICATARUM$ obtinuerunt.
Vocantur autem hoc casu Applicatae normales seu orthogonales, quin cum Axe angulum rectum constituunt.

In general, we can see :
