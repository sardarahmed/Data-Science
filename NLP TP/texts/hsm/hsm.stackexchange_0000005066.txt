Q:

Looking for source of foods associated with specific humors

Let's get this out of the way- I am aware that this is nonsense today. However, historically it would have been considered science, so I'm asking here rather than in the History SE.
Classically, foods were associated with the four humors. But while I will hear people occasionally say things like "apples were phlegmatic," I have no idea where they came by this information. Apparently applesauce and pork were combined with this in mind, and most classical recipes had these balances in mind while being made. 
So I would like recommendations for good sources/resources to find the humor associations of different foodstuffs. I like experimenting in my kitchen and I thought it would be a fun theme to try, what can I say?

A:

Turns out the answer seems to be the Roman doctor-philosopher Galen, who wrote extensively on food, diet, and the humors. I found an excellent translation of his work on this specific topic on Amazon here: Galen on Food and Diet https://www.amazon.com/dp/0415232333/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_RhWwBbF900F84
