Q:

What made Newton realize that the law of gravitation was 'universal'?

Newton's law of gravitation operative near the earth is the same law causes the earth and the other planets to go around the sun and other heavenly phenomena. Was it a giant leap of faith by Newton or did he religiously studied astronomical data to come to this conclusion? 

A:

According to his own recollections, Newton arrived to the idea of universal gravitation when he compared the acceleration of the moon in its orbit with the acceleration of falling objects on the Earth surface. This was his first calculation. This was a rough, approximate estimate with many simplifying assumptions.
Many years later, Newton was able to show that the his attraction law is equivalent to the Kepler Law. This was a major step which made the universality of the law of gravitation much more plausible. After that he started to investigate other phenomena: the three bodies problem (that is deviations of the Moon from the Kepler laws), tides, the shape of the Earth, etc. And was convinced that the gravitation law can indeed explain these phenomena.
He wrote his famous book, where he gave explanations of many celestial and other phenomena
from the gravitation law.
His results were far from complete. For example, he could not explain all known at that time irregularities of the Moon motion. His prediction of the shape of the Earth was confirmed after many measurements (mostly French).
His theory of tides was eventually developed to the extent which made tide prediction possible. A reasonably complete theory of Moon motion was developed (with enormous efforts of best mathematicians) by the middle of
18 century.
These investigations were curried on by his successors, gradually convincing more and more in the exactness and universality of the law. Some major steps were calculations of the orbits of small planets and the discovery of Neptun
in the first half of 19 century.
