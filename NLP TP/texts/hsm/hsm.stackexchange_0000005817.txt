Q:

Is the symbol for set membership $\in$ derived from greek letter $\epsilon$?

Title self explains: Is the symbol for set membership $\in$ derived from greek letter $\epsilon$? What is their historical relationship? Obviously the letter must be older, since greek alphabet is extremely old. 
Paul Halmos Naive Set theory, page 2, second paragraph (equivalently page 2 lines 8-11)

This version of the Greek letter epsilon is so often used to denote
  belonging that its use to denote anything else is almost prohibited.
  Most authors relegate $\in$ to its set-theoretic use forever and use $\epsilon$
  when they need the fifth letter of the Greek alphabet.

In the comments of this answer is found a discussion, but not in the form of answer. Also this site seems more appropriate than Math.SE.

A:

Yes, it is.
In Giuseppe Peano's Arithmetices Principia (1889), the $\epsilon$ symbol is explained as follows (page x): 

Signum $\epsilon$ significat est.  

[The sign $\epsilon$ means is.]

In his Principi di Logica matematica (1891), Peano gives the full explanation (page 3) : 

Per indicare la proposizione singolare « $x$ è un individuo della classe $s$ » scriveremo (8)
  [To mean the proposition "$x$ is an individual of the class $s$" we will write]
  $$x \varepsilon s,$$
e il segno $\varepsilon$  si potrà leggere è, o è un, o fu, o sarà, a seconda delle regole grammaticali; però il suo significato è sempre quello spiegato.
  [and the sign $\varepsilon$ will be read is, or is a, ...]
[...]
(8): Il segno $\varepsilon$ è l'iniziale di ἐστι.
  [The sign $\varepsilon$ is the initial of ἐστι.]

See also: Hubert Kenendy, What Russell learned from Peano, NDJFL (1973).
And see: Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell, Principia Mathematica (1910-1913), page 25:

The propositional function "$x$ is a member of the class $\alpha$" will be expressed, following Peano, by the notation 
$$x \epsilon \alpha.$$
  Here $\epsilon$ is chosen as the initial of the word ἐστι.

In 1888, Richard Dedekind, in Was Sind und was Sollen Die Zahlen? (art. 3), used a "reversed" $\varepsilon$ ($A ∋ S$) to mean "is part of", where this relation slid between membership and improper inclusion.

A:

Yes and no. Peano originally used $\epsilon$ in Arithmetices Prinicipia Nova Methodo Exposita (1889), and stated that the symbol was an abbreviation for Latin est (is), apparently using a Greek letter for a Latin word. However, as Mauro Allegranza pointed out, in Principi di Logica Matematica (1891) he changes the script, and explains the use of $\varepsilon$ by reference to the Greek ἐστι (is). In Formulaire de Mathematiques (1895) Peano goes back to $\epsilon$ (possibly the choice between the two depended on typographers). 
In the first edition of Principia Mathematica (1903) Russell explicitly adopted Peano’s symbol $\varepsilon$, along with the Greek lineage. Extensional (sets) and intensional (classes) notions were not separated at the time, so Russell-Peano's $a\,\varepsilon P$ is more of intensional "$a$ is $P$", with $P$ as a class defining property, than modern extensional "$a$ is an element of the set $P$". Fully extensional interpretation of sets only appears in Hausdorff's Grundzuge der Mengenlehre (1914), see Kanamori's The empty set, the singleton, and the ordered pair. The stylized $\in$ and its crossed version $\not\in$ appear in Bourbaki's Theorie des Ensembles (1939), likely responsible for their widespread adoption, but they might have been used earlier.
