Q:

Who first defined the "equal-delta" or "delta over equal" ($\triangleq$) symbol?

The symbol $\triangleq$ is sometimes used in mathematics (and physics) for a definition. It is instantiated for instance in the Unicode Character 'DELTA EQUAL TO' (U+225C).
The notation  $t \triangleq m$ (generally) means: "$t$ is defined to be $m$" or "$t$ is equal by definition to $m$" (often under certain conditions).
In a similar sense, some use $:=$ or  $=:$ (see for instance Symbols based on equality). Yet, this Delta variant is more important to me.
The SE. Maths post What is meant by the delta equivalent sign? proposes a slight distinction (not crystal-clear to me) between the above similar senses:

Sometimes it is used with the slightly different meaning of "equal by definition", to underline the difference w.r.t. "$:=$ " which is the definition itself.
i.e.
$$
a:=3;\\
5+a \triangleq 5 + 3 = 8 
$$

I always took for granted that the $\Delta$ stood for letter "D", i.e. for the  initial of "definition". Indeed, one sometimes finds $\overset{\mathrm{def}}{=}$ too. In German apparently, one also uses $≙$ (Entspricht-Zeichen, with Unicode U+2259).
Based on these prior hints, my questions are as follows:

Who introduced this dual symbol first in science, and where (which source)?
What motivated the Greek $\Delta$ notation? The abbreviation of some word, a symbol (why not a latin notation)?
Why not merge the lower bar of the Delta with the upper bar of the equal sign, to save some ink, and create a lighter symbol?

A:

This is really a comment rather than a full answer.
Florian Cajori's encyclopedic tome A History of Mathematical Notations does not seem to discuss this symbol specifically; the closest thing is the following remark in Section 269:

L. Gustave du Pasquier (Comptes Rendus du Congrès International des Mathématicians (Strasbourg, 22–30 Septembre 1920), p. 164) in discussing general complex numbers employs the sign of
double equality $\overset{\displaystyle =}{=}$ to signify “equal by definition.”

I checked MathSciNet, and the review of the 1953 paper "Zwei Klassen von Flächen, deren Bestimmung von einem Integral der Telegraphengleichung abhängt" by Hans Jonas (MR0058259) uses the notation $=_{\text{def}}$ (but note that Jonas's paper itself does not use that notation). This seems to be the earliest occurrence of $=_{\text{def}}$ or $\overset{\text{def}}=$ in MathSciNet.  But I do not have access to a print version to verify that the notation was actually used back in the 1953 edition of Mathematical Reviews.
