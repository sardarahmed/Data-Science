Q:

Literary Movements in Math Writing

I am wondering if there is some analog for literary movements in writing (e.g., romanticism/post-modernism) for mathematics or the sciences as a whole. I would think there would be similarly large tonal/structural shifts from decade to decade in how mathematics is communicated.
I am curious if there are specific examples of these shifts (named or not) and what they entailed.

A:

This is an interesting scholarly book:
Jeremy Gray, Plato's Ghost: The Modernist Transformation of Mathematics (Princeton University Press, 2008)
There were profound changes in mathematics between 1880 and 1910.  Gray argues that these changes constitute a "modernist" movement, like the modernist movements in art and in music.
