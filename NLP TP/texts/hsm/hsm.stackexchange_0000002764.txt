Q:

Is there any historical "evidence" maintaining that Euclid was a single person?

Bourbaki, for example, was the name of a set of mathematicians, rather than a single person, under which several books were published.
Out of curiosity, I wonder if there is any historical evidence that makes one maintain that the author of the Elements, Euclid, was a single person instead of a set of ancient scholars?

A:

There's little question that some parts of "The Elements" were added by later authors.  Heath's English translation gives a lengthy commentary on what is likely in the original work and what is known or suspected to be from later editors.  
There were also two entire books tacked onto the end that were often attributed to Euclid, but are now generally recognized as being from later authors.
So in that sense the author of the Elements wasn't just one person.  But there almost certainly was an actual Euclid who wrote the bulk of what's come down to us as The Elements.  Pappus and Proclus both discuss him as an actual person, and while they lived several centuries after The Elements were written, we know they were drawing from near-contemporary sources.  

A:

I too do not see any reason to doubt that the works of Euclid were written by one person, apart, naturally, from some interpolations. However, I must disagree with Konstantinos when he writes that “there is no known similar group of scientists in the ancient times”. The medical writings attributed to Hippocrates are well-known to have been written over a period of centuries and have very clear differences in content and style. But maybe medicine is not a science in the way that mathematics is.
