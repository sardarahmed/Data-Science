Q:

When was the convention for the indefinite integral $\int\frac{1}{x}dx$ changed?

In Europe, in the 20th century, $\int\frac{1}{x}dx$ equalled $\ln{x}+C$. (I have references from Poland for 1930-1947 and the UK for the 1960s and 1970s).
Now, if one mentions $\int\frac{1}{x}dx=\ln{x}+C$ in Mathematics Stack Exchange, one is lynched. The doctrine is now that $\int\frac{1}{x}dx=\ln|x|+C$, and any suggestion to the contrary is a crime.
I don't want to discuss the pros and cons of this alteration, but I am interested to know: who made this change, and when? Was it intentional, or just an influential textbook? Or is this less of an "old millennium/new millennium" and more of an "Old World/New World" kind of thing?
There is an argument for posting this to Maths Stack Exchange rather than here, and I will if asked; but it is a historical question and so this seems a reasonable forum for it.

A:

Mathematicians say $\int \frac{1}{x}\;dx = \log x + C$.  It works even for the complex case.  
Calculus instructors say $\int \frac{1}{x}\;dx = \ln|x|+C$ for some reason, but it is WRONG in the complex case.  (Perhaps that "ln" in there gives us a hint that they are writing for engineers and physicists rather than mathematicians.)
So my guess is that the change came around 1950 or so, when calculus textbook writers were no longer research mathematicians first, and textbook writers later.
