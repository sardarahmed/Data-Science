Q:

Examples of mathematical definitions motivated by engineering problems

I'm interested in the development of mathematical definitions for the sake of engineering, and what makes a particular definition better suited for a problem than another in any particular context.
Ideally, I aim to compile a list of examples of definitions, their historical context and a list of inadequate definitions which were proposed, along with a rationale of what was missing from the inadequate definition.
A concrete example is Bell Labs being contracted to create secure military communications, and Claude Shannon developing his theory of mutual information as a result. A failed attempt would be Karl Pearson's suggestion of mutual information as P(x,y)^2.
Here's a blog post that goes a little bit into that history, and points at the kind of comparitive research I'm interested in:

A:

Stable polynomials. A polynomial is called stable if its zeros lie in the left half-plane. This is a substantial research topic for the last 150 years. The problem arose as a pure engineering problem of stabilizing various automatically controlled machines (First Airy was investigating stabilization of his telescopes, then Stodola investigated stabilization of steam engines etc.) Important contributions were made in 19 century by Maxwell, then Routh and Hurwitz, but research on stable polynomials continues to this day.
