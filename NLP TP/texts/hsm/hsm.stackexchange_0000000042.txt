Q:

Which came first, the natural logarithm or the base of the natural logarithm?

The natural logarithm function ($\ln x$) and the base of the natural logarithm function ($e$) are both extremely useful. They're also both closely related: $\ln (e^x)=x$, and $e^{\ln x}=x$. But which came first? I would think it's likely they were developed together, but each could have been developed separately. For example, $\int 1/x \,dx=\ln x$, and the $\cosh$ function can be described in terms of $e$. So which came first: the natural logarithm function or the base of the natural logarithm function?

A:

It may seem strange but logarithms were invented much earlier.
Napier used the base $(1-10^{-7})^{10^7}$ which is very close to 1/$e$ (within 0.00000002 of 1/$e$).
Number $e$ (as a limit) was formally defined by Euler approximately 100 years after
Napier.
Napier's MIRIFICI LOGARITHMORUM CANONIS CONSTRUCTIO (English translation by Ian Bruce) contains tables of logarithms, and explanations of the construction of the tables. 
EDIT. Natural logarithms, and the formula $\ln x=\int_1^xdt/t$ defining them, were known long before Euler. Modern texts usually define them as the inverse function of $e^x$, but historically this was not the case: $e^x$ is much later invention than logarithms.
According to Wikipedia, this definition using "the area under the hyperbola" is due to
Alphonse Antonio de Sarasa (1649), that is a century before Euler.

Quick answer: logarithms came before Euler's Number, $e$.
The Euler's Number, $e$, one of the most important mathematical constants is an irrational number closely related to growth and rate of change. The earliest written observation of number approximate to $e$ was made by J. Bernoulli, around 17-th century, arising from experimenting with the length and number of intervals of compound interest over an initial investment, where he observed a pattern which was later identified by Euler (and Gauss) as we know it Today. 
The logarithms were developed, a century earlier (early 1600s) by Napier, as a practical tool for Astronomical calculations related with the multiplication of large numbers.
Around that time (middle 1600s) the concept of function became relevant together with Calculus, which is essentially the language of rate of change. Main part of that "language" is played by $e$ which arises naturally in expressions and functions related to growth. Calculus provided the "platform" that allowed $e$ to be associated and connected with another mathematical (already existing) branches - geometry (areas under a curve (hyperbole)), trigonometry, etc. leading to a culmination, which is named: "The most beautiful formula." (Euler's identity.): $$e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0$$ applicable and helpful in numerous areas in science.
