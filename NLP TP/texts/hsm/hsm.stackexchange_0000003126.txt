Q:

Who was the first to mention the nine problem?

When Cantor published his seminal diagonal argument, he used binary code and did not distinguish the real numbers 0.1000… and 0.0111… Later, Koenig found a way to save the diagonal argument in binary digits (a reference would be appreciated). Meanwhile, the most popular form is to use decimal digits.
My main question: Who was the first person to mention that in the diagonal argument digits should not be replaced by 9's because of 0.1999⋯ = 0.2000… ?

A:

The first mention of the "nine-problem" was by Felix Klein, Vorträge über ausgewählte Fragen der Elementargeometrie, Teubner 1895, p. 42.
