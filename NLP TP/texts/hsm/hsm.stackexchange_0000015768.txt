Question about Felix Klein's "Development of Mathematics in the 19th Century"

The original version of these photos is Felix Klein's "Development of Mathematics in the 19th Century"

In this book, it says class-field and decompose 2 into $(1+i)$ and $(1-i)$. Is it not possible to decompose it into 3 parts like $\sqrt{2}$, $\sqrt{1+i}$, $\sqrt{1-i}$? If this is not possible, I would appreciate it if you could explain the rules of the class field.

And it says $2\mu+(1+\sqrt{-5})\nu$. I understood this to be the sum of "the set of numbers divisible by 2"and "the set of numbers divisible by field $K\sqrt{-5}$". i.e. Felix Klein could have written $a+b\sqrt{-5}$ in the book, but I think he wrote $1+\sqrt{-5}$, which is the easiest. If this interpretation is wrong, what is the meaning of $2\mu+(1+\sqrt{-5})\nu$?

A:

Regarding your second question:
It is not clear what you mean by "the set of numbers divisible by the field $K\sqrt{-5}$".  In any field, every element is divisible by every non-zero element of the field.
The expression $2\mu + ( 1 + \sqrt{-5} )\nu$ denotes any element that can be written in this way, where $\mu$ and $\nu$ are algebraic integers with respect to the field $K(\sqrt{-5})$.  Since not every element of a field is an algebraic integer we would not write $a + b\sqrt{-5}$.
(I am still wading in the shallow waters of algebra, so other readers may have different views of your questions.)
