Q:

What's a good resource for some of mathematics greatest controversies and debates?

We often think of mathematics as being clean-cut, with questions being settled with theorems, and not much room for disagreement. This isn't true though of course.
Going back to ancient history, we hear the story of how Pythagoras murdered the man that discovered irrational numbers. Jumping to modern mathematics, Cantor's ideas about infinity invoked such harsh criticism, he literally went insane$^1$.
Is there a good website or other resource recounting some of the great controversies and debates of mathematics?

$^{^{^1\text{Although I'm sure going insane isn't fun, you have to admit that's a pretty awesome reason, if one had the choice.}}}$

A:

One of the greatest mathematical controversies arguably is the one concerning infinitesimals: are they contradictory? are they useful? did Leibniz really use them? is there a connection between Leibniz's infinitesimals and Robinson's? are Euler's infinitesimal procedures sheer madness? are they chimeras, as alleged by authors ranging from Berkeley to Moigno to Connes? Why did Cantor described them as "abominations", "paper numbers", and self-contradictory?

You might be interested in "Great Feuds in Mathematics: Ten of the Liveliest Disputes Ever" by Hal Hellman. Personally, I don't think very highly of such 
books, however.  

A:

This is not a list of controversies, but you might be interested in Imre Lakatos' book Proofs and Refutations which describes the mathematical progress. For example it provides a discussion of Euler's Polyhedron Formula as a discussion between a teacher and some students. The arguments the students use in this discussion are arguments which have been brought forward by different mathematicians. 
The book also describes different "solutions" which have been used in the history of mathematics if someone found a counterexample to a "Theorem".
