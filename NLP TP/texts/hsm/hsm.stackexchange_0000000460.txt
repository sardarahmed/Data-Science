Q:

When and where was Electricity used for the first time?

There are references of Greeks discovering static electricity around 600 BC. Mediterranean's were also thought of having the understanding of rubbing amber rods to attract light objects  like feather. 
My question is when was it first used productively for the first time, after having understood it's properties ?

A:

I do not know of any practical use of static electricity except for many funny demonstration experiments which were popular in 18-th century. Only after the invention of a battery (by A. Volta, around 1800) serious applications became possible, and the earliest that comes to my mind is telegraph. Wikipedia mentions 1809 as the date of the earliest experiments with electric telegraphy. So I guess that telegraph was the first practical application of electricity.
EDIT. I agree with SJuan that lighting rods was the first use. I would say, important use,
because it saves lives and property.
