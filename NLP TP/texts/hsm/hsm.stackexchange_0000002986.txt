Q:

Examples of good research mathematicians that did poorly in exams

Are there any examples of mathematicians have produced good research, having done poorly in mathematics exams?

A:

Well Ramanujan was such a mathematician. He was not so poor in math exams but he scored somewhat unbelievable marks in mathematics. In $1907$, he appeared in FA Examination at Pachaiyappa College, after studying privately. He got $85$ out of $150$ in mathematics and failed in English, Sanskrit, Physiology and History. Now one would expect that Ramanujan would get $100\%$ by analyzing his ability to tackle hard problems, but it was not so. But as we all know, he was very good at research. The reason for his scoring low marks in examinations are discussed here by Berndt.  

A:

The most famous case of this sort is Galois failing the entrance exam to Ecole Polytechnique.

A:

Newton somewhat infamously failed his examinations at Cambridge: he was questioned orally about the proofs in Euclid, and since he had looked at Euclid once and thought it a total waste of time, and had just rederived all the results himself, he had no idea how to answer things like "How does Euclid prove X.1?"
Somehow he was awarded the scholarship anyway - presumably someone noticed that they were dealing with Isaac Newton.
