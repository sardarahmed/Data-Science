Q:

Who is the Göbel who is the eponym of Göbel's Sequence?

Richard K. Guy refers to him as "F. Göbel" in his Unsolved Problems of Number Theory but that's as close as I can get.

A:

The first thing I tried was searching for "Gobel" at the Mathematics Genealogy Project, which I figured wouldn't be successful because for something like this it's likely the person doesn't have a math Ph.D. (or any Ph.D.), and it's also something I would assume you tried. However, there was a single "F. Göbel" listed, Frits Göbel, and his thesis title also somewhat suggests that this might be the correct person. (A title such as "Enriched Categories and Quasi-uniform Spaces" would, for example, have had me thinking otherwise.)
Then I tried the google search "Göbel's sequence" + "Fritz" and got exactly one hit, this 25 September 1986 letter from Richard K. Guy to Neil J. A. Sloan. The sequence $1,$ $2,$ $3,$ $5,$ $10,$ $28,$ $154,$ $3520,\, \ldots$ at the bottom of the first page is identified with the name Fritz Göbel. The google search "Fritz Göbel" + "sequence" appears to confirm that this is the Göbel you want. I don't know whether he has a middle name or his birth year, but I believe he is still alive.
