Q:

Why didn't Boyle made a correlation between V and T of a gas (and similarly between P and T)?

I was just reading about The Gas Laws of Boyle, Charles and Avogadro from a general college book Chemistry (7th edition, Zumdahl&Zumdahl).
 Boyle was the one who discovered a correlation between pressure and volume of a gas.
I was left wondering... 
Why didn't he further studied gas properties at different volume and temperature and/or also between pressure and temperature? The latter is quite similar to his own.

A:

I believe that the comment by @Stephan Matthiesen contains the crucial point (so the credit for the answer should go to him) : -- Boyle's work did not include quantitative temperature effects because he worked in the age before thermometry.
Lack of the techniques of thermometry also limited, in some respects, the work of Boyle's contemporary Newton, and this aspect is mentioned, along with references that also have relevance here, in the following answer:-- Why is there little scholarship devoted to Book II of Newton's Principia? .
