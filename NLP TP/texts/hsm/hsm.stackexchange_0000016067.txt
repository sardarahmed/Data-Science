Q:

Origin of the name "Loschmidt echo" in quantum chaos studies

The name "Loschmidt echo" is used in quantum physics for the quantity
$$
 M(t) \equiv \left|  \langle\psi_0| e^{i H t/\hbar} e^{-i H_0 t/\hbar} |\psi_0\rangle \right|^2
$$
where
$$
H = H_0 + \Sigma.
$$
The idea is that $|\psi_0\rangle$ is the state of some quantum system at time zero and $\Sigma$ is a small perturbation; the system evolves under $H_0$ for time $t$ and we would like to discover the degree to which the result overlaps with evolution under $H$. One can interpret $M(t)$ also as if the system first evolved under $H_0$ and then under $-H$ for a further time $t$ (or backwards in time under $H$), and one wishes to know the degree to which $H$ 'undoes' the effect of $H_0$.
The name "Loschmidt" is, as I understand it, that of Johann Josef Loschmidt (15 March 1821 – 8 July 1895) who debated with Boltzmann about reversibility and entropy etc. in classical physics, so one can see why $M(t)$ might have got to be named after him. However in view of the fact that $M(t)$ as defined above is a thoroughly quantum-mechanical quantity I am not sure if the name is apt, and I wonder whether we might introduce the name Peres since Asher Peres used the quantity in his Stability of quantum motion in chaotic and regular systems, Phys. Rev. A 30, 1610 (1984). Anyway my question here is if anyone can elucidate the origins of the name "Loschmidt echo", and comments on the feasibility or appropriateness of introducing another name would also be welcome.

A:

Here I present what I could find about the coinage of the term "Loschmidt echo" (mostly based of two reviews 1 and 2 and sources therein).
Erwin Hahn demonstrated and defined spin echos in the 1950, per 3. As soon as this happened the discussion of a "Loschmidt paradox" being realizable in the experiments was discussed. See 4, which is from 1957, "Loschmidt-Ehrenfest paradox" of 5 from 1965, and 1970 "Loschmidt demon"  from 6. Ref 5 also cites 7 for having first made this association in 1959 between spin echoes and thermodynamic paradoxes.
However the earliest mention of "Loschmidt echo" I have found online is from Hahn himself in a lecture from 1978, see 8:

The path taken in precession phase may be in accord
with a mirror sequence of pulses, in which case the Loschmidt echo scheme is realized; or the path may be cyclic, which does not retrace the forward evolution of phase, but
nevertheless returns to the initial point by a different return route.

While this article is not cited, review 2 cites 9 to say:

Early on Erwin Hahn recognized that his procedure, which he viewed as a change in the sign of the system Hamiltonian, provided a quantum implementation of the Loschmidt proposal.

Hahn in Ref. 9 (1984) does not use the term Loschmidt echo but his realization of the Loschdmidt paradox is explained in more detail.
The next textual mention of the "Loschmidt echo" (as far as I can find online) does not appear until the 2001 work of Rodolfo Jalabert and Horace Patawski (10) who also refer to Ref. 9. The 2001 publication also clearly defines the formula that you mention. Worth highlighting Asher Peres who also introduced the same formula in 1984, without calling it Loschdmidt echo, in 11.
Reviews 1 and 2 suggest that the echo was named after the Loschmidt paradox. Review 2 was also written partially by Jalabert and Patawski, if their use of the term was inspired by some other earlier work they missed to indicate it.  The term Loschmidt echo might have existed informally to refer a series of spin echo results until its formalization in 2001.
Disclaimer: I will comment very little on the "feasibility" of introducing an alternative name. This site is not the forum for that unless it is already a matter of historical name conflict. Also it clearly does not help with the vast family of spin echo names.
