Q:

Was Cramér the first to interpret the PNT's $1/\log(x)$ as probability of primes?

The Cramér probabilistic model of primes is built on the assumption that the probability of $n$ being prime is
$$\Pr(n)=\frac{1}{\log (n)}$$
This is not a big leap from the Prime Number Theorem which tells us that the density of primes is approximately $1/\log(x)$, an approximation that is asymptotically more accurate for larger $x$.
My question is, was Harald Cramér the first to use this density as a probability, in the 1930s?
His famous paper was published 1936/7 (pdf).

A:

A good place to look is Granville’s paper “Harald Cramér and the distribution of primes numbers.” It is on Granville’s  website here. He brings in Cramér’s work starting on the bottom of page 19. The reason Cramér deserves to have this probabilistic model for the primes named after him is that he went much further than anyone before him in exploring consequences of the basic $1/\log n$ heuristic to primes. He applied nontrivial theorems from probability theory to make predictions about the primes in a style nobody had ever done before. This did not directly prove anything about the primes, and Cramér acknowledged this, but simply having an idea of what might be true is often very important in trying to understand how mathematical patterns fit together.
