Q:

With what kind of proof was the Binet formula derived for the first time?

As everyone knows, there are dozens of proofs of Binet's Fibonacci Number Formula.
My question is, what was the first approach used by Binet? What let people to say this result (the Binet formula) was known to Euler and Bernoulli? 

A:

The original proof by Binet was published in 1843 in Paris.

Binet, J. P.: Mémoire sur l'intégration des équations linéaires aux
  différences finies, d'un ordre quelconque à coefficients variables,
  Comptes Rendus des Séances de l'Académie des Sciences 17 (1843),
  559-567.

You could find the online version of the paper here or here, and a list of publications by Binet here.

Like many results in mathematics it is often not the original
  discoverer who gets the glory of having their name attached to the
  result. J. P. M. Binet (1786-1856) published [Bin] this result now known
  as the Binet’s formula in 1843 although the result was known earlier.
  It seems that Daniel Bernoulli (1700-1782) discovered and proved this
  formula in 1726 ([Ber], §7). Two years later also Euler mentioned the
  formula in a letter to Bernoulli, but he published [Eul] it only in
  1765. A. de Moivre (1667-1754) published it in the general form in the first systematic account of linear recurrences ([Mo1], pp. 26-42) and it
  seems that Binet’s formula was known to him already in 1718 [Mo2]. From
  the later authors let us mention for instance E.Lucas who may
  rediscovered it but did not report it before 1876.

Many authors say that this formula was discovered by J. P. M. Binet
  (1786-1856) in 1843 and so call it Binet's Formula. Graham, Knuth and
  Patashnik in Concrete Mathematics (2nd edition, 1994) mention that
  Euler had already published this formula in 1765. But Don Knuth in The
  Art of Computer Programming, Volume 1 Fundamental Algorithms, section
  1.2.8, traces it back even further, to A de Moivre (1667-1754). He had written about "Binet's" formula in 1730 and had indeed found a method
  for finding formulae for any general series of numbers formed in a
  similar way to the Fibonacci series. Like many results in Mathematics,
  it is often not the original discoverer who gets the glory of having
  their name attached to the result, but someone later!

It was derived by Binet in 1843, although the result was known to
  Euler, Daniel Bernoulli, and de Moivre more than a century earlier.
