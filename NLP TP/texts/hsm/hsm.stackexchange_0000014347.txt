Q:

What was the first physical theory to be mathematically expressed?

Newton's theory of gravitation is expressed as a mathematical relationship between distances and masses. It can be deduced from Kepler's equations (which are also mathematical).
Are there even older physical theories formulated by equations?

A:

The first physical theory which was mathematically expressed is
the Pythagorean theory of music. According to the legend, Pythagoras himself
discovered the relation between musical intervals and the ratios of lengths
of strings. (Based on this discovery, Pythagoras jumped to the conclusion that "Numbers rule the world", so mathematical physics was born).
This seems to be the earliest quantitative discovery of physics.
Based on this, a sophisticated theory of music was developed, one can read about it for example in the book:
B. L. van der Waerden, Science awakening. Mathemarics of ancient Egypt, Babylon and Greece, Appendix: Pythagorean teaching on harmony.
(Was earlier published as a separate paper in Math. Ann., 118 (1941)).
Remark. This competes with Babylonian mathematical astronomy, but one can argue whether Babylonian astronomy belongs to physics or not. Anyway, this discovery is more ancient than Greek astronomy.
Remark 2. Since Pythagoreans was a secret society, the exact details of this discovery and its date are not known. But surely this predates the first well-documented discoveries in physics which are due to Archimedes (floating bodies, the rues of the lever etc.)
