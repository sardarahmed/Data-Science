Q:

Who first came up with the idea that heavenly laws and earthly laws should be the same?

At least Newton realized that the motion of the Moon on the heaven and the motion of an apple on the earth are governed by the same law. 
But who first proposed that the same laws should hold everywhere, regardless of the distance from us? 

A:

Philoponus
John Philoponus, "The Grammarian," who lived in the late 5th – 2nd ½ of 6th century A.D., argued that the sun is fire and of terrestrial-like, corruptible matter.
From his Dictionary of Scientific Biography entry:

Philoponus’ main significance for the history of science lies in his being, at the close of antiquity, the first thinker to undertake a comprehensive and massive attack on the principal tenets of Aristotle’s physics and cosmology, an attack unequaled in thoroughness until Galileo.

Philoponus is certainly one of the "grands génies de l'Antiquité" ("great geniuses of Antiquity") and "principaux précurseurs de la Science moderne" ("principle precursers to modern Science"), as Pierre Duhem wrote in his magisterial, 10 volume work in the history of medieval physics:
