Q:

Comparison of the accuracy of the Ptolemaic and Copernican models

A Japanese book on mechanics says the following (English translation by me):

As a young boy, Tycho Brahe became interested in astronomy when he was impressed by the fact that the solar eclipse occurred almost exactly as predicted. Later, faced with the fact that a prediction of the celestial proximity of the two planets based on a heliocentric model was off by several days and a prediction based on a geocentric model was off by a month, he realized the need for precise observation of celestial bodies.

『物理学序論としての力学』(藤原邦男)
I would like to know how the prediction performance of the Copernicus and Ptolemaic models compare.

A:

The Ptolemaic and Copernican models are observationally indistinguishable, so the book must be misunderstanding the question or summarising it inaccurately.
