Q:

How could the people of the past be sure that $a \times b = b \times a$?

Let me quote from Terence Tao "Analysis 1":

Historically, the realization that numbers could
be treated axiomatically is very recent, not much more than a
hundred years old.

Then, how could the people who lived before the axiomatization of real numbers be sure that, for example, $a$ times $b$ always equals $b$ times $a$? Because, back then they did have a set of axioms from which they could prove things, and thus they also didn't have a notion of rigorous proof. Does this mean that they just observed the pattern that if they took two concrete numbers, it didn't matter if they said "the first times the second" or "the second times the first"; and because of this observation they assumed $a \times b = b \times a$ without a proof?

A:

Multiplication, before the invention of modern (axiomatic) algebra, was defined as the operation giving the area of a rectangle with sides of a particular length.1  Commutativity of multiplication then follows from two axioms:

Congruent geometrical figures have equal areas
Any geometrical figure reflected through a line is congruent to the original figure

and the observation that reflecting a rectangle through a line through a corner at a 45 degree angle from the two sides flips the roles of the sides of the rectangle, so the side that formerly corresponded to $a$ in the figure now corresponds to $b$ and vice-versa.  Since the first rectangle corresponds to $a*b$ and the second rectangle corresponds to $b*a$, and they have the same area, $a*b = b*a$.
Note: the geometrical intuition behind this proof is still used today, in the proof in set theory that $|A\times B| = |B \times A|$.  (The regular inductive proof you may have seen for integers would work for finite sets, but for infinite sets it's easier to do a direct 'geometrical' proof).
1 For example, Euclid states the theorem which today we would state as "the area of a triangle with height $h$ and base $b$ is $\frac{1}{2}bh$ as "If a parallelogram and a triangle are on same base and in the same parallels, the parallelogram is double the triangle", i.e., "the area of a triangle with height $h$ and base $b$ is half the area of a parallelogram with the same height and same base".  Archimedes goes a step further and states the theorem "the area of a circle with radius $r$ is $\pi r^2$" (which he was the first to prove) as "The area of any circle is equal to a right-angled triangle in which one of the sides about the right angle is equal to the radius, and the other to the circumference, of the circle", i.e., "the area of a circle is $\frac{1}{2}rC$".  Note that $\frac{1}{2}rC = \frac{1}{2}r\pi D = \frac{1}{2}r\pi 2r = \pi r^2$", but Archimedes evidently lacks the language to express his result in that form.

A:

The guesses that are ventured in this question are entirely wrong.
(1) That our reason to think multiplication is commutative is that we have an axiom that says so is wrong.
(2) That those without modern standards of logical rigor could not easily understand why multiplication is commutative is wrong.
Suppose $3\times5$ means $\overbrace{5+5+5}^\text{3 terms}.$
and $5\times3$ means $\overbrace{3+3+3+3+3}^\text{5 terms}.$
(Remember that "terms" are things that you add or subtract, and "factors" are things that you multiply.)
Here is $3\times 5{:}$
$$
\begin{array}{ccl}
1 & \bullet \bullet\bullet\bullet\bullet & \longleftarrow \text{5 things} \\
2 & \bullet \bullet\bullet\bullet\bullet & \longleftarrow \text{5 things} \\
3 & \bullet \bullet\bullet\bullet\bullet & \longleftarrow \text{5 things}
\end{array}
$$
Take one of those things from each of the three sets of five and set them down here:
$$
\bullet\bullet\bullet
$$
Now take another one of those things from each of the three sets of five and set them down here:
$$
\bullet\bullet\bullet
$$
Now take another one of those things from each of the three sets of five and set them down here:
$$
\bullet\bullet\bullet
$$
Now take another one of those things from each of the three sets of five and set them down here:
$$
\bullet\bullet\bullet
$$
Now take another one of those things from each of the three sets of five and set them down here:
$$
\bullet\bullet\bullet
$$
There you have $5$ sets of $3$ things, thus
$$
3+3+3+3+3
$$
or $5\times 3.$
It is readily apparent why this must work for other numbers than $5$ and $3.$
