Q:

Motivation and history of singular homology

Among the many cohomology theory's branches I asked about last time, I was curious about $d^2=0$ because I know that it is the formula that is the basis of all cohomology.  So this time, I would like to ask a more detailed question than the last one.  I want to know the background of singular homology, that is, the motivation and history of singular homology.  I would like to receive a recommendation for a text-oriented book with little formula or an answer on the motivation and background of this singular homology.

A:

Regarding singular homology proper, its main development occurred in the 1930s and 1940s with Lefschetz and Eilenberg figuring prominently. For this history, Dieudonn√©'s "A History of Algebraic and Differential Topology, 1900 - 1960" is rather authoritative (see especially pages 68-70). See also Ronnie Brown's math stack exchange answer here in which he comments briefly on singular homology and references Eilenberg's 1944 paper.
