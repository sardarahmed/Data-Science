Searching for book about non-Euclidean geometry that recapitulates the First Book of the Elements

I am looking for a specific book on non-Euclidean geometry that I read in my undergraduate years.
The unique characteristic of this book is that the first part of the book started by re-proving in modern notation the entirety of the first book of Euclid's Elements â€“ given that all the geometry up until Euclid used the parallel postulate would be common to Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries.  The second part of the book treats a few equivalent formulations of the parallel postulate and the ways in which non-Euclidean geometry modifies them.

A:

The book is none other than Marvin Jay Greenberg's "Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometries: Development and History" (the fourth edition of which is available wherever fine books are sold).
