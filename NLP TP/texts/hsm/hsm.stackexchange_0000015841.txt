Q:

$l^p$ space definition

Usually, when studying the applications and results of a theory, it becomes clear why it was interesting to define it in a certain way. However, I'm currently beginning my studies in functional analysis. I see $l^p$ spaces as a generalization of Euclidean space, for vectors in an infinitely-dimensional space. But I would like to understand the construction of this space in a logical manner, comprehending the chronology of definitions, where it originated, who defined it, and everything else. Does anyone have a good recommendation for a history on this?

A:

As I recall, there are extensive historical notes in both:
Dunford & Schwartz, Linear Operators (Interscience, 1958)
M. M. Day, Normed Linear Spaces  (Springer, 1958)
