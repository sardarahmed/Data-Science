Q:

How was it discovered how many electrons are in one coulomb?

I understand the SI meaning of a Coulomb but how were the individual electrons counted in the measurement to know how many it would take to constitute a Coulomb? 

A:

Please check the following references at the bottom (from the earliest known usages of Coulomb in unabridged Oxford English Dictionary). Also, check the early definition of ampere which was also defined on the basis of silver nitrate electrolysis.
from the wt of Ag+ deposited, by Faraday's law, we have one to one correspondence:
Ag+ (solution) + electron ---> Ag (metal), thus from the weight of Ag deposited during electrolysis, you can count electrons involved in the process.
You can independently measure charge passed through a solution via time (t) and current (I). Q= Ixt
from OED:
1881   Nature 29 Sept. 512/2   The name Coulomb to be given to the quantity of electricity defined by the condition that an ampère gives one coulomb per second.
1892   Lightning 3 Mar. (Spec. Suppl.) Gloss. Electrical Terms s.v.   The Coulomb is the quantity of electricity, which, when passed through a solution of nitrate of silver, deposits ·001118 of a gramme of silver on the plate by which it leaves the liquid.
