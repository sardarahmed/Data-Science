Q:

What did the study plan of a early 20th century mathematics undergraduate program look like?

I am interested in what subjects and activities mathematics undergrads were involved in the beginning of the 20th century. Most subjects mathematics majors study at an intermediate and advanced level now were relatively recently developed (for example, Measure Theory or Modern Logic). How different is an early 20th century mathematics undergraduate from a 21st century mathematics undergraduate?
