Q:

From where the so-named "elastica problem" is coming from?

In a book by Cash et al, I see the mention of the so-called Elastica problem (pg 221 in the link here).
The problem is presented as a system of ODEs, 
$$
x' = \cos (\phi) 
$$
$$
y' = \sin (\phi) 
$$
$$
\phi' = \kappa
$$
$$
\kappa' = F \cos (\phi)
$$
and when I looked for where these ODEs come from I could not find a clear derivation anywhere. There are references to Bernoulli, Euler, but the formulation looked different. Does anyone know a book, reference that shows where these equations come from? 
Thanks,

If you read French, a much clearer and more comprehensive discussion is in
