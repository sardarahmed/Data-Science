Q:

Who first drew the Weierstrass function?

As we know, it was Weierstrass who gave the first (published) example, in 1872, of  a function which is continuous but everywhere non-differentiable. However, in his paper "Über continuirliche Functionen eines reellen Arguments, die für keinen Werth des letzeren einen bestimmten Differentialquotienten besitzen" there is no figure  of this function or an attempt to draw it.
Hence, is it known who was first to draw it? Was its depiction possible only to computer graphics or were there attempts before?

A:

I looked through some of my stuff this morning and found the following publications that seem to be relevant to your question.
Moore [1] (1900) and Koch [2] (1904), [3] (1906) are the earliest publications I could find that have diagrams of somewhat accurate approximating curves to nowhere differentiable continuous functions. Until fairly recently (1960s and later), almost all publications on this topic have no figures, and the few that do have figures tend to have only very superficial figures such as absolute value graphs or step functions that are used in various ways to generate such functions. Lang [4] (1961) is the earliest publication I could find that attempts to show the "final state" of the construction of a nowhere differentiable continuous function. Hailpern [5] (1976) is the earliest publication I could find on this topic that gives computer generated graphs, the graphs being for high level approximating curves for such a function. Tall [6] (1982), Dubuc [7] (1989), Hata [8] (1991), Duistermaat [9] (1992) also give various computer generated graphs, but none yet show the Weierstrass function. Baouche/Dubuc [10] (1992) is the earliest paper I could find with the Weierstrass function shown.

See Figure 4 on p. 698. Incidentally, Section III (pp. 697-702) of the paper involves a modification of the now-called Koch curve to obtain the graph of a (nowhere differentiable continuous) function. Incidentally, in the title of Section III translates to: "Transformation of $P$ to a curve $P'$ where the ordinate (i.e. $y$-coordinate) is a uniform function (i.e. single-valued function) of the abscissa (i.e. $x$-coordinate)".

I believe this is a republication of Koch's 1904 paper. Figure 4 and Section III mentioned above are on p. 167 and pp. 166-174.

[Various piece-wise continuous approximations of this function can be found much earlier, but this appears to be a computer generated graph.] Figure 4 on p. 271 shows the Takagi function.

Figure 1.1 on p. 304 gives a graph of Riemann's function. Figure 4.2 on p. 321 shows the behavior at the right side of a point where the derivative exists and is negative -- it looks like a choppier version of what $-x + x^2 \sin (x^{-2})$ looks like at the right side of $x=0.$ See also Figures 4.3, 4.4-4.5, 6.1, 6.2 on pp. 322, 323, 335, 336.
The following is from pp. 303-304: "Already for many years, a picture of the graph of $f(x)$ [the Riemann function], made by A.J. de Meijer, adorns the cover of the notes of the first semester analysis course in Utrecht. In it, the aforementioned differentiability properties at the rational points with not too large denominators can be distinguished quite clearly."
The following is from p. 308: "As for the role of the computer, of course in the old days computer pictures were not available to put one on the track. On the other hand, the mathematical analysis definitely is the more essential part of the story. Without it, one may look at the pictures with equal fascination, but with less understanding."

Figure 1 on p. 90 gives a graph of the Weierstrass function.

(ADDED ABOUT 4 MONTHS LATER)
I recently came across another paper that is old enough and relevant enough to belong to the above list (between [5] and [6]):
Michael Victor Berry and Zinaida V. Lewis, On the Weierstrass-Mandelbrot fractal function, Proceedings of the Royal Society A 370 #1743 (April 1980), 459-484.

This paper gives many computer generated graphs of a variation on the Weierstrass function that the authors call the Weierstrass-Mandelbrot function.
