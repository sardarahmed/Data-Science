Q:

Can abuse break a genius?

Landau was famous for his abusive personality. Are there any examples of his students leaving his tutelage because of that and still achieving great success in physics? Any similar examples with other teachers?
More generally, are there historical examples correlating students' success with teachers' personality at the high end of the spectrum? (I.e., very talented graduate students, very famous professors, success is measured in Nobel Prizes or something similar). 
This question is motivated by the movie Whiplash which justifies the abusive behavior of a teacher by the future success of the student. The idea is that if a student fails to become fanatically driven to the degree that (s)he ignores/survives/enjoys teacher's abuse, then (s)he is no potential genius and his/her departure from the field is no loss to the field and Humanity. Is this idea supported by history?
PS. I tried to expand on the question here (as recommended by a commenter).

A:

If a genius is "broken" at an early stage, we will never know that s/he was a genius.
On the other hand there are abundant positive examples.
For example, Hungarian mathematician Fejer made an important contribution to mathematics himself, but also as a teacher had such students as von Neumann, Erdos, Polya and Turan.
(There was one school in Budapest in the early 20-th century whose graduates are called collectively "Hungarian miracle").
In Russia, in the early 20-th century, there was Luzin who taught in Moscow University.
Perhaps more than 1/2 of the most famous Russian mathematicians were his students or students
of his students.
The most incredible fact of this sort is that Gauss (in  Braunschweig) and Lobachevski (in Kazan) had the same teacher,  Johann Christian Martin Bartels.
So there is no doubt that there is some strong correlation between a teacher personality and his students success.
