Q:

Number theory: a quote

I remember reading a remark on number theory that went something like this: "there is plenty of material in this topic for an $n$ semester course without having to repeat oneself".
Have you read a sentence of this type once? If so, would you be so kind as to tell me where it is that I can find it? Quite possibly, in the version of the quote that I originally read the writer had $n=100$.
Thanks in advance for your help with this little question of mine.
Cheerio!

A:

"It has been estimated that, at the present stage of our knowledge, one could give a
200 semester course on commutative algebra and algebraic geometry without ever
repeating himself." These are the opening lines of the Foreword to Ernst Kunz' book An Introduction to Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry.
