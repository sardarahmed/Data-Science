Q:

Why is the natural logarithm represented by $\ln$?

The natural logarithm is often represented by several different notations:

$\log_e x$
$\log x$ (although this is also used for logarithms with a base of 10)
$\ln x$

It is the third notation that has me wondering. Why is $\ln$ used, and not, say, $\text{nl}$? My two theories about this are

It is an abbreviation for "natural logarithm" in a non-English language
It is meant to correspond with the "$l$" in typical logarithmic notation.

Why is the notation $\ln$?

A:

As far as I am aware, the mathematical operator commonly spelled $\ln$ is an abbreviation of the Latin term,  logarithmus nātūrālis. 
I am not sure who first used this abbreviation, but I suppose it very well may have been Napier.
I remember having seen ln written as an abbreviation of two words in the form $l.n.$ 

A:

According to Earliest Uses of Function Symbols :

$\ln$ (for natural logarithm) was used in 1893 by Irving Stringham (1847-1909) in Uniplanar Algebra (Cajori vol. 2, page 107).

Thnaks to KCd's reference in his comment, we have an earlier occurrence :

Anton Steinhauser, Lehrbuch der Mathematik für höhere Gewerbeschulen (1875), page 277.
