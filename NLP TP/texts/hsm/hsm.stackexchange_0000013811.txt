Q:

How accurate was the measurement of the period of Earth's orbit in the 19th Century?

There was a section on my textbook on history of theories of sun's energy source.
It talks about how the Meteorite Theory was dismissed, as it would decrease the period of Earth's orbit by 2 seconds per year due to increased mass of the Sun.
This theory was dismissed due to disagreeing with observation. And the textbook says the change in period is "easily measurable"
My question is how is 2 seconds difference easily measurable in Nineteenth Century?

A:

Astronomer Norman Lockyer published The Meteoritic Hypothesis in 1890. By then the age of the Earth was known to be at least several hundred million years from geological evidence, and Darwinâ€™s theory of evolution suggested life on Earth originated at least 100 million years ago. A change in the length of the year by 2 seconds a year over 100 million years would make the year over 6 times longer than it is now. It would also mean that 100 million years ago the Earth was over 3 times further away from the Sun than it is now. This would put the Earth between the current orbits of Mars and Jupiter, making it uninhabitable.
