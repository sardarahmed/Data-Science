Q:

Was 'Operation Paperclip' controversial at the time?

With the benefit of hindsight we tend to look back at the the decision to bring ~2000 Nazi Scientists to the US after WW2 with a well deserved level of cynicism. But reading into some of the history it seems as though this was not a remotely controversial decision at its time, both by the political establishment and the scientific community.
On the political side, I am specifically referring to some internal memorandum in the War Department, including the letter sent to Truman by Acheson.
My only evidence for the reaction of the Scientific Community inside of the US (who had just dedicated 5 years to fighting the Nazis), is their loud apathy towards the matter, no one said anything. This is particularly noticeable because many in the Scientific community were proudly anti-Soviet. Any refference to the reaction of scientists during this time would be greatly appreciated.

A:

According to one history that I've read, denazification was done more thoroughly by the former Soviet Union than by the Western powers, although mainly on class lines. The Weatern Powers were concerned more with the growing 'threat' of communism hence it's likely Operation Paperclip was seen as non-controversial as they saw it simply as harnessing German scientific expertise.
