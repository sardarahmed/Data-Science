Q:

In which 1644 publication did Pietro Mengoli first pose the Basel Problem?

I find numerous claims that the Basel Problem was first posed by Pietro Mengoli in 1644. However, I am unable to find even the name of the publication (or book or letter) in which this was supposedly done.
I am hoping someone will help me.
(My suspicion is that this might be an academic urban legend. Mengoli would have been 18 years old in 1644 and the earliest publication I can find of his is his 1650 Novae quadraturae arithmeticae.)

Related question: Where (if at all) in Novae quadraturae arithmeticae (1650) does Mengoli pose the Basel Problem? (Unfortunately I don't know any Latin and there doesn't seem to be any translation of this work.)

Below is a list of references claiming that Mengoli first posed the Basel Problem in 1644.
All fail to cite the name of the avenue in which he did so.
And only two even bother citing anything at all for their claim. One (Mathworld) does so to another book on this list, while the other's (Benko, 2012) citations are incorrect.

Benko (2012) incorrectly cites (i) William Dunham who does not give any specific year (Euler: The Master of Us All, 1999, p. 42); and (ii) Julian Havil who gives the year of 1650 and does not mention 1644 (2003, Gamma: Exploring Euler's Constant, p. 38).

A:

André Weil, in his article Prehistory of the Zeta-Function, only mentions Mengoli's Novae quadraturae arithmeticae as the source of the problem. However, the year 1644 also appears there. In that year, Torricelli published his De dimensione parabolae, in which he states that, given a sequence $(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb{Z}^+}$, we always have$$a_0=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(a_i-a_{i+i})+a_n$$and$$\sum_{i=0}^\infty(a_i-a_{i+i})=a_0-\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n.\tag1$$Mengoli, in his book, used $(1)$ to prove that the series$$\sum_{i=0}^\infty\frac2{(i+1)(i+2)}$$converges. But this is the series of the reciprocals of the triangular numbers. Then, Mengoli expressed “his wonderment at the fact that the reciprocals of the ‘triangular numbers’ can be summed, but not those of the ‘square numbers’.” Perhaps that it's from this that the year 1644 came to be mentioned in this context.
