Q:

Abbreviated Notation for Groups, Rings and Fields

Groups, Rings and Fields are often referred to by the set involved without mention of the operation(s). For example, the "group (G,+)" may be called the "group G".
When did this practice originate and why?
It seems the labour saved in writing "G" instead of "(G,+)" (for example) is trivial compared with the loss of clarity and precision so I wonder what other reasons there could be? 

A:

The shift seems quite recent.
For the "short" writing, see some "old" Algebra's textbook, like:

Bartel van der Waerden, Modern Algebra, Vol.I (1949 - or.ed.1930-31): page 11 for groups and page 38 for rings;
Nicolas Bourbaki, Elements of Mathematics. Algebra I: Chapters 1-3 (1998 - or.ed.1970), page 30:

Definition 1. A set with an associative law of composition, possessing an identity element and under which every element is invertible, is called a group. 
  [...] If $G$ and $H$ are two groups, ... 

Garrett Birkhoff & Saunders Mac Lane, A Survey of Modern Algebra (4th ed - 1977), page 133:

Definition. A group $G$ is a system of elements with a binary operation 
  which ...

From the '90s, we can see the "new wave" emerging: 

Saunders Mac Lane & Garrett Birkhoff, Algebra (3rd ed 1991), page 43:

A group $G$ is a set $G$ together with a binary operation...,

but see page 85:

A ring $R=(K,+,∙,1)$ is a set $R$ with two binary operations...

and :

David Dummit & Richard Foote, Abstract algebra (3ed - 2004), page 16:

A group is an ordered pair $(G,∙)$ where $G$ is a set ...
