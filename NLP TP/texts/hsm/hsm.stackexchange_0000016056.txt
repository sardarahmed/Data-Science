Q:

Which geometer first compared a length (one dimensional) to an area (two dimensional)?

What are sources placing a length (one dimensional) in proportion to an area (two dimensional)?
The Greek geometers compared quantities of the same dimension: e.g. the area of a circle is in proportion to the area of a square with the radius as the side.
Descartes was to my knowledge the first to compare quantities of different dimensions: Segment $AB$ is in proportion to $XY$ as $PQ \cdot RS$ is to $TU$.
What examples of there of people saying, e.g.

Consider a line $OB$ and a curve.  For any point $C$ on the curve, drop the perpendicular from $C$ to $BO$, and call its foot $C'$.  The curve has the property that at any point $C$, the length $CC'$ [one dimensional] is in direct proportion to the area of a square with side $OC'$ [two dimensional] if and only if the curve is a parabola whose vertex is the point of tangency to $O$.

or any other type of proportion or equation between different dimensions (length, area, volume)?
Obviously this is common place in calculus.  I'm looking for examples of where this idea developed, as it seems totally absent from classic geometry.

A:

Al Khwarizmi, one of the first written sources of the general solution to quadratics, does exactly that:

I observed that the numbers which are required in calculating by Completion and Reduction are of three kinds, namely, roots, squares, and simple numbers relative to neither root nor square.
A root is any quantity which is to be multiplied by itself, consisting of units, or numbers ascending, or fractions descending.
A square is the whole amount of the root multiplied by itself.
A simple number is any number which may be pronounced without reference to root or square.

In doing so, if I understand correctly, he seems to "upshift" length into area, by equating a length $x$ to an area $x \times 1$:

If my reading is correct, then Al Khwarizmi, besides solving the quadratic, helped lay a foundation for analytic geometry and calculus, which depend on being able to compare e.g. the rate of change of $x^2$ compared to rate of change of $x$.  This was unthinkable to the Greeks, but Al Khwarizmi seems to have opened the door.

A similar comment is made here:

Thus, Islamic mathematics allowed, and
indeed encouraged at variance with the Greek tradition...
the simultaneous manipulations of magnitudes of different dimensions as part of the solution of an individual problem. Thus... the solution of a quadratic
equation is a “number”, rather than a “line segment” or an “area”... this approach was fundamental in developing a more abstract and
general conception of number, which eventually became essential for the creation of a
full-fledged abstract idea of an equation.
