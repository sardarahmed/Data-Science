Q:

Did John von Neumann solve any unsolved problem in mathematics?

I have searched and examined legendary stories of the problem-solving skills of von Neumann in mathematics.

With George Polya

With Dantzig

Maybe there are other stories showing that he is a great problem-solver, but I think these two are well-known.
I know that he wrote many papers in pure mathematics (mostly developing new concepts), but with his talented problem-solving skills, didn't he write any paper on solving unsolved problems in mathematics? Maybe I haven't searched enough?
Just because he was not interested in publishing a paper on that subject?
Or, even for him, it is not easy solving problems that are worthy of publishing. What are your thoughts?

A:

John von Neumann (partially) solved Hilbert's fifth problem.
Plus: he is one of those that contributed to solving Russell's paradox by building the axioms of maths.

A:

One guess: There was a question from physics on how to formulate quantum mechanics.  Von Neumann proposed doing it using operators on Hilbert space. (1927-1929)
