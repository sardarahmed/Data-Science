Q:

Did Cyrano de Bergerac's space ship have retro-rockets?

In this answer I cite and quote some surprising information; that the real Cyrano de Bergerac (not the one in the play) had written of using a rocket ship to go to the Moon circa 1650.
As strange as it sounds, I'm asking if Cyrano de Bergerac's conceptualization of a space ship include retro-rockets, or at least some propulsive method to decelerate (slow down)?

A:

Hard to say, seeing as his little essay about going to the moon was almost certainly a combination of fantasy and satire.  Consider his landing:

After falling a long time, or so I presume, the violence of my fall
  having kept me from noticing it, the next thing I can recall is
  finding myself under a tree, tangled in three or four rather thick
  branches that I had shattered by my fall, with my face smeared with an
  apple that had smashed into it.
