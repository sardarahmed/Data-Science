Q:

How did scientists know how to build spacecraft before we got them into space?

Surely the scientists working on (un)manned spaceflight understood the concept of the earth having an upper level to its atmosphere, but how were they able to determine what exactly the physics of space were, before a spacecraft had ever made it out of the atmosphere?
Issues such as:

space is a vacuum
traveling at incredibly high speeds while in orbit (due to low friction)
atmospheric reentry
etc

must have been hard to figure out without some sort of actual testing.  Was it simply trial and error?

A:

I'll expand a little bit my "oracolar" comment above (with less fun) :

They have studied physics and mathematics, and physics and mathematics, and ...

There was "explorations" of "outer layers" of atmosphere with balloons.
There ware the "experiments" made with rockets (mainly German) used during WW II.
But mainly, there were faith in the immense power of newtonian mechanics (and mathematics) to predict the correct behaviour of bodies subject to the "law of motion". 
With insight, space travel (think about a 10 years travel of a little "spacecraft" able to "land" on a comet after a journey of millions of km) has been - for me - the "paradigmatic" cased of verification (if any) of a scientific theory.
I mean : we can speculate about skepticism, philosophical realism and any other kind of "mental experiment" about the reality of the world "out there".
But, if we are able to compute a ten years long trajcetory with this precision... this means that the theory is definitively correct.

If you can spray them, then they are real.
