Q:

History of the inverse matrix

I know the definition and the procedure to calculate the inverse of a matrix, but I want to know the history of starting the idea of an inverse matrix. mathematicians must have faced a real life situation which compelled them to invent the inverse matrix. What was the situation?

A:

Cayley defines the inverse $M^{-1}$ of a matrix in the very same note Remarques sur la notation des fonctions alg√©briques (1855) where he first introduces matrix multiplication. He emphasizes the fact that a linear system $Mx = \xi$ is then solved by $x = M^{-1}\xi$, and that seems motivation enough for him. Here, $x,\xi\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $M\in GL(n,\mathbb{R})$.
Same thing when he later expounds the theory in A memoir on the theory of matrices (1858).
