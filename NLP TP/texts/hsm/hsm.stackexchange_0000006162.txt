Q:

Absolute space and time before Newton

Why is so much emphasis put on the concepts of absolute space and time as the grand foundations of Newtonian mechanics, and not as foundations also of previous theories, as for example Kepler's laws of planetary motion, or even the ancient Ptolemaic system?
Is not the concept of universal force Newton's main contribution, and not the concepts of absolute space and time?

A:

Newton was not the first to conceive of the notion of absolute space. The Stoics, John Philoponus in particular, and the medieval physicist Bishop Nicole Oresme (1320-1382) conceived of it. For the quote from Bishop Oresme's Traite du ciel et du monde illustrating this, see pp. 264-266 of Pierre Duhem's Medieval Cosmology: Theories of Infinity, Place, Time, Void, and the Plurality of Worlds.

A:

Max Jammer has an original theory which should be treated cautiously. In his book Concepts of Space, (Einstein wrote a preface for it) he argues that Newton's absolute space is a notion of religious origin. It is an attribute of the absolute deity, an argument that was made visible in the controversy Leibniz-Clarke about space being the "sensorium dei". He traces back the idea to early theology but that is no more 'history of science'. Such more or less mystic ideas are not uncommon during the Renaissance  and Jammer also comments some of them.
