Q:

How did human beings come to realize the concept of counting numbers?

Human beings keeping count is as old as recorded history; however, how did humans first think about keeping documentation and counting numbers? Is there any defined period in history where numbers were written about, where early scholars and scientists discoursed about the origins of counting? Specifically, how did we as a species come to realize that counting is possible and useful in everyday life?

A:

The simple answer is that we don't know how human beings came to realize the concept of counting numbers. The discovery of counting is lost in prehistory. Most likely humans are born with the capacity to count, given that scientists have established that other species like apes or parrots can count. This would be the numerical analogue to Chomsky's notion of an innate grammar.
