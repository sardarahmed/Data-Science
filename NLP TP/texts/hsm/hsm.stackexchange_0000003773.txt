Q:

Classification of experimentally-determined physics laws?

Has anyone classified (or attempted to classify) all the experimentally-determined laws of physics, such as with a simple diagram or even in a full-length book?
Doing an "experimental physics" subject search on WorldCat doesn't reveal much.

A:

A History of Mechanics, by Dugas (1955) is available from Dover; Part V is an introduction to Quantum Theory.  Some experiments are discussed, but it is mostly a scholarly discussion of ideas and how they evolved over time, with proper references, as explained by a trained engineer and historian of science.
The scope is well described by the preface and table of contents. Dugas references earlier compilers, and more detailed works of scholarship.
History of electromagnetism is a Wikipedia resource, providing references. 
Scholarpedia provides an open-access, peer reviewed Encyclopedia: Physics, which could keep you busy for a few years, or decades.  The content is intended to be "a living review" of each topic; it is not intended to provide a history of physics, but rather, the current state of it.
