Q:

Does Euclid's Elements acknowledge a concept of 0, either directly or indirectly?

From what I understand Euclid avoided infinity, and so I'm wondering how Euclid might have dealt with the concept of 0 in the Elements.

A:

He did not. There is no reference to $0$ in the Elements. As a matter of fact, for Euclid even $1$ was not a number. For him, the numbers are $2,3,4,\ldots$

A:

The arithmetic books of Elements are books VII - IX.
Euclid begins book VII with his definition of number:

A number is a multitude composed of units.

(This is taken from the Pythagorean notion of number.)
Since "zero" is not a multitude of units it does not satisfy Euclid's definition of number.  Euclid did not consider "one" to be a number for the same reason.  However, Euclid appears to have been somewhat ambivalent on this point and did treat the unit as a number on those occasions when it helped in stating a general proposition or proving them.  For example, Euclid's famous proof (IX.20) that there are infinitely many prime numbers.
