Q:

Who is Wanner from Rosenrock-Wanner (ROW) methods?

I've spent some time with a search engine trying to find out about Wanner, a person whose surname is mentioned in the name of Rosenbrock-Wanner (ROW) methods primarily used for iteratively solving stiff differential equations, but without much success.
Does anyone know who this person is/was, and the full name of this person?
I apologize if my question does not belong here. In this case please suggest where it can be posted.

A:

According to Wikipedia, it is the Austrian mathematician Gerhard Wanner.
