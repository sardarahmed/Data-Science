Q:

History and origin of the Iso-, Sec-, Tert- and Neo- prefixes?

I have studied the prefixes "Iso-", "Sec-", "Tert-" and "Neo-" for a long time in chemistry but wonder where they originate from i.e. where is the place (the paper or the journal) that they first appeared in the form that they are used today in modern-chemistry.
About the prefixes of "Neo-" and "Iso-", the earliest appearance of them I could find is by William Odling in his paper in 1876 cited below:

Altogether, however, the names which call to mind that the normal, iso-, and neo-acids are mono-, di-, and trimethyl &c. derivatives would seem to be most advantageous. [1]
[1] Odling, W. (1876). Formulation of Paraffins and their
Derivatives.
The London, Edinburgh and Dublin philosophical magazine and journal of science, ser.5:v.1 (Jan-June), 216.

Now, about the prefixes of "Sec-" and "Tert-", I could not find any definitive appearance of them (in the way we use them today) on any resource like - Wikipedia or OED. However, I did find the use of the words "tertiary" and "secondary" as they are used in modern-chemistry in several old sources dating back to the late 1800's. [2][3][4]

[2] Meyer, V. & Lecco, M. (1876). Zur Constitution der
Ammo-niumverbindungen.
Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft , 8(2), 936-938.

auf secundäre aromatische
Amine.
Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft , 31(2), 2523-2541.
[4] Fischer, E. (1890). Synthese des
Traubenzuckers.
Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft , 23(1), 799-805.

So, I want to ask about the first occurrence of these prefixes as used in modern-chemistry and if the sources I provided and searched on have any relation to the history and origin of these prefixes.

A:

OED, The unabridged Oxford English Dictionary has the earliest reference to your query.
tertiary
Applied to compounds regarded as being derived from ammonia by replacement of three hydrogen atoms by organic radicals, and to derivatives of such compounds; also extended to analogous derivatives of other elements, esp. phosphorus. [The sense is due to Gerhardt & Chiozza, who used French tertiaire (Compt. Rend. (1853) XXXVII. 88).]
Applied to organic compounds other than amines, etc. (see sense A.1b.i) in which the characteristic functional group is located on a saturated carbon atom which is itself bonded to three other carbon atoms. [Applied originally to alcohols by H. Kolbe, who used German tertiär (Ann. der Chem. u. Pharm. (1864) CXXXII. 104).]
secondary
Applied to compounds regarded as being derived from ammonia (†or water) by replacement of two hydrogen atoms by organic radicals (cf. primary adj. A.II.18b); also extended to analogous derivatives of other elements, esp. phosphorus. [The sense is due to Gerhardt & Chiozza, who used French secondaire (Compt. Rend. (1853) XXXVII. 88).]
Applied to organic compounds other than amines, etc. (see sense A.3l.i) in which the characteristic functional group is located on a saturated carbon atom which is itself bonded to two other carbon atoms. [Applied originally to alcohols by H. Kolbe, who used German secundär (Ann. der Chem. u. Pharm. (1864) CXXXII. 102).]
