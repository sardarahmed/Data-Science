Q:

The first of Fermat's last theorem

A simple question(s):
When and by who was Fermat's famous conjecture (proved by Wiles et al.) called his "last theorem"? Was the original motivation the same as is given nowadays, that this would be the last-proved of his theorems?
It is interesting that so many accounts of its history were written which did not really mention the issue of its relatively mysterious naming.

A:

My guess is that it was G. Lam√©:
Memoire sur le dernier theoreme de Fermat
C.R. Acad. Sci. Paris, 9, 1839, 45-46.
