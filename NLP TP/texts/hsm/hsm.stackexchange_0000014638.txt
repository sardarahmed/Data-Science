Q:

Who was N.M. Stephens who refuted the Stronger Feit-Thompson Conjecture?

The Stronger Feit-Thompson conjecture states that:

There exist no distinct prime numbers $p$ and $q$ such that:
$\dfrac {p^q - 1} {p - 1}$ and $\dfrac {q^p - 1} {q - 1}$
are not coprime.

This was refuted by N.M. Stephens in July 1971 who published On the Feit-Thompson Conjecture in Mathematics of Computation volume 25 no. 115 (p. 625) where he showed that for $p = 17$ and $q = 3313$, the above expressions have the common prime factor $112 \, 643$.
The Wikipedia article Feit–Thompson conjecture suggests his first name might have been Nelson, but I have been unable to corroborate this.
Does anyone have any biographical details about N.M. Stephens?

A:

I’m Nelson Stephens’ daughter. He was born on 6th May 1941 and was a Professor of Mathematics at the University of London. He passed away on 8th January 2024. Not sure I can be much help on the maths but very cool to see what an impact he had :)

A google search for [Stephens + On the Feit-Thompson Conjecture" led me to an online copy of the paper, and the bottom of the first page of this paper gives Stephens' affiliation at that time as "Atlas Computer Laboratory".
A google-books search for "Stephens, Nelson" + "Atlas Computer Laboratory" led to a snippet view of the London Mathematical Society's "List of Members" for 1972 that shows the full entry of Stephen's entry:

STEPHENS, NELSON MALCOLM, B.Sc., Ph.D.; Joint Research Fellow, Atlas Computer Laboratory; Pembroke College, Oxford. [1966

A google-books search for "Stephens, Nelson Malcolm" gives several hits, and in particular shows that Donald E. Knuth gave Stephens' full name in one of Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming volumes AND a snippet view of the London Mathematical Society's "List of Members" for 1976 that shows the full entry of Stephen's entry:

STEPHENS, NELSON MALCOLM, B.Sc., Ph.D.; University College, Cardiff CFI IXL [1966

A google search for "Nelson Malcolm Stephens" shows some Pembroke College Records for 1970, 1971, 1972 that are accessible online.
With this information in hand you can try various other search words/phrases, such as "Nelson M Stephens" + "Manchester", for items missed by the previous searches.
