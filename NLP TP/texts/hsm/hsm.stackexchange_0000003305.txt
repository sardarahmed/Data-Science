Q:

When or why & who originated this puzzle, $0.999... = 1$

The problem is the infinite or endless repeated digits of $9's$ after zero digit and the decimal notation,
Despite its apparent simplicity & the huge talk about it every where in mathematics or scientific community, one wonders if it is of all that importance,
What its background, Is it settled as being equal to one or meaningless, how can this problem affects mathematics, 
How many proofs or disproofs for this puzzle?   
My question is a bet different in the sense of its absolute legend truthiness, where one may easily spot the illusion in its absolute truthiness by means of approximation, limits, ambiguous use of infinity, convergence, famous cuts, ...etc,
where all these tools are good for calculating approximately (also in our own sense only), the area of a circle for example, but the exactness sense in mathematics doesn't require any kind of approximation, it doesn't consider terms being large as $10^n$ or being little as $10^-n$ when $n$ tends to infinity, it consider them existing, regardless of our own needs or sense 
To illustrate further, if we define the accuracy of approximating $pi$ by how many digits can be obtained,(instead of area of a circle of radius one), then all the formulas of $ pi $ are useless    

A:

One of the earliest places where an infinite string of 9s is rounded off to a finite string is Euler's text on algebra around 1777.  Here he gets the answer 9.999... and makes a comment that this is virtually indistinguishable from 10.  That was one of the earliest places as I mentioned.  Conifold found an earlier source (see comment above).
