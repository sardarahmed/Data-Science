Q:

Is there an archive of Andre Weil's papers?

Most specifically I wonder if there is any chance that he kept the notebooks he refers to in his autobiography.  Probably he did not.  But Gauss kept his diary....

A:

Casey Westerman, archivist at the IAS in Princeton, advises that André Weil's papers are held at the Institut de France Académie des Sciences.

In addition, the Bibliothèque nationale de France holds Simone Weil's papers including her correspondence with André.
