Q:

Why did John Napier use logós ‘ratio’, to coin "logarithm"?

I agree that logarithms are numbers, and Napier chose arithmós reasonably. But why did Napier pick Greek logós ‘ratio’? I don't see a ratio in this definition of the logarithm in James Stewart, Calculus 2011 7e (not the Early Transcendentals version), p 404.

logarithm [17]

Greek lógos had a remarkably
wide spread of meanings, ranging from ‘speech,
saying’ to ‘reason, reckoning, calculation’, and
‘ratio’. The more ‘verbal’ end of its spectrum has
given English the suffixes -logue and -logy (as in
dialogue, tautology, etc), while the ‘reasoning’
component has contributed logic [14] (from the
Greek derivative logiké), logistic [17] (from the
Greek derivative logistikós ‘of calculation’), and
logarithm, coined in the early 17th century by
the English mathematician John Napier from
Greek logós ‘ratio’ and arithmós ‘number’
(source of English arithmetic [13]).

I don't know if zbeckabee's quotation here matches Napier's rationale.

It comes from the Greek words 'logos' and 'arithmes.' The second word means 'number'. The first word has a broad range of meanings, starting from 'word' or 'speech' (thus our word 'dialog'), going into 'thought' and 'reason' (thus 'logical'), and on to 'proportion'. In this range of meanings, it resembles the Latin 'ratio', which means both 'reason' and 'proportion' (thus the two meanings of 'rational': reasonable, and expressable as a ratio or proportion of two integers).

Thus, a 'logarithm' is a 'proportion number'. I suppose the thinking was that logarithms help in the calculation of proportions. Instead of multiplying a number by a fraction, you just add or subtract the logarithm of the fraction to the logarithm of the number.

Your specific question is

I don't see a ratio in this definition of the logarithm in James Stewart, [...]

The ratio is implicit in that definition, but it is explicit in the change of base formula
$$ \log_a(x) = \ln(x)/\ln(a) $$
which equates a logarithm to a given base to the quotient (or ratio) of
natural logarithms. In fact, logarithms to a given base are exactly similar
to measurement of a quantity in a given unit of measure. That is, they are
the ratio of a given quantity relative to the unit quantity. That is how
you can conceptualize logarithms as the relative ratio of the growth rate
of two geometric progressions. One based on the given growth rate and the
other based on the standard unit growth rate. For example, the geometric
progression $\,1,a^2,a^4,a^6,\dots\,$ grows at twice the rate of the
geometric progression $\,1,a,a^2,a^3,\dots\,$ in the sense that the
first takes $\,1/2\,$ as many steps to grow to a given size than the other.
This interpretation agrees with the result $\,\log_a(a^2) = 2.\,$
