Q:

Why second-order logic?

Wikipedia says: First-order logic quantifies only variables that range over individuals (elements of the domain of discourse); second-order logic, in addition, also quantifies over relations. For example, the second-order sentence ${\displaystyle \forall P\,\forall x(x\in P\lor x\notin P)} \forall P\,\forall x(x\in P\lor x\notin P)$.
Who has first published this doctrin? And why has it been accepted?

A:

Modern logic began with Boole, Peirce and Frege.
Frege's system (1879) was the first "fully formalized" system of mathematical logic and was a Second- and Higher-order system of Predicate Logic: quantification over predicate of any order was allowed.
Subsequently, the first modern math lofic textbook: Hilbert & Ackermann's Grundz√ºge der Theoretischen Logik (1928) codified the distinction between first-order: quantification over individuals but not predicates, and second- and higher-order.
