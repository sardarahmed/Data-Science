Q:

Two articles of Poincaré

In Jammer's book Concepts of Simultaneity on page 108, there is a reference to two of Poincaré's papers:

"...his 1904 lecture on St. Louis..."
"...his contribution to the Lorentz Festschrift."

Unfortunately there is no bibliography in the book, and an internet search does not reveal anything. How can I find a pdf of these papers?
PS: I am not sure if such bibliography type of questions are welcome here. But given the importance of the persons involved and the historical importance of the topic, I guess it can be tolerated.

A:

Poincare's lecture given during the 1904 World's Fair was published in 1906. 
The Lorentz Festschrifft talk is discussed in this paper, which has a footnote to the original published version, and a translation:
Poincaré, Henri, "La théorie de Lorentz et le principe de réaction", Archives
néerlandaises des sciences exactes et naturelles. Recueil de travaux offerts par les
auteurs à H. A. Lorentz (The Hague: Nijhoff) Ser II, 1900, 5, pp. 252-278. See my
discussion of Poincaré and his work on the violation of the principle of reaction in
Lorentz's electron theory: Granek, Galina, "Poincaré’s Contributions to Relativistic
Dynamics", Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics 31, 2000, pp. 15-
48.
When looking for items like this include more terms: e.g., "Poincare Lorentz Festschrifft".  The paper that is linked above show up first in the list.
