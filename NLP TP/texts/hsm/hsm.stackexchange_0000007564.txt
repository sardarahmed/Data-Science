Q:

From a historical perspective why is beta decay associated with an anti neutrino instead of a neutrino?

I know it sounds like a silly question but didn't both Pauli and Fermi hint at Beta decay missing a particle to carry away a small amount of it's energy or mass but why is this an anti neutrino ?
The neutrino was not actually discovered some years latter so how was the Beta decay dubbed with the anti neutrino? 

A:

Only after the neutrino's discovery did we come up with the concept of lepton number (based on the unexpected multiple lepton families), which warranted reclassifying "that other thing emitted in beta emission", which was how we originally defined the word neutrino, as an antineutrino. Ironically, there's still an outside chance the neutrino is its own antiparticle anyway.
