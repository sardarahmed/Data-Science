Q:

Historical examples of "pseudoscience" becoming "science"

What are some historical examples of theories/ideas that were initially labeled "pseudoscience" and later considered legitimate "science"? I don't mean theories or ideas that were initially not accepted or ignored and later accepted, but things that were derided as pseudoscientific (and labeled as such) but then either evidence or new theories eventually made them considered "science." Something akin to the hypothetical where "dowsing" was suddenly given a mechanistic and experimental basis that convinced the scientific community to accept it as "real science" (or similarly for parapsychic powers).

For a long while it was widely believed that the main cause of peptic ulcer disease was stress or spicy food. When the theory arose that it was in fact usually an infection this was rejected by the medical establishment. The Greek physician John Lykoudis was in fact fined for his treatment of patients with antibiotics. Subsequent work by Australian scientists identified the bacterium responsible Helicobacter pylori and they were awarded the Nobel for their work. A full timeline is available on Wikipedia. It is far too long to summarise here.

It seems ball lightning was disbelieved by scientists until around 1960.  See Wikipedia .
I knew a geologist who told us how his eye-witness account of ball lightning had been ridiculed.  He had learned not to mention it when he interviewed for jobs as a professor of geology.

A:

Plate tectonics
It was put forth by a meterologist, and offered no explanation how, given the solid crust and mantle, the continents could drift about like icebergs on the liquid core.
The discovery of processes by which a solid surface could indeed drift about took decades, but finally triumphed.
