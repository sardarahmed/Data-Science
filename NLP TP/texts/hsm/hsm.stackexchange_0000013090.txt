Q:

Why is there no notation for tetration similar to summation?

I noticed that we use $\sum$ and $\prod$ for summation and infinite product (I don't know why it does not have a name like the other two), but we use different looking notation for tetration. Is there some sort of historical reason why not, or did no-one just do it.

A:

Mostly, it comes down to usefulness.
Pick up any mathematics textbook more advanced than elementary arithmetic, and you're probably going to find summation in there somewhere (it's especially common in statistics).  Iterated multiplication is less common, having fewer real-world applications, but it's a natural counterpart to summation.
Tetration?  It's rarely seen outside of number theory and pop-science articles.
There's also the matter of age: sigma notation dates back to Euler, who first used it around 1755, and the concept itself is considerably older.  Pi notation is more elusive, but appears to date to the early-mid 1800s.  In contrast, tetration appears to date back no further than 1901, with most work being post-1950.
