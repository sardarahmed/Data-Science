Q:

What are some of the most important scientific works done that have not received a Nobel prize?

Many of the 'famous' papers in the scientific community have resulted in Nobel prizes, but certainly that represents only a small fraction of notably important papers throughout scientific history. What are some of the most famous/important non-Nobel prize winning papers/scientific-works?

A:

Here are some prominent examples of unrecognized discoveries; the actual publications should be easily findable online. Note that I've only included omitted discoveries, not omitted individuals (such as Lise Meitner's omission for nuclear fission, or Chien-Shiung Wu's for parity conservation). I've also only included work whose inventor was still alive when the Nobels were around (so no Newton!).
