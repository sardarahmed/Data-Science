Q:

When/Why did Septagon change to Heptagon?

I graduated high school in 1980, and as a second career, am helping HS students with their math. I just finished my 6th year of this, and have just one question about the change noted in the title. 
I recall Septagon, Octagon, Nonagon, Decagon, being figures with sides numbering 7,8,9,10. As a child, I noted that these prefixes reflected those of the last 4 months on the calendar. From this a teacher explained that the calendar months got shifted around, and that at one time September thru December were, in, fact, months 7-10. 
A few years ago, I ran into a seven sided figure and a student telling me it was a Heptagon. I do understand that Sept is Latin and Hept is Greek, but would like to know when and more important, why, this change was made. 

A:

It is only a recent mistake.
See : Anthony Lo Bello, Origins of mathematical words (John Hopkins UP, 2013),

Septagon This vox nullius is a learned mistake for heptagon. People of some education make a certain type of error not committed by the multitude, and this word is an example of one such mistake, viz., the confusion of languages. Knowing that they need a foreign word for seven, they take the familiar Latin word instead of the required but unfamiliar Greek word and concoct the hybrid septagon on the analogy of the common term pentagon. Related absurdities are automobile, homosexual, neuroscience, sociopath, television, etc. Any such word may be immediately identified as modern. The word septagon appears in
  Herstein’s Topics in Algebra (first edition, 1964) on pages 190 and 341, an example of a mathematical Homer nodding. It was corrected to heptagon on page 242 of Abstract Algebra, Macmillan, New York, 1986.

See Tripod : Heptagon : In 1551 in Pathway to Knowledge Robert Recorde used septangle. Heptagon appears in English in 1570 in Sir Henry Billingsley’s translation of Euclid’s Elements.
