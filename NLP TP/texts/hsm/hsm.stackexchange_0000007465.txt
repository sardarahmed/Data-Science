Q:

In history of algebra, who was the first to add one equation to another equation?

In history of algebra, who was the first to add one equation to another equation? Someone gave me the name of an Italian mathematician of Renaissance period, but I lost the email. I wish to make it a bit more precise: adding two equations (hence involving unknowns), not just equalities: the latter was apparently dealt with by Euclid.

A:

For sure, the technique was used by Leonhard Euler (15 April 1707 – 18 September 1783).
See : Elements of Algebra (English transl., 1822), page 208:

Since the two equations are,

$x+y=a$, and
$x-y=b$;

if we add the one to the other, we have $2x=a+b$.

The first German edition of the Elements was in 1770.

An earlier example seems to be in Gerolamo Cardano (24 September 1501 – 21 September 1576)'s Ars Magna (1545), but we have to consider that we are reading a modern English translation: the original Latin text can be quite different (see Caput IX (page 21)).
