Q:

Who discovered the Jordan normal form?

In the paper by A. J. Coleman, "The greatest mathematical paper of all time"
(Math Intelligencer, 11, no. 3 (1989), 29-39), on page 30 there is a passing remark
that the "Jordan form is due to Weierstrass". Can anyone give a reference
to Weierstrass's publications or to a history source that discusses this? 

A:

According to the following linked text, Weierstrass defined his equivalent form in a memoir presented to the Berlin Academy in 1868, two years prior to Jordan's Traite being published.
From Bartel L van der Waerden's A History of Algebra :

On the history of Jordan Normal Forms, see Thomas Hawkins "Weierstrass and the Theory of Matrices" Archive for History of Exact Sciences 17, p 119-163 (1977).  In section four of this paper, Hawkins shows that Weierstrass, in his theory of Elementary Divisors, has already defined a normal form equivalent to that of Jordan.  Weierstrass presented his fundamental memoir "Zur Theorie der bilinearen und quadratischen Formen" to the Berlin Academy in 1868 (Monatsberichte, p. 311-338 = Werke 2, p.19-44) two years before the publication of Jordan's Traite.
