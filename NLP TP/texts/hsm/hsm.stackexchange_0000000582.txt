Q:

Where had Alexander Grothendieck been all this time?

Recently, I heard that the great Grothendieck has passed away (RIP). But until last year I've been aware that he is lost from the world. So how could they figure out his death? My resources on this brilliant man are too small. Any resource would be appreciated!

A:

He was not "lost" in the first place; it is just that he lived a very private life after his retirement. The general public did not know where he was exactly but it was not at all that he was a missing person or something along these lines. 
He died in a hospital, more precisely at l’hôpital de Saint-Girons (Ariège), in the south of France, near the French-Spanish boarder. This is also the general region that was named all the time for his location. Thus, the answer to the question where he was is in Ariège.  
I have no information how he spent his last days, and who exactly communicated his death to the general public (and I am rather unsure this is relevant here), but the fact that he died in a hospital in a highly developed country that was moreover his home-country, shows that there is no mystery at all about his death having become known.   
Source: the obituary of Grothendieck in the major French newspaper Liberation mentioned the place of his death.
