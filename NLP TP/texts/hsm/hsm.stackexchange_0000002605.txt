Q:

The terminologies "Adjoint" and "Adjugate"

The adjoint of a matrix is also called the adjugate. 
However, the word "adjoint" is also used in Linear Algebra for linear transformations, and the "adjoint of a matrix" and "adjoint of a linear map" are very different notions. 
Question 1: For matrices, which word was used first - "adjoint" or "adjugate" (can one give a historical reference)?
Question 2: Can one give the historical reference for the identity 
$$A\, \mathrm{adj}(A)=\mathrm{det}(A)I$$

A:

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first use of the word 'adjugate' is by CL Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) Proc. Roy Soc 15(1866) at p. 151. He says "In doing so I shall use the word "adjugate" in the following sense:-if there be a square block, and is a new block be formed, such that each of its terms is the determinant of the complemental minor of the corresponding term of the first block, the second block is said to be adjugate to the first" (italics in original).  I take his use of inverted commas to be an admission that he is defining a new word.
