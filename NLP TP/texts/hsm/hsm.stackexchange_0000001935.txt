Q:

How and where was the notion of a primitive root formulated before Gauss?

Gauss credits Euler (and I think some others) with having known of the existence of primitive roots. How did these predecessors of Gauss formulate the notion of a primitive root without a concept of congruence? In what works, and in what context? In particular, since the notion of a primitive root seems quite unnatural to me if you don't have a notion of congruence (I mean, the shortest definition I can think of is "A number $a$ such that for every possible remainder $r$ there is an integer $n$ such that $a^n$ is $r$ more than a multiple of $p$"), what led Euler and other pre-Gaussian mathematicians to consider such a concept?

A:

According to Dickson's history book Lambert in 1769 was the first to grasp the concept by claiming that for any prime $p$ there was a number $g$ such that $g^{p-1}-1$ was divisible by $p$, but  $g^e-1$ was not for any $0<e<p-1$. Euler coined the term "primitive root" in 1773 when he attempted to prove Lambert's claim in 1773, but his proof had a flaw. He also listed primitive roots for primes up to 41, but noted that he had no general way of finding them. Lagrange gave a result about polynomials in 1777 that fills the gap, and Lagrange in 1785 connected primitive roots to roots of unity, where the concept arises very naturally. 
Gauss himself was partly motivated by roots of unity since he wanted to prove that certain polygons were constructible when a primitive root of unity could be expressed using only square roots. Gauss only defined congruences in their modern form in Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (completed in 1798 but published only in 1801), where he gave two proofs of their existence for primes.
