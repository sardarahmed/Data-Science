Q:

Who was the first scientist who calculated with physical quantities?

Newton changed the way we look at physics by giving a simple rules such like:
F=ma
In these equation we don't count with specific numbers, we are only stating what are the dependences.
Who was the truly first scientist who counted only with dependences of one factor on another?

A:

Newton's formulation of his II Law of Motion into the Principia is not "symbolic"; see:

Sir Isaac Newton's Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy and His System of the World, Andrew Motte's translation (1729) revised by Florian Cajori (1934), page 13.

The first "algebraic" formulation of Newton's law of motion is due to:

Leonhard Euler, Decouverte d'un nouveau principe de Mecanique (1752), page 196:

XXII. [...] after having decomposed all the forces acting on the body into the three perpendicular components $P, Q, R$ [...] the movement of the body will be described by the three following formulae:
$$I. \ \ 2M ddx=P dt^2 \ \ \ II. \ \ 2M ddy=Q dt^2 \ \ \ III. \ \ 2M ddz=R dt^2.$$

An early example of dependency between physical magnitudes is Aristotle (wrong) law of motion:

If, then, $A$ is the mover, $B$ the moved, $C$ the distance moved, and $D$ the time, then in the same time the same force $A$ will move $\dfrac 1 2 B$ twice the distance $C$, and in $\dfrac 1 2 D$ it will move $\dfrac 1 2 B$ the
whole distance $C$; for thus the rules of proportion will be observed [Physics, Book VII, 249b27-250a9].
