Q:

When was the first recorded use of subscript in mathematics to represent index?

(Disclaimer: apologies for any incorrect usage of mathematical terminology throughout this question.)
In modern mathematical notation, a variable with a subscript can represent a couple of different concepts relating to the notion of index.
For example, we can define an integer sequence such as the triangle numbers as:
$$T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$
Or, we can write an infinite series as:
$$\sum_{i=1}^\infty a_i = a_1+a_2+a_3+\ldots$$
And we can label the elements of a matrix or vector like so:
$$
\mathbf{A} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13}\\
a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23}\\
a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}
\end{bmatrix}
,
\mathbf{v} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
v_1\\
v_2\\
v_3
\end{bmatrix}
$$
But, when did this notation first arrive in mathematics? I've been trying to track down the origins of where this notation comes from through various sources, to no avail. The closest place I've come to an answer was through the book A History of Mathematical Notations, by Florian Cajori. One interpretation of the book may hint that they seem to have emerged around the time determinants were beginning to be studied, before the modern day invention of matrices, possibly by Leibniz? However, this is just from my reading, and the book doesn't acknowledge this directly, or make any note of it. And they could have very easily originated from later or earlier than this. Is there an original field of maths they come from, that their use proliferated out from?

Looking in Mathsym, I find:
$\bullet \;$Use of $\;{}^1a,\;{}^2a,\;{}^3a$ in Laplace, 1772.
Histoire de l'Académie royale des sciences,  p. 294
It didn't catch on.

$\bullet \;$Then Cauchy, 1815, with subscripts.
Œuvres complètes d'Augustin Cauchy, Serie 2, tome 1, p. 130

There is an interesting passage in

Dodgson, Charles Lutwidge. An Elementary Treatise on Determinants:
With Their Application to Simultaneous Linear Equations and
Algebraical Geometry. Vol. 13. Macmillan and Company, 1867:

New words and symbols are always a most unwelcome addition to a
Science, especially to one already burdened with an enormous
vocabulary, yet I think the Definitions given of them will be found to
justify their  introduction, as the only way of avoiding tedious
periphrasis.  The symbols employed to represent the single elements of
a Determinant, require perhaps a word of apology, and it may be well
to enumerate those already in use, and to point out what seem to be
their chief defects.  We may commence with

, where the change of letter indicates a change of
column, and the change of subscript a change of row. Now the
properties of Determinants, relating to columns, being always
convertible into properties relating to rows, and vice versa, it was a
sufficient objection to this system of notation, that it represented
things distinctly analogous by methods so different, and it was
properly superseded by the notation introduced by Leibnitz,

, both of column and row, are alike
denoted by subscripts.  But it seems a fatal objection to this system
that most of the space is occupied by a number of a's, which are
wholly superfluous, while the only important part of the notation is
reduced to minute subscripts, alike difficult to the writer and the
reader.  It was almost an obvious improvement on this system to raise
the subscripts into the line, and omit the a's altogether, as
suggested by Baltzer, thus -

, and this system, though tedious for writing, might serve very well,
were it not for its liability to be confused with the notation, common
in Plane Algebraical Geometry, by which $(1,1)$ denotes the Point
$x=1,\ y=1$.  The symbol

, which I have ventured  to suggest as an emendation on this last, will
be found, I have great hopes,  sufficient'y simple, distinct, and easy
to be written. I have turned the symbol towards the left,    in
order to avoid all chance of confusion with $\int$, the symbol for
integration.

Edit
The reference to the
Hidden Math in Alice in Wonderland
is due since that is where I've learned about that published math book.

According to this article Frege used it in 1879:

Although you may also be interested in this article which says Georg Cantor used subscripts in his notation for cardinal numbers, and he was born in 1845.
Whilst this is just my opinion, I suspect them to be much older due to the use of symbols to vary letters in many languages and variations of characters in previous cultures however I cannot find a source for this.
