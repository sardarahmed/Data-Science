Q:

Study of embryos

I want to know how different stages of human development were elucidated. What experiments were done? Do they involve taking out zygotes, embryos, and fetuses at different stages? How could one study all these stages in development of one individual? Does this mean that many developing humans were examined?
I don't think MRI could have helped because it was discovered a bit later.
