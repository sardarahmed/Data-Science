Q:

Who invented the way we write exponentiation?

Why do we write $a^n$ instead of $^n\!a$ for exponentiation? What benefit is there to writing the base before the exponent? With addition and multiplication order doesn't matter since $a + b = b + a$, so why was $a^n$ chosen, and who popularised this notation?
To me the first is preferable since it's a logical choice, as you put the number in front when you add:
$$a+a+a = 3a$$
Thus it makes sense to write:
$$a\times a\times a = \,^3\!a$$
It would also retain left-associativity as is commonly used with subtraction and division: $$(a\text{^} b)\text{^}c = \,^\left(^ab\right)c$$
Historically the best choice isn't always the one which got popularised, but there must have been some reason why this choice were made and preferred in its period of invention.

Browsing the "original" historiographical" source for the "power" symbolisms , i.e. :

Florian Cajori, A History of Mathematical Notations (1928, Dover reprint), page 335-on

can be very istructive, showing how Descartes' choice was the last step of a complex process :

Pietro Antonio Cataldi : $5$ $3(crossed)$ for $5x^3$
Joost Bürgi : with $vi$ on top of $8$ for $8x^6$ (obvious problem : how to handle two variables : $x$ and $y$ ?)
Romanus (Adriaan van Roomen) : $A(4)$ for $A^4$
Pierre Hérigone : $a3$ for $a^3$ and $2b4$ for $2b^4$
James Hume (1636) : $A^{iii}$ for $A^3$.

Thus, Cajori concludes that :

Hérigone and Hume almost hit upon the scheme of Descartes. [...] Where Hume would write $5a^{iv}$ and Hérigone would write $5a4$, Descartes wrote $5a^4$.

See Earliest Use of Symbols for Operations for a discussion.  Summary: Descartes 1637 is the first to use exponents for powers in the modern way:  $a^3$.
