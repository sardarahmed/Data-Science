Q:

First use of the term and principle of dynamic pressure — Daniel Bernoulli?

I have read in several places that both the developed concept and the term for dynamic pressure as it pertain to fluid dynamics was first published in Hydrodynamica by Daniel_Bernoulli, but I can not find any direct evidence of this. Assuming it is there, I assume that it would be in the original latin. Is there a linkable source where I could see it as originally written and defined? Either the original latin, or a scholarly translation into a different language if necessary.
If not a linkable source, even a screen shot of the relevant passage would also be helpful.

A:

The experiment described in Section 12, § 7 of the "Hydrodynamica" and depicted in the appendix (second picture from above on the left part of the page), can be described as follows: water flows out of a perforated tube and rises to the height of the water in a nearby manometer, thus establishing the equality of hydrostatic and hydrodynamic pressure. See also Mikhailov in: Grattan-Guinness, "Landmark Writings in Western Mathematics 1640-1940", Elsevier 2005.
Daniel's as well as Johann Bernoulli's treatises on hydraulics were translated into English by Carmody and Kobus.
