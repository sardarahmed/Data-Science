Q:

Einstein's contribution to Mathematics?

What contribution to mathematics did Einstein make, or was he only interested in Physics and derived formulas using mathematics?

A:

There is a discussion of Einstein's early and late views on mathematics at https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Einstein-write-Since-the-mathematicians-have-invaded-the-theory-of-relativity-I-do-not-understand-it-myself-anymore-After-all-GR-relies-heavily-on-mathematics. Although he had been taught by Minkowski at ETH Zurich, he apparently had no relationship with him and disliked his approach to spacetime in special relativity. When he subsequently exploited this in general relativity, he is said to have acknowledged his debt.
