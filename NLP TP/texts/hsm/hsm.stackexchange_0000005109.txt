Q:

Who is Father Bertet (correspondent of John Collins)?

John Collins corresponded with numerous mathematicians in Europe in the 17th century. One of his correspondents mentioned in several letters is one Father Bertet.  Judging from the letters Bertet was in Italy or perhaps more specifically in Venice.  Beyond this I can't find any information on the fellow.  Who was he?

A:

Googling, I found ---
Philip Beeley and Christoph J. Scriba (editors), The Correspondence of John Wallis (1616-1703), Volume IV (1672-April 1675), Oxford University Press, 2014.
The following is from p. 506:

Bertet, Jean (1622-92).--- Born in Tarascon. Admitted S.J. 1637. Studied under Honoré Fabri at Collège de la Trinité in Lyon. Taught philosophy and mathematics at University of Grenoble. By 1659 professor of mathematics at Aix. In 1689 conspired with Leibniz and Antonio Baldigiani S.J. in Rome to have ban on Copernicanism lifted. Died in Paris on 29 June 1692 (new style).

I wonder if Jean is the father or a grandfather of Laurent Dominique Bertet (1671-1739), who seems to be better known?
