Q:

Who introduced the stream function?

I have found many different claimed answers to this question:

Wikipedia article on the stream function claims that Lagrange introduced it in 1781.
Darrigol's The Worlds of Flow says that D'Alambert did it in 1761.
The Oxford Handbook of the History of Physics mentions that Euler introduced the complex potential and so by extension the stream function in 1757 (p.356). However, I am not sure if this claim is true.

Can somebody clarify this? Thanks a lot.

A:

d'Alembert did originally introduce the stream function in "Remarques sur les lois du mouvement des fluides" in 1761.  Page 149 says that
$$p = \frac{\partial \omega}{\partial x} \,,$$
$$q = - \frac{\partial \omega}{\partial z} \,,$$
where $q = -u$, $p = -v$, $z = y$, and $\omega = \psi$ in modern notation.  See page 138 for a better way to see how these variables match modern notation.  This is the stream function once you parse the odd notation.
Lagrange basically repeated this more clearly in 1781 in "Mémoire sur la théorie du mouvement des fluides".  See page 173 in particular.  Lagrange changes the variables, though.  He gives
$$p = \frac{\partial \omega}{\partial y} \,,$$
$$q = - \frac{\partial \omega}{\partial x} \,,$$
where $p = u$, $q = v$, and $\omega = \psi$.  Other than that this is basically the modern notation for the stream function.
I'm not familiar with the history of the complex potential, so unfortunately I cannot help you there.
