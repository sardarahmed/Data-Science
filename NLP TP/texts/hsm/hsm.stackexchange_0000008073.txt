Q:

What is the intuition behind Brahmagupta’s rule for multiplying negative numbers?

The rule says:

The product (or quotient) of two debts is a fortune

What I’m struggling with is what exactly is the product of two debts? What accounting need forces one to multiply debts? How do you interpret something like this?
Here’s what Wikipedia has to say but it doesn’t sound right:

Thus (−2) × 3  =  −6 and (−2) × (−3)  =  6. The reason behind the
  first example is simple: adding three −2's together yields −6: (−2) ×
  3  =  (−2) + (−2) + (−2)  =  −6. The reasoning behind the second
  example is more complicated. The idea again is that losing a debt is
  the same thing as gaining a credit. In this case, losing two debts of
  three each is the same as gaining a credit of six: (−2 debts ) × (−3
  each)  =  +6 credit.

The trippy thing is $(-3$ each$)$ - that makes no sense IMHO. 
I’m okay even coming up with a contrived scenario but I can’t swallow the interpretation above. 
So, how should one interpret “debt times debt is fortune from an accounting POV?
This question seems to have similar intent but the answers there are inconclusive or not "intuitively correct" (multiplication by $-3$ people for example). Hence the focus of this question is to purely understand it from an accounting POV vs. multiplying negative numbers in general.

A:

The interpretation is derived from "stretching" the natural interpretation of product as repeated sum. 
$3 \times 2 = 6$ because $3 \times 2 = 3+3$.
The same for $(−3) \times 2 = (−3) + (−3) = −6$.
Starting from this, we may interpret $a \times (−2)$ as "repeated subtraction" : we have to "subtract" twice the quantity $a$. 
If $a$ is a negative quantitiy, i.e. a debt, to subtract a debt is to earn money : if I have a debt of $-6$ with you and I give it to you, my account changes from $−6$ to $0$ while your account changes from $0$ to $-6$.
