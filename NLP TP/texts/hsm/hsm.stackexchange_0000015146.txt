Q:

When did the error function get its modern definition?

I am currently writing an essay on the error function and after researching its historical origin, I found out who first defined it: J.W.L. Glaisher. But his definition is different from today's form. His definition: $\int_x^âˆže^{-x^2}dx = \operatorname{erf}(x)$ and today: $\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_0^xe^{-x^2}dx$. I would like to know when they changed it and what the reason was.

A:

Harold Jeffreys's  1927 book Operational Methods in Mathematical Physics has a 2-page note titled "On the notation for the error function or probability integral" on pages 94-95, with 9 footnotes, addressing your question. (The link I give has a free pdf download option.) He seems to say that Jeans introduced the $\frac2{\sqrt\pi}$ factor, in his 1921 book The Dynamical Theory of Gases.
A partial resolution of the inconsistency of names is to see that where Glaisher, Whittaker and Watson, etc. use $\operatorname{Erf}$ and $\operatorname{Erfc}$ for the unscaled functions, A&S, Wikipedia, DLMF, etc. use $\operatorname{erf}$ and $\operatorname{erfc}$ for the scaled ones.  But Jeffreys uses $\operatorname{Erf}$ for the scaled version, so the inconsistency is not eliminated.
