Q:

Letter of Egorov to Lusin

I heard that there is a famous letter between Egorov and Lusin , which best reflects relation between the teacher student duo. Can anyone provide any link of that letter?

A:

If you mean the letter of 4th August 1905, you can read it here in English translation (from Russian Mathematicians in the 20th Century by Yakov Sinai). There are also excerpts of other letters by Egorov.
