Q:

Did Zermelo in 1914 miss the fact that there are only countably many finite strings?

Did Zermelo in 1914 miss the fact, known in 1905 already, that there are only countably many finite strings, for instance polynomials with defined parameters? He wrote: Every real or complex number $\alpha$ satisfies at least one algebraic equation of the form
$g(x, \eta) = g(x, \eta_1, \eta_2, \eta_3, ..., \eta_t) = 0$
where $g$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients, and $\eta_1, \eta_2, \eta_3, ..., \eta_t$ are basis numbers (a Hamel basis), and  the largest power of $x$ is at least 1.
[E. Zermelo: "Über ganze transzendente Zahlen", Math. Annalen 75 (1914) pp. 434-442]
Edit
In 1920 Skolem introduced his "normal form ", showed that every satisfiable well formed formula of first order predicate calculus has a satisfiable Skolem normal form (and vice versa), and improved and generalized the proof of Löwenheim's theorem: Every proposition in normal form either is a contradiction or is already satisfiable in a finite or denumerably infinite  domain.
"Zermelo regarded Skolem's position as a real danger for mathematics and, therefore, saw 'a particular duty' to fight against it. [...] His remedy consisted of infinitary languages. [...] Skolem had considered such a possibility, too, but had discarded it because of a vicious circle." [Heinz-Dieter Ebbinghaus: "Ernst Zermelo, an approach to his life and work", Springer (2007) p. 200ff]
Additional question relevant for the main question: What is the first paper where Zermelo explicitly considers uncountable alphabets?

A:

The assumption on which this question is based is incorrect, so, no, Zermelo did not miss this. The set of basis numbers, as defined by Zermelo, is itself uncountable, and the set of finite strings over an uncountable alphabet is of course uncountable as well.
