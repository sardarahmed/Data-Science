Q:

When did Gauss introduce "Gauss' planetary equations"?

"Gauss' planetary equations" are a set of equations that describe the rate of change of the six elements of a planetary orbit in the presence of a disturbing force. I just intend to ask in which of his works did Gauss first write his planetary equations. Did he write them down in the Theoria motus (1809) or perhaps in some of his shorter papers? 

A:

I agree with the conclusion that the planetary equations are not in Theoria motus (1809). I believe Gauss first wrote them down in §14 of the essay Exposition d'une nouvelle méthode de calculer les perturbations planétaires avec l'application au calcul numérique des perturbations du mouvement de Pallas, drafted (c.1812) for a Paris prize competition but only published posthumously (1906).
