Q:

What or who is Peloritan in the name "Accademia Peloritana dei Pericolanti"?

The University of Messina has a scientific organization and publication "Accademia Peloritana dei Pericolanti", see 1. What is the origin and meaning of the word "peloritana"?

A:

It is a toponym, functionally equivalent to "Messina".
Cape Pelorus is the modern Capo Peloro=Faro Point, at the end of the Peloritani Mountains in North East Sicily, where Messina is.
There is a navigation instrument called the pelorus, said to have been named after Hannibal's navigator Pelorus (the eponym of Cape Pelorus),  unjustly executed by Hannibal; one  exposition has more detail than most such, but (sadly) no references. See also the entry for Peloris in the 1853 A New Classical Dictionary of Biography, Mythology, and Geography by
William Smith, which is no better, references-wise.
