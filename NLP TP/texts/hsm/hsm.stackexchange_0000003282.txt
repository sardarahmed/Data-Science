Q:

Who discovered diamagnetism first?

Ferromagnetism is everyday life. 
Paramagnetism is not rare.
But diamagnetism is rare and weak. 
So, who first discovered diamagnetism? in which material?

A:

Credit for discovering diamagnetism is given to different people. Wikipedia states that Sebald Justinus Brugmans was the first to discover it, in 1778, when he observed bismuth and antimony being repelled by magnetic fields. Interestingly enough, some sources (e.g. Kustler (2007)) instead credit his father, Anton Brugmans, with the discovery. The elder Brugmans was also a scientist, and investigated electricity and magnetism, which may have led to the confusion.
Regardless of which Brugmans deserves credit, a more rigorous treatment of diamagnetism was given in 1845 by Michael Faraday (again, see Kustler for more information), who noted that a magnetic field could cause a piece of glass to rotate. Faraday's work was soon built upon by John Tyndall (see Jackson (2014)).
