Q:

What does this quote by Paul Halmos mean?

I came across the following quote by the famous mathematician Paul Halmos:

A clever graduate student could teach Fourier something new, but surely no one claims that he could teach Archimedes to reason better.

What does it mean, and what is the context? It seems as if Halmos wasn't fond of Archimedes' methods of reasoning, which is quite intriguing.

A:

The meaning of the quote is more likely to be, that Archimedes' reasoning was on such a high level, that no one (example: the clever graduate student) could teach him to reason better because Archimedes knew all about how to do that already.
