Q:

The role of the Elements in the development of mathematics

The Elements are often regarded as the cornerstone of the axiomatic approach to mathematics. However, mathematical textbooks have served as the foundational pillars upon which writing style, language, notation and the structural development of mathematics have been solidified over the centuries. Could someone provide further insight into the pivotal role that the Elements played in shaping these aspects? Are there significant predecessors, or was it the initial serious attempt to establish the framework for the communication and instruction of mathematics? If possible, I would also like to understand what factors contributed to their widespread acceptance in the tradition of writing math.

A:

Euclid was not the first book of this type, among his predecessors the ancient sources mention Hippocrates of Chios, Theudius of Magnesia, Leon and Hermotimus of Colofon.
See this Wikipedia article for references. However none of these previous books survives. We only know those names from some surviving ancient histories of mathematics. (This frequently happens that someone writes a book which is judged by contemporaries superior to the work of his predecessors, and they stop using the previous books, and do not care about copying them). Unfortunately only a very small portion of ancient literature survived to our days.
Then, for almost two millennia, Euclid's Elements was the standard of mathematical exposition, it was used in teaching, as a reference and as a standard of the style of mathematical writing. This includes,
for example Newton's Principia, where he tries to imitate Euclid's exposition. Even non-mathematicians like Spinoza tried to imitate Euclid's style. Only in 18th century (after the invention of Calculus) this started to change.
