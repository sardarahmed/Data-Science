Q:

History of exponential notation for the set of functions between two sets

It's well-known that if $A$ and $B$ are two sets, then the set of all functions from $A$ to $B$ can be denoted by $B^A$: explanations of this particular notation can be found in many places:
https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/901735/meaning-of-a-set-in-the-exponent
https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/63960/what-does-it-mean-when-a-set-is-the-exponent
https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/709184/why-is-the-exponential-of-sets-the-function-set
What I ask for is: when this notation was first introduced and in which context?
(So this question is not about the meaning or the rationale behind it.)
The older occurrence I can find is in Bourbaki's Théorie des ensembles, of 1954, E.R.20, but is it the first? 

A:

It comes from Bernstein's Habilitation dissertation Untersuchungen aus der Mengenlehre (1901, published 1905), where he also introduced the now common symbolism for cardinal arithmetic. The exponential notation is introduced in §2 as follows (my translation):

"If $M$ and $N$ are two sets, we call that set which - in the sense of a known expression - contains all combinations of elements from $M$ to the classes of $N$, the power $M^N$ ($M$ raised to $N$). Regarding the application to addition, multiplication and powerclasses of commutative and associative laws, they are the same as for finite numbers". 

Bernstein does not use $2^N$ for the powerset, but he does write $2^{\aleph_\alpha}$, meaning set cardinality, in §9, when discussing the continuum hypothesis.
