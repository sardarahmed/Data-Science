Q:

Who really invented the integration symbol?

Most of the sources online say that Leibniz invented the sign. There's also this answer on this site which says so. 
That is fine. But recently when I was watching Cosmos, I noticed this:

See the integration sign on the wall? That's Newton's house. Was it a co-incidence that Leibniz used the same symbol for integration? 

A:

The sign of the integral was proposed by Leibniz (for indefinite integral). It is a stylized letter $S$, and $S$ stands for the "sum".
The things seen in your picture are probably metal parts of the house construction which can be seen on many old houses built of stones.
They have nothing to do with the integration symbol:-)
Remark. The modern notation for definite integral
$$\int_a^b$$ was invented by J. Fourier.
