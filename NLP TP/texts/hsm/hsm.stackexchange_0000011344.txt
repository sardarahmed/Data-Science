Q:

Who wrote "projective geometry" for the first time?

I guess Desargues did not use that term. Anyone could help me know where did it appear for the first time? Thanks

A:

I looked in MathWords and found this

PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY. In his account of the origins of projective geometry Katz (1993) mentions Pascal, Desargues and Monge before saying that J.-V.Poncelet composed the first text in synthetic projective geometry: his Traité des Propriétés Projectives of 1822. See here for an extract from Poncelet’s Introduction.
The OED finds the term projective geometry used in English in 1885 in Charles Leudesdorf’s Elements of Projective Geometry, a translation of Cremona’s Elementi di geometria proiettiva of 1873.

So, perhaps the first use in English was 1885, but that was a translation from Italian.  First uses in other languages are (of course) not answered by this.

“The first known use of the expression 'projective geometry' only dates back to Olry Terquem (1859)” in the article Sur diverses géométries, Nouvelles Annales de Mathématiques, 18, 445–446, according to https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/anachronisms-in-the-history-of-mathematics/measuring-past-geometers-a-history-of-nonmetric-projective-anachronism/75A9056750446E37CABBDAFE12E32986 page 263.

Actually Desargues used the term "project".  The title of his fundamental work was "Brouillon d'un Project".  Notice the unusual spelling (in modern French the word is spelled without the "c").  It is possible that his use of the term (apparently in a different sense) may have influenced the subsequent choice of the standard name for the field.
