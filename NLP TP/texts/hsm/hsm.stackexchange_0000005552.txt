Q:

"Cycles" to "Hertz": Why the shift circa 1970?

Before circa 1970, it was more common to say "kilocycles" than "kilohertz" (and analogously for "mega-," "giga-," etc.). What contributed to "Hertz" becoming more common than "cycles"?
cf. the Google Ngram graph for "megahertz,megacycles,kilocycles,kilohertz,gigacycles,gigahertz"

A:

SI units started to be used.
In 1960 (not 1970!), the Système international d'unités was established at the General Conference on Weights and Measures. The hertz was officially recognized as a unit derived from metric system units (namely, the second). It was already in partial use (the International Electrotechnical Commission began using it in 1930). With the rise of the hertz, the phrase "cycles" in "cycles per second" fell out of fashion, leading to the general trend we see on the Google Ngram.
Interestingly enough, adding "hertz" to the Ngram search shows that its usage, too, took off a bit after 1960, though it was already fairly popular.
