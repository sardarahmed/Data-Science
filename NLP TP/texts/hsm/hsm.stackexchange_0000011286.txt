Q:

Jean-Christophe Yoccoz (May 29, 1957 – September 3, 2016)

Outstanding French mathematician had also his Brasilian chapter in his life (or two chapters?). I'd like to know more.
The en.wikipedia tells us that Yoccoz was born, raised and educated in France,
"Yoccoz attended the Lycée Louis-le-Grand,[3] during which time he was a silver medalist at the 1973 International Mathematical Olympiad and a gold medalist in 1974.[4][5] He entered the École Normale Supérieure in 1975, and completed an agrégation in mathematics in 1977.".
You'd think that he would immerse himself in mathematics totally. However, suddenly, he had completed military service in Brazil. How come?
"He joined the French Academy of Sciences and Brazilian Academy of Sciences in 1994, became a chevalier in the French Legion of Honor in 1995, and was awarded the Grand Cross of the Brazilian National Order of Scientific Merit in 1998."
Well, by this time, Yoccoz had so many mathematical and formal achievements that it is no wonder that he was celebrated also by Brasil (in view of his military service there).

A:

At that time, France had compulsory military service for all males, but they could replace it by work in a school overseas.The French version of the Wikipedia article on Yoccoz specifies:

Pendant cette période, au début des années 1980, il effectue son
  service national en coopération à l’Instituto de Matematica Pura e
  Aplicada de Rio de Janeiro

That is: He did his National Service "in cooperation with" the Instituto de Matematica Pura e Aplicada in Rio de Janeiro.
