Q:

When was the electronvolt first introduced?

When was the unit "electronvolt" (eV) first introduced, and by whom? 
The definition of the eV requires the knowledge of the electron charge $e$, so it must have been introduced after 1909, the date of the famous oil drop experiment conducted by R. A. Millikan and H. Fletcher, in which, as far as I know, $e$ was measured for the first time.

A:

The OED's "electronvolt" entry gives this as the earliest usage in English:

1925 Proc. Royal Soc. A. 109 559

Now one electron-volt = 1·59 .10−12 ergs, and 4·18 .10−17 ergs = 1 gram-calorie.

But it defines what its measure is, not what it is.
