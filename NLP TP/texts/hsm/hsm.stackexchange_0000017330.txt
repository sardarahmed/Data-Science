Q:

When did they start requiring holotypes for species description?

I know they weren't required in the early 1800s but obviously they are now so just wondering when this started being required and/or who coined holotype. Internet research yielded no good answers.

A:

As far as botany is concerned, the concept of type specimen and obligation of using one was introduced in the 1935 version of the code (the so-called Cambridge Rules).
For zoology, surprisingly, it is only compulsory to explicitely name a name-bearing specimen since 1999, when the 4th (and current) edition of the ICZN code was published.
The term 'holotype' though (and the concept of typification) is older. The earliest occurrence I can find is in this short communication in the journal Science from 1897: What is a type in Natural History? by Charles Schuchert.
