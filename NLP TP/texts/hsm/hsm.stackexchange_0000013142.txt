Q:

Were Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion the first formal definition of an ellipse?

It seems to me that Kepler's Laws necessitate some definition of an ellipse in terms of a coordinate system. I am wondering whether Kepler's Laws mathematically defined what an ellipse is, or if he used an already defined shape in his laws.
The reason I got curious about this in the first place was that I realized that Descartes may not have invented the Cartesian coordinate system by the time that Kepler discovered these laws and I have only seen proofs of Kepler's Laws in a Cartesian system.

A:

No. Conic sections were studied in Greece since the IVth century BC. And Apollonius of Perga (c. 240 BC – c. 190 BC), who coined the term ellipse, wrote a treatise on conic sections (Conics) in eight books.
