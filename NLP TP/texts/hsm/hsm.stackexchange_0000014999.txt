Q:

Original source of these 2 trigonometric identities

I am interested in knowing what is the original source/author of the following identities:
$\tan{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\tan{\frac{\beta}{2}}+\tan{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\tan{\frac{\gamma}{2}}+\tan{\frac{\beta}{2}}\tan{\frac{\gamma}{2}}=1\tag{1}.$
$\cot{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\cot{\frac{\beta}{2}}\cot{\frac{\gamma}{2}}=\cot{\frac{\alpha}{2}}+\cot{\frac{\beta}{2}}+\cot{\frac{\gamma}{2}}\tag{2}.$
Where $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are the angles of a triangle.
I ask this question because Wikipedia does not cite sources or mention the original author.

A:

After hours of searching through scans of books from the 18th and 19th centuries in English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, and Latin I managed to find a source for each of the two identities.
The first one appeared in a list of trigonometric identities for the oblique triangle in a book by the Belgian mathematician Émile Gelin, Éléments de Trigonométrie Plane et Sphérique. Namur: Wesmael-Charlier 1888, p. 106:

[151] [...] $\mathrm{tg}\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{A} \ \mathrm{tg}\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{B} + \mathrm{tg}\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{B} \ \mathrm{tg}\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{C} + \mathrm{tg}\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{C} \ \mathrm{tg}\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{A} = 1;$

The second one appeared as an exercise in Joseph Alfred Serre, Traité de Trigonometrié. Paris: Bachelier 1850, p. 67:

2. Démontrer que si $a,b,c$ sont trois arcs dont la somme est égale à $\pi$, on a:
1°. $\mathrm{cot}\frac{a}{2} + \mathrm{cot}\frac{b}{2} + \mathrm{cot}\frac{c}{2} = \mathrm{cot}\frac{a}{2} \ \mathrm{cot}\frac{b}{2} \ \mathrm{cot}\frac{c}{2};$

I think it is unlikely that these are the first (original) instances of these two identities in the literature. The inscribed circle of a triangle is already found in Euclid IV. 4. In the first century C.E., Heron of Alexandria already showed that the area of the triangle is $\sqrt{s(s – a)(s – b)(s – c)}$, where the semi-perimeter $s = \frac{a+b+c}{2}$. As far a I know, the ancient Greeks already had the notion of a (co-)tangent, as the length of a shadow cast by a gnomon hit by the sun at a particular angle.
I do not know who first worked out that the radius of the inscribed circle is $r = \sqrt{\frac{(s – a)(s – b)(s – c)}{s}}$ and that $\tan\frac{A}{2}=\frac{r}{s-a}, \tan\frac{B}{2}=\frac{r}{s-b}, \tan\frac{C}{2}=\frac{r}{s-c}$. With modest effort this might lead one to the first formula, for example. I would be very surprised if this did not happen long before the 19th century.
Thinking up trigonometric identities for the oblique triangle for use in exercises and exams or as mathematical puzzles for certain journals appears to have been a favorite pastime of 19th century mathematicians (or at least this is the impression I got from my lengthy perusal of the literature) and this might be the reason such identities are most readily found in books from that time period.
