Q:

Did Turing ideas make any impact on Psychology or Brain Science? Why?

Some authors, namely Daniel Dennett and Douglas Hofstadter, argue that anything capable of passing the Turing test is necessarily conscious (Hofstadter, D. R., & Dennett, D. C. (2006). The Mind's I: Fantasies and Reflections on Self & Soul).
Others use the M Thesis - any physical system can be simulated by Turing Machine simulation - to make statements about the brain and conscience: It can be fully simulated by a machine.
Did Turing work make any impact on Psychology and Neurosciences or it was mostly ignored? If it did have an impact, which author bridged the gap between Math\CS to the other sciences?

A:

Turings works are highly formal and hardcore mathematical. Actually, not even a simple mathematician would understand it, if he is not on a similar area.
The Turing-test is a very different thing from the Turing-machines. The Turing-machines aren't about consciousness, they are about computability. Turing reached very… surprising results, from a philosophical viewpoint they are similar in the computer science as Gödels' results were in the mathematics. For example, there are functions which can't be calculated by any computer. Actually, most of them aren't.
The Turing-test is rather a philosophical construction. Afaik the main problem for the psychologists, that for them is everything which is non-intelligent, per definitionem out-of-scope. (Off-topic, he-he).
AFAIK the philosophers of the present time like to play a lot with every scientific results, especially on the area of the artificial intelligence. They interact relative heavily with current results / possibilities. Around half of the leading text-book in most university-grad Artificial Intelligence courses, is about philosophical questions and not about the actual algorithms.
