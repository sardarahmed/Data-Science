Q:

How old are the shape of the numbers based on the number of angles?

There is a famous image that pretends to explain the origin of the shapes of the digits by the number of angles in them.
I do know that it is erroneous but I would like to know if this is an old legend or a recent one. After all, maybe centuries ago, someone spread this false etymology, maybe ten years ago.

A:

In the book Florian Cajori "A History of Mathematical Notations" on pp 65-66 says: "A French writer, P. Voizot<a reference to 1899 work>, entertained the theory that originally a numeral contained as many angles as it represents units. ... He did not claim credit for this explanation, but ascribed it to a writer in the Genova Catholico Militarite".
