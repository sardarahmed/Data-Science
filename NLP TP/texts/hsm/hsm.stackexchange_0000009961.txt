Q:

What was the "libration of Pallas" that Gauss studied, when Pallas is not a moon of Jupiter?

This question is a request for general explanation of an astronomical phenomenon known as "Pallas libration", and isn't much about the details of Gauss's  mathematical model of this libration. As is well known (see this post: Calculation of Gauss leading to 18:7 resonance between orbits of Jupiter and Pallas), Gauss discovered a $18:7$ resonance of Pallas with Jupiter, and according to the source given in https://aas.org/archives/BAAS/v31n5/aas195/431.htm ("On the Commensurate Motion of Pallas") he developed a theory of the periodic libration of Pallas with a period of $737$ Jupiter sidereal periods (Werke v. 7, p. 421, p. 559). Martin Brendel, in his essay on Gauss's astronomical works, also commented about Gauss's theory of libration (he actually devoted an entire section to it in his essay).
The basic point i don't understand is the use of the word "libration" within the context of the motion of asteroids - as far as i know, libration is a phenomenon in which an observer on a planet (Earth, for example) is able to see more than a half of an orbiting moon which is in a "tidal lock" with the planet (the effect in which tidal forces and moments synchronize the rotational angular motion of the moon with his orbital angular motion). This is caused by visual effects such as the parallax derived from the change in positions of the observer. But Pallas isn't even a moon of Jupiter, let alone in "tidal lock" with Jupiter. So I'd really like to get an explanation on this.
Although this question is more about the physics involved then about the historical circumstances, I chose to mention Gauss and ask it on this HSM Stack Exchange, simply because he was one of the few astronomers that attempted to formulate such a theory (which is quite a "niche" in astronomical sciences), so one can't really separate the science from its history and discoverers in this case.

A:

"Libration" loosely refers to longitudinal oscillations due to orbital resonances. The tidal lock and the trojans, the only situations that Wikipedia mentions, are just special cases. The existence of resonances does not require one body to revolve around the other, and Jupiter exerts a major pull on the asteroid belt just as a planet would on its moons.
However, according to Woltjer's On the supposed libration in the motion of Pallas, Gauss's "libration" of Pallas was likely a numerical artifact:

"One of the results of GAUSS' investigation on
  the motion of Pallas as disturbed by the attraction
  of Jupiter consists in the commensurability of the
  mean motions 
  $$18n'-7n=0.\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (1)$$ This equation shows a remarkable difference with the corresponding equations for some of the best known cases of libration in the solar system. In all these cases the algebraic sum of the integral numbers from the coefficients of the mean motions in the equations analogous to $(1)$ is zero; here it is $+11$...
The origin of this strange result contained in $(1)$ lies in the fact that GAUSS developed the perturbative function for definite numerical values of the elements. If $\lambda, \varpi, \Omega$ denote the mean longitude, longitude of
  perihelium, longitude of ascending node of Pallas, and the corresponding quantities for Jupiter are denoted by accented symbols, we have the following arguments in the perturbative function associated with the commensurability $18:7$:
  $$
18\lambda'-7\lambda-11\varpi\\
18\lambda'-7\lambda-10\varpi-\Omega\ \ \ \ \ \ (2)
$$
All the corresponding terms have been coalesced
  into one by GAUSS' numerical development; If however
  one of these terms, say the first; represents a case
  of libration, then the other's arguments have mean
  motions, such as for the second term $\varpi-\Omega$, which
  in general are different from zero.
Thus the coefficient $\alpha$ in the differential equation for the argument of the libration u:
  $$
\frac{d^2u}{dt^2}=-7\alpha n^2\sin u
$$
  should correspond to one of the arguments $(2)$ only,
  and not to the coefficient resulting from the addition of all the terms $(2)$ for definite numerical values of $\varpi$, $\varpi'$ and $\Omega$. Consequently it seems to me that we have no reason
  to assume the existence of libration in the motion
  of Pallas, until a more detailed investigation of the problem has been made by considering each of the
  terms $(2)$ separately.

Taylor in The secular motion of Pallas summarizes this as "Woltjer (1922) showed that the $18:7$ commensurability was unlikely to lead to a libration in the motion of Pallas", and discusses the effect of resonances with Jupiter on the motion of asteroids more generally.
