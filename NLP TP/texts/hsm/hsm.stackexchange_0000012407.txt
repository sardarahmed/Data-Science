Q:

The reason behind defining the direction of angular velocity towards the axis of rotation?

This is one of those questions which has confused a lot of students like me and I know similar questions have been asked on Physics Stack exchange but I literally want to know what was the reason behind defining it towards the axis of rotation and not any other ? Why did scientists used this convention ?

A:

Not really discussing history, but since you asked ...

(Bold is vector, normal is magnitude)
The position vector is $\mathbf r$, the velocity vector is $\mathbf  v$, and $\mathbf \omega$ is the angular velocity vector.
We know that the angular velocity and the velocity are related through $v = R\omega$, and, if you look carefully, you will see that $R = r\sin\alpha$, hence $v = r\omega\sin\alpha$. Looks like the magnitude of a cross product!
This might very well give one the idea of defining an angular velocity vector such that $\mathbf v=\mathbf\omega\times\mathbf r$ or $\mathbf r\times\mathbf\omega$. Since the right hand rule is a thing, it seems best to define $\mathbf v=\mathbf\omega\times\mathbf r$, where $\mathbf\omega$ would be in the direction your thumb points at when you close your hands in the direction of rotation.
Why is this useful? We can use any theorem that we have found for the cross product. :)
