Q:

Did Rene Descartes send or receive any letters (regarding mathematics) on 18.v.1638 (May 18, 1638)?

I dreamed about the date 18.v.1638 (May 18, 1638) last night.
As I currently do research on odd perfect numbers, and because Rene Descartes lived during the years 1596 to 1650, and as I am not a math historian, I would like to ask the experts here:

Did Rene Descartes send or receive any letters (regarding mathematics) on 18.v.1638 (May 18, 1638)?

I tried searching via Google, using the keywords Descartes and 18.v.1638, but there are too many search results (with none of them promising).  I did skim through a few of them, but did not find any letters on mathematics sent to or received by Descartes on May 18, 1638.

A:

On checking the Early Modern Texts for Descartes' correspondences, I did not find any correspondence of Descartes dated precisely to 18.v.1638. However, Descartes sent a letter to Reneri which has been dated to April or May, 1638. Because of this ambiguous dating, it seems like we don't have the knowledge that if there was a correspondence precisely on 18.v.1638.
