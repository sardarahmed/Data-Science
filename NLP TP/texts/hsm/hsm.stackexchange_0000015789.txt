Q:

Who introduced the terminology “nondecreasing” for weakly increasing (i.e. x≤y ⇒ f(x)≤f(y)), and when/why?

Arguably one of the most hated parts of English mathematical terminology is the word “nondecreasing”, referring to a function such that $x\leq y \;\Rightarrow\; f(x)\leq f(y)$ (what other conventions or languages might call something like “weakly increasing”, “(weak-)order-preserving” or various variations thereof).  The term is much hated, of course, because it is not the negation of “decreasing” (i.e., there are functions which are not decreasing but neither are they nondecreasing), so the question arises as to how this annoyance came about.
I can form two (noncontradictory!) conjectures as to the origin of “nondecreasing”:

One is that it is simply formed by analogy with “nonnegative” to mean “$\geq 0$” (which is also questionable, but at least makes sense logically) and “no less” to mean “$\geq$”: simply following the same pattern of using “non-” with the reversed inequality gives “nondecreasing”.

Another is that “nondecreasing” should really be “monotonically nondecreasing” (some people indeed use the full form, which is cumbersome but clear), and that the adverb was eventually left out as it seemed redundant (rather than being later added by people who wanted to make the term less illogical).

Question:  Who introduced “nondecreasing”, when, and why?  And is either (or both) of the above conjectures correct?

A:

My guess is that "nondecreasing" became a thing in the late 1800's and early 1900's, with the development of the theory of functions of bounded variation
and of the Stieltjes integral. Thus, in his 1882 "Sur la série de Fourier" Camille Jordan wrote

Le  théorème  subsistera donc tous le fois que $F(x)$ pourra être représenté de $0$  à $\epsilon$ par $f(x)-\phi(x)$, $f(x)$ et $\phi(x)$ étant deux fonctions fines et non décroissantes.

Hobson's 1907 Theory of Functions of a Real Variable says the same thing
(on p.336 of the 1956 Dover reprint):

... that it can be expressed as the difference of two bounded monotone functions, which are either both non-increasing or both non-diminishing.

According to F. Riesz and B. Sz-Nagy, writing in 1955 (on p.106 of the 1995 English translation of Functional Analysis), this result was made popular by Riesz's 1909 result about the dual of $C[0,1]$, for which it is useful to know (on p.10)

Every function of bounded variation is the difference of two nondecreasing functions.

My guess is that the English term "nondecreasing" is a direct borrowing from the French "non décroissantes".  I do not know if the ambiguities the OP finds in the English term are present in the French one.
