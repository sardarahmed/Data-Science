Q:

Earliest concrete example of a binary / digital computing device

I am trying to trace (as far as known) the first example of a digital computing device. I am discounting (no pun) an abacus because I regard that as a device for representing, storing and manipulating discrete, not binary digital, data values.
I have read that in 1937 Church and Turing published theoretical papers on computing. My understanding is that the (universal?) Turing machine does not explicitly require a digital representation of data and operations (maybe that is wrong).
I am trying to track down the point that it became clear that both data and operations could be represented by digital codes (maybe it was Church-Turing?). I have read that the earliest binary digital computers were produced by 
1938: Konrad Zuse: Konrad Zuse creates the Z1 Computer a binary digital computer using punch tape    
1939    George Stibitz: George Stibitz develops the Complex Number Calculator - a foundation for digital computers
Was this the time when the relationship between high-level operations (such as integer multiplication) and manipulating binary digits became explicit?

A:

Digital devices were quite common since 19th century, they were called cash registers:

Many shops were equipped with them.
Similar device for scientific/engineering purposes was called arithmometer,

In 1970s I was solving PDE's with this arithmometer:

or adding machine. The earliest ones appear in 17th century (Pascal is credited
with invention of one.)
Remark. The main feature of modern computers which sets them apart is that they are programmable, not that they are digital. But programmable computers also existed in 19th century (Babbage machine, for example).

There were also quite sophisticated analog computers (as opposite to digital)
and they were also in use since 19th century.
