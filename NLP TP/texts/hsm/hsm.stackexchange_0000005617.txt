Q:

Essential basic geometrical discoveries still possible in our era?

Can we imagine that scientific can still discover some basic simple but essential geometric rules such as the Pythagorean theorem in a near of far future:
$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$
Or do we consider that the future of discovery in mathematic, geometry and physic only rely on heavy computational models ?
I mean, is it possible to imagine that a man with some books and a brain (no computer for simluation, or heavy equipement) can still discover essential stuffs that have never been discovered, such as Euclide, Thales or Pythogore did in the past ?

A:

This is exactly what is happening in modern mathematics: people with some books and brain discover essential things that have never been discovered, such as Euclid, Thales and Pythagoras did in the past. In Geometry as well as in
other areas of mathematics. And most of these people use computers only to write e-mails and to check their bank accounts). 
Type "Poincare conjecture", "Perelman" on Google and you find plenty of popular texts explaining one of the recent top achievements in geometry. If you want very recent (2016) type "Marina Vyazovska", "sphere packing". Average well-educated person can understand what has been done (not how was it done), from these popular explanations.
