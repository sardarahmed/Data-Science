Q:

Why is kinetic energy denoted by the letter $T$ in quantum mechanics?

Kinetic energy is often written as $K$, $KE$ or $E_k$. Where does $T$ come from in quantum mechanics? Why and how did it come to be different?

A:

Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis and Jean-Victor Poncelet used the name "quantité de travail" (quantity of work) and "travail mécanique" (mechanical work) to denote the kinetic energy. I guess that this (the term "travail") could be the origin of the symbol $T$. See at the end of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vis_viva
(Be patient for my superficiality, I am very far from being a historian of science, I am just a mathematical physicist and this post migrated here from PSE.)

A:

I’m pretty sure Lagrange started this, in Méchanique analitique (1788, p. 224; 1809, p. 263; 1811, p. 311; 1815, p. 2): his predecessors mostly worked with the vis viva ($=2T$) instead.
(As to why he chose the letter  $T$, no idea. Words like kinetic, energy, work, appeared only later.)
