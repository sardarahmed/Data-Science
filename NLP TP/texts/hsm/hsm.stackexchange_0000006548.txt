Q:

Mathematicians with a history of conjecturing a lot

Of course, I could ask who conjectured the most, but conjectures can later be shown to be either true or false, so perhaps who has the most unresolved conjectures, in publication?  More than that though, also considered would be mathematicians with a reputation towards conjecture for discussion.
Another related question would be the person with the most disproven conjectures, in publication?  I'm also looking for interesting accounts of someone being shown to be wrong in conjecture while alive, yet still go on to write mathematics, hopefully of high quality, despite the setback.

A:

Probably Paul Erdos was the champion in the number of conjectures, but I do not
want to do the research needed to prove this. Another candidate that I know was Lee Rubel from the University of Illinois. But on my opinion, it is a waste of time to count such things.
