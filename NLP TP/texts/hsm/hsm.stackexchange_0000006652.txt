Q:

Did any famous physicists think nuclear weapons were impossible?

In the history of science and technology, there are some cases when scientists did not believe something that later turned out to be real.
For example, Bill Gates was saying 640K is sufficient to any computer :)
Did such thing happen in the history of nuclear weapon? Did someone famous not believe nuclear weapons were possible?
UPDATE
Maybe some problems were regarded as unsolvable initially, for example obtaining pure enough fuel or handling undercritical masses?
UPDATE 2
Urban legends also ok. For example, if it was popular opinion that A said something impossible.
UPDATE 3
Let's try to narrow the time. Let it be before the discovery of neutron and fission (1932). Wasn't it possible to understand that that the nucleus contain a lot of binding energy, but not knowing about fission to doubt that it can be extracted?

A:

I've never heard of a physicist denying the possibility of building atomic weapons. The closest thing that I am aware of is Werner Heisenberg's statement “I don't believe a word of the whole thing,” concerning the use of atomic weapons in Japan. But he was not denying the possibility of building the weapons. He just did not believe that the Americans had actually been able to do it.
