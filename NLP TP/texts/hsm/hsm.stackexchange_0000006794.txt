Q:

Lord Kelvin's wonderful prediction

My question is straight forward. How did Lord Kelvin accurately determine that -273.16°C is absolute zero. I guess this was not determined by experiments cause the equipment was not so developed. ( Please note that I am not sure that it was Lord Kelvin only who gave the concept of absolute zero.)

A:

Long ago I had to make a project about this topic. I disagree with other answers: Lord Kelvin, with the help of Joule, did actually find the absolute scale, because there's much more you are missing.
It's true that it was well known that $T=-273 ºC$ was acually the temperature at which wolume predicted for ideal gases gets zero. You can see it in many books like Callen thermodynamics.
However, setting $T=ºC+273$ is NOT enough to consider it an "absolute scale", because it still depends on the instrument you use. You must DEFINE temperature in such a way it doesn't depend on the substance used. You always measure a physical property related to T, but not directly T. What Kelvin did was finding a relationship between T and energies, heats and works, which are universal physical quantities that do not depend on the sustance. For this, he used the results of the ideal Carnot's engine.
Liek this, it doesn't depend on the substance but on measurable energies/heats. This is now indeed an absouet scale.
