Q:

The physical significance of $\sqrt{-1}$ prior to Einstein

The spacetime metric of relativity 
$$(ds)^2 = - (cdt)^2 + (dx)^2 + (dy)^2 + (dz)^2 $$
attaches physical significance to $\sqrt{-1}$.  (In order to achieve invariance the time differential used must be $-(cdt)^2 = (c\sqrt{-1}dt)^2$ rather than $(cdt)^2$.)
Prior to Einstein, which physical theories treated $\sqrt{-1}$ as physically significant?

A:

Complex numbers enter physics in the work of Fresnel on wave theory of light, namely in his derivation of total reflection. This was in the early 19 century.
