Q:

Origin of "Spline" word

I was studying interpolation by Splines in numerical analysis and started to wonder the word's origin. I've found that it was a system used in technical drawings using weights but couldn't find why they where called like that in that context. Any idea?
Regards

A:

The term comes from shipbuilding in the old days: A long thin flat spline which was fixed at discrete points by newts, flexes just like a cubic spline with natural boundary condition. In this case, the strain energy becomes a minimum. 
The technique is still in use in experimental ship building.

In his 1946 paper, "Contributions to the Problem of Approximation of Equidistant Data by Analytic Functions". Quart. Appl. Math., mathematician Isaac Jacob Schoenberg explains that:  

A spline is a simple mechanical device for drawing smooth curves. It
  is a slender flexible bar made of wood or some other elastic material.
  The spline is place on the sheet of graph paper and held in place at
  various points by means of certain heavy objects (called "dogs" or
  "rats") such as to take the shape of the curve we wish to draw.

It is also called a flat spline or a flexible  curve:

a long strip fixed in position at a number of points that relaxes to
  form and hold a smooth curve passing through those points for the
  purpose of transferring that curve to another material

My dictionary has this as origin of the word:

East Anglian dialect, perhaps related to splinter.
