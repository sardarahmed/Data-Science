Q:

What does this cover of a 1508 German book on arithmetic depict?

In a 1508 German book on arithmetic for merchants, this image appears on the cover (high resolution and context here):

What is this depicting? Who are these people and what are their roles? In particular, what are the symbols on the table? What is happening?

A:

The image appears to depict a counting board.  Since the context is mercantilism, it is most likely depicted being used by tax collectors or accountants.  The symbols are most likely stylizations.

A:

The image may depict the new form of doing arithmetic by writing numbers, as opposed to the old style of using the counting board.
Two image attestations around the same time.

A 1503 print of Gregor Reisch's encyclopedia Margarita Philosophica. Under the entry for arithmetice, there's an image contrasting the old and new style of doing arithmetic. Note the banner saying "typus arithmeticæ".

Two 1514 prints by the same publisher Öglin in Augsburg. The first book is about the counting board technique. The second book is about arithmetic by writing numbers.

Technology
In terms of technology for the table surface and smaller writing board, I have thus far found no references from the 1500s. Today, we can find slate boards on which we write with chalk or some other form of soft stone.
