Q:

What are examples of serendipity in the history of the sciences and math?

Cosmic microwave background radiation was discovered after Penzias & Wilson couldn't get rid of the noise generated by their horn. In fact, the noise was their discovery.
The strings in string theory were introduced in the context of the strong interaction to make the back-then newly discovered interaction between quarks visible. The strings turned out to be applicable (in closed form) even to gravity, certainly not what they were intended for.
What are other examples of serendipity in the sciences?
(If someone has a tag suggestion it is welcome)

A:

One famous example is that of Alexander Fleming. He left a cup of staphylococci on his desk and later discovered that it was contaminated with some fungus. Instead of disposing this cup, he started to investigate and the result was the discovery of penicillin, the first antibiotic. This is how he later described this himself:

One sometimes finds, what one is not looking for. When I woke up just after dawn on September 28, 1928, I certainly didn't plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer. But I suppose that was exactly what I did.

In 1961, Edward Lorenz was running a numerical simulation of weather systems.  To restart a run half-way, he copied the initial values from a previous printout — but saw that the simulation began to diverge from the previous run.
This turned out to be the result of the printout showing values that were rounded to 3 decimal places, without the full precision used in the calculations.  He expected the resulting errors to stay small; but instead, they grew exponentially, doubling roughly every four simulated days, until after two simulated months the weather scenario was completely different.
He thus encountered what is now known as the butterfly effect.

A:

It was well known that when you iterate $x\mapsto \lambda x(1-x)$, the following happens: when $\lambda$ is small, $x=0$ is an attracting fixed point; as $\lambda$ grows, at some moment $\lambda_1$ the attracting point becomes repelling, but an attracting $2$-cycle is born nearby. ($2$-cycle is an fixed point of $f\circ f$). As $\lambda$ grows further, this attracting cycle becomes repelling at $\lambda_2>\lambda_1$, but a
new attracting $4$-cycle is born nearby, so we have a sequence of "doubling bifurcations" $\lambda_1<\lambda_2<\ldots$, and this sequence converges to some
$\lambda_\infty$.
In 1978, Mitchell Feigenbaum studied this sequence using a hand calculator. He used Newton method to compute $\lambda_k$. Newton's method requires a good initial guess. Since the computation was slow, Feigenbaum started to think what the best initial guess will be, that is how to extrapolate the obtained sequence one step further. And he discovered that
the ratio $(\lambda_{n}-\lambda_{n-1})/(\lambda_{n+1}-\lambda_{n})$ tends to a constant. To his great surprise, when he tried another function, $x\mapsto \lambda\sin x$, he found that this ratio tends to the SAME constant!
This great discovery is called the Feigenbaum Universality, and the constant the
Feigenbaum constant. It is a universal mathematical constant (like $\pi$),
and it is approximately equal to 4.669201609102990671853203820466...
He said himself once, that the discovery was made because
he had no programmable calculator at his disposal.
