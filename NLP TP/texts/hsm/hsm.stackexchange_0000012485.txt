Q:

Where does the name "geometric theory" come from?

In mathematical logic, where does the adjective "geometric" comes from, in terms like "geometric theories" and "geometric logic"?
These terms come up in fields like topos theory, e.g. in works such as the following:
The unification of Mathematics via Topos Theory

A:

This answer is CW, so I don't gain reputation for someone else's work.
To quite Kevin Arlin's answer to the same question on math.stackexchange:

Geometric logic constitutes the logic, models of whose theories are preserved by geometric morphisms between topoi. Geometric morphisms are those appropriate to toposes viewed as generalized spaces, for instance, identifying the topos of sheaves on a topological space, or on a locale, with the space itself. Historically, toposes were first introduced by Grothendieck's school to model generalized algebro-geometric spaces, which explains why these morphisms are called geometric, rather than topological.
