Q:

The history of the equation $\boldsymbol {Et}-\boldsymbol {tE}=\frac{h}{2\pi i}$

Heisenberg already in 1927 quotes this equation as a "known equation".1

Then what is the origin of it? And what is its further history of it, ending in its death?

A:

Since you do not explain what $E$ and $t$ mean, I suppose that this is the equation
written by
M. Born and P. Jordan, Zur Quantenmechanik, Z. Phys. 34 (1925), Eq. 38,
few weeks after Heisenberg published his first version of Quantum Mechanics.
Of course, by 1927 it was already well-known. Development was very fast in this area.

As a comment (deleted since) pointed out, the source is mentioneed in in §5.4, p. 140 of Jammer, The Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics. It is   P. A. M. Dirac, Relativity quantum mechanics with an application to Compton scattering Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A 1926 111, 405-423. The equation in question is among eqs. (7) (the energy operator is denoted here by $W$):

This formula was proved to be senseless by Wolfgang Pauli, in Handbuch der Physik, zweite Auflage, Band XXIV, Ersten Teil - Quantentheorie, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg GmbH, 1933, p 140:

The English translation of the marked sentence can be found in Fundamental Questions in Quantum Mechanics, p. 266 as

We conclude that the introduction of an operator t must fundamentally
  be abandoned and that the time t in quantum mechanics has to be
  regarded as an ordinary number (c-number')
