Q:

Any account of the history of determinant of a matrix?

Recently I got some knowledge of the so-called hyper-determinant discovered by Cayley.
It arose a lot of interest of determinant in my mind. 
So, is there any good account of the history of determinant? 

A:

At Alain Lascoux's web page you can find .pdf files of Thomas Muir's encyclopedic history of determinants. Muir devoted quite a bit of his long life to this work, which is only one of a very few essentially complete literature surveys ever done of a mathematical field of study. FYI, Dickson's multi-volume treatise History of the Theory of Numbers is another such literature survey that is essentially complete up to the time it was written.
