Q:

Biography of L. Euler

Could you recommend a historically rigorous biography of L. Euler (if possible with discussions and examples of the mathematics he was doing)? 

Edit: I'd rather prefer a book (not necessarily about Euler alone) or a thorough article.

A:

The standard reference seems to be

Euler: The Master of Us All by William Dunham.

See also

Leonhard Euler
  by Emil A. Fellmann.

There is a short article here: 

Biography: Leonhard Euler, 
  by B. F. Finkel.
The American Mathematical Monthly,
  Vol. 4, No. 12 (Dec., 1897), pp. 297-302

See also The Euler Archive, in particular its Historical and Biographical Resources page.
