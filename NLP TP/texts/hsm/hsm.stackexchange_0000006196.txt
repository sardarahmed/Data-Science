Q:

Who said that theory of probability was not mathematics?

I seem to remember that as late as in the XIX century there was a prominent mathematician who denied that the theory of probability was part of mathematics, since it does not deal with certainty. 
Do you know who was that mathematician?

A:

It was Hardy and Littlewood. They said in a footnote to an article in the early 1920s (this was notably before Kolmogorov's measure-theoretic foundations were developed) that "Probability is not a notion of pure mathematics, but of philosophy or physics." See p. 37 of their paper Some Problems of Partitio Numerorum III.
