Q:

Who was the first scientist to develop the concept and mathematical formula of string theory?

I was just looking at a YouTube Video interview with Leonard Susskind and did not realize he was the first to discover stings in string theory!

It is an interesting video but I also had read a few articles of other participants in this endeavor such as Veneziano while working at  CERN  and others who were also working on the same idea so I did not think anyone person was really the originator but I believe I am wrong now. I believe he was the first to develop this.
I am wondering if someone is familiar enough with the topic to perhaps comment on the history of it's original founding? 

A:

It was a collective effort, and certainly it is not one formula as the title of your question seems to imply:-)
One of the principal "founding fathers" was Gabriele Veneziano.
