Q:

Which conception of a "machine" allows to call "mechanical" the new physics of the 17th century?

My questions deal more properly with pre-Newtonian modern physics in its Cartesian or Hobbesian versions. 
The word "mechanical" comes from a Greek word meaning "machine". However, the received definition of mechanical philosophy does not contain the concept of a machine. This school of thought is said to adopt the principle according to which 

everything in nature can be explained by the size, the shape and the
  movement of bodies or material objects (one body acting on the other,
  through collision).

Thus, which concept of a "machine" allows calling "mechanical" such a principle?

A:

The etymology of the word "mechanics" is irrelevant here. In 18th century, when this concept prevailed "mechanics" meant a part of physics as we know it now: mechanics created by Galileo and Newton.
The word itself arises in Hellenistic Greece, when the only part of mechanics known at that time was statics. It had a lot of technical applications (building, war engines, etc.) so mechanics was associated with machines. Essentially the same machines were available in the 18th century,
with an important addition: clocks and watches, and other clockwork mechanisms. Comparison of the Solar system with a clockwork was common among philosophers at that time.
But the scope of mechanics was already much wider: it included celestial mechanics first of all.
