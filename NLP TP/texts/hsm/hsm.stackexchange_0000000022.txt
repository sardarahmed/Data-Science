Q:

How was the Ozone Layer discovered?

Related to my previous question When was the division between the troposphere and stratosphere determined?, an important atmospheric feature at this boundary is the Ozone Layer, as shown in the image below:

Given that the Ozone Layer concentration is very low, according to NASA,  

The peak concentration of ozone occurs at an altitude of roughly 32 kilometers (20 miles) above the surface of the Earth. At that altitude, ozone concentration can be as high as 15 parts per million (0.0015 percent).

How was the Ozone Layer discovered?

A:

Wikipedia's article isn't quite up to snuff. It's rather short and largely skips over the early history of research regarding the ozone layer. Here's what it has to say about it:

The ozone layer was discovered in 1913 by the French physicists Charles Fabry and Henri Buisson.

Not a lot of great information. Here, though, it is stated that Fabry worked closely with Alfred Perot to develop the Fabry-Perot interferometer. Its initial applications were in the field of astrophysics, but later

in 1913 they [Fabry and Buisson] were the first to demonstrate
  that the ultraviolet absorption in the Earthâ€™s upper
  atmosphere was due to ozone.

So Fabry took his prior work regarding interferometry and used it to collaborate with Buisson. That said, G. M. B. Dobson was one of the first people to truly explore the ozone layer's properties in detail, using a spectrophotometer to monitor ozone concentrations.
