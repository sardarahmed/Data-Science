Q:

What was the system for naming scientific ideas / inventions?

I'm interested in tracing the history of the word "Optical Illusion."  See these two questions History of optics
 and https://english.stackexchange.com/q/260495/129806
It seems Greek and Latin words were mixed together to make new words / ideas.  Optical Illusion is one: television is another.
Why were words mixed together?  Why not keep the words in the same language?  It appears Greek has a separate word for "optical illusion;" ophtalmarati.  Why was this renamed?

A:

"Optical illusion" is a phrase combining two separate words. Each was already a word in English, adapted (directly or indirectly) from respective Latin and Greek sources. Combining two English words to coin an English phrase is not at all controversial.
