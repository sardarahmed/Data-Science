Q:

Who are credited for angle transformation formulae and law of sines in trignometry

I'd like to who are credited for discovering angle transformation formulae 
$$
\sin(A\pm B)=\sin(A)\cos( B)\pm\cos(A)\sin(B)
$$
$$
\cos(A\pm B)=\cos(A)\cos( B)\mp\sin(A)\sin(B)
$$
$$
\tan(A\pm B)=\frac{\tan(A)\pm\tan(B)}{1\mp\tan(A)\tan(B)}
$$
$$
\cot(A\pm B)=\frac{\cot(A)\cot(B)\mp1}{\cot(A)\pm\cot(B)}
$$
and so on, as well as and law of sines
$$
\frac{a}{\sin A}=\frac{b}{\sin B}=\frac{c}{\sin C}
$$
in trigonometry.

A:

Your first three formulas (addition laws) were essentially known since the beginning of
trigonometry, though they were not written in the modern form. These laws actually predate the definition of $\sin$, $\cos$ and $\tan$.
The only trigonometric function in the ancient Greece was the chord ${\mathrm{chd}}$
which is related to our modern $\sin$ as follows $\mathrm{chd}\, x=2\sin(x/2)$. Ptolemy,
who computed the first trigonometric table makes use of the addition formula for the chord, which is equivalent to Menelaus geometric theorem. Later, when other trigonometric functions were introduced (for convenience of computation) the addition laws were of course written for them as well.
It is a routine matter to rewrite the addition formula for any trigonometric function, once you know it for one of them.
Your third formula, the sine law for a flat triangle, is the limit case of
the similar formula for the spherical triangle,
$$\frac{\sin a}{\sin A}=\frac{\sin b}{\sin B}=\frac{\sin c}{\sin C}.$$
When the triangle is small, the sines of the sides are approximately equal to the sides themselves. Spherical trigonometry actually predates the flat one. Wikipedia article "Law of sines" credits it to various medieval  astronomers in the Middle East, and in Europe - to Johannes MÃ¼ller (Regiomontanus).
Reference. Glen Van Brummelen, in his book Heavenly Mathematics, Princeton 2013
credits the spherical law of sines to Abu Nasr and Abu 'l-Wafa, and their priority dispute is discussed by Al-Biruni. (The special case of the flat Law of sines was stated much later).
