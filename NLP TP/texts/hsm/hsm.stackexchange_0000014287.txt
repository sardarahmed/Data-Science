Q:

Who was E. Midy, the eponym of Midy's Theorem?

I have just become aware of the 19th century French mathematician E. Midy, who apparently was the first to prove what is now known as Midy's theorem.
I can find out nothing about this mathematician beyond the fact that he wrote a paper De Quelques Propriétés des Nombres et des Fractions Décimales Périodiques from which "Midy's theorem" seems to have come.
Does anyone have any access to more information about him? Full name, dates and places of birth and death help to put him into context, but any other relevant details more than welcome.

A:

From the entry for Etienne Midy on Biographies of Scientists - Numericana:

Etienne Midy   (c. 1775,  fl. 1846)
Midy's theorem (1835)
His name is spelled  Meidy  in some records.  He was probably already teaching when  Napoléon  instituted the  lycées,  in 1802.  Midy himself advertised he had taught  mathématiques spéciales  at Cahors (1821-1826) and Orléans (1826-1832) before moving to Nantes.
At the  Collège Royal de Nantes  (future  Lycée Clémenceau)  Midy taught  mathématiques élémentaires  from 1833 to 1837.  That post was entrusted to a young  normalien  (Alexandre Lepord, ENS 1834)  when Midy was promoted to teach  mathématiques spéciales  again in 1837-1838  (after M. Dorveau resigned).  Midy would be replaced in this capacity by M. Gascheau  (previously, professor of physics)  when a ministerial decree  (1838-11-17)  allowed him to retire.
In Nantes,  Etienne Midy lived  3, rue Richebourg,  next to his workplace.
