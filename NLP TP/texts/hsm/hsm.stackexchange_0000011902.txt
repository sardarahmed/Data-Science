Q:

Nobel Prize for Applied Mathematics

There is no Nobel Prize for mathematics. However, have there been any Nobel Prizes for the use of applied mathematics to model the real world?

A:

Here is a list of "Mathematicians who were awarded Nobel prize" taken from
this paper
1902 Lorentz (Physics)
1904 Rayleigh (Physics)
1911 Wien (Physics)
1918 Planck (Physics)
1921 Einstein (Physics)
1922 Bohr (Physics)
1929 de Broglie (Physics)
1932 Heisenberg (Physics)
1933 Schroedinger (Physics)
1933 Dirac (Physics)
1945 Pauli (Physics)
1950 Russell (Literature)
1954 Born (Physics)
1962 Landau (Physics)
1963 Wigner (Physics)
1965 Schwinger (Physics)
1965 Feynman (Physics)
1969 Tinbergen (Economics)
1975 Kantorovich (Economics)
1983 Chandrasekhar (Physics)
1994 Selten (Economics)
1994 Nash (Economics)
The work of all of them, except Russell qualifies as "applied mathematics".
