Q:

how sophisticated was Egyptian and Babylonian mathematics compared to the Greeks

It seems like the focus always tends to be on the achievement of Greek math (which strikes of eurocentrism a little bit) while civilizations like the Egyptians and Babylonians are overlooked
why do we overlook their mathematical contributions?

A:

The achievements of Babylonian mathematics are on a par with the Greek ones. Actually a rather significant part of Greek mathematics is a rewriting in a more modern style of Babylonian material. In contrast, Egypt which received even earlier a similar input, did not find interesting developments.
Much new material and ideas have been presented by JÃ¶ran Friberg in the two volumes of solid work (published unfortunately with bombastic titles):
Unexpected Links Between Egyptian and Babylonian Mathematics, Singapore: World Scientific (2005),
Amazing Traces of a Babylonian Origin in Greek Mathematics, 2007, World Scientific 
The Clay tablets Plimpton 322 and YBC 7289 are famous and offer indubitable evidence of sophistication, e.g. pythagorean triples larger than 10000 and  srt(2) with six digits.
The crux of the history, of course, is the discovery of incommensurables by the Greeks, that is the failing of the old programme "Everything is a Number"; no satisfactory solution being available, a new programme was launched with the moto "Geometry is Real". However in astronomy, during Hellenistic times, the Greeks were still using Babylonian computational techniques (see e.g. A Jones work). 
The accessible sources are not equivalent: there are no traces what arguments or ideas did the Babylonian use, but what they have left are not the results of guesswork. In contrast the text known under the name of Euclides is obviously focused on method.
