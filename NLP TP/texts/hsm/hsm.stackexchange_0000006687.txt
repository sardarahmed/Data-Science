Q:

Who was the first individual that used the word "torus" to refer to $\mathbb{S}^{1} \times \mathbb{S}^{1}$?

Further, I believe that the idea to call it thus had to do with its resemblance to the "torus" in the base of some Greek columns of old:

What do you think of this hypothesis of mine?
Thanks in advance for your knowledgeable replies.

A:

Hero mentions the work of Dionysodorus in his "Metrica" this way: "διονυσωδώρω έν τω περί τησ σπείρασ έπιγραφομένω", namely "Dionysodorus in his work On σπείρασ". 
In modern Greek σπείρασ stays for "spirals", but was used in ancient Greek for the Latin torus.
You can find the original text here at page 128, line 3 and 4.

Answer from Mathword

TORUS. Hero mentions a mathematician named Dionysodorus as the author of On the Tore, in which a formula for the volume of the torus is given [DSB].
An early use of torus as a mathematical term in English is in 1860 in The Practical Draughtsman’s Book of Industrial Design by William Johnson: “In geometry, the torus is a solid, generated by a circle, revolving about an axis, continuing constantly in the plane of this axis, in such a manner, that all sections made by planes passing through the axis are equal circles, and all sections by planes perpendicular to the axis will also be circles, but of variable diameters.” [Google print search]

So, do you think the term used for Greek columns was named for the geometric term as in Dionysodorus?  Or the other way around?
