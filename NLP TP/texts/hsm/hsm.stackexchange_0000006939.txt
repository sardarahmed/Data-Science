Q:

How was geometry with 3 dimensions discovered/invented?

I wondered if back in the time of ancient Greeks mathematicians, 3D geometry was discovered as result of plane geometry? (Was there anything in the axioms of plane geometry that indicated existence of 3D geometry?) or was 3D geometry a familiar concept already and there were simply attempts to find its axioms?
Basically, at the time of ancient Greeks mathematicians was geometry discovered mathematically or was it familiar concepts for which axioms were derived? 

A:

Three-dimensional Geometry is what the last three books of Euclid's Elements are about. No, it was not discovered mathematically, at least not in sense that it was seen as a generalization of two-dimensional Geometry. Already in ancient Egypt and Babylon it was known how to compute the volume of a truncated quadrangular pyramed, for instance, long before axioms were introduced in Geometry. What Euclid added was an axiomatic approach to an already known subject, besides, possibly, adding a few new theorems of his own.
