Q:

Where can I find Grothendieck's letter of resignation from Bourbaki?

I encountered Grothendieck's resignation letter from Bourbaki along with its English translation not too long ago on the web, but for now it seems it's nowhere to be found. I've scoured through the Grothendieck circle site for the letter, but to no avail.

A:

Here is an English translation of Grothendieck's letter dated October 9, 1960.
Here is the letter in its original French.
May also be of interest, Grothendieck's stolen correspondence of 1985.
