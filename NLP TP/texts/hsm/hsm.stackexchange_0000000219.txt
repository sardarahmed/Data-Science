Q:

How did ancient Egyptians become aware of the analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties of cold?

Cooper, S. M., and R. P. R. Dawber. "The history of cryosurgery." Journal of the royal society of medicine 94.4 (2001): 196-201. claims:

The benefits of cold have been appreciated for many thousands of
  years. The ancient Egyptians, and later Hippocrates, were aware of the
  analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties of cold.

What cold object/water/etc. did ancient Egyptians use for analgesic and anti-inflammatory purpose? I am surprised they could have objects that were cold enough for this use.

A:

The claim that Egyptians were aware of the benefits of using cold objects appears to be from the Edwin Smith Papyrus, a famous Egyptian scroll on ancient medicine. I found the abstract of a paper here that goes into some detail:

As long ago as 300) BC, the use of cold compresses to treat compound skull fractures and infected wounds were mentioned in an Egyptian papyrus, identified by the historian Breasted as the Edwin Smith Papyrus.

It goes on to quote from the papyrus:

The portion of cryotherapy is translated by Breasted as follows:

Thou shalt make for him cool applications for drawing out the inflammation from the mouth of the wound.

So it appears that the Egyptians would create a compress filled with something slightly cooler, such as water, and use it to treat the wound.
This isn't yet a full answer; I'll add more later.
