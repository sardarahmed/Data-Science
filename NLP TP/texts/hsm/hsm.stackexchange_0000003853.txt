Q:

Who said “Either you speak maths or you speak nonsense?”

I am in the process of preparing a lecture and remember that some of the Gods (highly esteemed researchers of the past) said, “Either you speak maths or you
speak nonsense.” Perhaps is was “Either you talk maths or you
talk nonsense.”
Any idea of the exact quotation and its original source, including the author?

A:

Googling around, I have found this quote somewhere on facebook:
John McCarthy:
Those who don't speak math are doomed to speak nonsense.

However, this apparently are not the actual words. Wiki quote claims that the actual wording was:
He who refuses to do arithmetic is doomed to talk nonsense

dated ~1995, so.. it is possible that somebody said it earlier too
