Q:

The earliest reference I can find to "banana brackets" is in:

G. Malcolm. Data structures and program transformation. Science of Computer Programming, 14(2-3):255-280, October 1990.

Where they are clearly crescent-moon/banana shaped symbols: ⦅...⦆.
The later style using $($ and $|$ seems to be a typographic practicality, and is used by Malcolm himself in another publication the same year:

G. Malcolm. Algebraic data types and program transformation. PhD thesis, Groningen University, 1990.
