Q:

History of the definition of complex derivative

Almost all of modern complex analysis (Cauchy residue theorem, analytic continuation, etc) depend on the definition of a complex derivative.
That definition requires the derivative at a point $z_0$ is the same no matter which direction the limit is taken to that point.
$$ f'(z_0)=\lim_{z \rightarrow z_0} \frac{f(z)-f(z_0)}{z-z_0}$$
This definition is quite strong, and leads to the Cauchy Riemann conditions.
Question: Why did this definition become the standard one?
Why didn't, for example, a derivative that depends on direction become standard?
If other options are possible, do they lead to useful but different complex analysis?

A:

In general, definitions in mathematics are not arbitrary. Useful definitions are those which lead to interesting and important objects. This particular definition is good because it leads to an interesting and important class of functions.
A function $f(z)=u(x,y)+iv(x,y), z=x+iy,$ of one complex variable is the same
as two real functions of two real variables. So partial derivatives, directional
derivatives etc. can be defined, but you do not obtain anything new with these definitions, in comparison with real calculus of functions of several real variables. Since this theory (real calculus) exists for functions of any number of real variables, one does not obtain anything new.
The definition of complex derivative uses the field structure on complex numbers in a very essential way: it involves division. There is no "division" of real vectors. And this definition leads to a remarkable and useful class of functions: complex analytic functions.
