Q:

Heisenberg's Obituary to Pauli

In an interview of Heisenberg by Thomas Kuhn:

When Pauli had died, I was asked to write this memorial volume. Weisskopf had asked me. Then, actually, originally I had written an article on Pauli's philosophical views, but this article was not accepted. Weisskopf said, "Well, this article is very nice, but you know we don't like to discuss this side of Pauli so much. We want to see Pauli as a physicist." So actually I was a bit angry about Weisskopf, but, well, I had to take his opinion, and apparently other people agreed. Afterwards I did publish my article of Pauli's philosophical views. I first then published it in German. May I give you a copy? Later on it did appear in a rather obscure periodical in the United States because there were still some people in America who were still interested in it, but not the physicists. These were people of a different structure. Still, I like this article on Pauli's philosophical views. I think that I had succeeded in describing very accurately how Pauli's mind was constructed. I also hoped that I had made it clear to many people that I liked this kind of mind, and that my own mind is not so very different from that of Pauli. I may just have it here.

Any detail of this article (title, name of journal of publication,...) would be really appreciated.

A:

I think the article in question is:

Heisenberg, W. Wolfgang Paulis philosophische Auffassungen. Naturwissenschaften 46, 661â€“663 (1959). https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00594803

I found it via citation in this article.

A:

The English translation by Kurt Leidecker is referenced as "Wolfgang Pauli's philosophical views", in Main Currents in Modern Thought, volume 17, pages 51-54 (1961).
The paper is also cited as "Wolfgang Pauli's philosophical views. Towards a new understanding of the unitary order of the cosmos," pp.38-41. The journal is indeed quite obscure and I'm not able to locate a copy of that issue in any library.
