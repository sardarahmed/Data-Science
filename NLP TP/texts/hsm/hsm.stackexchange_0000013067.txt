Q:

Who named Black Hole?

A black hole is a compact region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, even light, can escape from its event horizon, and, interestingly, Einstein didn't accept this viewpoint. Now, I'm curious:  who named "Black Hole"? And when? I know that John Archibald Wheeler is best known for using the term "black hole", but I heard that he adopted this term from the other physicists. Does anyone knows extra formal information about this? For example, when was the term "black hole" used for the first time in a manuscript?
Thanks you very much in advance ...

A:

Space.com claims that

The term "black hole" was coined many years later in 1967 by American
astronomer John Wheeler.

Which, given Conifold's references via Wikipedia, lead me to propose that Wheeler gets credit for making the name "go viral."   As with many names or inventions in science (e.g., who gets credit for television), fame goes to the person who is at the 'tipping point' rather than the original inventor/discoverer.
