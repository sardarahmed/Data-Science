Q:

Did anyone ever try to determine or propose the algebraic role of Euler-Mascheroni constant?

Both the constant $\pi$ and the constant $e$ have clear algebraic roles in complex numbers and in differential calculus.
But did anyone ever propose an algebraic role for Euler-Mascheroni constant $\gamma$?

A:

The answer is yes:
