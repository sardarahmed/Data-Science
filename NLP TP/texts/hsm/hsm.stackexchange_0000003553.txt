Q:

Which came first, Coulomb's law or Gauss's law?

which one has been discovered earlier? Coulomb's law or Gauss's law?
I've read that Gauss's law is more fundamental and of course we can derive Gauss's law using Coulomb's law and vice versa.
But my question is that which one is discovered earlier?

A:

Cavendish verified the Coulomb's law in the early 1770s, but did not publish,  Coulomb published it in 1785 in his first three reports on electricity and magnetism. For magnetic poles the law was established even earlier by Michell in 1750, explaining Newton's inverse cube law for the magnetic dipole in Principia (1687), see Is Coulomb's law the earliest mathematical formula describing electricity? 
So when Gauss was born in 1777 Coulomb's law was already known. He only formulated Gauss's law in 1835, and it was not published until 1867, when Maxwell already stated it as one of his four equations in 1861-62. It is interesting however that the divergence theorem which relates one law to the other in modern expositions was discovered by Lagrange in 1762, and then rediscovered multiple times, by Gauss in 1813, Poisson in 1824, Ostrogradsky in 1826, and Green and Sarrus in 1828.
