Q:

Lost memoir of Évariste Galois

According to the Wikipedia article on Évariste Galois

He submitted his memoir on equation theory several times, but it was
never published in his lifetime due to various events. Though his
first attempt was refused by Cauchy, in February 1830 following
Cauchy's suggestion he submitted it to the Academy's secretary Joseph
Fourier, to be considered for the Grand Prix of the Academy.
Unfortunately, Fourier died soon after, and the memoir was lost.

Abel's memoir was lost in a similar circumstance by Cauchy and Legendre some years prior to this incident and was only recovered partially, until 2002 when the last few missing pages were also found.
Question: Similar to this, has Galois' lost memoir ever been found?

A:

There have been several versions of the memoir. The last version was sent by Galois to his friend  Auguste Chevallier.   just before the duel and was published by Camille Jordan. For details see the book.
