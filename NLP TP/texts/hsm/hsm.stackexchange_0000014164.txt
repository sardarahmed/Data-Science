Q:

Notation of Poynting vector

I know that the Poynting vector is defined as the cross-product $\vec{E}\times\vec{H}$ and that is "usually" denoted by $\vec{S}$ or $\vec{N}$.
I wonder if there is a particular reason for these names. I've also seen it indicated with $\vec{P}$ and this makes more sense as it could stand for "Poynting". Do the others refer to something?

A:

Prior to Heaviside, notation in electromagnetism was mixed, and vector notation as we know it today was not in use. Rather, equations were often expressed component-wise, although the concept of a vector still existed. Heaviside, who developed much of the modern vector notation we use today, used $\mathbf{W}$ to represent this additional energy term as early as 1884.
For use of $\mathbf{S}$: As noted in this article, "Energy in Electromagnetism: The Poynting Vector" published in IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine, the notation $\mathbf{S}$ first appeared in H. A. Lorentz's The Theory of Electrons and Its Applications to the Phenomena of Light and Radiant Heat (1909) p.23, where he says:

As to the transfer of energy represented by (39), it must necessarily take place at the points of the surface $\sigma$ itself, because our theory leaves no room for any action at a distance. Further, we are naturally led to suppose that the actions by which it is brought about are such that, for each element $d\sigma$, the quantity $c[\mathbf{d}\cdot\mathbf{h}]_n d\sigma$ may be said to represent the amount of energy that is transmitted across this particular element. In this way we come to the conception, first formulated by Poynting${}^1$, of a current or flow of energy. It is determined by the vector product of $\mathbf{d}$ and $\mathbf{h}$, multiplied by the constant $c$, so that we can write for it
$$
\mathbf{S} = c[\mathbf{d}\cdot\mathbf{h}]\qquad\qquad\qquad\text{(42)}
$$

Where Lorentz uses $c$ for the speed of light, and $[\ \cdot\ ]$ represents the cross product. He doesn't give any justification for choosing $\mathbf{S}$.
It was not used by some significant physicists, including Max Abraham and Hermann Minkowski, nor was it used by Whittaker in his History of Theories of the Ether and Electricity (1910), see e.g. p.348. But G. H. Livens did use $\mathbf{S}$ in The Theory of Electricity (1918), (second edition available here) which was influential.
