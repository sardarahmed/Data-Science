Q:

Who was the first to use the phrase "the standard model" of something?

I was doing some reading on stellar structure, and I noticed the phrase "the standard solar model" used to describe the structure of the Sun, and stars in general. It reminded me of the Standard Model of particle physics. Also, the $\Lambda$-CDM model is sometimes referred to as "the standard model of cosmology." There are other uses of the phrase.
Who first used the phrase "the standard model" to describe a theory? Was it first applied to the Standard Model of particle physics, or was it used somewhere else?

A:

Its first appearance in particle physics was in Pais, A., and S. B. Treiman (1975), "How Many Charm Quantum Numbers are There?" Physical Review Letters 35, no. 23, p.  1556. The point was to stop repeating "what we all agree on, the SSB gauge theory of SU(2)xU(1) of...", dropping the names of the contributors, an increasing list that would then quickly  slip off to "me too / him too" bibliographical tangents. Worse yet, people would champion their favorite contributors with emphasizing different aspects of the model, declaring them as more conceptually crucial. It was thus a brilliant argument stopper, adopted very quickly.
To my knowledge,  the name was spread to cosmology by particle cosmologists in the 1980s.
I am not, however, familiar with its usage in other, more remote fields.
