Q:

When were the abbreviations of chemical elements standardized?

This is going to be tricky because the discovery/synthesis of elements has taken place over centuries. It might be best to restrict this purely to the elements contained on Dmitri Mendeleyev's table, but I'd let the community decide. It may be too broad if all the elements are included, so this may be the best course of action.
Anyway, my question is fairly straightforward. When (and by who) were the elements on the periodic table (the modern-day one or simply Mendeleyev's) first standardized? I'd prefer that any answers not use Wikipedia.

A:

Elements were standardized before we were even talking about chemistry: The alchemical elements were all well-known to those dabbling in that "science".  This should put the answer to your question around 1670 according to the Proposal for Alchemical Symbols in Unicode
As for modern chemical symbols, the first notation approximation of modern elements I could find are John Dalton's elements in 1808 where we can still clearly see alchemical influences on his representations of elements, though evolving more towards modern notation.
In the virtual tour of the basement of the Museum of the History of Science in Oxford, you will find Charles Daubeny's "Symbols of Simple bodies" dated to 1831.
So not an exact date, but depending on your definition of "(al)chemical elements" middle of the 17th century or early 19th century.
