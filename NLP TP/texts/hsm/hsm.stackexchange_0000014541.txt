Q:

What mathematical expressions took a long time for a closed form to be found?

The Basel problem, $\sum_{n=1}^\infty{\frac{1}{n^2}}$, took 90 years for a closed form, $\frac{\pi^2}{6}$, to be found.
I'm curious to know what other mathematical expressions, especially those involving limits, took a long time for a closed form to be found. (By "found", I mean discovered and verified.)

A:

Euler's Pentagonal number theorem was discovered by Euler in 1775, published in 1783. In his paper Euler gave only heuristic arguments. The first
rigorous proof
was obtained by Jacobi in 1829.
The theorem is an identity for formal series:
$$\prod_{n=1}^\infty(1-x^n)=\sum_{-\infty}^\infty(-1)^nx^{n(3n-1)/2}.$$
