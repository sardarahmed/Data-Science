Q:

Which were the first PhD thesis in Mathematics and Physics?

Were there PhD thesis in the time of Galileo and Newton?
Did Newton and Galileo make a PhD thesis?
Due to the poor level of science (before calculus and so on), were PhD thesis made in math and physics?

A:

According to the Mathematics Genealogy Project:
Galileo Galilei was a student of Ostilio Ricci
The official tutor of Isaac Newton (M.A.) was Benjamin Pulleyn
; Isaac Barrow was NOT a formal advisor but probably had the greatest influence on the young Newton
But neither of these held the actual title "Ph.D."...History 
If Erhard Weigel (1652) is indeed the first Ph.D. (as some have suggested), then that would be mathematics.
