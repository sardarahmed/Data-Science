Q:

Did Feynman win the Putnam by a "large margin"?

From James Gleick's Genius: the life and science of Richard Feynman:

One of Feynman’s fraternity brothers was surprised to see him return home while the examination was still going on. Feynman learned later that the scorers had been astounded by the gap between his result and the next four.

Is this true? From what I can tell, he was simply one of the 5 top scorers in the 1939 Putnam Competition. It seems that other resources say the same thing, but I can't find any primary evidence.

A:

This is Feynman's memory of an unnamed person who told him that. To quote him in an interview:

Anyway, I was among the first five. I have since found out from somebody from Canada, where it was scored, who was in the scoring division—he came to me much later and he told me that it was astonishing. He said that at this examination, “Not only were you one of the five, but the gap between you and the other four was sensational.” He told me that. I didn’t know that. That may not be correct, but that’s what I heard.

Thank you Dave L Renfro for pointing me here. I was lucky to find this -- the word "Putnam" was never mentioned!
