Q:

When did derivative mean not only "slope of tangent" but also "instantaneous rate of change"?

When did derivative mean not only "slope of tangent" but also "instantaneous rate of change"?
Fermat was interested in minima and maxima, and realized these occur when the tangent has zero slope.  When was it realized that this slope of tangent was the same thing as an instantaneous rate of change, i.e. velocity?
The post History of the derivative/tangent of a curve discusses the history of the tangent notion, but not the instantaneous rate of change notion.

"Fermat was interested in minima and maxima, and realized these occur when the tangent has zero slope. When was it realized that this slope of tangent was the same thing as an instantaneous rate of change, i.e. velocity?"

As far as Fermat is concerned, it should be noted that he did not work with any notion of "slope" at all, as far as I am aware.  He did realize that at minima and maxima of an expression (he didn't use functions, either), the change of the expression is only quadratic in the change $E$ in the variable.
While he of course found the tangent line for many curves, he did not think of them as representing the rate of change as we do today.  Some recent publications on Fermat can be consulted at https://u.math.biu.ac.il/~katzmik/fermat.html
