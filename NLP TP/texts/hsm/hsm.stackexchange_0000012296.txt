Q:

Mr. Newton at the Royal Mint

I would like to ask how Isaac Newton specifically applied mathematics to reducing forgeries and improving coinage while he was Master of the Royal Mint.
Thank you.

A:

This is not mathematics, but Newton invented the ridges on coins to prevent theft. I am not sure if he invented it while he was director of the Royal Mint, but I suspect so.
In good ol times, coins were made of valuable metals (in fact, they were worth their value). Thieves would scrape the coins around the edge, thus making them smaller (but hardly noticeable the difference), to obtain a bit of that valuable metal. By making ridges on the sides, it was clear if a coin had been scraped.
Always a genius.
