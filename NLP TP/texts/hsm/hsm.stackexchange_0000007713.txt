Q:

When was the energy of the electron first measured?

Can you give a few details? where/how was it measured, was the value .511MeV found right away, etc..

Readers who'd like a proper answer to the question may find this link useful.
The value found by this experiment is .537 MeV
I do hope that someone can answer the question from an historical point of view, specifying when this experiment was made first, and if Einstein's conjecture (we all know that his 1905 paper was not even intended as a proof by himself) was verified by any different experiment.

A:

I suspect what you really are after is the electron's mass, since we can then "easily" get its energy via an obscure :-) equation developed by some fellow named Einstein. 
The path thru measuring the charge-to-mass ratio, followed by some famous oil-drop experiments, is discussed pretty well in a physics.SE page.
