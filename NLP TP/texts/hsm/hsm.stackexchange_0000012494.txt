Q:

Archimedes - method of mechanical theorems - centroid of hemisphere

Hoping a philomath can help - I'm searching how Archimedes calculates the centroid of a hemisphere without calculus  as behind the below sentence in the  wikipedia entry on "the Method of Mechanical Theorems":
"This type of method* [leverage argument - please see wikipedia] "can be used to find the area of an arbitrary section of a parabola, and similar arguments can be used to find the integral of any power of x, although higher powers become complicated without algebra. Archimedes only went as far as the integral of x3, which he used to find the center of mass of a hemisphere, and in other work, the center of mass of a parabola." ...
"Other propositions in the palimpsest
"A series of propositions of geometry are proved in the palimpsest by similar arguments. One theorem is that the location of a center of mass of a hemisphere is located 5/8 of the way from the pole to the center of the sphere. This problem is notable, because it is evaluating a cubic integral."

I found reference to Proposition 12 in Archimedes, the Center of Gravity, and the First Law of Mechanics
2nd edition The Law of the Lever Andre K.T. Assis which is "If any number of straight lines drawn from the origin to meet the spiral make equal angles with one another, the lines will be in arithmetical progression."
I am intrigued how Archimedes could use the integral of a cube by the leverage argument to determine the centre of mass of a hemisphere and a parabola?  I know the proofs by calculus which Archimedes did not have full access to - although he seems to have used some of its concepts.  Archimedes intuitive and elegant method of leverage has much didactic benefit - but this part escapes me.
Maths stackexchange refers to Pappus but also has footnotes referring to Archimedes but again no explanation:

A:

I confirm that Archimedes did  get the centroid of a hemisphere.
This can be done - without calculus -using the leverage argument in the wikipedia article relying on the integral of a cube which follows from the leverage argument after using Archimedes method for the centroid of a parabolic segment which Archimedes go in Proposition 8 of Book 2 (see
The Works Of Archimedes : Heath,T.L.).
Take a hemisphere of radius 1.
So for the hemisphere, volume of hemisphere is 2/3pi.
Here Archimedes proves the centroid of a parabola is 3/4 which shows the integral of the cube is 1/4 - by geometry and the leverage argument! (start with the center of gravity of parabolic segment and go from there).
Using leverage this balances the integral of pi.x(1-x^2)=pi(x-x^3)=pi(1/2-1/4)=pi/4
So if centroid of hemisphere is "x" then
x.2/3pi =pi/4
so x=3/8 QED
Hats off to Archimedes! Eureka!! Wikipedia is right on this!!!
