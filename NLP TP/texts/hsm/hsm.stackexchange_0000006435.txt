Q:

Has Alphonse Pyramus de Candolle's "Géographie botanique raisonnée" ever been translated into German or English?

Alphones Pyramus de Candolle (1806-1893), the son of Augustin-Pyrame de Candolle (1778-1841), has been an important figure (as was his father) in the development of plant geography.
The younger Candolle's work "Géographie botanique raisonnée" (1856) has been an especially  important text for the history of plant geography since it combines botanical arithmetic with hypothesis driven scientific research. The scholar Janet Browne call this text "the cornerstone of mid-century ideas on the subject".[^1]
I was wondering if this text (or any of his for example his "Essai élémentaire de Géographie botanique" from 1820) has been translated in either German or English as these two languages were the other principal languages of biological distribution studies. It would also help myself, since my French is regrettably limited.

EDIT: As noted in my answer the Essai élémentaire de Géographie botanique was written by Auguste de Candolle.

Further research has shown, that there exists a list of de Candolle's publications from 1824 until May 1883:

Liste complète des ouvrages et opuscules publiés par M. Alph. de Candolle dans le laps des soixante années de 1824 à mai 1883.

It's available on Hathi Trust..
On top of that, and even more comprehensive, is Frans Stafleu's Taxonomic Literature. Here's is Volume 1 and here's the supplementary Volume III on Alphonse de Candolle.
Both do not list any translation of "Géographie botanique raisonnée".
P.S.: I also realized, that the "Essai élémentaire de Géographie botanique" from 1820 was actually written by Auguste de Candolle (the father) and not by Alphonse. I have edited my question as regards to this.
