Q:

Literary works authored by mathematicians

At a first glance, Mathematics and Literature look like two completely unrelated subjects. 
I wonder whether there are examples of acclaimed mathematicians which wrote novels, poems, or other literary works not related to mathematics.

EDIT. Following a request by  HDE 226868, I invite all the answerers to give some more details about the author and the cited literary works, whenever possible. Thanks to all of you. 

A:

Bertrand Russell wrote many books and essays on philosophy and social justice, and was awarded a Nobel Prize in Literature.
And the Persian mathematician Omar Khayyám wrote poetry: quatrains that have been translated into English as the Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám.

A:

Hausdorff wrote many literary and philosophical works, including poems and a play, under the pseudonym Paul Mongré.

A:

Many mathematicians wrote their autobiographies, see the answers to

Quite a few also have engaged in writing literary fiction.
For example, Sofya Kovalevskaya (apart from memories about her childhood) wrote a novel: Nihilist Girl, translated by Natasha Kolchevska with Mary Zirin ; introduction by Natasha Kolchevska. Modern Language Association of America (2001) ISBN 0-87352-790-9.
Kovalevskaya also collaborated with Anne Charlotte Leffler on a play (according to the Wikipedia page of Leffler, the title is The struggle for happiness). 
In our times, Michèle Audin, known for her achievements in symplectic geometry, is a member of Oulipo.
She recently published a novel: La formule de Stokes, roman, Cassini, 2016, 297 p. (ISBN 9782842252069) However, in view of the preferred mode of creation by Oulipo, this work may be not entirely unrelated to mathematics. It is a novel, though, not a  scholarly or popularizing work.
