Q:

Notation from Weyl's algebraic number theory book

In Weyl's "Algebraic Theory of Numbers", which was written in 1940, there are many symbols that look handwritten, such as Fraktur (or SÃ¼tterlin, whatever you want to call it) letters for ideals. His symbol for the rational numbers looks to me like something else entirely. You can see it a few times at the start of Chapter IV:

What is that symbol?!?  I suppose it should be a letter, but when I look online at samples of handwritten Fraktur nothing resembles what Weyl is writing for rational numbers. I thought maybe it could be a lower-case q, but the way it curves on the bottom is going the wrong way for it to be a convincing q.

A:

On page 10 of that book the author wrote

The most important example of a ground field is the field of common rational numbers for which I use the freely invented symbol 9...

where he uses the symbol in question instead of the 9 that I used above.
