Q:

Why is the Bondi-Van der Burg-Metzner-Sachs group often called only Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group?

In general relativity, the Bondi-Van der Burg-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) group is the group of symmetries of future null infinity. To the best of my knowledge, it originated in the works of Bondi, Van der Burg, and Metzner and later in the work of Sachs.
In spite of this, I have read multiple references that refer to this group as the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group, ignoring Van der Burg. I'd say this is evident in the abbreviation BMS, instead of BVMS, for example. Furthermore, Wikipedia calls the group the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group.
Why is Van der Burg often ignored in the name of the BMS group? Isn't he one of the authors of the original paper?

A:

The paper by Bondi et al. is unusual in that different parts (A-D) are signed by different authors. Its history and context are thoroughly described in an (open access) article by D. C. Robinson. Julian van der Burg, who was Bondi's PhD student, only signed Part B (together with Bondi), while Kenneth Metzner is the only signatory of Part C. Robinson states, though, that Bondi wrote the whole article. The super-translations of the BMS group appear only in Metzner's Part C and are then discussed in Part D, signed only by Bondi. Rainer (Ray) Sachs generalised these findings in a subsequent publication. Metzner was an American PhD student of Philip Morrison's at Cornell who joined the "collaboration" when Bondi was visiting during a sabbatical. Robinson quotes van der Burg with a statement from 2009 saying

To this day I have no idea who Metzner is.

In summary, the acronym BMS seems chosen correctly, listing all authors who contributed to the concepts behind.
