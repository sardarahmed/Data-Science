Q:

Earliest proof of the soundness of first order predicate logic

When was the soundness theorem for first order predicate logic (quantification theory) first proven?
Is there any evidence that soundness was presupposed or taken as self-evident prior to 1930?

A:

See D.Hilbert & W.Ackermann, Principles of Mathematical Logic: the 1950 American translation of the 1938 second edition of Grundzüge der theoretischen Logik.
The 1928 first edition is considered the first elementary text exposing the formalism now known as first-order logic.
See §9 The Consistency and Independence of the System of Axioms, page 87-on.
The consistency proof is based on an arithmetical interpretation in the universe $\{ 0,1 \}$ showing that all the axioms always yield the value $0$ and, in addition, that if one or more formulas always have the value $0$, any other formula obtained from them by means of the rules [of inference] likewise always gives the value $0$.
