Q:

Equation for the conservation of vis viva

How did Christiaan Huygens come across the fact that the quantity $mv^2$ is conserved during motion? I would like to know his thought process and how he derived or proved this result.

A:

In "Tractatus de motu corporum ex percussione" Christiaan Huygens showed energy conservation during the elastic impact. His investigations were triggered by a question of the Royal Society. Also Wren and Wallis gave answers. Wallis treated the inelastic impact, Huygens and Wren the elastic impact.
Huygens considered the impact in two different inertial systems, one of them being the centre-of-mass system. There he found that for both cases the vis viva was conserved. He wrote the equation already in modern form:
$m_1v_1^2 + m_2v_2^2 =m_1v_1'^2 + m_2v_2'^2 $
