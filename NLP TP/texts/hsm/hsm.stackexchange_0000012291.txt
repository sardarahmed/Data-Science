Q:

Original derivation of the Dyson equation

In what paper did Dyson derive the Dyson equation, as shown on Wikipedia?

A:

It is equation (63) in his epochal second paper, Dyson, F  J  (1949). "The S matrix in quantum electrodynamics", Phys Rev 75 (11), 1736.
He refers to his first one, but the systematics in momentum space of the reducible self energy Î£ are there.
