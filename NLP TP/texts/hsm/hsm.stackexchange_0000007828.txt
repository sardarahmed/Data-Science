Q:

Where is the Foucault pendulum in Mainz?

A Foucault pendulum in Mainz is listed on Wikipedia. The article says that it is in

School for Business and Technique, Mainz

However, I didn't find any information about this pendulum on the Internet. I know that this question is not fully in the profile of this site, but maybe someone know that

where exactly is this Foucault pendulum and when is it visitable.

A:

Summary of comments, per OP’s request:

As observed by @njuffa, there is no apparent trace of a Foucault pendulum at (closest match) Hochschule Mainz’s School of Business (Wirtschaft) nor School of Engineering (Technik).
Could it, then, be a mixup with — or relocation to — nearby Experiminta Museum in Frankfurt am Main, which  does have one, half an hour away and missing from the wiki list?
