Q:

Feynman story: providing two different explanations for the same phenomenon

There's a story told about Feynman in a non-scientific book (whether written by him or another, I don't recall) that I'm trying to track down.
If I recall correctly: he's part of a group (perhaps while still a student) that's trying to think of an explanation for some phenomenon. He offers one - perhaps based in physics - and is praised for it. He then offers a completely different one, and claims that the exercise is nonsensical: he can always fit a theory to such limited data.
Does anyone have a reference for (or correction to!) this?

A:

See the story "Meeeeeeeeeee!" at 
https://www.e-reading.club/chapter.php/71262/17/Feynman_-_Surely_Youre_Joking%2C_Mr._Feynman__Adventures_of_a_Curious_Character.html
in which he gives comparisons between poetry and physics but considers such analogies not to be meaningful since he thinks he could do the same between poetry and any other subject.
