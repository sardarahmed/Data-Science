Q:

When did bounties and prize money for open mathematical problems start being a thing?

I'm a science/math journalist [ger] and currently I'm working on an article about the culture of prize money/bounties for solving open mathematical problems (Millennium Prize Problems and such). One section will be about the history of such bounties for which I'd like to ask you for some historical examples. I will certainly include the bounties in the Scottish Book from the Lwow School, as well as Erd√∂s' faible for betting money on open problems. Thanks to a respond on the same question on MathOverflow I will also include the bounty for solving the three body problem, announced by king Oscar II of Sweden as an older example.
Now my question is: Does any of you know further examples for such rewards and maybe even know reliable sources for these?
Thank you very much for your help!

A:

I'm not sure which is the earliest. But one of the earliest I knew of is due to Mobius.
In 1846, Mobius invited Grassmann to paricipate in a competition to solve a problem first set by Liebniz: to derive a geometric calculus without coordinates, his famous analysis situs. His entry was the winning entry - it was also the only entry. Grassmann of course is responsible for the modern development of linear and exterior algebra.
I think I first read about this first in a biography of Grassmann.
