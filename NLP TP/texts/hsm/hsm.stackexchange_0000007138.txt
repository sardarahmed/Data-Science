Q:

Why is distance sometimes abbreviated S?

While distance in physical formulas is often abbreviated as d (which is pretty intuitive), another common abbreviation is s, as seen e.g. here, here or here. It also seems to be used in optics to represent focal distances.
Does anyone happen to know what S stands for? A quick look at Latin and Greek terms for "distance" doesn't seem to reveal anything starting with an S.

A:

I think it most likely stands for spatium. E.g. Euler’s first book Mechanica (1736) uses $s$ throughout and first introduces it as follows (p. 13):

Theorema. (...) oportet determinare tempus, quo arcus $\mathrm{AM}$ absolvitur.
Solutio. Sit spatium $\mathrm{AM}$, sive sit linea recta sive curva, $=s$, et celeritas, quam corpus habet in $\mathrm M$ sit $c$ (...). Integrando ergo habebitur tempus, quo totus arcus $\mathrm{AM}$ absolvitur $=\int\frac{ds}c$.

(I don’t know who started this. A letter of Leibniz to Huygens (1690) has “resistence $r$, vistesse $v$, temps $t$, espace $s$”. Johann Bernoulli’s work on caustics (1692) has spatium curvilineum (p. 57) but apparently not the letter $s$, which he uses in later papers (ibid. pp. 60, 309, 316, 409).)
