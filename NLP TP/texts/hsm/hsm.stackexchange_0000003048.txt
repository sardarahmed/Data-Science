Q:

Historical roots of the justification for the rule for multiplication of negative numbers

As a follow up question with respect to : Who wrote down minus times minus is equal to plus? and to : Historically, how did people define multiplication for negative numbers?, it can be interesting to trace the first "modern" justification for the rule :

"minus multiplied by a minus makes a plus".

If it is quite intuitive that "if you have a debt of $3$ by $3$ people, then you have a debt of $9$" (we can justify it reducing multiplication to repeated sum) it is not so easy to imagine a debt of $3$ by "minus" $3$ people.

For a (negative) reference, see :

Isaac Newton, Universal Arithmetick : or, A Treatise of Arithmetical Composition and Resolution. To which is Added, Dr.Halley's Method of Finding the Roots of Equations Arithmetically (latin manuscript : Arithmetica Universalis (edited and published by William Whiston, Newton's successor as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, in 1707, based on Newton's lecture notes).

See page 3 :

Quantities are either Affirmative, or greater than nothing; or Negative, or less than nothing. Thus in humane Affairs, Possessions or Stock may be calld affirmative Goods, and Debts negative ones. [...] A negative Quantity is denoted by the Sign $-$ ; the Sign $+$ is prefix'd to an affirmative one [...].
In an Aggregate of Quantities the Note $+$ signifies, that the Quantity it is prefix'd to, is to be added, and the Note $-$, that it is to be subtracted. And we usually express these Notes by the Words Plus (or more) and Minus (or less). Thus $2+3$, or $2$ more $3$, denotes the Sum of the Numbers $2$ and $3$, that is $5$. And $5-3$ or $5$ less $3$, denotes the Difference which arises by subducting $3$ from $5$, that is $2$. [Note the clear distinction of the two usages of the signs $+$ and $-$.]

Then see page 16 :

Simple Algebraick Terms are multiply'd by multiplying the Numbers into the Numbers, and the Species into the Species, and by making the Product Affirmative, if both the Factors are Affirmative, or both Negative : and Negative if otherwise. Thus $2a$ into $3b$, or $- 2a$ into $- 3b$ make $6ab$, or $6ba$; for it is no Matter in what Order they are plac'd. Thus also $2a$ by $- 3b$, or $- 2a$ by $3b$ make $- 6ab$.

Useful "post-Newtonian" references :

William Jacob s'Gravesande, The Elements of Universal Mathematics or Algebra (1728 - Latin original : 1727), page 9 :

if the Signs of Multiplicand and Multiplicator are familiar (or the same) the Product will be Affirmative, but Negative if they are different.

The explanation of the minus times minus case is in terms of "symmetry", followed by an intuitive example :

There is taken away in this Case a negative Quantity, by which the Negation vanishes. So to take away a Debt is to pay it [emphasis added].

It is useful to compare with the fully "algebraic" explanation by one of the most brilliant Newton's followers:

Colin MacLaurin, A Treatise of Algebra (posthumous : 1748 - 3rd ed 1771), page 13 :

By the definitions, $+a-a=0$; therefore, if we multiply $+a-a$ by $n$, the product must vanish or be $0$ because the factor $a-a$ is $0$. [...] Therefore $-a$ multiplied by $+n$ gives $-na$.
In like manner, if we multiply $+a-a$ by $-n$, the first term of the product being $-na$, the latter term of the product must be $+na$, because the two together must destroy each other, or they amount be $0$, since one of the factors (viz.$a-a$) is $0$. Therefore $-a$ multiplied by $-n$ must give $+na$.

Possible source :

Francois Viète  (1540 – 1603), , The Analytic Art (In artem analyticam isagoge 1591), RULE III : To multiply one magnitude by another, page 19 :

If a positive term of one quantity is multiplied by a positive term of another quantity, the product will be positive and if by a negative the result 
  will be negative. The consequence of this rule is that multiplying a negative 
  by a negative produces a positive, as when $A - B$ is multiplied by $D - G$. 
  The product of $+ A$ and $- G$ is negative, but this takes away or subtracts too 
  much since $A$ is not the exact magnitude to be multiplied. Similarly the 
  product of $- B$ and $+ D$ is negative, which takes away too much since $D$ is 
  not the exact magnitude to be multiplied. The positive product when $- B$ is 
  multiplied by $- G$ makes up for this. 

The geometrical interpretation can be traced back to ancient Greek geometrical algebra; see Euclid's Elements : II.7 and II.4.

For a "pure" algebraic exposition, see :

John Wallis (23 November 1616 – 28 October 1703), A Treatise of Algebra (1685), page 78-79 :

Unde patet ratio tum hujus regulae, $+$ in $+$ facit $+$; tum hujus $-$ in $+$ facit $-$. [...] Indeque patet ratio tum hujus regulae, $+$ in $-$ facit $-$; tum hujus, $-$ in $-$ facit $+$.

The "justification" is that to multiply a given quantity by a positive factor is ponendi ("ubi $+2$ significat bis ponere") while to multiply it by a negeative factor is tollendi ("ibidem $-2$ est bis tollere, seu bis ponere contrarium").

Contra vero, $-A$ per $-2$ multiplicare, est bis tollere $-A$, seu defectum $-A$ bis supplere, quod est $+A$ bis ponere, facitque $+2A$, (adeoque $-$ in $-$ facit $+$.)
