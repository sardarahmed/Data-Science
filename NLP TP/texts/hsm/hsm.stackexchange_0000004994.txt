Q:

Was there any atomic model(s) that came between Bohr's and the actual beginning of Quantum Mechanics in early 20s?

Well, the question arose in the physics chat when slereah mentioned about it.
So, was there any prominent model that came to light after Bohr and before the actual beginning of Quantum Mechanics in early 20s?
As Slereah mentions:

History of physics texts rarely mention models of that era

What were the developments in this topic during that specific period?

A:

To my knowledge the first documented atomic model considering Planck’s action quantum was formulated by the Austrian Arthur Erich Haas (1884-1941). He hypothesized in 1910 a relation between the action quantum and the size of atoms. 
A substantial initiation progress was postulated by John William Nicholson (1881-1955) (Cambridge) who in 1912 formulated the quantization of angular momentum and conjectured an explanation of Ritz’s series rule of hydrogen spectra. (shortly before Niels Bohr’s model).
In conclusion, Niels Bohr wasn’t the first to formulate a relationship between the quantum of action and the atomic structure. However Bohr soon became friend of Nicholson who must have inspired him. The whole story of the many try-and-error attempts of Bohr’s atomic model are documented in a trilogy published in “The Philosophical magazine” July 26, 1913.
