Q:

What is the first reference to a nondeterministic Turing machine?

I am looking for the first reference of a Nondeterministic Turing machine. There is no mention of them in the 1936 paper "On Computable Numbers."

A:

According to SEP, non-determinism was introduced by Rabin and Scott in Finite Automata and their Decision Problems (IBM Journal of Research and Development, 3(2) 114â€“125, 1959). Their main result was that it does not lead to a stronger notion of computability:

"The automata used throughout Chapter I were strictly
  deterministic in their tape-reading action, which was
  uniquely determined by the table of moves, since there
  was one and only one way the machine would change its
  state in any particular situation. Requiring all machines to
  be of this form can lead to rather cumbersome details, in
  view of the large number of internal states needed even
  for some relatively elementary operations. In this section
  we introduce the notion of a nondeterministic automaton
  and show that any set of tapes defined by such a
  machine could also be defined by an ordinary automaton.
  The main advantage of these machines is the small
  number of internal states that they require in many
  cases and the ease in which specific machines can be described."
