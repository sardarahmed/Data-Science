Q:

How old is the peer-review process in scientific publishing?

Everything is in the title but just to expand on the question, I am wondering if there was any publication process similar to the peer-review process in the past (and when). If not, does it mean that anybody could widely release its results without any control?

A:

Wikipedia has a nice page about the peer-review process, which includes a section on its history:

The first recorded editorial pre-publication peer-review process was
  at the Royal Society of London in 1665 by the founding editor of
  Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, Henry Oldenburg. In
  the 20th century, peer review became common for science funding
  allocations. This process appears to have developed independently from
  that of editorial peer review.
The first peer-reviewed publication might have been the Medical Essays
  and Observations published by the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1731.
  The present-day peer-review system evolved from this 18th-century
  process.
A prototype professional peer-review process is recommended in the
  Ethics of the Physician written by Ishāq ibn ʻAlī al-Ruhāwī (854–931).
  His work states that a visiting physician must make duplicate notes of
  a patient's condition on every visit. When the patient was cured or
  had died, the notes of the physician were examined by a local medical
  council of other physicians, who would decide whether the treatment
  had met the required standards of medical care.
Peer review has long been a touchstone of the scientific method, but
  it had only been performed by editors in chief or editorial committees
  until the end of the 19th century.

The Wikipedia also points to some very interesting, thorough resources:

According to the article Peer Review in 18th-Century Scientific Journalism (Kronick, 1990), state that peer-review had its antecedents in the 17th century, and that

the beginnings of "peer review" are frequently associated with the Royal Society of London when it took over official responsibility for the Philosophical Transactions in 1752

However, according to the article The ups and downs of peer review (Benos et al. 2007) suggests that the scientific peer review system had its basis in Edinburgh in the early 18th century, from the article:

It was not until 1731 that the Royal Society of Edinburgh published Medical Essays and Observations, the first peer-reviewed collection of medical articles 

Where the editor of the journal

distributed the submitted essays for review to individuals he considered to be “most versed in these matters

There was a disclaimer even then that the peer-reviewed articles did necessarily mean that the content of the article was truthful or accurate and stated that

As always, the submitting authors were ultimately responsible for the quality and veracity of their own research

However, an important point made by both authors is that there has been many cases of editors exercising different policies and methods of ensuring the veracity of scientific articles, with Benos et al. stating:

The development of peer review was gradual and somewhat haphazard. Different editors employed varying styles of peer review.
