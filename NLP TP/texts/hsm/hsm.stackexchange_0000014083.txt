Q:

When was it realized that the giant planets do not have solid surfaces?

When was it realized that the gas giant planets Jupiter and Saturn, and the ice giant planets Uranus and Neptune, do not have solid surfaces?
When was that idea first proposed and when was it accepted by astronomers?

A:

Prehistory goes back to the second half of 19th century after Fraunhofer introduced astronomical spectroscopy, and then Kirchhoff identified some spectral lines in the Sun's spectrum in 1860s. Rutherfurd observed the spectrum of Jupiter in 1863, but its import remained murky until 1920s. For example, in a 1906 Scientific American article Erber noted great similarity in the observed chemical composition of Jupiter and Saturn, and mentioned that Joussen found presence of hydrogen there, but his pictures indicate that he still thought an observer could stand on Saturn's surface, complete with hills and clouds above.
Only in 1920s Jeffreys conjectured gaseous (hydrogen-rich) composition. The confirmation came in 1930s largely due to Wildt, see Taylor et al., The Composition of the Atmosphere of Jupiter:

"Modern studies of the composition of Jupiter's atmosphere
date back to the mid-nineteenth century, when the near-
infrared spectrum of the planet was viewed by Rutherfurd
(1863) using diffraction gratings of his own manufacture. He discovered features that remained unidentified until 1932, when Wildt showed that the unknown spectral lines were due to ammonia and methane. In later years, building on the original insight of Jeffreys (1923, 1924), Wildt and others went on to note that the low density of Jupiter and the presence of these hydrogen-rich compounds in the atmosphere were consistent with a bulk composition similar to that of the Sun, that is, primarily hydrogen."
