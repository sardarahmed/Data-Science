Q:

What are some of the most complete genealogies of scientific and mathematical subject areas?

I am interested in the way scientific and mathematical subject areas developed (and are still developing). One of the great visual tools that can help us gain insight in how these areas developed is by creating a "genealogy". 
For the case of mathematics: I already asked about it here (on Quora). Although there is a genealogy of mathematicians, (take a look over here), to my knowledge there is no such thing for mathematical subject areas. There are a few so-called "mind-maps" that show how some (certainly not all) mathematical areas are connected, but they don't take into account the historical developments that are relevant (another example is the Mathematical Atlas made by Dave Rusin, which unfortunately currently can't be viewed online). 
So, to come back to the question: do you know of any (annotated) genealogies of scientific and/or mathematical subject areas? I think those can be great to help one gain a broad perspective on the history of science and mathematics, however crude it may be. 

A:

History of Mathematics Classification
To see how the classification of mathematics has developed historically, compare the ancient classification of mathematics:

Arithmetic (discrete math)
Geometry (continuous math)

to that of Descartes' era:

Analytic Geometry

Arithmetic (discrete math)
Geometry (continuous math)

to the 1868 classification in Jahrbuch Ã¼ber die Fortschritte der Mathematik:

History and Philosophy
Algebra
Number Theory
Probability
Series
Differential and Integral Calculus
Theory of Functions
Analytic Geometry
Synthetic Geometry
Mechanics
Mathematical Physics
Geodesy and Astronomy
(+ 38 subcategories)

to the modern zbMATH or MSC2010 classifications of mathematics.

History of Physics Classification
For physics, cf. my question "Classification of experimentally-determined physics laws?"
