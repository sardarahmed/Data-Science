Q:

Is Vedic Science true?

I somewhere read that ancient Indian science was so advanced even in 2000 B.C. (or may be even before this) that Indian scientist and mathematicians calculated the value of distance between sun and Earth. They even found the value of $\pi$. They made a piller made of iron which resists rusting.They did even more. It is said that they wrote all their discoveries in scriptures which can be found even today. They called it Vedic science. 
So my question is: Is it possible that they could have found and done all these things? If yes, how? If no, how?
I am not claiming that they did those things. But it has confused me for so long.

A:

There is no "Vedic science".
There is an ancient Indian mathematics as well as an ancient Indian astronomy.
They are comparable (from an historical point of view; not in term of "better or worse") to ancient Egyptian mathematics, Babylonian astronomy,  Chinese astronomy.

Regarding the question :

Is Vedic Science true?

if you consider e.g. Jyotisha, i.e. the traditional Hindu system of astrology, we have the Siddhānta:  the branch of Jyotisha devoted to calculating the position of the planets and other heavenly bodies :

According to this theory, the earth is motionless and is not considered a planet. Seven planets (Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn) revolve around the earth.

Thus, this theory is false.
Regarding Samhitā : Mundane astrology, and Horā : Predictive astrology, they are clearly not scientific at all in any "modern" sense.
