Q:

Who used "Tabellenstatistik" as a derogatory term in the history of biogeography?

I recently read the book "The secular ark" by Janet Browne on the history of plant geographical studies.
In the chapter "A Science of Patterns", a subsection entitled "Tabellenstatistik" is included, that tries to answer, why people were so enamored with numerical surveys of plants. 
On page 75 in this subsection she writes:

"Later, this preoccupation with figures was derisively called Tabellenstatistik, after a similar episode in German political economy where, for a short period, theory was disregarded in favour of numerical data alone."

Does anybody know what Browne is referring to here? It would be very interesting to know the context a little bit better in which this was said and of course by whom it was said. So far my own searches didn't bring anything up. I have also wrote a message to Browne herself in August, but thought it won't hurt to ask here as well.

A:

Histories by Twellmann (2014, pp. 148-154), Westergaard (1916, pp. 230-231; 1890, pp. 249-250), John (1884, pp. 88 sq, 128 sq) or Knies  (1850, pp. 23-24) all point to “the Göttingen school (1806-1811)”, with e.g. Lueder who wrote in (1817, pp. 221-222):

After and next to the true statisticians, who described the State in words, there arose a new kind of statisticians, who described the State in numbers: political arithmeticians, table fabricators, or, as Brandes so aptly named them, table serfs.

Edit: As to similar controversies in biogeography, Rudwick (1978, p. 236) has a slightly earlier and more specific claim than Browne:

Bronn (1831)’s tables are an outstanding example of the ‘statistical’ approach in paleontology at this time (remembering that ‘statistics’ meant simply a compilation of quantitative data). (...) Yet only incidentally in the midst of all this ‘Tabellenstatistik’ (as its critics scornfully called it) did Bronn (...)

By the way, Rudwick (p. 229) attributes the first (non-derisive) use of the word statistics in botanical geography to de Candolle (1820, p. 362; see also 1838a, 1838b, 1840), but it is already (semi-derisively...) in von Humboldt (1817, p. 18).
