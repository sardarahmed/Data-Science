Q:

Citation of Brouwer needed

In a letter to Zeilberger the late Alexander Zenkin states that Brouwer called set theory "a pathological incident in history of mathematics from which future generations will be horrified". (See Doron Zeilberger: "Opinion 68" (2005)
I could not find the source. Where, if at all, did Brouwer say so?

A:

I have done a lot of research without any result. The quote is also given in "How Humans Learn to Think Mathematically: Exploring the Three Worlds of Mathematics" and asked the author by e-mail 3 days ago. There was no reply. I am convinced meanwhile that the quote is not authentic. If there will be any positive reaction I will edit this answer.
