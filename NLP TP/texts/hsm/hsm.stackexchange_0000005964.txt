Q:

Did Fraenkel's article on $Number$ for Klein's volume on Gauss discuss set theory?

As a follow-up to this earlier question on Fraenkel and Klein, I am interested in the actual contents of the article Fraenkel apparently wrote for Klein's volume on Gauss, which I don't have access to.  Did Fraenkel's article actually discuss set theory which was Fraenkel's specialty?

A:

Fraenkel's article does not discuss set theory but gives a review, based on Gauss' letters and notes, how Gauss understood and defined the numbers in comparison with Bolzano, Cauchy, Dedekind, and others.
Only on p. 5 Fraenkel asserts that Gauss' famous quote "I protest firstly against the use of an infinite magnitude as a completed one, which never has been allowed in mathematics" does not mean what it appears to mean to the avearge reader and does not condemn the infinite in general. He claims that Gauss would have agreed with Cantor.
On the last pages 48-49, Fraenkel mentiones sytems with infinitely many dimensions, but not set theory.
