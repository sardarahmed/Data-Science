Q:

How did Newton & Raphson's versions of the N-R method differ?

To quote Wikipedia,

Raphson's most notable work... contains a method, now known as the Newton–Raphson method... Newton had developed a very similar formula in his Method of Fluxions, written in 1671, but this work would not be published until 1736, nearly 50 years after Raphson's Analysis. However, Raphson's version of the method is simpler than Newton's, and is therefore generally considered superior. For this reason, it is Raphson's version of the method, rather than Newton's, that is to be found in textbooks today.

It's a shame we normally call it Newton's method, since if anything it should be named after the otherwise forgotten Raphson. But what was Newton's version of the formula? Raphson's is our modern formula,
$$x\mapsto x-\frac{f(x)}{f'(x)}.$$

A:

According to Peter Deuflhard's A Short History of Newton's Method, Newton began by familiarising himself with the methods of Vieta, which had been simplified by Oughtred.  (Vieta's method was already known to al-Kāshī, who published a method using Vieta's perturbation technique in 1427, though Vieta appears to have been unaware of al-Kāshī's work.)

As an example, he discussed the numerical solution of the cubic
  polynomial $$f(x) := x^3 - 2x - 5 = 0.$$ Newton first noted that the integer part of the root is $2$ setting $x_0 = 2$.
  Next, by means of $x = 2 + p$, he obtained the polynomial equation  $$p^3+6p^2+10p-1 = 0.$$ He neglected terms higher than first order setting $p ≈ 0.1$. Next, he
  inserted $p = 0.1 + q$ and constructed the polynomial equation $$q^3 + 6.3q^2 + 11.23q + 0.061 = 0.$$  Again neglecting higher order terms he found $q ≈ −0.0054$. Continuation of the process one further step led him to $r ≈ 0.00004853$ and therefore to the third iterate $$x_3 = x_0 + p + q + r = 2.09455147.$$

Deuflhard continues 

In 1690, Joseph Raphson (1648–1715) managed to avoid the tedious computation
  of the successive polynomials, playing the computational scheme
  back to the original polynomial; in this now fully iterative scheme, he
  also kept all decimal places of the corrections. He had the feeling that
  his method differed from Newton’s method at least by its derivation.

Note that neither Newton nor Raphson mention derivatives, even if, as Deuflhard notes :

Note that the relations $10p − 1 = 0$ and $11.23q + 0.061 = 0$ given above
  correspond precisely to $$p = x_1 − x_0 = −f(x_0)/f′(x_0)$$
  and to $$q = x_2 − x_1 = −f(x_1)/f′(x_1).$$

Finally

In 1740, Thomas Simpson (1710–1761) actually introduced derivatives
  (‘fluxiones’) in his book ‘Essays on Several Curious and Useful Subjects in
  Speculative and Mix’d Mathematicks [No typo!], Illustrated by a Variety
  of Examples’. He wrote down the true iteration for one (nonpolynomial)
  equation and for a system of two equations in two unknowns thus making
  the correct extension to systems for the first time. His notation is already
  quite close to our present one (which seems to date back to J. Fourier).

Also worth noting is that, according to UBC Math

At first sight, the method Newton uses doesn’t look like the Newton
  Method we know. The derivative is not even mentioned, even though the
  same manuscript develops the Newtonian version of the derivative!
