Q:

Motivation of Continuous Functions

What is the historical motivation of continuous functions? Also, does anyone know who first isolated the idea?

A:

Isolation of the modern concept is generally attributed to Bolzano (1817; translation) and/or Cauchy (1821), with some controversy on their independence: see Grattan-Guinness (1970), Freudenthal (1971). Kline (1972, p. 950) says Bolzano’s motivation was to rigorously prove the fundamental theorem of algebra, and on his way, the intermediate value theorem — stated in his memoir’s title.
