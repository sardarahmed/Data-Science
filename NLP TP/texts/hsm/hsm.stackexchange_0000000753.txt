Q:

Two competing definitions at the birth of the unit "meter"

It might be famous that $\pi^2$ is a good approximation to the gravitational acceleration in the unit "meter per second squared".
My explanation for this is the seconds pendulum, which was proposed as the definition of "meter" back to the birth of the unit, competing with the meridional definition.
However, I don't see why the two competing definitions of meter have to be close to each other.  I don't know any pre-existing unit of length for their reference.  And in the meridional definition, the "ten-millonth" seems to be chosen just for convenience, doesn't it?
So why the "meter" according to the seconds pendulum and the "meter" according to the meridian turn out to be close? Is it purely a coincidence?

A:

It is a pure coincidence. And the agreement is not so good. Meter was introduced in connection with decimal system. They wanted all units to be based on decimal system,
including angular and time units.
So it was decided to have 100 decimal degrees in the right angle, and 20 hours in a day.
Each hour was divided into 100 decimal minutes, a decimal (time) minute into 100 decimal
time-seconds. Similarly with angular measures: one degrees is 100 angular minutes.
The kilometer was supposed to be one (angular) decimal minute of the (Paris) meridian.
Similarly to the nautical mile which is defined as one angular (sexagesimal) minute of the
meridian. And meter is 1/10 of one angular decimal second of the meridian.
During the rule of the French revolutionary government, they actually made clocks, watches
and angle measuring instruments with this decimal division. It was abandoned during the
rule of Napoleon I.
That acceleration of gravity is roughly 10 meters/$sec^2$, where $sec$ is the
Babilonian (sexagesimal) second, is a pure coincidence.
A coincidence of the same sort as $\pi^2\approx10$.
