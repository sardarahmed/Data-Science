Q:

Lengths as equivalence classes

From Wikipedia on cardinal numbers:

The oldest definition of the cardinality of a set $X$ (implicit in
  Cantor and explicit in Frege and Principia Mathematica) is as the
  class $[X]$ of all sets that are equinumerous with $X$.

My question is simple:

Who was the first to state explicitly that the length of a line
  segment $l$ is the class $[l]$ of all line
  segments that are equal to $l$ (in the sense of Euclid)? And who can be assumed to have known or considered this implicitly? Euclid himself?

Probably not the first but a very important author did state it like this:

(Hartshorne, Geometry: Euclid and beyond (1997), p. 3)

A:

Intuitively, Euclid understood this. Probably. (It is very difficult to speculate
what a person who lived 2300 years ago, and about whom we really know nothing, understood). Euclid's Elements was rigorously formalized by Hilbert
(Foundations of Geometry, end of 19th century, there are translations to many languages, including English). He essentially corrected what Euclid "probably understood but could not express well", and filled many gaps in Euclid.
This includes the notion of length. In the modern approach length is a function on the set of intervals which takes values in real numbers. This is equivalent to what you say. Equivalence relation a set is mathematically the same as a function on the set (which sends an element of the set to its equivalence class).
For a very accessible discussion of this and other questions about Euclid's Elements I recommend the book by R. Hartshorne, Geometry. Euclid and beyond.
Hilbert's book is also very readable. But on my opinion, Hartshorne is the best. One can also read Euclid, but this is difficult, and it is recommended to read him with modern comments (by Heath or Hartshorne).
