Q:

Is there a formal distinction between potential and actual infinities?

In modern set theory the difference between actual infinity and potential infinity is often not understood or even denied. Some decades back however mathematicians like Hilbert or Poincar√©, let alone Cantor or Fraenkel were fully aware of the difference. My question: Does there exist a formal definition of potential infinity in contrast to actual infinity, and who was the first to give it?

A:

Not "formal" but quite precise: Aristotle and apeiron.
See Meta, Book IX ($\Theta$), 1048b10:

The infinite and the void and all similar things are said to exist potentially
  and actually in a different sense from that in which many other things are said
  so to exist, e.g. that which sees or walks or is seen. [...] But the infinite does not exist potentially in the sense that it will ever actually have separate existence; its separateness is only in knowledge. For the fact that division never ceases to be possible gives the result that this actuality exists potentially, but not that it exists separately.

And Phys, Book III, 4, 206b17:

By addition then, also, there is potentially an infinite, namely, what we have
  described as being in a sense the same as the infinite in respect of division. For it will always be possible to take something ab extra. Yet the sum of the parts taken will not exceed every determinate magnitude, just as in the direction of division every determinate magnitude is surpassed and there will always be a smaller part.

And 207a32:

It is reasonable that there should not be held to be an infinite in respect
  of addition such as to surpass every magnitude.
