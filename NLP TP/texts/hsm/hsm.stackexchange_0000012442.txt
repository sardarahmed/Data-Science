Q:

An English translation of Simon Stevin's De Thiende

I enjoy reading manuscripts written by mathematicians of old, and I would love to read the famous De Thiende by Simon Steven. I've done some research online here and there, but I have not found any English translations.

A:

An old English translation is available on Google Books (or in transcribed form here). The Dictionary of Scientific Biography entry for Stevin lists several translations in its bibliography.
