Q:

Reverse subtraction: has any culture had a symbol (call it $\oplus$) where $A \oplus B$ (read in the same direction as in the language) $:= B - A$?

The standard use of the minus sign is such that $A-B$ means you subtract B from A. Thus $$5-2 = 3.$$ Has any culture used a symbol (let's call it $\oplus$) where $A \oplus B$ means you subtract A from B? Thus you would get $$2\oplus5=3.$$
Note that in languages written from right to left, this question has to run in that direction. What I am interested in is the case when reading symbols written in the standard direction (whichever direction that is) you would say "A [symbol] B" and get the answer $B-A$.
That 3 is said to be equal to $$5 \;[\text{symbol for subtraction}] \;2$$ rather than $$2 \;[\text{symbol for subtraction}] \;5,$$ and more generally we write $$[\text{minuend}]\;[\text{symbol for subtraction}]\;[\text{subtrahend}], $$ is of course convention. I am interested in whether any cultures have used a symbol for "reverse subtraction"; and if so, how widespread its use has been, both in absolute terms and relative to the use of a minus symbol with the usual meaning. Perhaps there have been cases where the "reverse" symbol has been the standard one, or the only one; or perhaps two symbols have been in more or less equally widespread use, one for one meaning and one for the other?

A:

It may remain a mystery in some cases.  Britannica states that the ancient Egyptians wrote right-to-left but also states that their algorithm for subtraction is not known.
Then again, Wichita   says (sadly, without a picture),

In one example, from the Rhind Papyrus, addition and subtraction
signs were represented through figures which resemble the legs of a
person advancing for addition, and departing for subtraction.

They did have a horizontal "equals" glyph.
