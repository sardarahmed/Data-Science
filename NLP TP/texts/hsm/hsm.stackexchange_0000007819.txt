Q:

Who solved the quantum harmonic oscillator?

In continuation of this question, Who introduced the creation and annihilation operators for the harmonic oscillator?, I got curious who came up with the quantum harmonic oscillator originally. 
I am aware that the simple classical harmonic potential arises from the definition of $F = kx$ as a central force, thus $F = \nabla V$ and $ V = \frac{1}{2} kx^2 $. But what was the purpose of plugging such a potential into the Schrödinger equation? 
Nowadays the harmonic oscillator is the simplest way to model chemical bonds but I assume that it had a different purpose in the dawn of quantum mechanics. 

A:

In matrix mechanics: Born, Max; Jordan, Pascual, Zur Quantenmechanik, Z. f. Physik 34, 858-888 (1925). ZBL51.0728.08. (27 September 1925)
In wave mechanics: Schrödinger, Erwin, Quantisierung als Eigenwertproblem. II, Annalen d. Physik (4) 79, 489-527 (1926). ZBL52.0966.01. (23 February 1926)
(“Old quantum theory” also discussed oscillators and even zero-point energy, but I guess that’s outside the scope of this question.)
