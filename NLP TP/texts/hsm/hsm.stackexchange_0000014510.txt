Q:

Who came up with the theory of Krylov Subspaces?

The well celebrated field of numerical linear algebra is heavily based on Krylov subspace methods. A quick google search on Krylov himself returned the following results:

Nikolay Krylov (1941-) [Russian mathematician]
Aleksey Krylov (1863-1945) [Russian engineer and mathematician]
Nikolay Krylov (1879-1955) [Russian mathematician]

But it seems that none of them have personally been a part of the creation or development of "Krylov Subspace Method" and most definitely not in numerical linear algebra.

Question: If it is not some "Krylov" who led foundation of the "Krylov subspace methods" then who was/were the mathematician(s) that were part of its invention.

A:

It was Aleksey Krylov, see (in Russian):
