Q:

Who discovered L'H么pital's rule?

Who discovered the rule of L'H么pital?
In the Wikipedia article, it is mentioned that it was not l'H么pital who proved the rule but that it might have been Johann Bernoulli.
I even heard something about l'H么pital paid Bernoulli for the privilege to publish the proof instead of him.
Is this true? Are there any proofs for this theory? Or is it totally nonsense?

A:

According to Carl Boyer's A History of Mathematics, this is the case.  
According to Boyer's account, Jean Bernoulli's father Nicolaus had intended Jean to become a merchant or physician, and Jean did in fact write his dissertation in 1690 on effervescence and fermentation...

but the following year he [Jean Bernoulli] became so deeply interested in the calculus that during 1691-1692 he composed two little textbooks on the differential and integral calculus, although neither was published until long afterward.  While in Paris in 1692, he instructed a young Marquis, G.F.A. de L'Hospital (1661-1704) in the new Leibnizian discipline; and Jean Bernoulli signed a pact under which, in return for a regular salary, he agreed to send L'Hospital his discoveries in mathematics, to be used as the marquis might wish.  The result was that one of Bernoulli's chief contributions, dating from 1694, has ever since been know as L'Hospital's rule of indeterminate forms.  ....  This well-known rule was incorporated by L'Hospital in the first textbook on differential calculus to appear in print - Analyse des infiniment petits, published in Paris in 1696.  This book, the influence of which dominated most of the eighteenth century, ...

Boyer goes on to say of L'Hospital :

L'Hospital was an exceptionally effective writer, for his Traite analytique des sections coniques, published posthumously in 1707, did for analytic geometry of the eighteenth century what the Analyse did for calculus.
