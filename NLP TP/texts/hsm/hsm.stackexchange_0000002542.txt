Q:

How was the composition and structure of water determined?

Water is a pretty basic molecule that people used since early science. What were the steps in figuring out what water is made of and what is its structure?

A:

Composition (i.e. water is not an element):

1783: The Scottish inventor James Watt published a paper on the composition of water in 1783; Cavendish had performed the experiments first but published second. Controversy about priority ensued. (source: Wikipedia - Cavendish)
1783: Lavoisier began a series of experiments on the composition of water which were to prove an important capstone to his combustion theory and win many converts to it. Many investigators had been experimenting with the combination of Henry Cavendish's inflammable air, which Lavoisier termed hydrogen (Greek for "water-former"), with dephlogisticated air (oxygen) by electrically sparking mixtures of the gases. All of the researchers noted the production of water, but all interpreted the reaction in varying ways within the framework of the phlogiston theory. In cooperation with mathematician Pierre Simon de Laplace, Lavoisier synthesized water by burning jets of hydrogen and oxygen in a bell jar over mercury. (source: Wikipedia - Lavoisier)

Ratio of oxygen to hydrogen:

1805: Gay-Lussac and Humboldt discover that water is formed by two parts of hydrogen and one part of oxygen (by volume). (source: Wikipedia - Gay Lussac)
1842: Dumas fixed the ratio H:O as 2:16. (source: Atomistry - Atomic weight of hydrogen history)
