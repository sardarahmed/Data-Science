Q:

How has the estimate of the number of stars in the universe changed over time?

Current estimates for the number of stars in the universe are about 10^22. However, that number has changed several times as new observations have come forth. How has the estimate of the number of stars in the universe changed over time? What was the estimate after Hubble's findings? What was the estimate in the 70s, 90s, etc., and what new discoveries forced those estimates to change?

A:

Do you mean the observable universe? We can only see stars whose light has reached us since the big bang, but the universe is much larger. We don't even know whether it is infinite. This article discusses estimates since 1995, giving a current estimate of $10^{24}$.
