Q:

When and WHY did mathematicians start turning their attention to imaginary exponents?

When and WHY did mathematicians start turning their attention to imaginary exponents? I read on Wikipedia about Euler's correspondences with Bernouille and such, but it doesn't answer what exactly triggered this. What did they hope to achieve by exploring such things? Why did they not do this earlier? 
I have recently read the history of fractional exponents and how they were a suggested notation according to the laws of exponents by Nicole Oresme for numbers which were not "nice" (natural number) powers of each other (e.g. 4 and 8, $\frac{3}{2}$; and expressions like $5^\frac{1}{3}$ were taken to mean the number whose cube is 5). I don't know whether Oresme's work had the same philosophy of exponents as Euler's though! 

A:

The original object of study was logarithm, rather then exponent. Logarithm (discovered by Napier) was an important function, both in pure and applied mathematics. So people started asking what the log of a negative number can be.
Research on this question quickly lead to paradoxes. (Which still cause difficulties to students).
The solution of these paradoxes is mostly due to Euler, who explained that understanding of logarithm was impossible without considering complex values (of argument and of the function). Moreover, he understood that logarithm is a "multivalued function". To simplify the matter, he
introduced the inverse which is an honest, single valued function of a complex variable. This is the genesis of the exponential function.
