Q:

Emmy Noether's announcement in 1932 ICM

I read a book "a history of abstract algebra"- chapter 6 by Israel Kleiner.  And in this book, it is said that Emmy Noether gave a presentation at the ICM congress held in Zurich in 1932, and that the content was the starting point of modern cohomology theory.  And the reference for this part is M.K. Smith's "Emmy Noether's contributions to mathematics, Unpublished notes (13pp, CA 1976)", but no matter how much I search on Google, I can't find a resource where I can read this paper.  So in the end, what I want to ask are

What did Emmy Noether present at the 1932 ICM convention?

Which of the contents presented by Emmy Noether could have been the starting point of modern cohomology?

A:

All past ICM proceedings are available online in one place: https://www.mathunion.org/icm/proceedings. Scroll down to the year 1932, where pp. 189-194 in volume 1 is Noether's paper, which starts on p. 197 in that pdf file. The basic point is that the multiplicative relations among the standard basis elements in a crossed product algebra are an example of a 2-cocycle.  This is entirely in the direction of abstract algebra and number theory, not topology (one of your tags), so you be disappointed.
See also the section "Class field theory and cohomology" on pp. 42-45 in Chapter 1 of Peter Roquette's book Contributions to the History of Number Theory in the 20th Century. This is also available as manuscript 29 The Brauer-Hasse-Noether theorem in historical perspective on Roquette's webpage https://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~roquette/manu.html.
