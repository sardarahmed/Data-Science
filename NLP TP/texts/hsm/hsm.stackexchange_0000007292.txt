Q:

Has science fiction ever caused scientists to do real research?

Has science fiction ever caused scientists to do real research?

Science fiction here means fiction that tries to explain things in the world rather than speculate about the future or unexplorable past (e.g. aliens having travelled to Earth 100 million years ago is unexplorable).
Real research means the one based on scientific methods, such as experimental analysis, statistics and so on.
I am interested in natural science such as physics, biology, chemistry, etc, as well as history rather than human-created such as mathematics.

Some examples of science fiction according to my definition may include the fiction describing dark matter, 
human and animal behavior (e.g. fiction describing hunter-gatherer society where women can be hunters), historical speculations (say, ancient europeans travelled Americas), etc.
No way I am asking for a big/complete list of such examples, just most remarkable ones if there even are any.

Science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke is often credited with the idea of communication satellites.  link  That was in 1945, long before any artificial satellite had been launched in reality.

One such case comes to my mind: Jules Verne's novel Green ray (1882). Jules Verne popularized this rare phenomenon, and it seems that it has not been scientifically studied before. After Jules Verne novel, the green ray has been photographed and explained. See Wikipedia "Green flash" where there is a list of literature (Jules Verne included!).

While it may not be research exactly, the fictional cases of Sherlock Holmes did actually influence the way real world police agencies and detectives approached forensic science.  
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote about Holmes using fingerprint identification roughly 10 years before the police started to rely on it.  Also, Holmes did a lot of soil analysis before it was standard forensic practice.
