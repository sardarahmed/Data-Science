Q:

which country launched N-95 mask for the first time?

I did much searching about the N-95 mask but couldn't find any clue about its main  country, i.e. who launched it. Can anyone let me know which country really launched it?

A:

According to the article The untold origin story of the N95 mask:

The first single-use N95 “dust” respirator as we know it was developed by 3M, according to the company, and approved on May 25, 1972. 

The article details the use and development of the precursors to the N95, noting that initial use of the N95 was for industrial applications.  It was the appearance of drug resistant tuberculosis and HIV in the 1990s which brought the mask into clinical use.
