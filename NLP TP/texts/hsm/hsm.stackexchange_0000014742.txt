Q:

The First Published book on Algebraic Topology

As far as I know, according to google, Eilenberg, Steenrod's book: Foundations of Algebraic Topology was published in 1952, and Spanier's book: Algebraic Topology was published in 1966.

My Questions are the following:

Is there any book on Algebraic Topology which was published between 1952-1966?
Is there any book on Algebraic Topology which was published before 1952?
Can someone provide me with a list of the first few published books on Algebraic Topology?

A:

"The first" is either Listing (1847), or Veblen (1922), or Lefschetz (1942), depending on what counts. Here's Dieudonné's book list from his History of Algebraic and Differential Topology:

"It took about 30 years to construct a theory of homology applicable to curvilinear "polyhedra," embodying all the ideas of Poincaré and entirely
rigorous... The first treatise on this "classical" algebraic topology was Veblen's Analysis
Situs, published in 1922 (but a preliminary version was given as "Colloquium lectures" in 1916); it was followed by the much more complete book Topology by Lefschetz (1930), the very popular Lehrbuch der Topologie of H. Seifert and W. Threllfall (1934), and the book by P. Alexandroff and H. Hopf entitled Topologie I (1935)."

Lefschetz's L'Analysis situs et la géométrie algébrique (1924) can be added to the list. But it should be said that Listing's Vorstudien zur Topologie (1847) already included what came to be a part of algebraic topology (Listing numbers of 2D manifolds). He also pioneered the name "topology" in a letter of 1836.
Betti published his early work on homology in a paper rather than a book, Sopra gli spazi di un numero qualunque di dimensioni (1871), as did Poincare, the official "founder" of the subject, using Leibniz's name Analysis Situs (1892ff). He also coined the term "Betti numbers".
The term "algebraic topology" appears in Steenrod's paper Universal Homology Groups (1936),
Lefschetz then used it as the title of his 1942 book, a reworked version of his 1930 Topology, see Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics. Despite the earlier occurrences, the current spread of "topology" and "algebraic topology" is probably due to his influence, see Markus's biography.
