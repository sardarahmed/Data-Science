Q:

Are there any sources of mathematicians talking about their research methods?

I recall reading this article that was written to explain how Descartes read philosophy effectively. I am wondering if such analogous tips have been made by past mathematicians?

A:

Cédric Villani's Birth of a Theorem does exactly that. A great read for scientists, even non-mathematicians.
Edit: The English title of the book is Birth of a Theorem and not Living Theorem (the French title is Théorème Vivant). Thanks to Torsten for pointing it out.

A:

Mathematicians rarely describe the process which led them to their discoveries.
One notable exception was Euler.
Some books on the subject written by great mathematicians are:
J. Hadamard, The Mathematician's Mind.
The Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field (English translation).
G. Polya, a) Mathematics and plausible reasoning. b) Mathematical discovery.

A:

The first mathematician who did that was Archimedes, in his The Method of Mechanical Theorems (usually known as The Method).
