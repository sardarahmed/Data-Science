Q:

Whose 1930 number theory result is used in characterizing perfect 2-error correcting linear codes?

In Error-Correcting Codes: A Mathematical Introduction (Chapman & Hall, 1998), John Baylis wrote (p.109)

Moving on to 2-error correcting linear codes, the condition for perfection of linear codes of dimension $k$ is
$$M = 2^k = \frac{2^n}{1 + n + \binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2^{n+1}}{2 + n + n^2}$$
so $2+n+n^2$ must be a power of 2.  It was shown in 1930 that $n = 1, 2, 5$ and 90 are the only positive integers for which this is true.

without any citation.  Any ideas whose 1930 number theory result he had in mind?  Of course, a reference would be wonderful.
This came up in a MathOverflow question about when $\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{N}{n}$ is a power of 2.

Edit: As markvs explains in his answer (and as discussed in my answer to the MO question), this is equivalent to what is now known as the Ramanujan--Nagell equation $2^n + 7 = x^2$.  This only deepens the question of what Baylis was referring to:

Is there a 1930 result that addresses $2^n + 7 = x^2$, predating Nagell's 1948 solution (and Ljunggren's 1943 posing of the problem, both presumably unaware of Ramanujan's 1913 question)?

Was there a 1930 result about when $n^2 + n + 2$ is a power of 2 with no connection made to Ramanujan's question?

A:

See this oeis entry. This can be easily reduced to Ramanujan-Nagell problem. It was conjectured by Ramanujan in 1913 and resolved by Nagell in 1948 (where the year 1930 come from is not clear).
