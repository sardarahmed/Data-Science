Q:

Great scientists with chaotic private lives

In the arena of art, it is not uncommon to find great writers, composers or painters who suffer from chaotic personal lives (e.g., lifelong alcoholism, addiction to prostitutes, stormy marriages and affairs), but it seems that most of the biographical sketches of great mathematicians I read portray their lives as peaceful in general. 
A counterexample I can think of is Alexander Grothendieck, who estranged his wife and children, seeing other women while married. I understand that the criteria I'm setting is quite vague, but I suppose the example serves an illustrative purpose. 
What are some other examples of mathematicians or scientists who led tumultuous private lives?

A:

Kurt GÃ¶del was certainly known as an eccentric in his life. In fact it is said that he starved to death when his wife died as he refused to take meals from anyone but his wife. 
In the language of today, he would probably be diagnosed as suffering from mental health issues.

A:

There is nothing special about great scientists, their personal life is in general like the personal life of other people. If you mean by "chaotic personal life" things like
"estranged his wife and children, seeing other women while married," read biographies of Einstein or Schrodinger, for example. Several great mathematicians
suffered from alcoholism (T. Carleman, and probably S. Banach). Another great mathematician, Andre Bloch, murdered his family and spent all all his math career in a mental asylum.

A:

Georg Cantor faced many difficulties and died in a sanatorium.
Alan Turing faced persecution and ultimately committed suicide.
Both are titans of mathematics.
