Q:

What values of Avogadro's Number did Jean Perrin come up with?

I am currently plundering the contents of the $1969$ reprint of the 2nd edition of Data and Formulae for Engineering Students published by Pergamon International (authors J.C. Anderson, D.M. Hum, B.G. Neal, J.H. Whitelaw) which I found in my bookshelf.
In chapter 3: Physical Constants, it states:
Avogadro's number $\qquad \text N \qquad = 6.023 \times 10^{26} \ / \text {kg mole}$
It is understood that the definition of Avogadro's number (henceforth here $N_0$) was rationalised in 1971 to be the amount of substance that contains as many elementary entities as there are atoms in $12$ grams of carbon-$12$, but it is unclear (from the sources I have managed to find) what that number actually was, merely that it was known to be approximately $6.02 \times 10^{23}$.
It is also understood that the current definition of $N_0$ (as exactly $6.02214076 \times 10^{23}$) happened in 2019.
I am interested to know where the $6.023$ might have come from in the above book, or whether it's a mistake brought about by a conflation of the 2nd and 3rd decimal places (23) with the exponent of $10$. It is remarkably tempting to remember the $23$-ness of Avogadro's number and accidentally apply it to the mantissa.
The question is: what values of $N_0$ were in circulation before the 2019 redefinition? In particular, what value of $N_0$ was determined by Jean Perrin (who actually did most of the initial hard work of measuring it)?
It occurs to me that if it "suddenly" changed from $6.023$ to $6.022...$, that's a (relatively) large change to standards which in general are known to an accuracy of well under parts per million. That is to my mind something of a discrepancy.

A:

My 1975-76 CRC Handbook (56th edition) states:

Avogadro's number. -- The number of molecules in one mole or gram-molecular weight of a substance. A number of values of the Avogadro number, which is usually denoted by $N_{A}$, have been found by various methods, generally lying within a range of 1% about the value of $6.02252 \times 10^{23}$ per gram mole.

Rounding could easily make it $6.023 \times 10^{23}$ which is still within the 1% range given.
