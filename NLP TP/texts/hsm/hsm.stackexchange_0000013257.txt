Q:

Is it true that Empress Elisabeth of Austria did math?

I have encountered a user on Math Stack Exchange with writing in his bio that Empress Elisabeth of Austria ("Sisi") did some math and she was famous for an unsolvable integral:
$$\int_{0}^{1}\operatorname{si}(x)\operatorname{si}(x)\;\text{d}x$$
I am unsure if this is the precise integral that I saw in his bio. Anyways, I have did google searches and didn't find anything about her as a mathematician. I hope someone can provide any historical context.

A:

She didn't do any math. From my research about her, it seems that the user you are referring to is teasing the fact that her nickname was "Sisi" which looks similar to the integrand. I also highly doubt the integral of the cardinal sine function was even denoted at the time (the earliest mention of it I can find is by Abramowitz in the 1980s, although I'm sure it existed maybe a few decades before). The only sign of education I've found about her (citing Wikipedia page, couldn't find enough information elsewhere) was mostly learning languages while getting her hair groomed.
As a fun note, the dictator of Egypt is named "Abdelfattah El-Sisi" so I guess he did/does math as well.
