Q:

Looking for an online version of Archimedes' "The Method" (in Greek)

To me, one of the most exciting mathematical achievements of antiquity is Archimedes' The Method. It is crazy to think that, had it not been for its miraculous recovery in the early 20th century, it would perhaps have been lost forever. In translation, it can be found online here. The original text, however, seems as hard to find as ever, at least in terms of on-line availability. While I can find the Greek version of most of his other works online, I can't find it for the "Method". Can someone help me?

A:

The question was answered by Viktor Blasjo in the comments: the Greek text is included in this article by Heiberg.
