Q:

Zahler, Sussman, and Kolata Controversy of 1977

In Steven Strogatz's "Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos: With Applications to Physics, Biology, Chemistry, and Engineering", Storgatz mentions a "violent controversy" between Zahler, Sussman, and Kolata that happened in 1977. However, I am not able to find anything like that. What was the controversy he is talking about here?

A:

The following (and the references there) seems relevant: Guckenheimer, J. The catastrophe controversy. The Mathematical Intelligencer 1, 15â€“20 (1978).
Looks like it was about attempts to hype the catastrophe theory and extend it to numerous areas where its usefulness was dubious.
