Q:

F = ma -- How was did we come to understand that this compact form expressed what Newton said in words?

My understanding is, Newton in the 17th century did not use this formula but rather said, in words basically that if you apply a force it will cause a mass to accelerate in the direction of that force.
How did we move from descriptive words to using multiplication to express the same idea? Many people must have said, What does multiplication have to do with exerting a force? (Indeed, I ask that same question today in the 21st century.)

A:

Sometimes you just have to Wikipedia-it:

Newton expressed his second law by saying that the force on a body is proportional to its change of motion, or momentum. By the time he wrote the Principia, he had already developed calculus (which he called "the science of fluxions"), but in the Principia he made no explicit use of it, perhaps because he believed geometrical arguments in the tradition of Euclid to be more rigorous. Consequently, the Principia does not express acceleration as the second derivative of position, and so it does not give the second law as $ F=ma$. This form of the second law was written (for the special case of constant force) at least as early as 1716, by Jakob Hermann.

Note that Newton says that $F$ is proportional to $\dot p$ (the derivative/change of momentum $p= m v$). No need to have a product of anything.
Looking at Hermann's book (Phoronomia), he writes directly $G=M \mathrm dV/\mathrm dt$, $G$ is the weight, $M$ the mass and $V$ the speed.
Leonhard Euler wrote independently in Novi Commentarii
academiae scientiarum Petropolitanae that  $F=M \mathrm d^2x/\mathrm d t^2$, in 1775.
