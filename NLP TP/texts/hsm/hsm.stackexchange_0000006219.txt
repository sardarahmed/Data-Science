Q:

Why is differentiation under the integral sign named Feynman's trick?

It's a simple enough result I would have been unsurprised if it weren't named for anyone at all. I certainly find it odd it's named for a relatively modern physicist rather than an early-calculus mathematician. I assume Feynman earned the moniker by popularising its use in physics, but even that is a shock since it has obvious applications to 19th century thermodynamics.

A:

The name comes from Feynman's evaluation of the integral
$$\int_0^\infty\frac{\sin x}{x}dx.$$
This is a classical example on applications of residues (I think it is originally due to Hardy. In the US residues are not a standard part of the undergraduate curriculum).
Feynman proposed the following elementary argument. Consider instead
$$f(y):=\int_0^\infty\frac{\sin x}{x}e^{-xy}dx,$$
so we need $f(0)$. Then differentiate under the integral sign:
$$f'(y)=-\int_0^\infty e^{-xy}\sin x dx,$$
and this is easily evaluated (integration by parts twice). As we know $f(y)\to 0$ as $y\to+\infty$ we find $f$ and our integral is $f(0)$.
This simple argument impressed people so much that they started calling it Feynman's trick. Those for whom this was the first interesting example of differentiation under the integral sign extended this name to any differentiation under integral sign.
