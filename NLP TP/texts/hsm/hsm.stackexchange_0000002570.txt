Q:

When did we learn that our galaxy was merely one amongst many billions?

This Kurzgesagt YouTube video claims that

Without [the Hubble Space Telescope], we would never have known that our galaxy is one of billions in an enormous universe. But, the actual human, Mr. Hubble, discovered another galaxy in 1929 (Andromeda).

I found this claim surprising (note: I do not have much more than high school physics). According to Wikipedia, the Hubble Space Telescope was launched only in 1990. I would have thought that we already knew that there were very many other galaxies, long before 1990. 
So, when did scientists know (with a great deal of confidence) that our galaxy was merely one amongst billions in the universe?

A:

That video comment is not precisely true in the sense that, the idea that we were one of billions of galaxies was not new to 1990 (quite the contrary), but it has an element of truth to it. Galaxies were known as "extragalactic-nebulae" in the 1920's. By 1929, when Hubble wrote his seminal work Extra-Galactic Nebulae we had already photographed several of them. Hubble's paper has many pictures. Here is a supplementary article (light reading), sketching the events from 1919 to Hubble's 1929 paper highlighting the issue, to wit, the universe is expanding. At the time, astronomers were identifying galaxies many millions of light years away.
Now the thing about the Hubble telescope is, it quite simply has allowed us to discover more galaxies. There is a nifty little article on hubblesite titled Taking the Universe's Baby Pictures that has some of these results. The first picture on that page claims to have about 10,000 galaxies in one image. That's the sort of thing made possible by the telescope. Here is another article, Hubble Discovers Oldest Known Galaxy
. Again, a breakthrough made possible by the telescope. We can now see galaxies billions of light years away.
