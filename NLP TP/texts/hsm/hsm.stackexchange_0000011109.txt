Q:

Did Darwin say that the human menstrual cycle length was influenced by the tides?

According to this article from the BBC's Science Focus

Charles Darwin thought that the 28-day human menstrual cycle was
  evidence that our ancestors lived on the seashore and needed to
  synchronise with the tides.

Did Darwin ever say such a thing?
The closest I have been able to find from a cursory search is this letter from T.H. Huxley in the Darwin Correspondence Project, where Huxley writes

Fancy lunacy & menstruation coming out of the primary fact that one’s
  nth. ancestor lived between tide-marks! I declare it’s the grandest
  suggestion I have heard of for an age

Is there any evidence that Darwin suggested this?

A:

Yes. The menstrual cycle is surely one of the "some of our functions" that Darwin speaks of in this passage from Chapter VI of The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex:

The progenitors of man must have been aquatic in their habits. [...] In the lunar or weekly recurrent periods of some of our functions we apparently still retain traces of our primordial birthplace, a shore washed by the tides.
