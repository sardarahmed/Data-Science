American Mathematical Society lists 25 according to one of the comments in the thread below: 
https://mathoverflow.net/questions/207477/john-nashs-mathematical-legacy.
However, as indicated in the thread, a user indicated that almost half of these are reprints.  Wikipedia.org gives the number as 21. Also in the above thread one of the authors list 13 as the answer to the question.  Who's right? 

A:

Mathscinet database gives all his publications and publications related to him personally. Total is 54. If one removes reprints, translations and publications about him, 14 or 15 original papers remain.
