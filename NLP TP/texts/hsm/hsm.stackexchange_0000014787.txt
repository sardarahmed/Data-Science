Q:

How to build a protractor without a protractor?

We all know how to use a protractor, it is taught in elementary school. However, I was wondering what type of knowledge is required to build one from scratch.
For instance, was the understanding of $\pi$ and a compass first required before the first protractor, and if so how can I draw a full protractor on paper with just a compass, a ruler and some understanding of $\pi$?
I guess my point is as follows. If we can draw a semi-circle on paper, then how can we fill up the degrees without the help of a protractor?

A:

Until the middle of 18th century, division of the circle (when high precision was required) was performed by compass,
by starting with a regular pentagon or hexagon, and then performing bisections, additions and subtractions of arcs. This was a normal procedure of manufacturing astronomical instruments. Only in 18th century a division engine was invented, which performed the task mechanically.
For example, in the middle of 18 century they were able to divide an arc of radius 2-12 inches into minutes, so that the overall error in measuring any was less than 1 minute. By hands, and using only compass.
One cannot divide a circle into 360 equal parts exactly, using a compass only, so 1 degree angle could be obtained only approximately. But with any requires accuracy.
This fact was known experimentally, and proved only in 19th century: using a compass, you can divide the circle into $n$ equal parts, if and only if $n=2^kp_1p_2,...$, where $p_k$ are distinct primes of the form $2^{2^m}+1$. Since $360=2^3.3.3.5$, one cannot divide the circle into 360 parts  exactly.
One does not need "the knowledge of $\pi$" (whatever this can mean) for this procedure. Everything is based on simple geometry, and the use of compass. Division of a straight ruler into equal parts by a compass is possible for any number of parts. But from the practical point of view, it is of the same difficulty as for a circle.
