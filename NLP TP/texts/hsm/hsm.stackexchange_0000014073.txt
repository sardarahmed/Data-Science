Q:

Math-education comparsion between Japan and United States from perspectives of engineering contributions

I may think that this post is unsuitable in HSM.
NASA launches rockets far more than JAXA(Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency).
BostonDynamics-robots are way general-purpose than Japan's FANUC-robots.
However when it comes to average math education level till 12,13th grade, Japan is far better than US.
But as I mentioned firstly, number of rockets or performances of robots are US's advantages.
It is very strange for me.
Just looking math-education till 12th grade, I think Japan should be more powerful than US in engineering however actually not.
Does anyone who can explain this?
BTW I am good at Japanese so I can search and share about education system in Japan as possible as I can, if you require me to do so.

A:

The progress of technology is not a function of the state of education system. US imports huge number of highly educated people. Japan does not. Math education in most countries of East Europe is by far superior to the US (my first hand experience), but we do not have frequent news on breakthroughs in technology from East Europe. Instead, highly educated people from East Europe search for employment in the US.
