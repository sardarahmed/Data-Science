What is being referenced here?

A:

Marie Curie died as a result of exposure to radiation.  This was, in part, the result of her carrying test tubes of radium in her pockets while doing her research.
Source International League of Antiquarian Booksellers site :

One inadvertent and tragic discovery of hers was the effects of radium.  Much of her work was done in a shed, without the safety measures that are used today. She had remarked on the pretty blue-green light that the substances gave off in the dark, and kept test tubes in her pocket and desk drawer.  In 1934 she died of aplastic anemia from exposure to radiation.
