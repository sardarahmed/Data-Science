Q:

Representation theory in physics

The idea of using Lie groups in physics can be easily understood intuitively, but what are the origins of the use of representation theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras in physics?
We mathematicians use representation theory as a tool (among others, such as cohomology) to get information about groups and other algebraic structures that could not be gathered otherwise. But I guess physicists do not have the same use of it?

A:

Explicit applications of group representation to physics start with

E. Noether, Invariante Variationsprobleme, Nachrichten von der Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen. Mathematisch-Physikalische Klasse. 1918: 235–257.

where the celebrated Noether's Theorem was proved.
Applications to quantum mechanics were systematically developed by H. Weyl and E. Wigner:

H. Weyl,
The theory of groups in quantum mechanics, first edition 1928

and

E. Wigner,
Group theory and its application to the quantum mechanics of atomic spectra,
first edition 1931.

There are many good modern books with "group theory" and "physics" or "quantum mechanics" in the title,
my favorite is S. Sternberg, Group theory and physics, Cambridge, 1994.
Remark. The word "explicit" in the beginning of my answer is important.
Considerations based on symmetry are as old as physics itself: they were used already by Aristotle. A major 19th century application was crystallography.
