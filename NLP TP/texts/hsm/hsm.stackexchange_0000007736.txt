Q:

What does Rousseau mean by "Baroco des Logiciens"?

In the Wikipedia "Baroque" article I found this quote from "Dictionnaire
de Musique" by Jean-Jacques Rousseau:

BAROQUE. Une Musique Baroque est celle dont l’Harmonie est confuse, chargée de Modulations & Dissonances, le Chant dur & peu naturel, l’Intonation difficile, le Mouvement contraint.
Il y a bien de l’apparence que ce terme vient du Baroco des Logiciens.

Being a mathematician, I became intrigued - where to read about this "Baroco des Logiciens"? What is it?

A:

As noted in the comments, "baroco" is a mnemonic for a certain type of syllogism in classical Aristotlean logic.  See Wikipedia
But it is no longer believed that "Baroque" comes from it etymologically.
added 
In the mnemonic, the three vowels code what type proposition is used for each of the three terms of the syllogism.  Here is the key:  
A = all S are P,   E = no S is P,   I = some S are P,   O = some S are not P  
Baroco in particular is this syllogism:  

All X are Y.
  Some Z are not Y.
  Therefore, some Z are not X.
