Q:

What is the history of number theory?

Numbers were introduced in our lives far before we had the capability to understand their beauties. But as mathematics aspirant I really want to know how they all evolved and in what way number theory took its own path. May be the answer will be too descriptive,  So any link or book will work. Please if anybody know as such link and book refer it  (except Wikipedia). 

A:

There is a very comprehensive (several volumes) History of number theory by Dickson, https://archive.org/details/historyoftheoryo01dick
Here is a much shorter and more modern one:
Weil, André
