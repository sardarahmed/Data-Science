Q:

Etymology of Some Terms Used in Ratio and Proportion in Old Algebra Textbooks

In older algebra textbooks for high school (mainly 19th century) four properties of ratio and proportions were used. The properties were Invertendo, Alternendo, Componendo, and Dividendo.  This terminology has vanished in most textbooks.
I could never locate these words in any unabridged English dictionaries (Oxford's multivolume dictionary, as well as Webster's). Most likely these are Latin words. 
Does anyone know the literal meanings and English equivalents of these four words? Intuitively, they make sense but what is the word form (verb, adjective, noun?).

Thanks.

A:

These terms derive from the four Latin verbs invertere "to turn upside down", alternare "to alternate, to arrange in alternating order", componere "to add together", and dividere "to divide up, to separate into parts". The specific grammatical form is the gerund, indicated by -nd-, and the grammatical case used is the ablative, indicated by the suffix -o.
Therefore their literal meaning is: invertendo "by turning upside down" or "by inverting", alternando "by alternating" or "by arranging in alternate order", componendo "by adding together", and dividendo "by separating". Except for the final term, they clearly describe the underlying mathematical relationship:
invertendo: if $a : b = c : d$, then (by inverting) $b : a = d : c$
alternando: if $a : b = c : d$, then (by arranging in alternate order) $ a  :c=b:d$
componendo: if $a : b = c : d$, then (by adding together) $(a+b) : b = (c+d):d$
dividendo: if $a : b = c : d$, then (by separating) $(a - b ) :b = (c-d):d$
