Q:

Why isn't the history of mechanics dated from Archimedes time?

It's often said - and more often written - and perhaps, even more spoken of - that modern physics began with Galileo due to his application of mathematics to motion. This is the position taken by Einstein in his semi-popular book on the evolution of physics with Infield. Whereas motion had been theorised before, it was Galileos paradigm-shattering idea to quantify motion and hence discover actual quantitative relationships between the various factors of motion, that is distance, mass, speed and acceleration.
However, more broadly speaking mathematics had been applied much earlier in mechanics. For example, Archimedes law of the lever. And although I haven't checked, I expect that Hero of Alexandria had a quantitative idea of how block and tackle pulleys worked.
Thus, the key paradigmatic idea that separates the Renaissance of mechanics in 16th C Italy and the Hellenic Greece of Antiquity seems not be as paradigmatic as one might suppose.
Q. Why then the focus, as exemplified by Einstein, on the history of mechanics or physics as beginning in Renaissance Europe, when the evidence points to a much broader and historically, much longer period of time?

A:

Dugasâ€™ History of Mechanics (French ed 1958) starts with Aristotle followed by Archimedes.
Then Hellenistic and Arabic science, followed by Middle Age and Renaissance.
Thus it is old but quite comprehensive.
