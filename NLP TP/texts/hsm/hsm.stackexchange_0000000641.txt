Q:

Do we have any in depth material on Baudhayana?

I know he wasn't strictly a mathematician, but as I understand, Baudhayana recorded information on (what we know as) the Pythagorean Theorem and other geometrical properties like $\sqrt{2}$, in the Shulba Sutras, c. 800 BCE, about 200 years before Pythagoras. Other than his sutras, do we have any definite historical works on or about him?

A:

You can find a brief discussion in :

Eli Maor, The Pythagorean theorem : A 4000-year history (2007), page 66-67.
