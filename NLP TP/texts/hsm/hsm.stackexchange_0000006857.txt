Q:

How did Gauss overcome the problem of curvature of sunlight rays when he developed his heliotrope?

My question refers to Gauss's heliotrope - an optical device for projecting sunlight to a distance by a reflecting mirror, that was used in geodetic surveys in order to mark reference points. The problem is (and Gauss was aware of this problem) that since the index of refraction changes with the alttitude above sea, than according to snell's law the rays of light are not straight but rather curved. So my question is  how did geodesits make a practical use of hte heliotrope? and did Gauss originally face the problem? 

A:

In 1825, Gauss introduced the coefficient of refraction k, which represents a way to quantify terrestrial refraction. He defined it as the ratio of the radius of the earth R and radius of curvature  r of light ray (the line of sight). He found, on the basis of reciprocal vertical angle measurements near hannover, an average value of 0.13 for this coefficient. 
Now, in geodesy there is a mathematical trick of dealing with the curvature of line of sight - it's called effective earth radius convention, and it's very useful in calculating horizons seen from an heightened point. It's defined mathematicaly as:
$$ R_{eff} = \frac {{R_{earth}}}{{1 - k}}$$
By replacing earth with an imaginary earth with greater radius, one can make calculations from a new reference system. In order to direct the heliotrope ray to a distant observer, one has to calculate angles on the basis of the horizontal distance x between two points A and B, their heights $h_1$ and $h_2$, and the effective earth radius $R_{eff}$.

A:

In geodesy, one usually looks horizontally, or almost horizontally, so the ray travels in the same layer of the atmosphere, where the temperature and pressure 
are almost constant, thus refraction is negligible.
Sun only serves as the source of light in this case, so the refraction of the ray coming from
the Sun to the devise does not matter.
Refraction is not negligible for astronomic observations (which were also used in geodesy, for the measurements in which the Sun position is relevant), to take it into account, the tables of refraction are used, but the true refraction may depend on the state of the atmosphere and be different from the tables value. This is one of the major difficulties with astronomical measurements. (Gauss certainly was aware of this problem, it is well known since the antiquity, and the most precise tables of refraction in Gauss's time are due to his friend Bessel).
There are several possible uses of the heliotrope, so one has to specify the exact setting to discuss whether refraction is relevant or not in this setting.
