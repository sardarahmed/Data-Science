Q:

Did Fibonacci not grasp the idea of zero?

Indian mathematicians (e.g., Brahmagupta in the 6th century) developed the idea of 0 as more than a placeholder.
In 1202, Fibonacci wrote "These are the nine figures of the Indians: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1. With these nine figures, and with this sign 0, which in Arabic is called zephyr, any number is written, as shown below."
Fibonacci seems to be saying that zero is not quite a number like the rest. But if he basing this off the Indians work from centuries before, why is this? Wasn't it well-developed by this point?
Thank you in advance!

A:

The nonzero digits are also numbers that were considered by the Greeks as existing entities (the case for 1 was seen as somewhat special as it is not composed of other entities; Simon Stevin notably fought against this attitude concerning the singularity of 1).  Since 0 is not a number of anything, it was naturally viewed as a fictional entity not on par with $1,\ldots,9$.  Leibniz viewed entities familiar to the Greeks as the only possible ones; other entities such as surds, imaginary roots, infinitesimals, negatives (surely including 0) were fictions.  A detailed analysis appears in this publication.  There is nothing surprising about Fibonacci's attitude here.
