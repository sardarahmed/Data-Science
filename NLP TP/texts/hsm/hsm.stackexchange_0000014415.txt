Q:

How did mathematics come to use $\log(x)$ and not $\ln(x)$

Question: How and why did the discipline of mathematics come to use $\log(x)$ and not $\ln(x)$ in its writing - papers, books, teaching?
Clearly $\ln(x)$ is unambiguously $\log_e(x)$, but $\log(x)$ is ambiguous.
Almost all textbooks, papers and informal formats like blogs and YouTube videos use $\log(x)$ and assume base $e$.

A:

For me, handwritten especially, but also typeset, "ln" is easier to mis-read than "log". And since I do not ever use any logarithm but "base $e$", (except, rarely, base $2$ for some information-theory things maybe), there is simply no ambiguity.
It's true, it is easier to start kids with logs base $10$, and in calculus make the distinction to/from "ln", ... but that is a transitional phase, I think.
(Financial computations do also use logs base $e$, for reasons of natural phenomena! But, one way or another, almost no people have any reason to directly worry about which logarithm was intended...)
