Q:

control anger with persons

I am human,I have feelings and I can't overcome my anger alone.I have anger in my mind with some persons who went(and maybe will) and make bad things  to me. I didn't do anything yet. I don't know If I will do. Are methods or techniques that could make me from angry to calm my self and to feel relaxed? Especially,if I see a person like this.

A:

Yes of course ! You can control your angry. But instead of controlling it, you can show it in a peaceful way or forget it. I experienced it lot. Before few years, I used to get angry often. Showing your anger towards others should be in a peaceful manner if you want to show your angry. Count numbers in your mind from 1..10 when you get angry. 
Try these simple steps:

Breathe deeply, from your diaphragm. Breathing from your chest won't relax you, so picture your breath coming up from your "gut.
"Slowly repeat a calming word or phrase, such as "relax" or "take it easy." Keep repeating it to yourself while breathing deeply.
Use imagery. Visualize a relaxing experience from your memory or your imagination.
Try non-strenuous, slow exercises. Yoga and similar activities can relax your muscles and calm you down.

Practice these techniques daily. Eventually, you'll be able to use them automatically when you're in a tense situation.
It's best to find out what it is that triggers your anger, and then to develop strategies to keep those triggers from tipping you over the edge.
