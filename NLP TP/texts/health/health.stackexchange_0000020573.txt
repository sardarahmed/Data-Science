Q:

Where do I find an interactive 3D model of the human anatomy?

For medical students and more generally for learning purposes, an open-source website with a 3D human body model, in which we can "navigate" (zoom and move/walk), a little bit like a "Google Streetview / Maps" user interface would be very useful.
Where to find such a resource?
Example of use case: I find it quite difficult to understand how pharynx/larynx/esophagus/mouth cavity/etc. are linked, and being able to "walk" in this zone in a 3D mode would be very insightful for learning purposes.

A:

I like the 3D atlases of https://www.openanatomy.org/atlas-pages/.
You can remove anatomic structures and transact the body as if you're looking at CT-scanning images. They are great if you also want to understand the relation between the 3D-anatomy and CT-images. And best of all, it is completely open source.

Here you can see an example of their thorax model. I removed the lungs such that observing the heart is easier.
