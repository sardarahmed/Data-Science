Q:

What brightness level of mobile/desktop/laptop we should keep for better eye care?

What is the level on which it doesn't cause or cause less harm to the eyes or doesn't lead to eye dryness or eye vision problems?
My uncle was suggesting me to keep the brightness to a certain high level so that it will not give any effects on sight but I think it will create an itchiness in the eyes.

A:

You can't give accurate values to the exact level of brightness needed for optimal reading. There are several factors that affect such things such as type of display, ambient light, type of work, program you are working with.
If the brightness is reduced to a minimum, it forces the eyes to exert more strain which would damage the eye as excessive eye strain could cause permanent eye damage.
The best thing to do is to apply the 20-20-20 rule which says that every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.
