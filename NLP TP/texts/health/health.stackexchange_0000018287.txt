Q:

I always thought mouth breathing was a joke

After watching shows like Stranger Things, I just assumed the term mouth breather was a joke (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opUP0Nag9pQ). However, after doing a little research, it seems to be a legitimate medical problem that can negatively affect facial bone development (Basheer, et al. 2014).
Is it ever too late to develop proper tongue positioning habits later in life? Can the adult skeleton still morph and change over time or is this only possible during childhood?

A:

Not only in adults, even in children, if treated too late, the bone changes can be irreversible - they may not re-morph naturally.
The article linked from your question: Influence of Mouth Breathing on the Dentofacial Growth of Children: A Cephalometric Study (PubMed, 2014) says:

Because upper airway obstruction is an obstacle to normal dentofacial
  development, mouth breathing children deserve prompt attention before
  growth has proceeded irreversibly.
