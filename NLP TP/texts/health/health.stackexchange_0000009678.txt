Q:

Non-ionizing sound waves

The Mayo Clinic website specifies that "Diagnostic medical sonographers and vascular technologists use nonionizing, high-frequency sound waves (ultrasound) to diagnose, treat and prevent medical conditions."
Is there any reason they use the term nonionizing? As far as I understand there isn't a form of sound waves that can cause ionization.

A:

You're right: their description contains redundancy.
I think the reason for the extra clarification may be to make sure readers understand that the method does not involve X-rays (which are ionising, and hence more dangerous).  I've seen people confuse them with ultrasound, because both methods are used for seeing through tissue, their results look similar at a glance, and popular culture colloquially refers to any sort of "seeing through things" as "X-ray vision".
