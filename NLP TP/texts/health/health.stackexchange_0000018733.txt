Q:

How can a school be getting an epidemic of whooping cough if most of the students are vaccinated?

Apparently a private school is experiencing an outbreak of whooping cough. However, the article said that only 18 of the students in the school (out of 1500 or so) were unvaccinated, yet already 30 have the disease. Presumably some of the infected students were vaccinated. How can this be?

A:

Per the CDC:

A: Pertussis vaccines are effective, but not perfect. They typically
  offer good levels of protection within the first 2 years after getting
  the vaccine, but then protection decreases over time. Public health
  experts call this ‘waning immunity.’ Similarly, natural infection may
  also only protect you for a few years.
In general, DTaP vaccines are 80% to 90% effective. Among kids who get
  all 5 doses of DTaP on schedule, effectiveness is very high within the
  year following the 5th dose – at least 9 out of 10 kids are fully
  protected. There is a modest decrease in effectiveness in each
  following year. About 7 out of 10 kids are fully protected 5 years
  after getting their last dose of DTaP and the other 3 out of 10 kids
  are partially protected – protecting against serious disease.
CDC’s current estimate is that in the first year after getting
  vaccinated with Tdap, it protects about 7 out of 10 people who receive
  it. There is a decrease in effectiveness in each following year. About
  3 or 4 out of 10 people are fully protected 4 years after getting
  Tdap.
Keeping up-to-date with recommended pertussis vaccines is the best way
  to protect you and your loved ones.

Given the size of the school and the effectiveness of the vaccine, it appears that ~30 infected kids is within what's expected.
