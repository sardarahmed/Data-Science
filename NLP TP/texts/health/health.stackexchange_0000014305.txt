Q:

how to clean ex smokers lungs

I am ex smoker. I smoked for decade  and quit smoking. here on [this link]http://hangover-cure.co.uk/smokers-and-ex-smokers/) I have found a solution for cleansing the lung. is it safe and a possibke way for cleansing the lungs? or any other better ideas ?

A:

The cited article offers no mechanisms of action, no data to corroborate the claims, and no research (not even observational). It merely makes unsubstantiated claims and offers them as fact. As I pointed out in my comment, I can think of no mechanism by which any of the cited regimens could produce the desired effect.That said, the only thing I know of that can cleanse the lungs is time.
