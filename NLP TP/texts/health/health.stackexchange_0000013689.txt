Q:

Is there a reliable website about cosmetic science?

When I read something on nih.gov or nhs.uk, I trust that what I'm reading is scientifically reliable.
However, these sites do not really focus on cosmetics.
I'm looking for a website that is aimed at the general public, and provides information about cosmetics, and various cosmetic procedures like lasering or derma-rolling.
Most of the things I find about cosmetics online are written by questionable sources, such as consumers (who don't have a scientific background), or companies who clearly have a vested interest in certain products. 
Is there an impartial, scientifically reliable and extensive website about cosmetics, cosmetic surgery, cosmetic products, etc?

A:

I would trust the professional organizations' websites and journals:

American Academy of Dermatology  http://www.AAD.org
American Osteopathic College of Dermatology http://www.aocd.org/
American Journal of Clinical Dermatology https://link.springer.com/journal/40257
Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/01909622?sdc=1

Or google your terms followed by site:aad.org  or site:aocd.org etc
Finding evidence for the newest procedures is harder; there's simply less of it.  I find this to be the case myself.  Dermatologists themselves differ in what they accept and practice from newer technologies.
Any other major peer reviewed medical reference, like UpToDate, I would as well.
