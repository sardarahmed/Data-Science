Q:

What are the medications you definitely need to tell your dentist about?

I will go see a new dentist and I know that they ask all their patients what medications they're taking (in the US, at least). However, I don't want to tell my dentist this information because I feel like dentists and their staff do not keep things very private. Staff at some dental offices seem overly curious and may gossip a lot. And at some dental offices, I've heard very detailed conversations about the medical issues of other patients. I want to protect my privacy. Is it ok if I just say I'm not taking any medications? To put the question in more specific terms, which medications are actually crucial to tell your dentist about (for fear of serious medication interaction effects)?

A:

You should provide your dentist with a complete medical history and up to date list of all your medications. For example, endocarditis, inflammation of the lining of the heart, can be triggered by routine dental care. The ADA and AHA have guidelines when antibiotics should be taken prior to dental care. To give you an idea of the complexity, up until a few years ago it was recommended that patients with joint implants take antibiotics prior to dental care.
Drug interactions are another concern and in worse case scenarios you may not be conscious when medical decisions need to be made.
