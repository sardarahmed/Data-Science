Q:

Eating healthy and sporting, gaining weight

Hello this is my first post here.
I'm trying to lose weight and I'm eating healthy and do sports for at least five days a week (Running and Cycling).
I gained 100 grams in two days, what am I doing wrong?
Here's my diet:
For breakfast I have about 30 grams of Oatmeal with a bit of soy milk at lunch I eat mainly vegetables with a bit of chicken or tuna or just vegetables. For dinner I eat whole grain rice with chicken breast and again a lot of vegetables. 
During the day I eat about two pieces of fruit, like an apple or kiwi and drink about 2 liters of water.
Thank you.

Judging from your description, you're most probably doing everything correctly.
But ok, if you wanted to be absolutely sure, you really would have to precisely measure your calorie intake vs calorie expenditure (with a tool like cronometer or sth).
And as far as gaining 100 grams in 2 days goes, that's just jumping to conclusions and easily falls within normal day-to-day weight fluctuations.
I have personally lost almost 20 pounds in just 24 hours in a weight loss experiment - just to prove how much water weight can be lost (without burning off almost no body fat). And guess what...all that lost weight came back after just 2 days on my normal diet.
In other words, those 100 grams could easily mean you drank 1 extra dl of water, or that you didn't visit the toilet before weighing, or something similarly insignificant.
The only way to be sure whether or not you're gaining/losing actual body fat would be if you actually measured your body fat percentage...but even in this case, the measurements would not be precise enough to confirm what's actually happening if your weight changes by mere 100 grams.
