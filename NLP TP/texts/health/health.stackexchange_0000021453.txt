Q:

Can I make a Hand sanitiser with Reagent Grade Ethanol 99.8% v/v?

I have ethanol , Reagent Grade 99.8% v/v
can i use this to make hand sanitizer ? is it safe for hand skin ?
I will be following this guideline from WHO for making the sanitizer << have a look at that link.
I am planning to dilute the Ethanol with water to get a 65% concentration .
Can i proceed with making the sanitizer ? 
Look at the Ethanol specs on the picture below

A:

All the alcohol based sanitizers are using ethanol as the main alcohol often with isopropylalcohol.  The latter is more effective against bacteria and ethanol is better against virus 

The effectiveness of alcohol as an anti-bacterial or anti-fungal disinfectant increase as the molecular weight increases. Therefore, Isopropyl alcohols, such as IPA, are more effective than ethanol alcohols, such as DE.
Denatured Ethanol is considered more effective as a virucidal disinfectant, as isopropanol is not effective against non-enveloped viruses.
Examples of non-enveloped viruses:
  Hepatitis A
  Rotavirus
  Adenovirus
  Examples of enveloped viruses:
  Influenza
  Ebola
  HIV
  Hepatitis B
  Rabies
  SAR virus
Non-enveloped viruses utilize capsid proteins to mediate binding to host cells, while enveloped viruses use viral proteins for this function. Enveloped viruses are surrounded by an outer lipid membrane, while non-enveloped viruses lack this membrane.

You should add glycerine as an emollient as alcohol and water alone are too harsh on the skin, again as per the WHO recipe you referenced.
Summary: 

70% - 95% ethanol/propylalcohol to clean surfaces (diluted with water )
60% - 95% ethanol/propylalcohol to clean hands ( diluted with glycerine, or aloe vera )
