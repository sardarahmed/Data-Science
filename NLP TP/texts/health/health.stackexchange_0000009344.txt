A:

Which medical specialist should be consulted for anal polyp?

A physician specialised in disorders of the colon, rectum and anus might be the person of choice. 
This could be a proctologist (a physician specialised in proctology), or if this speciality is not recognised/available in your country, this could be a colorectal surgeon. In some cases (depending on the size of the anal polyp) a gastroenterologist can also handle anal polyps (through endoscopic removal).
I would suggest seeing the surgeon who diagnosed this anal polyp and discuss further management with him.
