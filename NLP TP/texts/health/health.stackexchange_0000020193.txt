Q:

Can telemedicine be used in migraine care?

How safe and reliable is a diagnosis of migraines through telemedicine (remote diagnosis)?
E.g. A patient and doctor go on video call, patient describes and attempts to demonstrates symptoms, and then doctor creates diagnosis.

A:

A recent study published in Cephalalgia proved telemedicine is feasible in migraine care. 
Fifty patients were studied, clinical outcomes were as good in telemedicine as in the in-office group. Convenience was rated higher and visit times were shorter in the telemedicine group.
