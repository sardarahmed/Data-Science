Q:

Can you never have a dental cavity your entire life?

I am 41 years old and I take terrible care of my teeth. I can remember when I was younger ,I never used to brush my teeth, maybe twice a week, nowadays if I remember I brush once a day. But still, maybe only 3-4 times a week. I don't mind the odd sugar snack as well. Always had white teeth even though I don't brush.
But despite all of this, I have NEVER had a cavity or even had pain in my gums or teeth area.
So can you go through your entire life without cavity?

A:

Well, you could die today and that would make the answer yes.

Dental caries is the most prevalent infectious disease in humans,
  affecting 97 percent of the population in their lifetime.

From the above we can conclude that 3% of the population go their entire lives without a cavity.
