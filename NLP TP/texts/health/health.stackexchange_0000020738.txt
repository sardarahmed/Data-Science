Q:

Is it possible to have both constipation and diarrhea at the same time?

From a quick Google it seems that this is possible at least in an alternating fashion, but I'm curious about whether both symptoms can occur simultaneously.  For example, a hard difficult-to-pass stool accompanied by liquid.  If so, what conditions make this possible?

A:

Yes, constipation and diarrhea can occur simultaneously - the situation is called paradoxical or overflow diarrhea.

Paradoxical diarrhea or overflow incontinence may occur is a a person
  who has chronic constipation. In paradoxical diarrhea, stool fills the
  rectum, hardens and becomes impacted. Liquid stool leaks around the
  fecal mass, imitating incontinence. (MedicineNet)

First, severe constipation (fecal impaction) with formation of a hard fecal mass develops in the rectum or higher in the colon. Later, when the new liquid feces reaches the hard fecal mass, it passes around it and (because the colon has been irritated for some time due to impaction) is quickly excreted as diarrhea. 
Causes of chronic constipation that can lead to fecal impaction:

Diet low in fiber
Medications: certain antidepressants, antihistamines, antacids, opiates and iron supplements
Constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome
Diseases: diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal injury, Hirschsprung's disease
Structural abnormalities of the colon, for example, in diverticulitis, Crohn's disease or colon cancer
Instrinsic neurological intestinal problems: slow transit constipation, anismus

As suggested in the question, constipation and diarrhea may sometimes only appear to be simultaneous, but in fact, they are alternating - in this case, the problem is not in fecal impaction.
