Max heart rate questions

Max Heart Rate
How accurate really is the 220 -minus my age = max heart rate formula? I don't even come close no matter what I do. My max should be 187. Most blogs say I'm just not exercising hard enough. Today I tested this theory: Sprinted for 3 minutes. Then, slowed down to a brisk walk (139). Then did it again (145). Finally, I started at a good clip, nearly a sprint and kept it up for 8 minutes and ended with an all out sprint for about 50 yards (155). Is this cause for concern? Seems oddly low for someone who really isn't in the greatest shape right now.

A:

Currently, there is no definitive way to predict maximum heart rate for a single individual. There are formulae that can give an approximation, but about the only way to get a good estimate on a personal level is to do a maximal treadmill test with monitoring.
As far as the 220-age, that is a bad myth, and wasn't based on a study, but simple observation of 11 different references of both published and unpublished research. This PDF writeup goes through the history of the 220-age origins, and gives some alternate ways to calculate maxHR. However, especially for exercise science, the margin for error is still too large for clinical use, although it may have slightly better use in a non clinical exercise setting.
