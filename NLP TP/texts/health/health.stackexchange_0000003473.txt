Q:

How do I get screened for (ovarian) cancer?

My wife faces infertility issues, and per a report on NBC news (http://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/can-infertility-point-ovarian-cancer-risk-n447901) she potentially faces a higher cancer risk for ovarian cancer. 
How can my wife get appropriate screening\early diagnosis?  Does one typically begin by talking with a family doctor?

A:

Tests that can help detect ovarian cancer are pelvic exams, transvaginal ultrasounds, and some blood tests. 1 At least the first two are generally handled by gynecologist, and they are the specialists that know mist about ovarian cancer, so if possible, your wife should probably talk to one. If your wife doesn't have a gynecologist, a general practitioner (I assume that's what "family doctor" means) can at least refer her to one.
Please note that:

There is no standard or routine screening test for ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer.

So these tests might not even detect it if it's there. 

Screening for ovarian cancer has not been proven to decrease the death rate from the disease.

Even if it's detected, it might not help. 
Because you mention fertility problems, your wife might want to see a gynecologist anyway, though, who would perform a pelvic exam and a transvaginal ultrasound to check for a cause of the infertility anyway.
