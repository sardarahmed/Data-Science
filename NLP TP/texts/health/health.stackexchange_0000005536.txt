Q:

Can we re mineralize our teeth?

Is it possible to mineralize and make our corroding teeth strong back again? 

What should one do?
Which food items will help?

Answers will be greatly appreciated. 
Thanks

A:

Yes. It is possible to remineralize teeth without cavitation. I am unsure what you mean by corroding, but cavities cannot be fixed by remineralization. Products can inhibit damage and harden intact and decalcified enamel.

Remineralizing tooth paste.

Xylitol

Low Cariogenic diet

Initial caries lesions without cavitation of the surface can
remineralise (heal) under conditions of low cariogenic diet and good
oral hygiene. However, once the surface has broken and cavitation
occurred, there is no alternative to restorative dental therapy
because remineralisation is no more possible.

Avoiding things like some beverages that break down teeth is a good thing to remember when prevention teeth problems.
