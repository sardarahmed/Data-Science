Q:

How can I detect condom failure?

I use condom to prevent the transmission of HIV in anal sex. How can I know if the condom is broken before or during the sex? 

What's the feeling when the condom breaks during the sex?
If there are tiny, invisible holes on the condom that will allow HIV to pass through (for example, the condom is damaged by a needle), will it remain complete during the sex or will it break apart "in time" so I can know?
Can I test for those holes before the sex?

A:

I'm afraid the answer is no, you can't know in advance if the condom is going to break.
As far as I can tell, and from my own personal experience, most condom failures are not due to the condom itself being bad, but from misusing it, e.g. putting it in a wrong angle (so it slides off during the act), using too much force during the act, thus tearing the condom, etc.
Sometimes there are indeed failures in the material itself, causing it to tear while using it, but no way to see those, they are not visible.
So my tips are quite common:

Make sure the condom is not expired. (they always must have expiration date on the package)
Make sure the condom's package is sealed when you open it.
Put the condom properly. (Tons of guides if one wants, don't think it's needed to repeat here.)
If during the act you have a feeling it's breaking/broken pull out immediately and take a look. In case of actual breaking, the hole should be obvious.

Enjoy!
