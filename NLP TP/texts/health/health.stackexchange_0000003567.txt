Q:

Is hemp oil the same as CBD oil?

CBD oil

It looks like CBD oil is made of hemp. Are they any major differences between hemp oil and CBD oil or are they pretty much the same?

A:

Official source of information
http://www.thehia.org/Resources/PressReleases/HIA-position-CBD-FINAL.pdf

Hemp seed oil does not contain any significant quantity of CBD.       Hemp fiber and seed cultivars contain relatively minimal 
  CBD and CBD production from such plants should not be considered a primary  product.

Because the plants are related, some unscrupulous sellers of hemp oil are trying to market it for its medicinal value, which is negligible.

Consumers often confuse hemp oil with CBD oil because both are low in THC and contain CBD.

It took me a while to wrap my head around all these quirks - I'm so detached from the nature :)

A:

Hemp oil is made from the seeds of the cannabis plants. These typically contain almost no cannabinoids, like THC or CBD. CBD-oil is any oil, not only hemp oil, enriched with CBD. The industry seems to prefer hemp-oil for that apparently. Ordinary, non-treated hemp seed oil is very low in CBD.
Cannabinoids are found in the stem, leaves and in greatest concentration in the flowering parts of the plant. To repeat: the seeds from which the oil is made do contain CBD, but only in trace amounts.
That means ordinary hemp seed oil does not contain CBD in meaningful quantities. Since hemp seed oil is a valuable source of fatty acids in a very nice relation to one another, it is often considered "healthy" on its own. But to get hemp seed oil with CBD, you need to bring the CBD from an external source into the oil. That is possible and seems like a natural choice since CBD is fat soluble and needs a carrier for the consumer to ingest it in meaningful dosage.

Source for table: Whatâ€™s the difference between hemp seed oil and cannabidiol oil (CBD)?
The legal advice in that table was quoted as is. It might be different where you live. According to WebMD: All About CBD Oil CBD might still be illegal in Idaho, Dakota and Nebraska. Worldwide there might be similarly crazy places.
