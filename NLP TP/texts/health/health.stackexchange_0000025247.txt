Q:

From R naught to infectious number

R naught is defined as number of infections from one sick person, and most of the paper when simulating the infectious number tends to directly multiply the current infectious number by R naught to get the newly infectious number. However, my doubt is this calculation seems to ignore the possibility that one people might be infected by the same two person, i.e., we would overestimate the newly infected people with direct multiplication.
My question is do we ever need to remove the overlap part in rigorous pandemic simulations or we don't have to at all ?

A:

The correct interpretion of R is on a population-based, statistical level. In your example, if two infected people have contact with one person who becomes infected, we do not say they each have an "individual R" of 1, we say the population has an R of 0.5: 2 infected people result in 1 infected person.
Because you are basing R on population level statistics, you would never count an infected person multiple times based on multiple contacts, they are just one infection.
Sometimes R might be estimated from contact tracing, and in this case the situation you describe may be a problem, if you assume everyone in contact with a patient who goes on to get infected was infected by that person. Breban et al addresses this concern and is strongly relevant to your question (there might be better resources, too, this was just the first I found). The contact tracing method is more accurate if you have very few infected people such that it is unlikely that someone would be exposed to more than one possible source.
