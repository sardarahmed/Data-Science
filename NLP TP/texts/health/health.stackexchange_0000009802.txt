Q:

Recommended foods for before surgery?

For an appendisectomy, what foods would be best to eat pre-op? What foods should be avoided or could make the surgery more difficult? Although there is no appetite and the only thing eaten in the past two days is watermelon which was promptly vomited. There is also a constant intake of fluids with electrolyte tablets. Please, what foods would be recommended and which ones deterred?

A:

In general, the best thing to eat before surgery is absolutely nothing.  This is done to reduce the risk of aspiration pneumonia, as your swallowing reflex doesn't work right under general anesthesia.
Your doctor may have specific instructions to the contrary, so ask them.
