Q:

Can the Coronavirus be spread via public toilet seats?

I would like to know if it has been proven or disproven that the Coronavirus/COVID-19 can be spread via public toilet seats?
I am thinking that perhaps I should always carry around hand sanitizer with me and put some on each public toilet seat that I use. I would put it on some toilet paper and then rub down the toilet seat before sitting down.

A:

The virus causing COVID-19 infects the respiratory tract. It is spread in droplets of moisture when an infected person sneezes, coughs, and exhales. These droplets can be inhaled directly and can also end up on surfaces, where they can be picked up on your hands and then spread to your face.
The WHO recommends hand washing and avoiding touching your face with unwashed hands as the primary ways to protect against infection.
Could a toilet seat potentially transfer the virus? Perhaps, but there is nothing special about a toilet compared to other surfaces in a bathroom, and there are no recommendations to treat that surface in particular. The way that you would transfer virus from those surfaces would be by touching them with your hands and then touching your face. The WHO recommends hand washing to combat this.
