Q:

Is it useless to drip Vitamin D drops on your tongue?

One celebrity doctor in my country says that Vitamin D can be absorbed only in the small intestine and that dropping Vitamin D drops on your tongue is therefore useless, because most of the liquid will never reach your small intestine. He suggests that people use vitamin D only in pill form, so that the pill will have time to travel through your stomach.
Yet, the bottle of my vitamin D drops explicitly says that the drops should be dripped on the tongue.

A:

It appears that Vitamin D oil drops are just as effective as tablets. Well they have the oil which helps the Vitamin D absorb since D is fat soluble I guess. https://vitamindwiki.com/tiki-download_wiki_attachment.php?attId=13764&download=y

We
  compared the effectiveness of tablets versus oil in raising S-25-hydroxyvitaminD(S-25-OHD) in plasma
  by re-analyzing data from a previously performed observational study in which immunodeficient
  patients with S-25-OHD concentrations <75 nmol/L were randomly prescribed vitamin D tablets
  (1600 IU/day) or vitamin D oil-drops (1500 IU/day) for twelve months. Tablets and oil were compared
  for the effect on S-25-OHD concentrations after 3–5 months and antibiotic use. Results: Data on
  S-25-OHD after  3 months was available for 137 patients treated with tablets and 69 with oil drops.
  Both groups exhibited a significant increase in S-25-OHD—oil-drops from 55 to 86 nmol/L and tablets
  from 52 to 87 nmol/L—with no difference between groups (p = 0.77).
