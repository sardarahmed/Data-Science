Q:

Different names for eGFR measurement

I had a look at our hospital database and found out that we have the below measurements
Estimated Glomerular Filtration          ml/min
Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate     ml/min
Estimated Glomerular Filtration, Female  ml/min
Estimated Glomerular Filtration, Male    ml/min
Am I right to understand that terms with Male and Female are being very specific or the doctor/data entry was made in such a specific manner.
For example, if we look at Estimated Glomerular Filtration or Estimated Glomerular Filtration they are no different from Estimated Glomerular Filtration, Male or Estimated Glomerular Filtration, Female
Am I right to understand this? It's just the level of info which was keyed in the EHR system?

A:

The eGFR is calculated differently based on several factors, including sex and race. So there are different calculation formulas based on male vs female, and African American vs Caucasian. There are not currently differences for other ethnicities, but there are some studies working on validating those.
