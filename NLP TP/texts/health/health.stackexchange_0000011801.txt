Q:

Is the yolk of the egg should not be eaten for bodybuilding?

My friend have suggested that a boiled egg is great rather than fried omelet but yolk should not be consumed as it makes fat.

A:

It is a common myth that egg yolk should not be eaten for bodybuilding. Unfortunately, it is a misguided thing.

Egg yolk contains vitamins and minerals in varying amount.
It raises good cholesterol. Cholesterol promotes more muscle growth. A study showed that those with higher cholesterol levels built more muscle than those will lower levels.
Egg yolks are a fantastic food source. This goes for everyone, but especially for the bodybuilder.
