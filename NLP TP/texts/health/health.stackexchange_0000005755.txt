Q:

Does brace to correct posture work?

I've had bad posture (humpback) for years, and no amount of reminding myself seems to help. I'm looking into chest braces that are supposed to help.
However, all the online reviews seem to come from sites trying to sell braces.
Do we have studies showing the effectiveness of these braces?

A:

Here's an paper that might help you:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3554027/
The short conclusion is 

"Application of the scapular brace improved shoulder posture and
  scapular muscle activity, but EMG changes were highly variable. Use of
  a scapular brace might improve shoulder posture and muscle activity in
  overhead athletes with poor posture."

Have you found any other sources? Have you tried it yourself?
