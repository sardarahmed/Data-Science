I asked my biology teacher which part of our brain takes change of itchiness. She supposed that the cerebral cortex will do it because it processes tactile sensations.

A:

Experimental sleep deprivation has been shown to cause psychotic symptomatology.  Although not explicitly mentioned, one might suppose that itching might develop as a psychotic symptom but other than supposition it is hard to  imagine any other mechanism as to why sleep deprivation might cause pain, of which itching is one form of.
