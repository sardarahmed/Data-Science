Q:

What are some conditions that would cause severe exercise intolerance?

I'm making a character and trying to be biologically accurate. Said character has transfusion-dependent anemia (from Gunther disease/congenital erythropoietic porphyria) so I suppose exercising would be hard by default, but what are some other conditions that would make physical training unhealthy? Ideally, I'm trying to make it so even light exercising is bad, but severe would cause vomiting/fainting/etc.
I posted this question on biology, but someone suggested I try asking here instead. I think that the question is less relevant there, so might as well ask here since I didn't get an answer anyway. I apologize for asking the same question twice.

A:

If you're looking for a disease with childhood onset that requires exercise restriction, Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) may work, specifically LQT1. Here is a lay overview. For more detail, see this review. I'm not a cardiologist, and have never seen a patient with LQTS, so I'm honestly not sure how variable the presentation is. Generally, for LQT1, exercise or stress induced tachycardia can cause a life threatening arrhythmia called torsades de pointes and sudden death. 
Treatment of LQT1 includes avoidance of stress, exercise restriction, and beta blockers. As discussed in the linked review above, certain extreme phenotypes may not be fully controlled with beta blockers. Pain, nausea, or perceived exercise intolerance (e.g., fatigue), the symptoms you mentioned in your comment, are not part of the described symptom  complex. Rather elevated heart rate leads to the malignant arrhythmia. The symptom complex is that of the arrhythmia (palpitations, fainting, seizures, and death).
