Q:

Does the 2011 Tsunami in Japan poses any health risks to Americans?

During the 2011 Tsunami in Japan, Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant was heavily damaged and it was reported that heavy nuclear waste leaked into the Pacific Ocean. Is it possible that the nuclear waste could affect the coastal regions of North America? Does that leak pose any health risks to Americans living on the west side of US?

A:

The WHO put out a statement in February 2013 addressing the health risks. Certain groups of people got fairly high doses of radiation:

Apart from emergency workers, the most affected people were those who
  remained in some highly contaminated towns and villages to the
  northwest of the power station for up to four months before
  evacuation.

These people will experience health risks, including increased risks of thyroid cancer:

The WHO estimated that there was a 70 percent higher risk of females
  exposed as infants developing thyroid cancer over their lifetime...
  The radiation exposure means about 1.25 out of every 100 girls in the
  area could develop thyroid cancer over their lifetime, instead of the
  natural rate of about 0.75 percent.

And other cancers:

In the most contaminated area there was a 7 percent higher risk of
  leukemia in males exposed as infants, and a 6 percent higher risk of
  breast cancer in females exposed as infants. Overall, girls had a 4
  percent increased risk of developing solid cancers.

However, outside of those high-risk groups of people, risk is minimal:

There was no discernible increase in health risks expected outside
  Japan, the WHO said in a 200-page report which was based on an
  assessment by international experts.
“In the rest of Fukushima prefecture and in particular neighboring
  countries and the rest of the world, the estimated increased cancer
  risk is negligible. It’s within the variation of normal background
  rates,” said Angelika Tritscher, acting director of WHO’s department
  of food safety.
