Q:

Why heart beats normal after AED?

I know that heart attack is when some of cells are dead. That's why heart beats abnormally and needs AED to stop it and restart. After that it beats again normally and my question is - how come since cells are dead?

A:

That's right Adrian, it restarts because the damage wasn't sufficient to turn it incapable of functioning. But it may develop cardiac insufficiency as the time passes by.
