Q:

Salt as a treatment to gum inflammation

I had strong pains in the gum. After several months I went to a periodontist. He said I had inflammation in my gums, and then gave me a complex treatment, but the pains remained.
After several more months, I followed advice from my wife, and started treating my mouth with salt. After several days of salting, the pains disappeared!
However, the periodontist still says I have inflammation, and have to go through the treatment again.
Now, I am not sure who to believe... the dentist, or my mouth (and my wife)?
So my question is: can regular salt-washing be a good cure for gum inflammation?

A:

You should thank your wife 1 million times for the cure that she suggested for you.
The fact that the pain has gone, is probably related to the type of bacteria that caused the inflammation. Common salt is a mineral composed primarily of sodium chloride (NaCl), and there are some types of bacteria that cannot tolerate high concentrations of sodium chloride (NaCl) (These bacteria are called : Non-halophilic bacteria), hence, salt is the perfect way to get rid of non-halophilic bacteria.
In addition, I've been using salt-washing everytime I have toothache, and this works for me.

And my answer is YES, salt-washing is a good cure for gum
inflammation.
