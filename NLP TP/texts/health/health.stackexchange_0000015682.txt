Q:

Diagnosing by ruling things out

What is the technical term for a condition that is diagnosed by ruling everything else out?

A:

Diagnosis of exclusion

A diagnosis of exclusion (per exclusionem) is a diagnosis of a medical condition reached by a process of elimination, which may be necessary if presence cannot be established with complete confidence from history, examination or testing. Such elimination of other reasonable possibilities is a major component in performing a differential diagnosis.
