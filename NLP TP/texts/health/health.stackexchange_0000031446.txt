Q:

Decide parent and child from DNA

Given the DNA of a parent and the DNA of a child of the parent, is it possible to tell which DNA belongs to the parent and which to the child? I've tried looking this up online, but could only find information on paternity tests, and about differentiating the DNA of a parent from the DNA of a sybling, given the DNA of some individual.

A:

There is one case where you might be able to differentiate parent and child,  taking advantage of the fact that mitochondrial DNA is only inherited from the mother.
If one genome is female and the other male, but the mitochondrial DNA are almost identical, then the male genome is that of the child and the female genome is the parent. If the mitochondrial DNA are different, and you definitely know that the samples are from one parent and one child, then the male genome would be the parent, and the female genome would be the child.
If both genomes are male, and the mitochondrial DNA are different, you haven't learned anything. If the mitochondrial DNA are the same, you've learned that they can't be parent and child.
If both genomes are female and the mitochondrial DNA are the same, you haven't learned anything. If they are different, you've again learned that they can't be parent and child.
Generally though I think you are going to need a trio of samples to be able to distinguish parent from child (two parents and a child or one parent and two siblings).
