Q:

Which disease is this combination of medicine is used for?

I have had a cough form in several days. 
My doctor had given me some medication for this.
But when I searched for the medication used it made me confused, because the medications given commonly work on asthma.
The Medication is:
1. Rapitus Plus (syrup)
2. Cap. Nuipenta-D
3. Deflazacort (MAHACORT-DZ 6)
4. Fix-AR
Can anyone tell me if he has given the right medication?

A:

Rapitus Plus (syrup) consist of:

Chlorphenamine(antihistamine)-relieves itching, sneezing, watery eyes or runny nose associated with common cold or flu.
Levodropropizine(antiussive)- helps coughs

Cap. Nuipenta-D- Antacids, Antireflux Agents & Antiulcerants
Deflazacort (MAHACORT-DZ 6)- Allergic And Inflammatory Disorders
Fix-AR: 

Montelukast is used to prevent and treat asthma, seasonal and year
  round allergies (hay fever), and prevent exercise-induced asthma.

We can not tell you if the medication is wrong, as I am not your doctor and did not prescribe it. However, the medication seems indicated for the symptoms. Your doctor probably associated your cough with possible allergies or Asthma, excluding the Nuipenta. To better understand you can:

Ask your doctor for papers on your meds 
Ask them why a medication was prescribed 
How it will affect you

As a patient you are entitled to his care and most times it is given.
