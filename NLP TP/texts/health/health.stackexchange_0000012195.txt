Q:

Growing foetus in another woman's womb

If you have a medical issue and are unable to carry a baby, can you have the fetus taken out of you and grown in another woman's womb? Or could you freeze it?
I'm thinking of a medical issue like severe chronic pain or cancer that requires significant medical intervention that may harm the baby's growth inside the mother's body.

A:

Currently no, but there is work in progress that will allow extremely premature babies to be grown in artificial uteri. It has so far worked well for baby goats.
