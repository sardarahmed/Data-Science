Q:

Do skeleton bones hold together after death & decay?

In many depictions of skeletons in modern culture (videogames, movies, etc.), we can see skeletons holding in one piece, as if glued, long after death and disappearance of body tissues. For instance, skeletons of hanged men still hanging at the rope.
I'm pretty sure this isn't realistic but I'd like a confirmation that nothing holds bones together after decay.
Thanks 

A:

Bones are held together by cartilage, and cartilage decays and vanishes along with the other soft tissues. So no, skeletons don't hold together by themselves. Skeletons in museums and such are generally held together by wire and glue.
