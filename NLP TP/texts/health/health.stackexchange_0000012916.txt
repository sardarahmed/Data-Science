Q:

can a person get infected by Hepatitis B while taking Hepatitis B vaccine

can a person get infected by Hepatitis B while taking Hepatitis B vaccine if the needle is infected with Hepatitis B virus. 

A:

It's hard to imagine such a scenario but the answer is yes. If you haven't completed the vaccination series and therefore haven't developed immunity yet, then you remain susceptible to infection.
