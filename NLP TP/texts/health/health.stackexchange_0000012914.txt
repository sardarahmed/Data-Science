Q:

Ejaculating while sleeping

I've been ejaculating huge amounts of semen overnight, and I have to wake up and change my clothes and clean up before I can go back to sleep.
Is there something I can do to prevent ejaculation during my sleeping hours?

A:

Nocturnal emissions (q.v.) are completely normal and generally nothing to worry about.
