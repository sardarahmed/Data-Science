Q:

Dietary fibre and carbohydrates

When dieticians speak of carbohydrates, do they include dietary fibre?  Also, what are carbohydrates?  Saccharides and polysaccharides?

A:

Carbohydrates can be categorized according to how well they are digested or absorbed:
a) WELL-DIGESTIBLE (4 Cal/g):

Sugars:

Monosaccharides (glucose, fructose, galactose, mannose...)
Disaccharides (sucrose, lactose, maltose...)

Oligosaccharides (fructo-oligosaccharides, galacto-oligosaccharides...)
Polysaccharides:

Starch
Glycogen

b) POORLY DIGESTIBLE/ABSORBABLE (2 Cal/g):

Sugar alcohols or polyls (maltitol, mannitol, sorbitol, xylitol...)

c) NON-DIGESTIBLE (2 Cal/g):

Dietary fiber (various oligo- and polysaccharides, such as oligofructans and cellulose)

Diabetics who want to calculte how carbohydrates will affect their blood sugar levels need to subtract the amount of fiber from total carbohydrates.
