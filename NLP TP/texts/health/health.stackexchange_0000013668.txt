Q:

Where I can find infomation about ALL diseases of human beings?

Is there any book or website about ALL diseases were officially registered ever?
I doubt that there is some book that has information about all diseases. I think that one book can hold only some diseases for instance A, B, C, D and another one C, D, E, F and it can always miss some of diseases. 
In order not to read all books I just want to know is there any main source in internet which most doctors use?
I need this for filtering and finding disease according its symptoms.
P.S. I have not medical education, I am just curious about it, and I want always be sure that doctors not making mistake when diagnosing.

The best you're going to get is the International Classification of Disease (ICD) which is developed by the World Health Organisation. It's currently at version 10. The draft version of ICD-11 can be found here.
In case you're unable to find it, just note that it does not list drapetomania, or the mental illness that compels black slaves to flee their masters. That went out of vogue mid-1800s.
So, the ICD falls short for your requirements: it only lists all currently recognised diseases, not ever.

Okay, what you're asking for is entirely different than a list of all registered diseases.
The standard reference is something like UpToDate, but it's a paid subscription. Another common one is Best Practice. That one has a free trial.

Unfortunately, if diagnosis were as simple as that, then a computer would do it.
