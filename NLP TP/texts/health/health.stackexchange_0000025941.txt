Q:

What is missing for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to get "regular" FDA approval?

Last year, the US FDA issued an "Emergency Use Authorization" for Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for Covid-19.
I read the wikipedia page on what that means, and it seems as though this can be issued under very lax conditions (e.g. human use after animal-only experiments). On the other hand, I know that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine passed "Phase III" trials.
What is missing, therefore, for the vaccine to qualify for "regular" FDA approval? Is it a longer period of time for evaluating the possibility of unexpected mid/long-term detrimental effects in vaccinated patients? Are there additional missing experiments/trials? Or perhaps just administrative procedures?
PS - I've gotten (both doses of) this vaccine already, so please don't mistake this question to about whether or not to get vaccinated.

A:

Well, it turns out I was wrong: The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine's Phase 3 trials have not been completed: US Government listing of the trials. They will not be over before 2023...
The FDA approval requirements/process is summarized as follows:

An Investigational New Drug application
Pre-licensure vaccine clinical trials
A Biologics License Application (BLA)
Inspection of the manufacturing facility
Presentation of findings to FDAâ€™s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC)
Usability testing of product labeling

it seems the vaccine is (as of March 2021) in step 2 of the above. Although it theoretically may have already cleared steps (3.), (4.) and (6.) independently. Perhaps others can shed light on this point.
