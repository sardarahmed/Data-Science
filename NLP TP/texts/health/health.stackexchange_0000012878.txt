Q:

Anatomy of Knee Locking That Heals in Weeks

I am trying to understand the anatomy of my injury.
How it happened: I was cutting to the left in basketball. My right knee popped 3 times and I felt sharp pain. Immediately after the injury I couldn't extend my leg any more.
Extension: I can extend it to about 20-30 deg from straight. After that I get a sharp pain in anterior-medial below the patella (where the meniscus is). 
Flexion: After the injury I could flex it almost all the way. Two days after it locks 45 degrees from fully bent. At that point I get a sharp pain in posterior-lateral region of the knee (in the knee crevice).
General: I can put moderete weight on my leg, but can't walk without crutches because I cannot straighten it. 
History: I had the exact same injury (simptoms) 2 times in my life before. Each time, I would stay in bed 2-3 weeks and could limp. A month or two and I could walk/run. I also had an ACL surgery 8 months ago (after those two times).
Question: I can't understand why my knee locks. The general belief is that a part of meniscus is stuck underneath the knee and this is in line with my immediate locking. However, I feel like it doesn't explain why I am able to region the range of motion 2-3 weeks after the injury. Is there any other explanation?

A:

As I can't see you in person.  This is by no means a Dx, please see a physician or physical therapist as soon as possible.  They will be
  able to perform an evaluation to determine the extent of the injury

You cannot treat this yourself you MUST see a specialist.

This is only an idea of what may be going on, I cannot tell without an eval.
