Q:

What can cause right lower quadrant abdominal pain?

Given a normal ultrasound, what are some possible causes of a dull right lower quadrant abdominal pain lasting up to a week in duration in a 30 year old female patient?

A:

Right lower quadrant pain is typically appendiceal or ovarian. It can also be salpingitis - which does last longer, or PCOS, depending on the duration of the symptoms, or cystic Lymphangioma. Finally, it could be a stone at the junction of the ureter and bladder.
Generally when a patient (or person) is asking about a symptom, they should be able to answer nine questions (O/S/Q/L/T/A/P/P/C):

Onset
Severity
Quality
Location
Timing
Associated sx
Palliatiated by
Precipitated by
Course.

A normal ultrasound would not rule out all of these, but would be a good start.
