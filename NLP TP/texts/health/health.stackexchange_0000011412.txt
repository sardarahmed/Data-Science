Q:

on what metabolism depends

Some people have fast metabolism (high basal metabolic rate), but some slow one. Usually it's high for men and decreasing with age. 
And fast metabolism is considered as good one, because it keeps you from over-weighting.
But on which factors metabolism and BMR depends? Genetic? Lifestyle? Environment?
Can you change it? If yes, then how?

A:

Well metabolic rate is determined by many factors.

Hormones: BMR is regulated by the thyroid glands. The T3 and T4 hormone levels increase or decrease the BMR.
Body Mass: BMR is directly proportional to the total body mass.
Muscle Mass BMR is also directly proportional to the percentage of muscle mass of your body.
Age: BMR is inversely proportional to age.
Activity Levels Regular aerobic/anaerobic exercise will raise the metabolism.

There are other factors that may have some impact like levels of Stress, menopause or total skeletal mass.
