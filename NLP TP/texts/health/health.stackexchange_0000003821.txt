Q:

Third-degree burn - Home treatment

In the case of a calf-long burn, second to third degree, what should you do to treat it by yourself, if there is nobody to help?
I was also wondering, since grafting is the usual medical practice for such wounds, would a stitch help? (I know they work differently, but in a case of absolute emergency) 

A:

The skin has several tasks. Among these are:

defense against outside threats like infection
keeping the body temperature as constant as possible
keeping the moisture inside

With large second/third degree burn wounds. Some or all of these functions are hampered. So we need to take care of these until the skin is cured.
The most important is of course to stop the damaging effect of the heat by cooling. Keep cooling until the pain is gone (but be careful not to use a coolant that is too cool.
You can counter infections by covering the wound with (preferably) sterile bandages. And you should renew these regulary. Try to keep the wound moist if possible.
Be aware that large burn wounds (around 10%) can lead to shock because of dehydration. So watch your fluid (and salt) intake. 
If there is no medical help available, you should be prepared for a long recovery time.
