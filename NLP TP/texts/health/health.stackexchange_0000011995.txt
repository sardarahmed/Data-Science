Q:

Blood in urine without seeing it...?

I came from my doctor and he did a urine sample and said there was blood in my urine. I've never seen "blood" in my urine or had any issues with my kidneys  so I was perplexed by this. Is this possible to have blood in urine without actually seeing it?

A:

Yes. what you are describing sounds like microscopic hematuria (1). Sometimes red blood cells(RBC) are not numerous enough to be visible in  urine. Yet, when tested, RBCs are detected.
