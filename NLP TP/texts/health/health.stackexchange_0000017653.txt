Q:

Is ShockWave Therapy Useful For ED or not?

I read the following in an article from a Facebook page for a clinic in the Lebanon region, and I am trying to know if this choice is good or not?:

Extracorporeal ShockWave Therapy, or ESWT, is a relatively new treatment for erectile dysfunction that is non-drug, non-surgical and without adverse side effects. It is the same therapy as used in orthopedics, urology and cardiology and which at higher energies is used to break up kidney stones, known as Lithotripsy. The indication for erectile dysfunction has been approved for use in Europe, most countries in the Middle East and South America as well as in Canada.

Is That Correct?
Is ShockWave Useful for ED or not?

A:

The results of our studies, which also included a double-blind randomized control trial, confirm that LI-ESWT generates a significant clinical improvement of erectile function and a significant improvement in penile hemodynamics without any adverse effects
