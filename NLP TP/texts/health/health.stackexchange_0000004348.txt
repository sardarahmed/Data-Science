Q:

What does "Townsend quintile" mean?

Can anyone tell me what does "Townsend quintile" mean exactly? 
I am trying to use this cardiovascular risk assessment.

A:

The "Townsend deprivation score" measures socio-economic status, and has five categories, hence you are being asked for your quintile. The scale is 1-5, and it incorporates the variables

car ownership
house ownership
unemployment
overcrowding of the household

Since it needs to be standardized you can't just calculate it for yourself. 2001 Townsend scores for the UK can be found at the UK census website. It seems to be occasionally used for risk assessments like in your link.
