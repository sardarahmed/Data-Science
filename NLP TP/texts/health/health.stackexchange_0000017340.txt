Q:

Natural Remedies For Lower Muscarine?

Histamines are found in cherries among other natural foods.  By restricting such treatment can actually prevent issues in the patient.  I was hopeful to find information like this for muscarine.
If you take a drug that blocks m1 for long periods of time and attempt to stop like Benadryl or many antidepressants, insomnia is a likely side effect.  Are there any natural remedies for muscarine and limiting acetylcholine muscarinic receptors?
What foods to avoid or supplements to take?

A:

Background
Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, or mAChRs, are acetylcholine receptors that form G protein-coupled receptor complexes in the cell membranes of certain neurons (Eglen, 2006) and other cells. They play several roles, including acting as the main end-receptor stimulated by acetylcholine released from postganglionic fibers in the parasympathetic nervous system.
Ligands targeting the mAChR that are currently approved for clinical use include non-selective antagonists for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, atropine (to dilate the pupil for medical examinations), scopolamine (used to prevent motion sickness), and ipratropium (used in the treatment of COPD).
With regard to antipsychotics mentioned in the question's image source (Correll, 2008), Olanzapine and clozapine produce robust increases in hippocampal acetylcholine release during acetylcholinesterase inhibition, while other antipsychotics, including thioridazine, have only small effects (Johnson, et al. 2005). Since thioridazine binds with similar high affinities to muscarinic receptors as olanzapine and clozapine, muscarinic autoreceptor blockade was ruled out as a primary mechanism (Shirazi-Southall, et al. 2002). This study compared in vitro binding affinities and functional activities of olanzapine, clozapine, thioridazine, ziprasidone, risperidone, chlorpromazine and scopolamine at muscarinic M2 receptors with their in vivo potencies to increase acetylcholine release in the rat hippocampus.
To your question (how do you prevent insomnia with natural remedies when stopping these medications)
Stopping Antipsychotics
The main thing to consider, especially when talking about stopping antipsychotic medications, is that insomnia can be the least of the problems.  As indicated in the image you posted, stopping them can have withdrawal symptoms which include psychotic episodes, anxiety, and Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS).  Stopping these medications should only be done under the guidance of your doctor.
Stopping other medications
Whatever the medication is you are stopping, if you suffer from insomnia as a withdrawal symptom, you should speak to your doctor who can advise on the best course of action.
