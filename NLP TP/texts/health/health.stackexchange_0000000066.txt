Q:

What topical applications can assist wound healing and prevent scarring?

I have used vitamin E to help prevent scarring.  Are there any other topical applications that can assist wound healing and prevent scarring?

A:

It greatly depends on the wound: is it clean or infected? A cut on an abrasion? Acute or chronic. Associated with disease (diabetes), immobility (pressure) or other? Is it a burn?
Honey is often overlooked. It is an antibacterial and a humectant, both helping wounds to heal better. Epidermal growth factor also helps but is not easy to get. Silver is preferred for burns (nanosilver is making an appearance). Collagen gels and other topicals are helpful. The body of literature is huge.
I like an ointment with lanolin and allantoin, both of which promote healing.
