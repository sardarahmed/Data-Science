Q:

Are stomach noises (without additional symptoms) a cause for worry?

For example, should I try to find a diet that does not cause these noises? Maybe the sounds are indication of non-optimal food combinations that has an impact on dietary value?
According to 1,2 (and more) stomach noises are normal.

A:

Stomach rumbles, or to give them their proper name of boborygmus, are the movement of gas and fluid in the intestines. This is a normal thing. Most of the time they are not loud enough to be audible, but they can occasionally be heard without the aid of a stethoscope. 
It can also occur with incomplete digestion causing excess gas, excess swallowing of air, or when your stomach is empty and you are hungry.
There are a few diseases that can cause rumbles, such as persistent diarrhea, celiac disease, Crohn's disease. I would not worry overmuch over the occasional noise, but if there seems to be a lot of it, and possibly accompanied by other symptoms such as excess flatulence, diarrhea, pain, I would have it checked out by a medical professional.
