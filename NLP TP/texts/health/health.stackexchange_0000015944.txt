Q:

Are Soft Drinks dangerous for health?

Nowadays soft drinks become fashion. 
Is it a good fashion or bad for our health?
If it is bad for health than how it can affect our health and which organ is mostly affected by this activity?

A:

Short and sweet (pun intended)
Soft drinks generally contain a lot of sugar.  As a general rule, there’s 10.6g of sugar per 100ml of Coca-Cola Classic. So the health effects of drinking soft drinks are the same as eating sugar.
Not so short and sweet
As a general rule, there’s 10.6g of sugar per 100ml of Coca-Cola Classic. There are 4g of sugar per teaspoon so this equates to just over 2.5 teaspoons of sugar for every 100ml.
Standard can sizes are different around the world.
Here in the UK the standard can size is 330ml and that equates to 35g of sugar equalling just over 8.5 teaspoons of sugar.
In the US the standard can size is 12 US fl oz or 355ml.  This equates to 37.6g of sugar equalling just short of 9.5 teaspoons of sugar.  This can contains 150 calories which is practically all from sugar.

So the health effects of drinking soft drinks are the same as eating sugar. Those which are of the 'diet' variety often contain aspartame which is covered by the question on here Are artificial sweeteners safe?.
