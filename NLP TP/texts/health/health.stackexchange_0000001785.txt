Q:

How does the efficiency of a diclofenac patch decrease over time?

I wonder how the efficiency of a diclofenac patch decreases over time. E.g. if a patient wears a a diclofenac patch for 24 hours, how useful are the last 12 hours. Ideally I would like to see a curve (abscissa: time; ordinate: efficiency). Assume that the diclofenac patch is used to treat a lateral epicondyle of the humerus.

A:

As previously said, this is dependent on the product. However, there is at least one study available comparing the bioavailability (which is what you are asking about - in this case, how much diclofenac permeates into the skin) of several of these patches and the differences don't look too big to me. 
Patel, Kunal N., Hetal K. Patel, and Vishnu A. Patel. "Formulation and characterization of drug in adhesive transdermal patches of diclofenac acid." Int. J. Pharm. Pharm. Sci 4.1 (2012): 296-299.
What you are interested in is table 2:

As you can see, they do look rather similar, and an obvious feature is that the bioavailability for the first hours isn't as "good" as later. So in my nonexpert opinion, keeping a 24 hour patch on for 24 hours would be preferable to switching after 12.
