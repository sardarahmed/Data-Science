Q:

Is it okay to reduce DHT in my body?

DHT may also has some roles in our bodies. If we keep its level as low as possible, I think it must begin to affect negatively. I'm specifically worrying about the negative effect regarding mind and mentality, since I'm a graduate student in science.
Depending on the method of lowering DHT level, I think it may affect the testosterone concentration too, and it will certainly cause problems.

A:

The problem is that dihydrotestosterone (DHT) does much more than contribute to hair loss. It also plays a crucial role in male sexual development and mood regulation. When DHT levels are reduced, either intentionally or unintentionally, it can impact these functions in unwanted ways and cause: 
Impotence,
Lower sex drive,
Difficulty achieving orgasm,
Abnormal ejaculation,
Gynecomastia (male breast development),
Depression.
However, these side effects only appear in a small minority of men. As with any medication, you should discuss with your hair loss physician whether DHT blockers or other pharmaceutical treatments offer a viable and effective option for addressing your hair loss issues.
