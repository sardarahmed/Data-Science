Q:

Are arsenic levels in poultry a health concern?

(While eating some turkey) I recently found out that poultry farmers routinely use a powerful, arsenic-based antibiotic called "Roxarsone" to treat their livestock.
Obviously, injecting arsenic into a bird will cause its meat to be contaminated with arsenic due to blood circulation. 
Are arsenic levels in bird meat of a health concern for Americans?

A:

Roxarsone has been banned by the FDA and in the EU, so if you live in either of them it's safe to assume that there was none of it in your turkey.
Additionally, not all arsenic compounds are equally toxic. Arsenate salts are the most toxic, whereas other ones like arsenobetaine (which is commonly found on fish) are completely inoccuous. In the case of roxarsone and related compounds the concern would be that its metabolism would break them down to release arsenates, but I couldn't find evidence that this actually happens through normal metabolism.
