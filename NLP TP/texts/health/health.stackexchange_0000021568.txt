Q:

Can CPAP devices connected with oxygen sources be used as ventilators?

I want to inquire if CPAP devices can act as low performance ventilators, if they are connected to an oxygen source as well.
I am asking this question in regards to the covid-19 pandemic. There are only two websites which cover this in the entire web. One of them only suggests that CPAP devices may increase the risk of spreading. The other one notes similarities between these devices. Due to the lack of discussion reachable via google, even if the answer is "no", it might help many people.

A:

The software is very different. And the capabilities of the machine. The monitoring parameters within Ventilators are much more sensitive to pressure and volume than CPAP or BIPAP machines. Below are two pages from the manufacturer with setting capabilities for a BIPAP and a ventilator.
