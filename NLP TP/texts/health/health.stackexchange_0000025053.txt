Q:

Definition of 'transmission onset' in this paper

I am a nonmedical scientist trying to make sense of medical terms that were involved in the following study: Transmission onset distribution of COVID-19. I am attaching a link to the paper for your reference: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220306123
My question is: what is a layman's definition of what transmission onset is? Can I construed it as the infectiousness of the disease or transmissibility of the disease?
I bring your attention to the crucial Figure (attached here, Figure 3 of the paper)
The figure presents the probability density function vs number of days after onset of symptoms. The caption reads: Estimated distribution of the transmission onset of COVID-19 relative to the onset of symptoms.
