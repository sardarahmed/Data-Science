Q:

Is Ibuprofen Safe To Use As A Catch-All First Aid Solution

I've heard it said that when in doubt use (or administer) Ibuprofen.  The idea being that it's a safe, general-purpose medical tool.  Assuming you follow the instructions on the bottle, is this a viable strategy?  Or are there situations or scenarios where it would be better to err on the side of doing nothing?  Are there situations or scenarios where you would definitely want to not use Ibuprofen, again assuming you at least follow the instructions.

A:

For every individual situation, one must weigh the risks vs. the benefits. If the potential or actual benefits outweigh the potential or actual risks, and the situation calls for ibuprophen, you take the medication.
If the potential benefits don't outweigh the potential risks, you don't take the medication.
The risks vary from individual to individual and from situation to situation.
There is no blanket answer to your question.
