Q:

Techniques to avoid fainting when observing a surgery

I wonder what techniques can efficiently help avoid fainting when observing a surgery, either directly from the operating room, or video.

A:

If observing surgery might cause you to faint then there are two things you can do:

Avoid observing surgeries.
Desensitize yourself with videos and photos of surgeries in a controlled environment where fainting won't injure you or disrupt an actual surgery.

Number two is quite easy to accomplish in this era of the internet*. There are thousands of videos and photos online to choose from, and as anyone with experience in medicine, emergency services, or combat will tell you, you will get used to seeing it and the autonomic response that causes you to faint will dissipate over time. However, if your reaction is so strong that fainting is a real possibility, you might want to consider visiting a psychologist for desensitization therapy. 

I would advise avoiding the so-called "gore sites" and sticking to real medical procedures on youtube and the like. The gore sites can be far, far worse than you might be prepared for.
