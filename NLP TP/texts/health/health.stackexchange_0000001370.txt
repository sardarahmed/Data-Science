Q:

How can mercury be removed from the body "naturally"?

Is it possible to remove mercury from the (live) human body without undergoing chelation therapy? Does the body remove it naturally?

The first ~50 Google search results have been spectacularly unhelpful, pointing to "alternative" medicine pages like Mercola. Wikipedia didn't have anything on the topic (or I was unable to find it).

Apparently the body does remove mercury naturally:

Sixty days after the amalgam removal, the Hg levels in blood, plasma, and urine had declined to approximately 60% of the pre-removal levels. [...] After removal, there was a considerable decline in the Hg levels of blood, plasma, and urine, which slowly approached those of subjects without any history of amalgam fillings.
