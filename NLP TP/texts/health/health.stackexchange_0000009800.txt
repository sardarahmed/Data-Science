Q:

Do some psychiatrists/psychologists still treat severe depression with electric-shock-therapy (ECT)?

About 9 years ago, my cousin in California confided in me that she was still undergoing electric-shock-therapy for her severe depression. I was sure this form of treatment was on it's way out of the medical practice, but she said she still had regular appointments for it. Almost a decade has past, is this form of treatment still occurring in the USA? 
Although she (and others) are under anesthesia when the ECT occurs, how do they prevent electrocution from happening? How does it work exactly?

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been demonstrated by the American Psychiatric Association to be an effective and safe treatment for many psychiatric disorders. (Jaffe, 2001) The use of ECT still generates significant controversy, however. One review concluded that ECT is only marginally more effective than placebo (ie, sham ECT). (Ross, 2006) ECT has been viewed as harmful by the general public, (Lauber, et al., 2005a) psychiatric patients, (Arshad, et al., 2007) and mental health professionals. (Lauber, et al., 2005b)
ECT has also been perceived as a form of violence against women. (Burstow, 2006) It has been negatively portrayed in movies such as One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, House on Haunted Hill, and Requiem for a Dream. (McDonald & Walter, 2001)
Despite such debate, ECT is used in the United States and endorsed by the American Psychiatric Association. (APA, 2015)
