Q:

UTI bacteria climbing up urine stream!

I visited a doctor who suggested that it is possible for UTI causing bacteria (E coli among others) to climb-up (so to speak) the urine stream, from a dirty urinal for example.
I would like to ascertain if this is possible. To me it is just unbelievable.

On one of the latest podcasts Harkin descries that with the Mate Tea (a very fine particulate tea) you can get upstream movement of particulates. "The tea leaves climb back into the kettle"

The phenomenon was ﬁrst observed during the preparation of the typical
  Argentinian drink, mate, when hot water was poured, from a pot, on a
  water surface “contaminated” with ﬂoating mate particles (each
  particle is like a grass leave of an average area near 0.5mm^2 If the
  column of falling water was short enough (say, under 1cm-height),
  particles of mate were observed to “swim up the stream”, actually
  reaching the originally “uncontaminated” water pot.

The study continues: 

For distances of the order of 1 cm or less, some of the ﬂoating
  particles eventually start to “climb up the stream”

Unless you were peeing 1cm away from the urinal, it's not possible for it to climb your pee stream.
