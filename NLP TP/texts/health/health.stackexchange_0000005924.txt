Q:

How do blood thinners stop the creation of platelets?

I know that with a cut sticky blood cells called platelets are used to prevent an extended amount of blood loss from the wound.
How do blood thinners prevent this?

A:

There are 2 types of blood thinners anticoagulants and antiplatelets. Simply:
Anticoagulants 

Anticoagulants work by interrupting the process involved in the
  formation of blood clots. They're sometimes called "blood-thinning"
  medicines, although they don't actually make the blood thinner

NIH

Vitamin K is essential for those reactions. Warfarin (Coumadin) works
  by decreasing the activity of vitamin K; lengthening the time it takes
  for a clot to form.

Antiplatelets

Antiplatelet drugs, such as aspirin, prevent blood cells called
  platelets from clumping together to form a clot.

A deeper understanding can be derived from looking up the individual medications: Clopidogrel (Antiplatelet) and Coumadin(Anticoagulant). I don't know which type your refering to, but they:

Dont actually thin the blood. They really just interfere with processes to stop and prevent blood clots. 

Anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs work by stopping platelets from
  adhering to one another and clotting proteins from binding together.

Blood thinners can cause thrombocytopenia (low platelets). However, the platelets have to be severely low beneath 100,000 to cause spontaneous and uncontrollable bleeding that may cause death usually. 

Many medications can cause low platelet count by causing immunologic
  reaction against platelets, called drug-induced thrombocytopenia.

So basically on this stuff it takes you longer to clot and therefore increased the time you bleed.
