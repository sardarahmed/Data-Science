Q:

Is this description a tension headache?

Could this be describing a "tension headache"?

A throbbing, aching pain that starts at the back of the head and
  finishes just below the shoulder line.

I thought tension headaches start and sometimes end on the forehead, sometimes traveling behind the ears, and was more of a tightening.

A:

Yes, a tension-type headache is more of a pressing, tightening quality, and mild to moderate intensity. There is no throbbing. There is also no nausea. It is usually bilateral, so usually it is on both sides of the head. The forehead is possible...but not the only option.
In contrast, a migraine is more of a throbbing kind of headache, and begins or stays unilateral.
I based my descriptions off "Medical School for Everyone: Grand Rounds Cases" from The Great Courses, presented by Roy Benaroch. I referred to Mayo Clinic to double check my answer.
