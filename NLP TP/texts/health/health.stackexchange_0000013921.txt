Q:

Is exercise at night dangerous?

Exercise is more fun in the morning, when the air is still fresh and the hot sun is not there to sting you. But not for a few of us who have to go to work in the morning, and also not fun after just coming home at night.
Some of us have time to do sports at night because in the morning we are busy. Is nighttime sports more dangerous for the body?

A:

If you are exercising outside make sure to bring a flash light and other saftey precautions. From what I have read there are many benefits to exercing at night. Here is an article from the Washington Post. And then here is another one which talks about research on this very subject (Chtourou & Souissi, 2012). Other research in the article includes Schoenfeld, et al. (2014) and Gillen, et al. (2013).
(I find it ironic that they said "What is the best time of day to exercise? Itâ€™s not when you think." since it is exactly what I thought.)
