What is the difference between Meniere's disease and Meniere's
syndrome? Is there any difference between the symptoms?

Merriam-Webster defines Disease as:

1 : a condition of the living animal or plant body or of one of its
parts that impairs normal functioning and is typically manifested by
distinguishing signs and symptoms.

and it defines Syndrome as:

1 : a group of signs and symptoms that occur together and characterize
a particular abnormality or condition
2 : a set of concurrent things (such as emotions or actions) that
usually form an identifiable pattern

To expand upon the basic framework supplied by the dictionary, medscape.com clarifies matters:

Ménière disease is endolymphatic hydrops of unknown etiology (ie,
idiopathic endolymphatic hydrops). [Making it the primary condition.]
Ménière syndrome is endolymphatic hydrops caused by a specific
condition. [ie. by any of a number of known primary causes, making the syndrome secondary as such.]
...both of which are both believed [sic] to result from increased pressure
within the endolymphatic system.
However, Ménière disease is idiopathic by definition, whereas Ménière
syndrome can occur secondary to various processes interfering with
normal production or resorption of endolymph.

[Words in bold - mine.]
It is the focus of close attention:

With the growing understanding of the pathophysiology and disease
processes involved with Ménière disease a re-evaluation and possible
redefinition of this condition are well underway.
