Q:

What is the name of this medical item?

The photo shows some kind of sheath, that's used in a hospital context in the UK, to reshape scar tissue and other outcomes of traumatic injury.
The product is made of two layers - an elasticated exterior material with a (fairly substantial/thick)  silicone internal layer.
I'm trying to find the generic name, and if possible specific UK brand names for this product. Help much appreciated.

A:

It appears that you are describing gel tube toe/finger bandage which can be cut to size.  Medipaq and Dykook are 2 brands I know of.
