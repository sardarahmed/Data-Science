Q:

What is the difference between the TDAP and DTAP vaccines?

What is the difference between the TDAP and DTAP vaccines? Some nurses/pharmacists told me they are the same, but I am not convinced. 
If they are the same then why would some organizations request for you to specifically have the TDAP vaccine and won't accept the DTAP?

A:

They are similiar, but for different age group. 

DTAP for people under 7
TDAP for 11 and up basically.

DTaP is a vaccine that helps children younger than age 7 develop
  immunity to three deadly diseases caused by bacteria: diphtheria,
  tetanus, and whooping cough (pertussis). Tdap is a booster
  immunization given at age 11 that offers continued protection from
  those diseases for adolescents and adults.

They both cover the same illnesses, as well. The DTap probably isn't accepted due to the fact that it usually is taken around 7 years and so needs the booster shot TDap.
