Q:

Is there a disease where having had the disease provides less protection for the future than the vaccination?

Vaccination makes sure that you have anti-bodies so that your immune system has a heads-start once you get infected. If you were infected before, your body also built anti-bodies.
Are there diseases where one knows (or at least has a good reason to believe) that having had the disease provides less protection than the vaccination?
This is a follow-up question to Is there a benefit of a COVID-19 vaccination if one had COVID-19 before?

A:

There are a few categories:
Diseases where infection does not produce immunity

Tetanus infection does not produce immunity. Vaccination with the tetanus toxoid vaccination does (ref).

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection does not produce protective immunity; repeat infections are typical. As of May 2023, there's an RSV vaccine in the US.

Malaria needs continual exposure to the parasite to develop some degree of immunity, and it's probably never sterilizing immunity (ref). The R21/Matrix-M vaccine is about 77% effective at preventing clinical malaria (ref).

Diseases where infection results in worse immunity

Dengue virus famously exhibits "antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE)" of disease, meaning that immunity from infection with one of the four types of the virus results in worse disease after subsequent infection with any of the other types. The Qdenga/TAK-003 vaccine is licensed in some countries and there's no evidence that it causes ADE.

Chronic infections

Diseases that produce chronic infections, such as HIV and hepatitis C, don't produce useful immunity. Neither of those have vaccines yet, but several are being tested.

Highly fatal infections

Rabies and Ebolavirus disease have high mortality rates. You might not survive to ever develop natural immunity. Both have vaccines.
