Q:

What's the equivalent of “premature ejaculation” medical condition in female sexual health?

I don't believe this line: 

men are from Mars and women from Venus.

From here, I learned that men and women feel orgasm same but different.
Premature ejaculation (PE) is when ejaculation happens sooner than a man or his partner would like during sex. 
So what's the equivalent of "premature ejaculation" medical condition in female sexual health? 

A:

It is always hard to prove a negative, but I don't think such a condition exists.
Premature Female Orgasm appears to be the term you are looking for, and apparently there has been a patent filed by Pfizer, but I couldn't find any references in literature (Google Scholar, Web of Knowledge) so I guess from a medical perspective, this condition has not been described.
It is here where @CareyGregory's comment comes into play: Premature Ejaculation is defined as an ejaculation that always or nearly always occurs prior to or within about 1 minute of vaginal penetration from the first sexual experience (lifelong PE) or a clinically significant and bothersome reduction in latency time, often to about 3 minutes or less (acquired PE), but one can argue whether statistical deviations from the norm alone provide for pathogenity. 
For females a likewise definition would be an orgasm prior to a certain time after vaginal penetration. Whether this would have any clinical significance can be doubted. Furthermore, unless women express suffering or distress from such a condition (as yet unreported in literature), calling it a condition remains questionable.
