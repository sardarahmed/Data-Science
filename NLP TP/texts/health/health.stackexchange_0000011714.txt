Q:

Can juices fulfill requirement of water ?

As our body needs more water and I drink more juices than water. So, I want to ask that can juices fulfill requirement of water ?  ? 

A:

The problem with getting your daily requirement of water solely from juices, is that most juices have significant amounts of sugar in them. Let's say your favorite juice is orange juice. Orange juice is about 88.3% water so in order to get your recommended 64 fl. oz. (1.892 L) of water you'd have to consume 72 fl. oz. (2.129 L) of juice. Orange juice has 112 Calories in 1 cup (248 g), so you'd have to drink nine cups which would be 1,008 Calories. Add that to whatever food you eat and you'd have a whole helluva lot of calories. Unless you led a very active live style, you'd gain a lot of weight. But as far as water goes, your body really doesn't care where the H2O comes from. If you got it from juice or plain water, you'd more or less remain just as hydrated. (I say "more or less" because variations in sodium content of one juice to another would affect how much water your body retains.)Edit: Contents of orange juice came from this Wikipedia article.Edit 2: For those who consider Wikipedia an unreliable source: this site also has similar data.
