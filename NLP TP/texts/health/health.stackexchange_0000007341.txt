Q:

Supplements: When and how to take them to maximize absorption

I switched to a vegetarian diet a while back, and I am now taking a few supplements consisting of common minerals, vitamins and omega-3's as a compliment to my regular diet.
When should I take the supplements to ensure that they are absorbed most effectively?
Does it matter what time of day it is, and does it matter what else I have in my stomach at the time?
I have read that some vitamins are fat soluble – does that mean that they should be taken with a meal? If taken with a meal – does eating a lot of food reduce "digestion efficiency" of the supplements?

What I have done, which is based entirely on my own thoughts, which are not based on any particular research:
I have been taking my supplements during the afternoon a few hours before dinner. At around 5 pm, body metabolism is at a high, and I usually don't have a lot of food in my stomach. My thinking has therefore been that the body will be efficient at absorbing the contents of the supplements.
I have avoided taking supplements in the morning because I am a morning coffee-drinker, and caffeine is laxative.

A:

To get the most of your vitamins/minerals is quite simple, really.
There are two types of soluble vitamins/minerals:

Water-soluble
Fat-soluble

Absorption of water-soluble vitamins is quite easy, considering almost everything you eat/drink contains water. 
However, if you want maximum absorption rate for fat-soluble vitamins/minerals, you'll want to have some fat along with the supplement(s) you consume. 
This is why most multivitamin boxes will instruct you to consume the pill with dinner (because it's presumed that fat will be present with your dinner).
