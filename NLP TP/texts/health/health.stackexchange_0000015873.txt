Q:

Put a finger in it? When is it appropriate to stop a bleed with your finger?

Can a arterial bleed be stopped by putting your finger/s in it? Like the one in your leg or a place where pressure can't be placed normally?

A:

Putting your fingers in a wound is going to inflict severe pain on the casualty.  There are ways you can apply direct pressure on an arterial wound, even if it is on the upper thigh.
It is possible to apply pressure to any sort of external bleeding, and sticking your finger inside an arterial wound is not really going to help. The casualty might survive the bleeding but then die because of blood poisoning/severe infections later on which can be introduced by inserting objects such as a finger. You should never do this.
It is known that a tourniquet can be used to stem the flow of blood but this too can cause more harm than not. If left on too long it can kill the limb and lead to the need for amputation due to lack of blood supply to the extremities.
If there's an object in the wound
If there’s an object in there, don’t pull it out, because it may be acting as a plug reducing the bleeding. Instead, leave it in and apply pressure either side of it with a pad (such as a clean cloth) or fingers, until a sterile dressing is available.  In which case, again apply the sterile dressing around the object. Don't apply pressure to the object.
If there's no object in the wound
Follow the steps below for treating severe bleeding.
