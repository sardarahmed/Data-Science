Q:

Nutritional Guidelines

Where can I find FDA nutritional guidelines that are used for Nutritional Facts on packaged foods?  
Based on 2000 calorie diet  
Total fat
Sat fat
Cholesteral
Sodium
Carbohydrate
Protein  
Daily g or mg for each of the items above?
I can find examples with % but cannot find what total is used.
Like 7% is rounded from some number.  

A:

National Institutes of Health
Daily Values for nutrients in a 2,000 Calorie diet:

Total fat = 65 g
Sat fat = 20 g
Cholesteral = 300 mg
Sodium = 2,400 mg
Carbohydrate = 300 g
Protein = 50 g
