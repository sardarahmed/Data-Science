Q:

Any irreversible damage from not treating common cold right

When I catch a cold, I usually just work through it, i.e. take no rest day and try to live by the same schedule as when I'm healthy.
I already read on WebMD that this behaviour can increase the duration of the cold and / or worsen the symptoms, but can I also experience any long-term damage, e.g. from the additional ~3 days of coughing?
And how about when the common cold symptoms mix with flu symptoms?

A:

Common colds are exactly that, common. Lots of people contract colds and there are no significant health repercussions. http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/coldsandflu/Pages/Coldcomfort.aspx However, if you have underlying medical conditions where your immune system is already compromised then a common cold can cause serious problems if left untreated. 
If you have a serious underlying health condition, your doctor will likely advise you of what action to take should you contract a cold.
