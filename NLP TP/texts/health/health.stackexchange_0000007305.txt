Q:

Walking immediately after the meal

I find different views for this topic.
First view,
It is not a good idea to walk immediately after a meal as your stomach requires energy to digest the food and so you should not be using your energy on something else immediately after having food, which can affect digestion negatively. Should wait for sometime and then can walk.
Second view,
Walk immediately after the meal helps burning calories and even helps digestion and other benefits as well.
What is actually true?

A:

There is a belief that walking just after a meal causes fatigue, stomach ache, and other types of discomfort.But researches have found that walking just after a meal is more effective for weight loss than waiting one hour after eating before walking.It can help

to prevent a lot of stomach problems, including indigestion and heartburn.
lower your blood sugar, 
bring down triglycerides, 
Decrease cardiovascular risk by preventing high fluctuation of blood sugar just after meal.As blood sugar typically rises and then falls after eating, but large spikes and variations can raise cardiovascular risk..
speed up digestion(increase metabolism) 
lower post-meal blood sugar levels in people with Type 2 diabetes
help  burn calories and 
aid in weight loss.

It is quite clear that walking suppresses the glucose increase after a meal. Because glucose increases to its maximum at 30â€“60 minutes after a meal, walking must be started before the glucose level reaches a maximum, because once insulin is secreted it will play a role as an obesity hormone. It can be assumed that starting walking as soon as possible seems to be optimal to control blood sugar levels.
