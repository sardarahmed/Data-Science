Q:

Treatment for severe Pain

I've been having severe internal pain around my eye, why? And how can it be taken care of 

A:

Firstly what you are going through is called cluster headache.   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_headache.                                                                                        Secondly, three main treatments are available to relieve pain when taken soon after a cluster headache starts. These are: sumatriptan injections, which you can give yourself up to twice a day. sumatriptan or zolmitriptan nasal spray, which can be used if you would prefer not to have injections.        http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cluster-headaches/Pages/Introduction.aspx
