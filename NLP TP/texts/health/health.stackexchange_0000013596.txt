Q:

What would be the impact of taking a 1 cell thick slice down the middle of a person

Would the brain be damaged, or would everything just stick itself together instantly?

A:

Adding to the above answer, the most immediate fatal events are:

While you can cut the corpus callosum effectively separating R/L cerebral cortex without killing the person, splitting your midbrain/brainstem is instant game over.  Almost all signals to/from the rest of the body and cerebral cortex, including your heartbeat breathing and consciousness, originate or go through there.  There are multiple points of crossover that you'd interrupt - there and throughout the spinal cord. 
You'd transect critical vessels (the aorta at the arch, superior/inferior vena cavae, circle of Willis, dural sinus) so you'd both dump out massive blood volume in an instant, and stop all further circulation. Vessels don't auto-seal, even a small break can cause significant leaks. Transecting your CSF ventricles would drain the fluid from the brain.
