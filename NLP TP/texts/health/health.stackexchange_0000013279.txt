Q:

Can a headache be caused solely by a smell?

I've bought some air fresheners a while back, and since then I get migraine attacks more often. I didn't fully realize that it might be the cause for my headaches, until I didn't use it for a week and I was fine.
Yesterday I just used it again and it was followed by a headache. I thought it might be because of the chemicals, or maybe I am allergic to it, So I tried a new one today, same result.
My question is, is there any scientific reason that could claim a headache caused by just a smell?!

A:

Certainly, headaches can be caused by a variety of smells, perfumes, paints, gasoline, bleach and yes, air fresheners.
A study in 200 migraine patients showed perfumes were the first most common cause when headaches are attributed to odors (75%), followed by paints (42%), gasoline (28%) and bleach (27%)
