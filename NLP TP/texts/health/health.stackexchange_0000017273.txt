Is there a drug being developed for palpitations without arrhythmia?

A:

A definitive answer is unlikely because drug companies don't normally make it publicly known what drugs they're developing. 
There are a number of antiarrhythmic drugs already available that could possibly treat palpitations, and there are also ablation procedures. Treatments exist now for arrhythmias.
