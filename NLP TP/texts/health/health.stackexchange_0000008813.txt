Q:

Is there a universal medical terms naming convention web resource?

I want to use proper conventional names for known diseases and cell and tissue types in my scientific research. Is there a web resource where I can look the terms up and make reference to this resource?

A:

Health insurances and hospitals (for the coding of the diseases) often use the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) from the World Health Organisation to standardise the naming of the diseases and assigns them a code.
There is an online available version (ICD-10) here:
http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2016/en
For the classification of tissues and cells, you might maybe find an answer on the biology SE.
Hope this helps!
