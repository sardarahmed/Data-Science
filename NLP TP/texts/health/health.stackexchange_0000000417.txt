Q:

How long is someone infectious after a cold?

How long is someone infectious after a cold? 
I am talking about a common cold, not something extreme.

A:

Tl;dr - More contagious at the beginning, much less at the end.
The "common cold" (or upper respiratory infection) is associated with over 200 different viral types1, and many times more than one virus is present. Because of this, there's probably no completely specific answer to this question, but it can be answered generally.
Rhinovirus-caused colds (which are a large majority of "common" colds) are typically contagious at the beginning, and are much less contagious after a few days2. You are most at risk of transmitting the virus to someone else for the 4-5 days after being exposed yourself3 - not necessarily when symptoms appear.
In other words, you can definitely be asymptomatic and still contagious. On the other hand, if you still feel symptoms after a week, the chances are much lower that you're actually still contagious.
