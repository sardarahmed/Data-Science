Q:

How to get rid of insomnia naturally?

I know that sleep is important, and on weeks, that I consistently get enough sleep I feel my best.  The problem is sometimes I wake in the middle of the night and can not go back to sleep for hours.  I know that insomnia in general is a somewhat common problem.  I do not want to take medication, but want my sleep to improve.  Any suggestions would be helpful.

A:

Sleep Hygiene. Learn it, try it, and see if it resolves your issue.
I've answered this similar question before.
Insomnia has different causes.  The most common, outside of poor sleep hygiene, is anxiety or depression.  That's something else to consider.
I recommend seeing your doctor in general to discuss it, they can help guide you whether there are any alarm features that might require tests or treatment, like signs of sleep apnea.
