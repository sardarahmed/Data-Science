Q:

How can I stop mouth breathing while I sleep?

I've been diagnosed with sleep apnea and am currently treating it with an apap. When I was fitted for the apap (and associated masks), the provider told me that if I start drooling I should call them and ask for a chin strap. Drooling is a sign that I am breathing through my mouth, and since the apap mask only covers my nose I shouldn't be doing that.
After about a year with the apap, I finally gave in to my dentist's urging that I wear a mouthguard to sleep because I'm grinding my teeth (and broke a crown). Now with the mouthguard, I started drooling in my sleep.
I dutifully called the medical equipment provider and asked for a chin strap like I was instructed. However, the chin strap interferes with the fitting of my mask so I keep waking up at night with air blowing in my face. I don't like it and I haven't been using it.
Is there another solution for mouth breathing besides a chin strap?

A:

Yes, you can get a full face mask and then it wont matter if you are breathing through your mouth or not. I would contact your medical equipment provider again and see what they have in options for full face masks. Personally I use Quattro full face mask and have no issues with it.
You can look here for an idea of what masks are out there to chose from.
