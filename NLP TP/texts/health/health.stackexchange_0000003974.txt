Q:

Can thinking too hard cause a migraine or a headache?

Can thinking too hard cause a migraine or a headache, and if so, why?
For example when you've a math problem and you're concentrating hard on a task to solve it.

A:

The exact cause of migraines is unknownNHS, although they are thought to be the result of temporary changes, or abnormal brain activity which can affect nerve signals, chemicals and blood vessels in the brain.
It could also relate to your health conditions (e.g. chronic headache), vital energy or specific hormone balance at the given time. Such as levels of sodium2006 or blood sugar (glucose).
Therefore it's not possible to indicate whether concentrating hard on a task can cause migraines or headaches, unless it's caused by emotional (anxiety, tension, stress, etc.) or physical trigger (tiredness, low blood sugar, etc.)NHS.
