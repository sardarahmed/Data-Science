Q:

What is topical snuff?

I am reading Burket’s Oral Medicine, Chapter - 4 on ‘Ulcerative, Vesicular, And Bullous Lesions’.
Under Herpesvirus infections, the author has this to say:

Animal studies on hamster cheek pouches show an enhanced development of invasive squamous cell carcinoma when HSV1 infection is combined with topical snuff.

Tried to google that but couldn’t find a definite answer.

A:

Topical products are applied directly to a part of the body, whereas other products are administered in other (more specific) ways. For example, oral products are used in or around the mouth.
Snuff is a smokeless tobacco made from ground or pulverised tobacco leaves. Snuff is dry and usually consumed via the nasal route (via the nose) by sniffing it. In the case presented, the snuff is used topically (in hamster cheek pouches), probably in the form of snus or dipping tobacco, both of which are wet powdered smokeless tobacco products.
