Q:

How to deal with winter blues

I suffer from severe winter blues. It starts around January and by March, I am at my wits end. I come from a tropical climate and the sever cold and lack of sunlight makes me just want to go crazy.
I have been living in Toronto for past 8 years.
Always taking a vacation to an exotic place is not possible. What are some things I can do? If I try to get used to winter sports, will it help? I am 34, quite fit but I tried skiing and it was so cold.
I don't want to become a couch potato watching tv for 4 - 5 months of the year. What are some things I can do?
This year I bought  a 10,000 lux light bulb, will it help?

A:

This answer is based on the fact that you have been in a region with less sunlight for several years and continue to suffer. It therefore focuses on Seasonal Affective Disorder, which you may or may not have. 
Seasonal affective disorder is an actual illness, and a form of depression. Unfortunately, it is underdiagnosed and undertreated. It is recognized in DSMâ€”5 as Depressive Disorder with Seasonal Pattern. 
Diagnosis and treatment are best left to a professional, and may include therapy and medication. However, there are some ways to at least try to make it less severe or that can ease "winter blues" that isn't severe enough to be diagnosed as SAD. 

Go outside when it's light as often as possible. This even helps when it's grey and cloudy outside 
while it's light outside, if you need to be indoors, be close to a window where your body can register that it is still light outside 
Exercise regularly 

Light therapy is effective, but is hard to get right alone - just sitting in front of a bright light occasionally is not enough.
