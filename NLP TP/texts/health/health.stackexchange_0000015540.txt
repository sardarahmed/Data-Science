Q:

Does ingesting nicotinamide riboside (NR) supplements have a deleterious effect on tendons?

I read on https://web.archive.org/web/20180308023625/http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/98465-elysium-basis-trial-published-repeat-dose-nr-pterostilbene-increases-nad-levels-in-humans/:

As you may recall in the Personal Experiences thread here on LC a number of people (tentatively) attributed their tendonitis to taking NR [nicotinamide riboside].

Does ingesting nicotinamide riboside (NR) supplements have a deleterious effect on tendons? I'm looking for scientific studies or sound reasoning  (less preferable but still could be interesting).

A:

There is no data to suggest that is the case.
The placebo controlled safety study https://www.nature.com/articles/s41514-017-0016-9 found no differences in musculoskeletal adverse side effects between active and control groups.
