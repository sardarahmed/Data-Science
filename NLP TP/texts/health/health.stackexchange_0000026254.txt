Q:

Are products used in dentistry tested for toxicity?

Drugs are systematically tested for toxicity according to strict standards nowdays. But are products and materials used in dentistry (varnishes, resins, metals, acrylic, cements, etc..) tested using the same standards as for usual drugs ? In particular, are they tested for long term low grade toxicity or just for short term acute toxicity ? I have in mind for instance the role of BPA as a well known endocrine disruptor, and that substance is nevertheless allowed and used in dentistry.

A:

In the US, medical devices including those used in dentistry both for diagnostic equipment and for things like cement, amalgams, etc are regulated by the FDA. Presumably in other countries the equivalent regulatory agencies are involved. FDA device regulation is similar to that of drugs, and in some ways can be even more stringent due to the difficulty in removing medical devices (vs stopping medication) should problems arise. The specific support required for approval will depend on what exactly the device is.
The EU guidance seems to be that exposure to BPA from medical devices (including dental devices) is low and not of much concern. Most BPA release from dental products is within the first hour after implant and at levels below that which causes harm.
