Q:

Drinking alcohol after tick-borne encephalitis vaccine

A friend of mine got a tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) shot yesterday, and the doctor said he mustn't drink alcohol for 3 days after getting the shot. Unfortunately, my friend forgot about that for a while and drank a bottle of beer today. Now he's worried about complications.
Is it known what complications could arise from drinking alcohol shortly after TBE vaccination, if any?  Could the vaccine be ineffective because of that? Could he get encephalitis?

A:

No, you can't get encephalitis from the vaccine. According to a company that provides one brand of the vaccine:

On the day of application it is recommended to avoid any strains,
  sauna or excessive alcohol drinking.

One beer doesn't constitute excessive drinking. 
The manufacturer of another brand of the vaccine doesn't even mention avoiding alcohol.
