Q:

Suffering from Gout problem need help?

I am 17 years old teenager, recently my joint at ankles got swollen, I thought its normal but next day I was unable to walk due pain in joint. So we wentt to Doctor using mine blood reports and in reports mine C-Reactive protein level was 61.7mg/L, Uric acid level was 7.5mg/dl and ESR was 39 mm 1st hr. So he told me that I have gout and prescribed Febutaz 80mg , Pantocid and Acyproxyum ( last two are painkillers while 1st is for reducing uric acid)  also gave diet restrictions (low purine diet) , however after 6th day my swelling was lowered I was still following diet restrictions and medication, but as soon as I head on 10th day swelling again returned ( my painkiller dosage was done before), What do I do? Cuz I have Exam in 2 months and is it enough to treat it? For your information On 8 the day I eat Ladyfinger and Raw pineapple and 7 glasses of water. 

A:

You need to have some synovial fluid drawn from the joint and examined for Crystals. If none are present the condition is not gout. 
Other possible causes of symptoms are psoriatic arthritis rheumatoid arthritis septic (infectious arthritis).
The high CRP number indicates an autoimmune condition. 
Ask for steroid injection in ankle.
That may give you some relief while you try to adjust your diet to one focused on reducing inflammation.
Keep an eye out for other symptoms like skin rashes that are also caused by auto immune inflammation  causing disorders. 
I had extreme ankle pain and swelling for 2 months finally got injection. Within a day ankle  was much better.
Has not recurred for 4 months.
But now I have a skin problem diagnosed as psoriasis.
My symptoms began during a high stress time in my life ( death of my sister).
Anything that helps lower stress like meditation, yoga,exercise,healthy foods will help.
Good luck!
