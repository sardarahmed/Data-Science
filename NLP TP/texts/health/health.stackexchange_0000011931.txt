Q:

Can flatulence be a cause of sleeplessness?

Traditional knowledge about heath in my country is guided by Ayurveda and according to it sleeplessness can be a symptom of flatulence. I wonder if a connection between flatulence and sleeplessness exists and has been discovered by modern medicine.
Research:
I found only freemd.com of DSHI Systems correlate Flatulence with insomnia.

A:

Flatulence, which is likely associated with abdominal distention and thus some discomfort, can disturb sleep.
