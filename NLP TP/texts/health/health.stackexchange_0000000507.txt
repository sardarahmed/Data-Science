Q:

Can wearing eyeglasses cause your eyesight to degrade further?

I've been told that wearing eyeglasses to correct poor vision can cause your vision to degrade even further. In other words, "Hold off wearing glasses for as long as possible, because once you start, it gets much worse."
The claim is that with glasses, the eyes don't have to work as hard to focus and then become "lazier" (for lack of a better term), leading to a vicious cycle of needing more and more correction.
Is there any truth to this claim?

A:

According to the Mayo Clininc, no. They write in their eye myths and facts section:

Myth: Wearing eyeglasses will weaken the eyes: The eyeglasses worn to correct nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, or presbyopia will not weaken the eyes any more than they will permanently "cure" these kinds of vision problems. Glasses are simply external optical aids that provide vision to people with blurred vision caused by refractive errors. Exceptions are the kinds of glasses given to children with crossed eyes (strabismus) or lazy eye (amblyopia). These glasses are used temporarily to help straighten the eyes or improve vision. Not wearing such glasses may lead to permanently defective vision [1].
