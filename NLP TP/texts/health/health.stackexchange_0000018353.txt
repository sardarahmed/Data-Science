Q:

What does the intensity in an MR image represent?

Hounsfield units are frequently used as intensity for CT images.
What is used for MR images? 

A:

There are no units for MRI intensity.
A Comparison of Five Methods for Signal Intensity Standardization in MRI (CEUR-WS.org):

A major problem in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the lack of a
  pulse sequence dependent standardized intensity scale like the
  Hounsfield units in computed tomography.

MRI sequences (Radiopedia):

When describing most MRI sequences we refer to the shade of grey of
  tissues or fluid with the word intensity, leading to the following
  absolute terms:

high signal intensity = white
intermediate signal intensity = grey
low signal intensity = black 

Often we refer to the appearance by relative terms:

hyperintense = brighter than the thing we are comparing it to
isointense = same brightness as the thing we are comparing it to
hypointense = darker than the thing we are comparing it to

Annoyingly these relative terms are used without reference to the tissue being used as the comparison.
