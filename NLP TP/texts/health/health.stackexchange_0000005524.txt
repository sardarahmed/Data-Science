Q:

Is there a difference between raw-eaten and dispersed sugar?

I've always wondered this one question: If in one liter of Coca-Cola there is a 30 sugarcubes equivallent, how is it possible for the fastfoods to make it from a little of powder?
So is the dissoluted sugar in a liquid actually equivallent to raw-eaten sugar from the medical point of view?

A:

Diabetics when calculating insulin doses for a meal look at the carbohydrate content for the whole meal.  It's not important if the sugars are taken in one mouthful, or dissolved and taken over the whole meal.  So, to answer your question, the approach taken is that functionally it makes no difference.
