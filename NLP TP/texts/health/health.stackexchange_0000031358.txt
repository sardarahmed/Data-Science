Q:

What is the meaning of "co-formulated"?

I was reading the The right drug for the right patient section of the University of Sydney website, which provides these clinical guidelines (flow chart), and says (bold my own):

There are no studies directly comparing these treatment
options and their relative effectiveness is unclear. Inhaled
corticosteroids (budesonide or ciclesonide) can be considered
for adjunctive use with other treatment options; however, the
added benefit of adjunctive use is unclear. There is currently no
evidence available on the effectiveness of concurrent use of
monoclonal antibodies or antivirals for COVID-19, except
where co-formulated.

I do not understand the meaning of co-formulated (nor coformulated), and cannot infer its meaning from the context.
What is the meaning of 'co-formulated'?

A:

From Chauhan, V. M., Zhang, H., Dalby, P. A., & Aylott, J. W. (2020). Advancements in the co-formulation of biologic therapeutics. Journal of Controlled Release, 327, 397-405.:

Co-formulation can be considered as the purist view of a combination therapy and can be described as consisting of more than one drug substance in a single formulation, with the intention of delivering multiple therapeutic agents at the same time for maximum therapeutic benefit

Co-formulated in the context of a therapeutic drug/treatment means that two or more components are part of the same combined treatment, for example existing in the same pill or solution for injection. In this form, they are not separable.
It's not clear to me that this is specifically what the chart you linked means, though, rather they are saying that some treatment options have not been compared independent of the others, but were always given together within trials. That might be better described as "co-administered".
From the context of the flow chart, it is not immediately clear to me which specific combinations they are referring to.
