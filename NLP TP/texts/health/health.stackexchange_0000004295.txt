Q:

If I add one fruit a day - which one?

I don't eat fast food and go to the gym. I try to eat healthily & sensibly.
I have noticed that I sometimes feel hungry/have an energy dip mid-afternoon.
I always have some granola bars in a desk drawer & will occasionally have one of those. 
Should I eat a piece of fruit then, and, if so, whic? 

A:

Why stick to only one type of fruit? One day you have an apple and a guava the next. After all, each fruit has it's own set of benefits and they are all good for your health. No fruit is considered bad to consume right? And if you are only looking to fill up your energy meter and to satiate your mid-afternoon cravings, bananas are an excellent choice as they are high in calories and are very effective in eliminating hunger.
