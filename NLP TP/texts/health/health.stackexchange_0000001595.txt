Q:

What are some natural remedies for lowering blood sugar besides diet and exercise?

I was diagnosed as a type 2 diabetic a few months ago, and have been dieting and exercising ever since. My A1C has gone down from 13% to 9%, I noticed these cinnamon pills in a local store that claimed they helped naturally bring down blood sugar. So I am wondering now if there is any validity in that, and also if there are any other natural ways to bring down blood sugar besides prescribed medication (which I am taking) and exercise. 

A:

You seem to be on a great track. I think you're doing all the right things.
Regarding cinnamon pills: I have indeed read studies regarding cinnamon curbs blood sugar by lowering insulin resistance. Just be aware that it is a warming herb/spice so if you are someone that finds themselves just a bit too hot all the time, this will exacerbate that.
Lastly, here are some other natural remedies that could work, with some support from science:

Coptis extract (called Huang Lian in Chinese): Lengthy studies have shown that Coptis extract has antibacterial, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory properties and protect against diabetes, heart disease, and some forms of cancer very well.

Gynostemma Pentaphyllum Herbal Tea: Gynostemma has been shown in a study to decrease insulin resistance significantly (Source: US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health) 

Note: I work with a new shop that addresses health concerns, including diabetes: rootandspring.com and I'm also one of the authors for rootandspring.com, which believes and carries in both these products.
