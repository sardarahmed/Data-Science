Q:

Can I contract chickenpox from my child who just got vaccinated?

My child just got the MMRV vaccine that contains a weakened chickenpox virus.
If I never had chickenpox symptoms in my life, can I contract it from him?
Would also getting vaccinated help?

A:

Yes, you can contract it, but it is very unlikely. 
The chickenpox vaccine is a live (attenuated) vaccine, meaning that it was weakened. 

People who get chickenpox vaccines can spread the vaccine-strain varicella-zoster-virus to others. However, this happens very rarely.

In a 10 year study of Varivax (the Merck vaccine), this happened in only 3 people in contact with. One of them was a pregnant woman, one a baby and one a healthy man. Even considering not all cases get reported and that the authors of this study work for Merck, this is a very low number, considering how many doses were used over that time period (55 million doses distributed). 

Secondary transmission of vaccine virus: A varicella-like rash occurring 10-21 days after exposure to a person recently vaccinated. It is extremely rare. Since 1995, only eight secondary cases of transmission of vaccine virus from seven vaccinees have been documented with the varicella (Oka/Merck) vaccine, five of which occurred in immunocompetent people... All laboratory-confirmed cases of Oka vaccine secondary transmission have resolved without complications.

As for getting vaccinated yourself, it is certainly something you can do as an adult and the CDC recommends it for unvaccinated adults.
