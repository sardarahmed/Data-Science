Q:

Is Pentasa an immunosuppressive drug?

Is Pentasa an immunosuppresive drug? I want to know because my brother has been diagnosed with Crohn's Disease.

A:

Pentasa is one brand name for a drug called mesalazine (or mesalamine). While immunosuppressant drugs are often used on the management of Crohn’s disease, this is not one of them. It is in a group of drugs called aminosalicylates (somewhat similar to aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but the mechanism of action is a little different).
It works through an anti-inflammatory effect on the walls of the bowel by inhibiting inflammatory compounds called prostaglandin E2 and leukotrienes. It can be administered orally or rectally, depending on the affected part of the bowel.
Here is a link to a useful advice leaflet about Crohn’s disease and its treatments.
