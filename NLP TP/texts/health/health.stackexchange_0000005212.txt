Q:

How can I calculate the daily recommended % value of calcium based on the information I have?

Essentially based on the calcium information I have on these brands of water bottles brands, how can I calculate the daily % value of calcium they give?
Fiji water = 17mg/L Calcium
Evian water = 78mg/L Calcium

A:

For calcium it depends on age and gender, as shown in this chart:

So for a male aged 19-50, 1 liter of Fiji water would be:
17 / 1000 = .017, or 1.7% of the RDV

And 1 liter of Evian would be:
78 / 1000 = .078, or 7.8% of the RDV

In other words, if you're looking for calcium in bottled water, you're looking in the wrong place. It's the most expensive possible source of calcium you could choose and not a very good one.
As Mayo notes:

Your body doesn't produce calcium, so you must get it through other
  sources. Calcium can be found in a variety of foods, including:

Dairy products, such as cheese, milk and yogurt
Dark green leafy vegetables, such as broccoli and kale
Fish with edible soft bones, such as sardines and canned salmon
Calcium-fortified foods and beverages, such as soy products, cereal and
  fruit juices, and milk substitutes

To absorb calcium, your body also needs vitamin D. A few foods
  naturally contain small amounts of vitamin D, such as canned salmon
  with bones and egg yolks. You can also get vitamin D from fortified
  foods and sun exposure. The RDA for vitamin D is 600 international
  units (15 micrograms) a day for most adults.

Notice that they don't mention water.
