Q:

What does the term "person vaccinated-days" mean

A number of papers relating to COVID-19 Vaccination refer to the occurrence of thrombotic events.
Rates of occurrence are usually expressed in the form of "cases of thrombotic events per million person vaccinated-days."
I am familiar with the concept of events per million but not events per million person vaccinated days.
What does the term "person vaccinated days" mean?

Example here -
"Thrombotic complications of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2: what pharmacovigilance reports tell us – and what they don't"

The study by Smadja et al. confirms the rarity of possible thrombotic complications in association with COVID-19 vaccination, reporting only 0.21 [95% CI 0.19–0.22] cases of thrombotic events per million person vaccinated-days.

A:

"Person vaccinated-days" is just expressing units of people*days; if one person was vaccinated 7 days ago and another 3 days ago that would be a total of "10 person vaccinated-days".
