Q:

Prevent foot cramp from standing at workspace

I've made myself a standing workspace (because of getting strain injuries from sitting).
Everything was going well until I started getting cramps in my feet.  I first noticed this while swimming.
It looks as though the tendon running along the sole of the foot is being constantly stretched.
Can anyone think of a good solution?
I'm thinking of something like the mats they use at Dojos, something that the foot would sink into enough that it is supported everywhere, but I can't find any product that fits my needs.

A:

I think that shoes with good bridge support may be the answer here.
I've been working wearing slippers (one of the many dangers of working at home!).
My guess is that whatever tendon runs the length of the sole was getting put under constant stress.
I've now taken a fortnight away from standing, and I'm using my tennis trainers upon return.
I think a better solution would be if I could find some mat made out of some kind of spongy material that allows the entire foot to sink into it, maybe at a slight angle so the heels are at a higher level than the toes, as I would guess the heel will sink further.
However, I won't accept this (or any other) answer until I am certain my feet are back to a healthy state.
EDIT: June 2016, A HogHeaven anti-fatigue mat has done the job perfectly.
