Q:

Best way to clean dry fruits and nuts before eating

Recently I got acute Diarrhoea, which I suspect to be due ton a new packet of dates which I purchased recently (1st time I'm using this).
I have dry fruits and nuts regularly, however I haven't practiced washing them before eating.
Can bacteria be present on Dry fruits/nuts? Is washing them before eating advisable? Would this kill any bacteria present on them if any?
What are the other possibilities of removing bacteria from dry fruits/nuts? Would refrigeration help?

A:

Can bacteria be present on Dry fruits/nuts?

Absolutely. In fact, everything in your environment, including your food, is covered with bacteria, but most of them are harmless. In the good old days, we washed fruit and veggies to reduce possible contaminants, like insecticides used in their growth to keep them pretty, not to remove bacteria. But today it's different.*

Is washing them before eating advisable?

In this day of increased mass production, questionable preservatives, and increased litigation, the medical websites I looked at recommend washing dried fruit and nuts. :(

What are the other possibilities of removing bacteria from dry fruits/nuts? 

Refrigeration keeps many bacteria from multiplying, but doesn't kill bacteria already present on food.
I couldn't find anything other method of reducing bacteria on the surfaces of dried fruits and nuts. On the effects of pretreatment on bacteria before dehydrating, yes. But once dried, no.
*I am old enough to remember this, and to remember the first big food-borne illness outbreaks. There were some outbreaks before then, of course, but many more probably occurred unnoticed. Looking into the origins of the Food and Drug Administrations is pretty informative and interesting reading.
