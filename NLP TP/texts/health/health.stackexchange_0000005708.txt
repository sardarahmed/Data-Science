Q:

Is stomach acid from healthy food different from unhealthy food?

This is maybe a weird question but let me try to explain it.
Once healthy food (vegetables, fruits, healthy oil's etc.) reaches the stomach the acids kick's in to break the food further. Is the stomach acid combined with healthy food the same as stomach acid combined with unhealthy food? 
The endpoint is that I'm trying to find out will stomach acid combined with healthy food make less damage to the esophagus than the stomach acid combined with unhealthy food or is stomach acid just stomach acid no matter which type of food  it interacts with?

A:

Stomach acid does not react with foods in the way that it would form harmful chemical complexes. The acid affects pepsinogen - it helps to convert it in its active form pepsin, which is the enzyme that breaks down proteins.

If your question is about acid reflux and how to prevent damage of the esophagus by acid, you may want to know which foods decrease the tonus of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and thus allow reflux of the acid. Examples of such foods are chocolate, fatty foods in general, and foods with peppermint. Other things that irritate the esophagus include spicy and acidic foods, tea, coffee and smoking.

So, in case you have acid reflux, the above foods may be unhealthy for you, even if they are not unhealthy by themselves.
