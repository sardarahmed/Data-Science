Q:

can I take pills before food?

Some medicine is required to take with food. This question asked how much food you need to take.
But I'm interested if you can take pills and then eat later (20-30 min). 
Is it considered that you take pills with food or it's too long and food should be taken exactly the same moment?

A:

They are referring to taking them with a meal (so in a real world sense you'd take them right after you sit down to eat).  I'd suggest taking them as prescribed.  Not taking your medicine with food can affect the bioavailability / absorption of your medicine. Can get a sick feeling too if taken on an empty stomach.
