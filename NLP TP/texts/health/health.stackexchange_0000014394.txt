Q:

How often do ICD codes reflect the actual diagnosis in EHR?

Electronic health records (EHRs) often contains ICD codes used for billing purpose. Is there any study/survey that looked at how often ICD codes in EHRs reflect the actual diagnosis?

A:

In many cases they do reflect the actual diagnosis. 
It depends on the disease in question.

eMerge network work on validation is for example here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3715338. In that study, they used ICD-based definitions but also other available data.
Similar work in diabetes mellitus diagnosis is also published (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4416392/)
Validation research tries to arrive at positive predictive value. E.g., https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30480162
In Japan, the PPV for AMI was 82.5%. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30477501)
