Q:

Ways to lessen or prevent episodes of sleep walking

I am currently on medication to dampen my sleep walking. The medication is amitriptilyne, but lately it seems to be having no effect. 
For the past few weeks I have been getting up at around 3am for a nightly sleepwalk in which I go to the fridge, get food, and take it back to my bed. 
I don't usually eat it, but it is getting ruined being out of the fridge. 
Are there any methods or other effective medication to help prevent sleep walking? I'm ruining quite a bit of food. 
When sleepwalking I seem to have full cognitive ability so locks and other mechanisms don't work. 

A:

There is no known way to absolutely prevent sleepwalking; however, certain steps can be taken to minimize one's risk. These include:

Get adequate sleep.
Limit stress. Meditate or do relaxation exercises.
Avoid any kind of stimulation (auditory or visual) prior to bedtime.
