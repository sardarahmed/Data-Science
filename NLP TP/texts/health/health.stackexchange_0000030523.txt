Q:

Spreading covid talking vs breathing risks

Some links claim one can spread covid merely by breathing (not talking):

Currently available research supports the possibility that SARS-CoV-2
could be spread via bioaerosols generated directly by patientsâ€™
exhalation

My question is: if someone say person A enters a room which activity carries more risk in terms of becoming infected from person A:

activity 1: A is silent in room all time

activity 2: A talks

A:

Activity 2 carries more risk of transmission : talking is associated with more droplets being exhaled in the room's air.
However, Activity 1 cannot be considered as completely devoid of droplet generation.
This article published in Nature gives informations on aerosol transmission  https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-69286-3
