Q:

How to combat muscular atrophy while in coma?

Muscles start to deteriorate without use, so without the person consciously moving a body part or flexing, can muscle tissue degeneration be stopped or at least decelerated by administering something, some passive technique, or machine assistance?

A:

Of course you could combat muscular degeneration. 
What you could do is 

Massage
(Higher protein intake by infusion)
(Electrical muscle stimulation (EMS)
(Steroids)

But it's an intervention that's not essential for life and probably dangerous so this isn't practical.
