Q:

Where might "Counter side Ax" be located? (Description of tumor location)

From a clinical trial article:

The table describes the locations in which breast cancer tumors recurred in patients. I think that Ax means "axillary" or "axilla", but I don't understand the whole phrase: "Counter side Ax". Where might this be? 
Might it mean, for instance, if the tumour was in the left breast, when "Counter side Ax" is merely the axilla on the right side of the body?
(Another question concerning the same excerpt)

A:

Contralateral (opposite site) is the opposite of ipsilateral (same side) in anatomical terminology.  In looking for references for this, I found "counter side" used in place of "contralateral" primarily in surgical literature, but it is not quite as common as contralateral, and ut isn't listed anywhere I could find with a clear definition. Nonetheless I think this is the most likely correct interpretation of it.
Ax would most likely be "axillary tail" (the portion of the breast that extends into the axilla) in this setting, or possibly "axilla" as the ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes are generally the first site of cancer spread.
