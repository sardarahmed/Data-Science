Q:

Please explain the algebraic reasoning in this textbook

I am reading Dennis M. Brown “Drug Delivery Systems in Cancer”.  On Page 29 when referring to monotonic increase or decrease of n (being the number of cells n(t) I believe) then how are they getting 
AUC50 = T(1-1/n)
I get how it equal k(1/n) because we just raise each side of equation IC50n * T = k to the 1/n power but not getting the the double equality here. 
The relationship between IC50 and AUC50 occurs when n = 1 in (IC50)n * T = k which reduces to AUC50 = k, meaning effect only depends on AUC.

A:

Let's take the general equation they mentioned, (IC50)nT = k, and rearrange it to IC50 = (k/T)1/n = k1/nT-1/n. (IC50)nT = k reducing to AUC50 = k if n=1 implies that AUC50 = IC50T if n=1. If this equation holds for other n, then AUC50 = k1/nT1-1/n. That looks a LOT like the text if the author accidentally inserted a =.
This next bit is more speculative because the exact descriptions of these terms in the source are not available online, but AUC generally stands for "area under curve," aka integration. I have doubts AUC50 is some definite integral of IC50 because when n=1, IC50 = k/T, which has an indefinite integral F(T) = k*ln(T) + constant.
