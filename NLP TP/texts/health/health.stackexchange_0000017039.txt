Q:

Is replacing one meal a day with nuts bad for health in long term?

I realised that replacing one meal a day (namely lunch) with a bag of mixed nuts (~200g) would be great for me for several reasons:

no cooking required
reasonably cheap
can eat while on-the-go
nuts keep you full for a long time
low in sugar, high in fiber and protein

I know that nuts are also high in fat, however it isn't saturated fat. Is this high amount of fat bad in the long term? Is there another reason why having 200 g nuts as a single food at one meal is a bad idea? 

A:

There are reasons why eating 200 g of nuts as the sole food at one meal could be questionable:

200 g of dry roasted mixed nuts contains 1188 Calories. This is about half of daily calories coming from a single food, which sounds like a lack of food diversity.
Nuts have very high omega-6/omega-3 ratio: 55:1, which might be pro-inflammatory. Regarding omega-6 PUFA, there is controversy whether their effects are pro- or anti-inflammatory. (PubMed, 2017)
The idea to spare some time by eating the food on the go sounds attractive, but it is also stressful; I believe one should sit down and eat in peace for optimal digestion.
Nuts are high in fats, so they stay a long time in the stomach, which can give a prolonged heavy feeling after eating.
