Q:

Does taking Vitmain B-Complex with zinc through tablets really help in reversing hair fall

I am thinking of taking Vitmain B-Complex tablets. I am concerned about my overall metabolism and my prime concern is my hairs. Does it also help in treating premature grey hairs?

A:

I found an expert answer for your question. May be this will help you to take right decision.
NDTV Doctors:

"There is no harm in taking a combination of B-complex vitamins with
  zinc but there is no evidence that such products have any utility in
  controlling loss of hair. Please do not rely on reports in the lay
  press because they are not always correct. Sometimes such reports are
  sponsored by manufacturers. There is some evidence that anti-oxidant
  preparations (such as Vitexid) may help in improving general well
  being of most body functions including skin of the scalp. I hope you
  are not suffering from dandruff which is a common cause of hair loss."
