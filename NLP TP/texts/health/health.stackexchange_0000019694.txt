Q:

What effect would a sperm containing XX have on a ovum and fetus?

So this is just a random thought I had, while writing a story, but
I assume this is likely impossible currently, and likely in the far future aswell, but let's assume a scenario where the body that the sperm came from, was XX, instead of XY. Let's just assume through science, there were no other issues related to a different chromosome. (Maybe the organ was printed)
From what I understand, the sperm determines whether the resulting fetus is XX or XY, based on whether it carries X or Y from its creation in the original body.
Would a sperm producing body that has no Y, only XX (So no XXY or XYY), then essentially be incapable of producing XY children, with a XX ovum producing body?
Would there be other potential issues for the mother or the fetus/child?
I imagine with organ printing not being a impossible feat(at this level, and not yet anyway), this could be a hypothetical scenario for a FtM transgender in the future aswell, but mostly I was just curious on the conception of it.
TLDR: A XX sperm (whether possible or not), and a XX ovum, would only be able to create a XX fetus, and never a XY, yes?

A:

Well, neglecting anything but the pure genetics' basics, yes, the XX mother will in any case transfer her X chromosome, just like the assumed "XX father", so the only possible genotype for the child is XX.
