Q:

Why does Melarsoprol have to be injected in glass syringes?

A WHO document, contains the statement

[Melarsoprol] injections must be performed using glass syringes.

Why is this the case?

A:

Since Melarsoprol is insoluble in water, dosage occurs via a 3.6% propylene glycol intravenous injection.

As propylene glycol can dissolve plastic, the drug should preferably be administered using a glass syringe (only if sterilisation is reliable), otherwise inject immediately (but slowly) using a plastic syringe (Source).

Melarsoprol is sometimes colloquially referred to as "arsenic in antifreeze".
