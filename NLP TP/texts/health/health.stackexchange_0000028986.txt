Q:

What are risks associated with injection made by a non-sterile needle?

On a regular vaccination, I've been handled by an unprofessional staff, who ( while preparing the injection needle) touched her hands 2 times to the injection needle (staff wore the gloves, but they were for sure non-sterile, due the fact that she was touching visitor's stuff with same gloves).

So, I have a generic medical question - what are the possible/worst risks associated when a person is shot with non-sterile (contaminated) injection needle, and what should be done by the victim after that fact?

A:

This isn't an exhaustive list, but a non-sterile puncture is

a risk of tetanus (infection with Clostridium tetani):

The spores can get into the body through broken skin, usually through injuries from contaminated objects. Tetanus bacteria are more likely to infect certain breaks in the skin.  These include:
Wounds contaminated with dirt, poop (feces), or spit (saliva)
Wounds caused by an object puncturing the skin (puncture wounds), like a nail or needle.
Tetanus bacteria can also infect the body through breaks in the skin caused by [...] Intramuscular injections (shots given in a muscle)

if the needle was actually used on someone else... a substantially wider spectrum of risks exist of various blood-borne illness. Most of those probably aren't much risk via fomites, i.e. merely touching the needle, but hepatitis is not something I'd totally [exclude]as the virus[es] causing these can transmit through other bodily fluids and in some experimental settings can persist a surprisingly long time even in dried state.
