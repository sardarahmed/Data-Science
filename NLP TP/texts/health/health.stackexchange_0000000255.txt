Q:

Does ice pack therapy have any healing effect for a tendinopathy?

When suffering from a tendinopathy, ice pack therapy reliefs pains. Does it have any healing effect as well?

A:

As I mentioned in this answer, icing is not meant to heal tendinopathy. It is supposed to be a painkiller. It can have some effects that may feel like they are fixing the problem though. The cold ice forces blood vessels to contract which can help reduce the inflammation. This might be considered healing, but the tendinopathy is still there, until the tendon heals itself.
