Q:

Will eating a high-calory diet (high carbs intake) for a long time (2-8 years) increase the risk of diabetes?

If someone is following a high slow-release carbohydrates diet for a long time (rice, oat, cereals, nuts, etc), will it increase the chance of developing diabetes in the future?
Are there studies supporting or denying this relation?

A:

Diet high in whole-grains ("slow-release carbohydrates") was associated with a decreased risk of diabetes 2, according to 2 systematic reviews of studies:
Source 1 (PubMed)

Whole grain intake is inversely associated with risk of type 2
  diabetes.

Source 2 (PubMed)

...consuming three servings of whole grain foods (45 g of whole grain
  ingredients) daily would induce a 20% relative reduction in the T2D
  risk as compared to consuming a half serving (7.5 g of whole grain
  ingredients).

In some studies, high intake of sugar was associated with diabetes type 2, but it is not clear if it is high sugar intake or high calorie intake that was actually associated with diabetes 2.
Source 3 (PubMed)

Higher consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is associated with a
  greater magnitude of weight gain and an increased risk for development
  of type 2 diabetes in women, possibly by providing excessive calories
  and large amounts of rapidly absorbable sugars.
