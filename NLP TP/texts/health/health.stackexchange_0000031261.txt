Q:

Looking for a comprehensive list of allergies

I need to put together a list of allergies for a software project I am working on.
Can someone direct me to a site or book that contains a navigational or indexed list of allergies?
What I need is Something like :

Drug allergies - Penicillin
Natural allergies - Fish, Pollen
Chemical Allergies - Latex
Etc...

I tried Google, but I could only find sites that mention "10 common allergy triggers", "top 15 allergies", etc..

A:

You may find SNOMED CT useful. As you can see from this screenshot from the UMLS Metathesaurus, SNOMED CT contains many allergies organized into a useful ontological hierarchy:

Here "allergy to peanut" is an "allergy to pulse vegetable", which in turn is an "allergy to food".
By starting at "allergy to substance" you can get many thousands of allergies.
Note that you need a license to use SNOMED CT and in South Africa, you'll need an affiliate license.
