Q:

Does the blood removed from the body still have immunity?

I know that blood contains white blood cells (which attack pathogens). Suppose we take half a liter of blood out of the body and implant the virus into it. Can the white blood cells in that half a liter of blood attack the virus and make antibodies?

A:

The usual approach is to use a whole animal such as horses

The results of our research indicate that healthy horses
  immunized with the SARS-CoV F69 strain can be induced to
  generate effective, specific and neutralizing antibodies

and to prevent anaphylaxis

Heterogenous antisera used for treatment possibly
  result in anaphylactoid severe acute side-effects[28]. To avoid
  the side-effects caused by horse antiserum, IgG against
  SARS-CoV was digested with pepsin and purified with anion-exchange separations to exclude the immunogenicity of
  Fc fragments and to retain the special activity of binding the
  antigen of F(ab')2 fraction. The titers of neutralizing F(ab')2
  against SARS-CoV was detected at higher level (1:5120). And
  approximately 15 g F(ab')2 fragments were obtained from 1 litre antiserum, with the purity above 90%.
