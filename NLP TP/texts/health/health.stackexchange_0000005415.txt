Q:

Why isn't clorhexidine gluconate used among humans?

It is used for non-human animals, but as far as I have read it is not used among people. Are there exceptions?

A:

It is used among humans it's called:

Hibiclens, Dyna-Hex, Ezy-tm, and Exidine

As also stated by the user JohnP in a comment. 
And it works for:

Cleaning the hands
Before surgery or injections
To cleanse skin or wounds
And as a oral rinse

So there is no exception it is used for humans. 

But you are right it is also used for animals.
