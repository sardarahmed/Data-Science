Q:

Does the pre-ejaculate of man contain sperm?

BeforePlay writes in 8 Pregnancy Prevention Myths: Busted:

there’s also pre-ejaculate to worry about, which does indeed contain sperm and can lead to pregnancy

KinseyConfidential writes in Q&A: Can You Get Pregnant From Pre-Cum? :

Sexuality and health educators often warn individuals that pre-ejaculate might have sperm in it and thus could cause a pregnancy.
Theoretically this is true, as there might be sperm that are still “left over” in the urethra from a previous ejaculation earlier that day or earlier in that same sexual session (either because of masturbation or sexual activity with a partner). Thus if sperm are “left over” in the urethra and then a man’s Cowper’s glands release pre-ejaculatory fluid, and it comes forth to the tip of the penis during arousal, then there is a chance that some sperm could be carried in this fluid and get into his partner’s body, if they are having intercourse without a condom.

Is the description that sperm doesn't contain naturally in pre-cum but can only be contained in it when there was recent ejakulation accurate or is it also contained naturally?

A:

Sperm does not naturally exist in pre-cum since sperm is released at the point of ejaculation.  However, both the articles you site are correct in that preexisting sperm already in the urethra could travel out with the pre-cum.
A quote from Teen Clinic on pre-ejaculate

Although pre-ejaculate does not contain sperm when it is produced, it can pick up leftover sperm in the urethra. This means that pre-ejaculate can contain sperm when it leaves the body, creating a risk for pregnancy. 

AmericanPregnancy.org also mentions this same thing.
One hygiene tip I've heard to help with this is for the man to urinate after sex to help clean out the urethra of both sperm and as a preventative measure against STDs.
Core Physicians also mentions that

You can help prevent UTIs if you: Urinate soon after sex.
