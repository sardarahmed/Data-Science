Q:

Building new muscle and effects on blood glucose absorption

Today I came up with the following hypothesis whilst pondering stuff after coming back from the gym.
If I build more muscle, my body will have more places to store glucose.

Is this hypothesis correct?
That is to say, could building more muscle help to reduce blood sugar levels overall.

A:

If you have more muscles, you will have more place to store glucose in them (in the form of glycogen), but what seems to be more important is the rate of glucose uptake by muscles, which increases with endurance training (running, swimming...) rather than with resistance training (body building).
The Role of Skeletal Muscle Glycogen Breakdown for Regulation of Insulin Sensitivity by Exercise

The glycogen content is higher in endurance trained subjects compared
  to untrained subjects and glycogen content increases in muscles after
  endurance training.

Also:

The reduction of skeletal muscle glycogen after exercise allows a
  healthy storage of carbohydrates after meals and prevents development
  of type 2 diabetes.

Exercise increases the glucose uptake by muscles by increasing insulin sensitivity:

Acutely, exercise improves insulin sensitivity in both healthy
  subjects and insulin resistant people. The improved insulin
  sensitivity after a single bout of exercise is short-lived but
  repeated bouts of endurance training improve insulin sensitivity
  beyond the acute effect of the last training session.
