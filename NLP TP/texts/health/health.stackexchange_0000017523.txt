Q:

Is there a link between fibromyalgia and sugar intake?

I've seen 2 women suffering from a fibromyalgic syndrome who tried to drastically suppress all sugar in their diet. The pain went from 7/10 to 3/10. 
After some reviews on forums I found other cases of success of such diets. I also found cases where it was not a success.
Is there any insights that could explain this ?

A:

The following is what I have found, which shows promise on your hypothesis.
Yanmaz, at al. (2012) found

an increased prevalence rate of [Fibromyalgia Syndrome] in patients with [diabetes mellitus] type 2 and [rheumatoid arthritis]. There was no correlation between the prevalence rate of [Fibromyalgia Syndrome] and good [diabetes mellitus] disease control.

A pilot study by Mengshoel, et al. (1995) followed a 10-week multi-disciplinary approach which involved exercise and cognitive approaches.
For the cognitive approach, they looked at patient knowledge of fibromyalgia and instructed on diet.

According to the food records, the dietician informed about good food habits and suggested dietary improvements such as: intake of four regular meals a day, increased intake of fruits and vegetables, increased intake of fluid and reduced intake of sweets and sugar.

All patients (n=16)

showed improvements for all variables after ten weeks.

They also said that controlled studies are needed in the future.
