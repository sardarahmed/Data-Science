Q:

Is it true that alcohol is the only "drug" one can die from during a drug-withdrawal? What are the symptoms of the withdrawal?

Is it true that alcohol is the only "drug" one can die from during a drug-withdrawal? Someone recently told me they heard this from rehab, but it doesn't resonate as true... but then again, I'm not expert in health matters. 
What are the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal?

A:

In addition to alcohol, benzodiazepines and the opiates (rare), another class of drugs that can cause lethal withdrawal symptoms is the barbiturates. In fact, they present the most dangerous withdrawal of all. Their use has largely been replaced with the benzodiazepines, so abuse is much less common today than it was in the 1960s and 1970s.

Withdrawing from Barbiturates
Within 2 to 3 months of consistent barbiturate use, a person can
  develop a tolerance and addiction. Once this has happened, it is
  important to understand that a doctor or rehab for barbiturates should
  be [employed] to come off of the medication. As a “GABAergic” drug;
  barbiturate withdrawal can produce life threatening effects, like
  seizures, which are similar to those of delirium tremens and
  benzodiazepine withdrawals. However, the barbiturate withdrawal can be
  even more severe than the aforementioned making it one of the most
  dangerous withdrawals out of every known drug. Like benzodiazepines,
  the longer acting the barbiturate drug is, the less severe the
  withdrawal will be.
