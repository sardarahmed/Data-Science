Q:

What is the coldest temperature a person could live in continuously?

When I tried googling this question, I found the answers for "What is the lowest survivable body temperature" and "humans can survive for a few minutes in -200 degree weather". Neither of which are my question.
I've read that the internal temperature of igloos can be in the wide range between 19 F and 61 F (-7 C and 16 C). 61 degrees I could see being reasonable, but 19 degrees seems nearing too cold for survival. I'm wondering where that cutoff point is. What is the lowest temperature that living in it continuously (say, a week or more) poses a serious health risk?

A:

There are just too many factors to give an easy clean answer to this question. To limit the problem, lets assume the individual is wearing 1 CLO of clothing in still dry air. Further, lets assume that this person has a surface area of 2 m (a little bigger than the typical male, but it makes the math easier). Finally, lets assume they can indefinitely produce 300 Watts of heat (this is about 6000 calories a day). This means their heat output is 150 W/m^2. Then solving
T = (31 − 0.155·P·R)°C

with R=1 and P=150 gives a temperature of 8°C.
