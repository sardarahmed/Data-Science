Dental Braces : Urgent Advise Needed

I got braces in January 2017. It is today 12 March 2017 that I got one of the braces detached from tooth (Lower tooth and Second Left tooth with respect to my reference frame). 
I talked to my Dentist and He is our of Town and will be available after 3 days. Dentist said - " Leave it as it is. It will cause no harm."
But I suspect, since food and water (Water is hard at my area)  can get between tooth and the bracket, And 3 days are enough for cavity to dominate. Is my tension worth? If yes, Please suggest some methods to avoid cavity
*I brush twice a day and I use Hexidine mouthwash. *
I planned to pull that bracket a little and clean the area between it and the tooth. It is right?

A:

If the bracket is removed all the way and is not cemented you can remove it carefully. You should be fine but I have had this happen before. Just open the tiny latch on the bracket and place bracket in a safe place. If you cannot remove it mouthwash and a little floss or a Christmas tree brush will help clean behind it.
