Does Möller’s omega-3 fish oil help to improve brain possibility and reduce hight hert rate? 
Is this product from Moller only abuse of well developed brands?

A:

The omega-3 supplement provider claims that omega-3 fatty acid supplements are important for proper functioning of the heart and brain, among other.
This review Reduction of heart rate by omega-3 fatty acids and the potential underlying mechanisms (PubMed, 2012) concludes:

Recent human and animal studies have shown that omega-3 fatty acids
  can reduce heart rate.

In one small 2006 study in men with myocardial infarct, omega-3 fatty acids decreased heart rate at rest from 73 +/- 13 to 68 +/- 13 beats/min. 
But this alone are just some dry statistical facts. For anyone with a high heart rate of an unknown origin, I strongly suggest to get a diagnosis from a heart specialist before starting any treatment, including omega-3 supplements. The treatment choice largely depends on the cause.
