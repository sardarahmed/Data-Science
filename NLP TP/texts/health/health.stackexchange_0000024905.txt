Q:

What should you put on your face if you want to protect both yourself and others?

Surgical masks protect other people but provide almost no protection for the wearer (see https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/sep/14/facebook-posts/face-masks-wildfire-smoke-protection-and-covid-19-/).
Respirators (with valves) protect the wearer but don't protect those around you.
What should you put on your face if you want to protect both yourself and others?

A:

A mask. According to the FDA

If worn properly, a surgical mask is meant to help block large-particle droplets, splashes, sprays, or splatter that may contain germs (viruses and bacteria), keeping it from reaching your mouth and nose. Surgical masks may also help reduce exposure of your saliva and respiratory secretions to others.

Other types on masks may afford further protection, but the surgical mask is generally accepted as an acceptable minimum. If a person is in a highly contaminated field an N95 mask or self-contained breathing apparatus. Likewise, if the wearer is significantly vulnerable a greater degree of protection is advisable.
