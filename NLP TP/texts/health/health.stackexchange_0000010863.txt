Q:

Is one more susceptible to chronic pancreatitis if one's pancreas hemorrhaged during a single inexplicable acute pancreatitis event?

Is one more susceptible to chronic pancreatitis if one's pancreas hemorrhaged during a single inexplicable acute pancreatitis event?
About 9 years ago, I suffered from acute pancreatitis, and somehow my pancreas hemorrhaged, and I lost a lot of blood due to internal bleeding and required several blood transfusions... As I mentioned in other posts, the doctors were unable to find the source for the sudden acute pancreatitis nor what caused it to hemorrhaged (so they removed my gallbladder as a precautionary measure).  
Anyway -- I was wondering if a single acute pancreatitis attack in the past that severely damaged your pancreas -- might develop into Chronic pancreatitis overtime? Is there a correlation to a one time incident to a chronic condition, which develops years later? 
What are the symptoms of Chronic Pancreatitis? 
(And... I've never actually even taken a sip of alcohol in my life).

A:

Yes, it is possible that one gradually develops chronic pancreatitis after a single attack of acute pancreatitis.
Pancreatitis (NIDDK)

The chronic form of pancreatitis can be triggered by one acute attack
  that damages the pancreatic duct. The damaged duct causes the pancreas
  to become inflamed. Scar tissue develops and the pancreas is slowly
  destroyed.

A doctor can make a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis from certain blood tests and other investigations. If chronic pancreatitis is established, further investigations to find the exact cause are warranted. 
Causes of hemorrhagic pancreatitis:

Pseudocyst
Pseudoaneurysm
Gallstones
Infection
Anatomical abnormality of the pancreas
