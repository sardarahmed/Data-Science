Q:

Does constant exposure to Dengue over a population, increases or decreases the mortality of the epidemic?

I'm trying to understand the significantly higher mortality rate of Dengue in Argentina in relation to Brazil. According to this, Argentina in 2024 had 47 deaths out of 57461 cases (1 death each 1222 cases)
Dengue Argentina 2024- Spanish
and Brazil had 41 deaths out of 1658816 (1 death each 40459 cases) .
Dengue Brazil cases 2023 (Spanish)
Dengue Brazil deaths 2023  - (Spanish)
Brazil has had much larger Dengue epidemics for more years, can this has anything to do with it? I understand there are differences in the way statistics are created and gathered in different places, for example, in some places cases are counted by epidemiological link and not by laboratory confirmation, also there might be differences in the way "dengue related deaths" are counted.
But anyway, I wanted to know if there is evidence of exposure to Dengue increasing or decreasing the mortality in a population. It is known exposure to other variant of Dengue significantly increases the chances of severe Dengue, though you get immunity to the same variant
Dengue in Peru - This is what happens when you get infected a second time (Spanish)

A:

Simply put, it is widely thought that there is an increased risk of death or serious harm with subsequent Dengue infections. The WHO has this to say on their website on Dengue:

Individuals who are infected for the second time are at greater risk of severe dengue.

However, there is some debate about the relative frequencies of severe dengue in primary and secondary infection, with some studies finding that there is no such association, at least in the population(s) they studied.1, while other analyses found the widely "known" effect of secondary being more likely to cause severe effects. There seems to be some correlation between the serotype of the virus (there are 5 serotypes2) and severity of secondary infection3.
