Q:

First aid for a rabies dog bite

When a person is bitten by a dog infected with rabies what are the first aid measures that must be taken? And within how much time should the person consult a doctor? 

A:

Wound cleansing is especially important when bitten, as it has been shown to remarlably reduce the risk of infections from animal bites in general, and in some animal studies, the likelihood of rabies infection.
This treatment should be immediate: irrigate with water or diluted water povidone-iodine solution.
You should consult a doctor as soon as possible. Animal bites are, by themselves, potentially very serious puncture wounds, and have the potential for a number of other infections beyond simply rabies.
Post-exposure vaccination - For people who have never been vaccinated against rabies previously, post-exposure anti-rabies vaccination should always include administration of both passive antibody and vaccine.
In the United States, post-exposure prophylaxis consists of a regimen of one dose of immune globulin and four doses of rabies vaccine over a 14-day period. Rabies immune globulin and the first dose of rabies vaccine should be given by your health care provider as soon as possible after exposure. Additional doses or rabies vaccine should be given on days 3, 7, and 14 after the first vaccination.
