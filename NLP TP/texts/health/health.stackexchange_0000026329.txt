Q:

Do people who were vaccinated against chicken pox need to be vaccinated against shingles?

Will people who never had chicken pox due to being vaccinated against it still need the shingles vaccine?

A:

Varicella virus vaccine strain Oka (V-Oka) has in rare cases caused zoster in vaccinated people.
But this study on children show that even after vaccination the wild virus still ends up settling in your body: "VZV was found in at least some ganglia of all of the other subjects."
What is interesting about the singles vaccine is prior to October 2017 there was only one FDA approved vaccine which was just discontinued silently in November 2020 which leaves us with one vaccine again.
