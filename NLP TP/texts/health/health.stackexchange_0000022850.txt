But this answer by Thomas is the proof that there is evidence and scientific research:
Yes, they can, see e. g. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30905159 (field of cheminformatics) re the possiblity of drug discovery in general via machine learning

A:

Yes, they can, see e. g. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30905159 (field of cheminformatics) re the possiblity of drug discovery in general via machine learning. Generally, a vaccine is a specific applicative field of drug discovery that might benefit from machine learning as well, e. g. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4395155/.
