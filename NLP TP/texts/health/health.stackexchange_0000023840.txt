Q:

What are the criteria to decide revascularization vs apexification in a young permanent tooth with necrosed pulp?

If a paediatric patient comes to the clinic with necrosed pulp either due to trauma or caries in one of his/her young permanent tooth then should apexification be done or revascularization? What are the criteria to decide among these two procedures? Since both these procedures have similar indications and contraindications.

I got the answer from my professor, though it's nowhere given on the net.
Apexification is done in cases where there is 2-2/3rd root canal length is remaining and the root canal apex is convergent.

The objective of this procedure is to induce root end closure (apexification) at the apices of immature roots through the formation of mineralized tissue.

Reference
Regeneration procedure is done in cases where the root canal apex is blunderbuss or parallel and the canal length is less than half and hence less dentinal wall left.

Immature teeth with a large open apex and short roots seem to be more conducive to the successful treatment of pulp revascularization.

Reference
In the left tooth the root canal apex is convergent with open apex whereas in the right tooth the open canal apex is divergent or blunderbuss.
