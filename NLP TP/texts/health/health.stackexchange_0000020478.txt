Q:

What kind of cell kill probabilities per division you get with chemotherapy?

As I understand it, many chemotherapeutic drugs target cell division, with the theory that a constant kill probability per cell division kills fast-replicating cancer cells faster than slow-replicating healthy cells.
What kind of kill probabilities per cell division event are useful in chemotherapy? Could a human typically tolerate, for example, 5% of cell divisions leading to apoptosis?

A:

The average human is rumoured to have around 30,000,000,000,000 cells in their body.
Apoptosis kills around 60,000,000,000 cells a day.
This is 0.002%, so I imagine a 5% kill rate would be at least fairly painful.
