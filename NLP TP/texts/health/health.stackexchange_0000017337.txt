Q:

Possibilities after stage IV melanoma diagnosis

My aunt is 62 and was diagnosed last november with stage IV metastatic melanoma. She had an operation to get a tumor removed and is undergoing an  immunotherapy treatment that I believe is experimental. So far it's caused some severe complications (typhlitis) and doesn't seem like it is going to work. 
My question is not so much medical but about doctors and medical departments. I'm not sure how to proceed, and un particular if it makes sense to search for opinions in other places besides the oncology department in the hospital in my city (Valencia) in Spain where she is being treated. Basically I don't know how and if doctors share and have access to ongoing clinical studies and new treatments. I don't know if looking for others opinions migh mean stumbling some promising possibility that doctors treating her right now might not be aware of. 

A:

If you're searching for treatments that are not currently main stream, you need to look on https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=melanoma+and+spain&Search=Search to see if there's a trial in your city or any other local to you.
However, most oncologists will be aware of these trials.  If you're prepared to travel, and can afford treatment in the USA or other countries, then you can look worldwide for experimental treatments.
