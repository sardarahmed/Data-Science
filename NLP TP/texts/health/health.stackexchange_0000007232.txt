Q:

Notation for toilet visits

As I have sometimes diarrhea I want to start a habit of documentating my toilet visits every morning. I however don't know how to categories it.
Are their notation systems or categorisation scheme used by medical professional that are recommended for patients gathering information like this?

A:

The bristol chart is commonly used for describing the texture and consistency of stools. See chart and details below.

Quoting the wikipedia article linked above

The seven types of stool are:

Separate hard lumps, like nuts (hard to pass)
Sausage-shaped, but lumpy
Like a sausage but with cracks on its surface
Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft
Soft blobs with clear cut edges (passed easily)
Fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool
Watery, no solid pieces, entirely liquid

Types 1 and 2 indicate constipation, with 3 and 4 being the ideal stools
  (especially the latter), as they are easy to defecate while not
  containing excess liquid, and 5, 6 and 7 tending towards diarrhoea.
