Q:

Do mRNA Vaccines tend to work only for a short period of time?

The two significant mRNA vaccines are for COVID and there effect is only about 6 months. Is there a cause and effect relationship here? That is, do mRNA vaccines tend to only last a short period of time?
Here is a site that says natural immunity should last for at last 7 months:Natural Immunity
Here is a site that says the vaccine should last for at least 6 months:How long the vaccine lasts
I would hope that the vaccine would last longer. Perhaps, that is not a reasonable expectation on my part.

A:

Short answer - no, the mRNA vaccines specifically don't only work for a short period of time. Natural infection and all vaccines of different types against SARS-CoV-2 all produce similar durations of immunity.
Longer answer:
Generally speaking we can expect the immunity from a vaccine to last approximately long as the immunity following a natural infection, though there are some exceptions to this, where vaccination (not via mRNA) results in shorter protection than natural infection for pertussis1 . In the case of infection with SARS-CoV-2, the natural immunity induced by the infection results in protective levels of antibodies for about 6 months to a year and similar time-frames for vaccines of any sort against SARS-CoV-2.
I found a relatively recent paper in PNAS2 (highly respected journal), that states (emphasis mine):

Peak antibody levels elicited by messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines mRNA-1273 and BNT1262b2 exceeded that of natural infection and are expected to typically yield more durable protection against breakthrough infections (median 29.6 mo; 5 to 95% quantiles 10.9 mo to 7.9 y) than natural infection (median 21.5 mo; 5 to 95% quantiles 3.5 mo to 7.1 y). Relative to mRNA-1273 and BNT1262b2, viral vector vaccines ChAdOx1 and Ad26.COV2.S exhibit similar peak anti-S IgG antibody responses to that from natural infection and are projected to yield lower, shorter-term protection against breakthrough infection (median 22.4 mo and 5 to 95% quantiles 4.3 mo to 7.2 y; and median 20.5 mo and 5 to 95% quantiles 2.6 mo to 7.0 y; respectively).

From this you can see that the durations of protection are similar in length between the various vaccine types and similar to natural infection.
The Conversation has a nice layman's explanation of how this all works and why infection and vaccinations don't typically produce different durations of immunity,
