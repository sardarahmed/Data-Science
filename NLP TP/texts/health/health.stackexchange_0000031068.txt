Q:

How soon can alcohol withdrawal symptoms (delirium tremens) start after cessation of alcohol intake?

From what I have read on Wikipedia, alcohol withdraw symptoms shouldn't kick in for a few days.

When it occurs, it is often three days into the withdrawal symptoms and lasts for two to three days."  [Emphasis is mine]

However, I have observed an individual who drinks heavily who begins shaking so badly that they cannot hold a glass of water without using both hands. This occurs as soon as they wake up or only a few hours later.
Is the onset of symptoms within the typically expected range?

A:

It turns out that I just needed to dig in deeper. Per https://escholarship.org/uc/item/08b9z9th, "Because of the short action of ethanol (beverage alcohol), withdrawal symptoms usually begin within 8 hours after blood alcohol levels decrease, peak at about 72 hours, and are markedly re-duced by day 5 through 7 of abstinence."
So, the start of DT's can be as soon as 8 hours, which coincides with my friend going to sleep and waking up after 6 or more hours.
But looks like they are in for a rough ride if the symptoms will increase and culminate after 3 full days.
