Q:

R0 as measure of transmissibility depends on external factors. Is there a more objective measure?

For example: during the current covid 19 outbreak the reported numbers are number of infections after various measures like social distancing or quarantine have been used - so it doesn't make much sense to compare it to the r0 if a disease like flu, where similar measures aren't used.
Is there an objective measurement?
Something like what are the chances of getting infected in some controlled conditions

A:

R0 is the basic reproduction number describing how many cases are expected to be infected by a single case. This value is not a biological constant.

With an R0 (reproduction number) estimated at 2.5 (based on China), many experts predict that between 20 and 60% of the world population could get infected (which means at least 0.5M deaths).
However, the R0 varies during the course of an epidemic as a result of a series of determinants and interventions

such as containment and mitigation factors, and eventually herd immunity and vaccination.
