Q:

What medical tests a man should take regularly to check for common health issues?

What medical tests should a man living in a relatively developed area take regularly to check for most common diseases? I'm interested in monthly and yearly basis.

A:

Tests that one may want to do annually: 

Blood pressure; increased BP is a risk factor for heart disease
Checking your skin for moles, which can develop into cancer
Blood cholesterol and triglycerides (lipid profile); increased levels are risk factors for coronary heart disease
Blood glucose to check for diabetes mellitus
Dental check for caries
Eye examination
PSA test for prostate cancer
Fecal blood test, colonoscopy and other tests for colorectal cancer ( for those with a family history of colorectal cancer)
Computed tomography or other tests for lung cancer (for smokers)

I'm not aware of any recommendation for monthly tests for healthy men.
