Q:

Are Depressions in the Skull Normal or At Least Okay

I went skiing recently and hit the back of my head pretty hard. I had a headache for a few days, but it went away and hasn't really come back. I recently got x-rayed for braces and noticed a depression about where I hit my head (in the back towards the bottom). 

Is this normal, or at least not an issue? I feel like I might be paranoid, but I guess you can never be too safe

A:

I am a layman, no expert on human skulls.  I do think I can likely help you feel a little less concern perhaps.  The type of xray used by orthodonists typically is called a cephalometric xray or ceph.  The image I see of you seems pretty typical & many seem to show some amount of a thicker area along the occipital bun on the back of the head.  Here is some info on the type of xray & if you link, you will see an image that very much shows a similar bone formation and a little info on the type of xray used.  You can certainly ask your orthodonist about it.  They can tell you what is typical that they see & I am pretty certain had they seen anything unusual, they would speak up immediately.  I had a chiropractor take an xray that showed a sinus tumor.  They didn't tell me that.  They told me I needed to have my dentist do some xray as something looked off in my oral cavity & they have a better resolution to take a look.  It was from a tooth growing in the wrong place & totally treatable.   https://www.verywell.com/definition-of-cephalometric-ceph-x-ray-1059162
