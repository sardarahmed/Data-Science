Q:

What is the coral-like structure in my nasal cavity?

Through rigorous training and deep meditation (AKA prolonged bouts of boredom) I have acquired the ability to maneuver my tongue into my nasal cavity. I can feel the back of my nostrils, and above them, a weird slatted mass. After seeing some rough anatomy sketches on the internet I think is something to do with smell.
What is that coral shaped region? Can I damage it by poking it with my tongue?
By "coral" I mean this stuff: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_coral

A:

The structure you are searching for is called nasal conchae.
They are bone lamellae coated with  mucosal tissue and their main purpuse is the augmentation of the surface of the nasal cavity, with the task To clean, warm and moisturize the inhaled air.
It's unlikely that you will be able to damage it  with your toungue.
