Q:

Alprazolam (xanax) longterm effects?

Is Alprazolam harmful longterm. I've been taking this med 3x-0.25mg for a week. Quite frankly, many of my colleagues/students/friends consume it as well.
I'm a little bit afraid since I've seen some scary videos on youtube of people taking it regularly who have gotten serious "longterm" side effects.
I'm also curious how come for the past 30 years since alprazolam has been released there hasn't appeared any better and safer drug which treats anxiety well?

A:

Short-term memory loss and an increasing tolerance to and dependence on the medication. To answer your second question, there are many avenues for treating anxiety, first you should try lifestyle changes like improving diet, exercise, reducing stress, and psychotherapy. There are other safer drugs that can help with anxiety and those include but are not limited to Zoloft, Prozac, Trazodone, BusPar, or Wellbutrin. The poster above me mentioned Valium but that is in the same chemical class as alprazolam and has similar adverse effects. I highly recommend that you consult with your doctor.
