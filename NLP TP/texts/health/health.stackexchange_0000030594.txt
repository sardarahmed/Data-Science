Q:

Are there diseases which are contagious but can also arise simultaneously in an individual?

Diseases like most cancers are known to be not contagious; they arise `from within'. On the other hand, diseases like the flu are known to be contagious. Are there also diseases which fit in both categories?

A:

Yes, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease is an example.
In Creutzfeldt–Jakob, a spontaneous misfolding of a protein in the brain gives rise to a prion. A prion is a misfolded protein that is able to 'transmit' its pathological shape onto the normal variant of the same protein. The disease progresses as more and more proteins become misfolded. This is known as sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease [1].
When a healthy person comes in contact with the tissue containing the prions, they can get Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease too. (For example, a pathologist performing an autopsy.) This is known as acquired Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease [2].
