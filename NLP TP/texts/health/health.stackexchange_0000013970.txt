Q:

Is it possible to deliberately get cancer?

Is it possible to deliberately get cancer? Maybe injecting a malignant tumor? I'm asking this just out of curiosity.

A:

Yes
A decent share of radiation will do the trick for you, as both Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but also physicists experimenting with the newly found radiation have shown.
There even is a unit (sievert) which measures how cancerous a dose of radiation is. One sievert is equivalent to a 5,5% chance of cancer.
Relevant XKCD for how what radiation has how much sievert:

Furthermore, cancer can be transplanted. This is an issue that has been subject to quite a few conferences.
