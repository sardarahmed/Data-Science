Q:

Why does adenosine processing require unconsciousness?

I've heard that one of the purposes of sleep is to process adenosine that builds up from metabolic processes, and it makes sense that the effect of adenosine as a neurotransmitter is to produce drowsiness so that you are put in an unconscious state where adenosine can get processed. But why does adenosine require you to be unconscious to be processed in the first place?

A:

ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is used by the cells as a source of energy. When you are awake, the brain cells use a lot of energy, and ATP is quickly consumed, and it becomes AMP (adenosine monophosphate).
One decay product of AMP is adenosine. So, the more your "fuel" is running out, the more adenosine has accumulated. So high adenosine is a signal for the body to sleep.
When you sleep, the activity in the body, and in particular the brain, is much lower, and is redirected from active functions (thinking, moving, eating, etc.) to passive function, and in particular regenerative functions. This is an opportunity for the body to concentrate on stockpiling ATP, and clean up adenosine.
