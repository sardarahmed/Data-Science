Q:

Does COVID-19 cause myocardial infarctions?

I heard that NYC hospitals are seeing an increased cases of myocardial infarction with higher mortality than normal during this COVID-19 pandemic. What the connection is between COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease?

A:

Cardiovascular disease is known to worsen during infections such as influenza through two proposed mechanisms:

cytokines from the resulting inflammation cause weaken atherosclerotic plaques and cause plaque rupture/thrombosis
stress from illness can precipitate decompensated heart failure in predisposed patients

Two studies from Wuhan have looked into this so far. One cohort study of 416 patients found that 19.7% of COVID-19 patients developed myocardial infarction during their hospitalization and had higher rates of mortality (51.2% MI vs 4.5% no MI)[2]. Another cohort study of 187 patients found that 27.8% of their patients developed MI with a similar mortality rate (59.6% MI vs 8.9% no MI). Patients from both studies who developed MIs seem to be older and have preexisting hypertension, diabetes and coronary artery disease.
From these studies, the current data support the idea that getting COVID-19 increases the risk of having an MI, especially in those with risk factors.
Update: The CDC states that patients with COVID-19 can also develop a hypercoagulable state, leading to thrombotic complications such as an MI. Unfortunately, the pathogenesis of COVID-19-related hypercoagulability is unknown.

A:

A case series in Seattle published in JAMA on March 17, 2020 describes a potential cardiomyopathy associated with coronavirus in critically-ill patients.  Current thinking includes a potential direct cardiac effect of the COVID-19 viral infection, rather than atherosclerotic or ischemic disease per se.
The authors noted:

It is unclear whether the high rate of cardiomyopathy in this case
  series reflects a direct cardiac complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection
  or resulted from overwhelming critical illness. Others have described
  cardiomyopathy in COVID-19, and further research may better
  characterize this risk

They go on to cite two other reports on potential COVID-19 related cardiomyopathy and cardiac impacts.
