Q:

What is the rationale behind spraying disinfectent on the street, or inside buildings against Corvid-19

Pictures of people clad in white protective gear, looking like SciFy and sparying streets, offices, factories and people have emerged in the media.
What are they spraying and is there any evidence it will help stop or slow the spread of the disease?
Making such large quantities of disinfectant must be costly, still the practice seems wide-spread especially in Asia. So there must be some assumed benefit, but is there any real evidence it helps?

A:

I don't know but they're likely spraying bleach to kill virus on surfaces.  Studies show the virus can persist for days on stainless steel etc, but we don't have good data how much of any of this can cause further infection.
It does help to impress on the public the need to keep washing which is the most effective way to be safe apart from complete isolation.
