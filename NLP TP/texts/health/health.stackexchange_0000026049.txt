Moderna and Pfizer also registered some case of thrombosis.

How about the others? (Sputnik V, Sinopharm, Sinovac, etc.)
Which covid-19 vaccines have suspected cases of thrombosis?

A:

As of April 16, 2021, information about blood clots in people vaccinated with the Sputnik V and the CanSino COVID-19 vaccines come from news articles and press releases.
Here is a link to an April 14, 2021 article in MedExpress that discusses the Sputnik V vaccine.

A statement from the state-run Gamaleya Research Institute, which developed Sputnik V vaccine, is quoted as follows:
“A comprehensive analysis of adverse events during clinical trials and over the course of mass vaccinations with the Sputnik V vaccine showed that there were no cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis."
An April 14, 2021 article in the South China Morning Post discusses blood clots for the CanSino vaccine.

The articles quotes CanSino Biologics, manufacturer of the vaccine, as follows:
“In a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange, the company said no serious adverse events related to blood clots had been reported among the almost 1 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine that had been administered to date."
Based on past experience with surveillance of potential adverse effects of new drugs and vaccines, one must anticipate that information about blood clots for all of the COVID-19 vaccines will evolve (and change).
