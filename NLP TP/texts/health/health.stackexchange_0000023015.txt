Q:

Why are dermatologists working on coronavirus cases?

I saw a report that dermatologists are working on coronavirus cases.
Does this mean that all kinds of medical doctors are licensed to care for COVID-19 patients?
So a neurologist can help, cardiologist can help, a urologist / penile enhancement surgeon can help, and also gynecologists?
What about dentists?
Anyone practicing medicine of any form can go to New York City to help right now? 
To be clear, I mean treating COVID-19 patients at the hospitals, in the ER, ICU, etc.
Note. An emergency text message was sent to us, urging any and all available doctors to report to New York City, because of the urgent need for doctors. So, it sounds like even a dermatologist might be working in the ICU at this point. Hence my question.

All of the specialities you list in your question are health care professionals and have completed basic training in hospitals.  The NY govt will triage those to see which qualifications are best suited to what positions are available.
