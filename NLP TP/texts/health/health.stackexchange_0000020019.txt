Q:

Is autism an autoimmune disease?

I have not a license on Science Direct and I can't read more than the abstract of this article:
Is autism an autoimmune disease?
I would like to know from experts (and read the articles you quote if possible) in what point is the science community in this topic presently. 
Is autism an autoimmune disease? 
Or conversely, there is still no consensus since 2004 when the article I quote was written?:

While immune system abnormalities have been reported in children with
  autistic disorder, there is little consensus regarding the nature of
  these differences which include both enhanced autoimmunity and reduced
  immune function

A:

I answered a similar question (Is autism caused by genetics?) on Psychology & Neuroscience where the following was found, plus I have added information regarding autoimmune responses concerning Autism.
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) now affects one in 68 births in the United States and is the fastest growing neurodevelopmental disability worldwide (Edmiston, et al. 2017) [free access paper with links to cited papers]. Alarmingly, for the majority of cases, the causes of ASD are largely unknown, but it is becoming increasingly accepted that ASD is no longer defined simply as a behavioral disorder, but rather as a highly complex and heterogeneous biological disorder (Edmiston, et al. 2017).
With the information available, the genetic and environmental causes of Autism is open to speculation and interpretation.
The paper you cited is referenced in Edmiston, et al. (2017) under citation number 28, and they stated (emphasis mine):

there are likely multiple, biologically defined subgroups within the ASD spectrum(3–7). Specifically, there is growing evidence that supports maternal immune dysfunction may underlie the behavioral abnormalities observed in a subset of children affected with the disorder(8). Several immunologic risk factors have been described including: genetic associations with immune-related genes(9–16), family history of autoimmune disease(15, 17–21), maternal inflammation and infection during pregnancy(22–27), and altered immune responses in the children, and are associated with increased impairments in core and associated features of ASD(28). More specific to this review, maternal anti-brain autoantibodies, which are thought to access the fetal compartment during gestation, have been identified as one risk factor for developing ASD and are proposed to contribute to early neurodevelopmental perturbations in the developing fetus(29–31).

In conclusion, they pointed out that Maternal autoantibody related (MAR) ASD:

has been noted by numerous researchers describing the presence of maternal autoantibodies reactive to fetal brain proteins in a subset of mothers of children with ASD. Further, there is now an abundance of evidence supporting their deleterious role in neurodevelopment. For the most part, these studies have described similar experimental outcomes and, given the clinical and biological heterogeneity of ASD, there likely exists a complex relationship between the presence of maternal anti-fetal brain antibodies and developmental trajectory of exposed offspring. It is still unclear how and when these maternal autoantibodies arise, but studies currently underway may provide increased insight into their ontogeny.

Genes causing ASD
The NHS webpage on Autism states (Emphasis mine)

Most researchers believe that certain genes a child inherits from their parents could make them more vulnerable to developing ASD.
Cases of ASD have been known to run in families. For example, younger siblings of children with ASD can also develop the condition, and it's common for identical twins to both develop ASD.
No specific genes linked to ASD have been identified, but it may be a presenting feature of some rare genetic syndromes, including Fragile X syndrome, Williams syndrome and Angelman syndrome.

Environmental causes
The NHS say that

Some researchers believe that a person born with a genetic vulnerability to ASD only develops the condition if they're exposed to a specific environmental trigger.
Possible triggers include being born prematurely (before 35 weeks of pregnancy), or being exposed in the womb to alcohol or to certain medication, such as sodium valproate (sometimes used to treat epilepsy during pregnancy).
No conclusive evidence has been found linking pollution or maternal infections in pregnancy with an increased risk of ASD.

Research Autism has some referenced information on leading research into the causes of Autism from the Medical Research Council, National Autistic Society and the Autism Society of America; and the crux of the matter from what is said here is that the causes are still being investigated and

There is no known single cause for autism, but it is generally accepted that it is caused by abnormalities in brain structure or function
