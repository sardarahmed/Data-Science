Q:

What is the health danger of frying past a smoking point?

What are the health risks of cooking/frying with healthy oils past their smoke point?
I've heard that the oil is decomposed and toxin are formed. How does that affect our health when we eat fried foods?

A:

The worst components of fats and oils from health point of view are "trans fats". These are unsaturated fatty acids with one or more trans configuration double bonds. MUFA (monounsaturated fatty acids) and PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acids), on the other hand, are good types of fat and oil components.Mayo Clinic
Repeated reusing and heating oils to high temperature lead to formation of trans fats hence this should be avoided. See: Does Overheating Olive Oil Turn it to Trans Fat?
Trans fats increase the risk of atherosclerosis (plaque formation in the walls of arteries) that limit flow of blood in vital organs like heart and brain (see: Trans Fatty Acids and Cardiovascular Disease). Trans fats are thought to be even worse than saturated fats for their propensity to cause atherosclerosis.
This leads to life-threatening conditions like myocardial infarction (heart attack), brain stroke and limb gangrene. Harmful health effects may also extend to other organs and diseases, e.g. Diabetes and Alzheimer.
 See: Dietary fats and the risk of incident Alzheimer disease. 
Studies show that it is possible to completely eliminate trans fats from foods. As a result there are limitation in many parts of world on use of trans fats (see Trans fat ban in NYC and this). 
FDA has made 2018 the year by which trans fat should be completely eliminated from food supply.NY Times
