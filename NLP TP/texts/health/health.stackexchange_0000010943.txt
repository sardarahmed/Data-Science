Q:

What should be done if a person is stabbed?

I have seen in almost all video-games and movies that when someone is stabbed by a sharp knife, the victim "takes out" the knife from his body. Does it help the victim in anyway? What should be the possible "first-aid" steps that can be taken to prevent death of the person? Can the knife stay in there till the medical help arrives? Or is there nothing constructive that can be done ?

A:

If the weapon is still in the wound : don't touch anything and call the appropriate emergency system (varies from country to country).

Never attempt to remove any penetrating object still in situ as this may cause more serious bleeding

If the wound is open, apply little pressure on it with clean clothes. And call the appropriate emergency system, keep applying pressure until ambulance/doctor arrives. 
Yes, you can save a life by decreasing the out bleeding, or at least make recovery from the wound possible.
