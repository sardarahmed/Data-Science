Q:

Is it possible for someone to develop Aspiration Pneumonia from standing in very heavy rain?

For example, could the spray (liquid moisture) suspended in the air cause irritation and inflammation of the lungs similar to what is observed in secondary drowning, where inhaled water irritates the airways and causes a condition that is identical to pneumonia?

For instance, in secondary drowning, there is no infection, but the irritation of the water inside the lungs causes symptoms identical to pneumonia and sets of an inflammatory response in the lungs.

A:

Inhaling sprayed water while staying in heavy rain does not likely cause aspiration pneumonia, at least not by water itself. I have found no relevant results after searching for combination of: rain, rainstorm, mist, fog, humidity and aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis.
Saying that, increased rainfall and humidity are associated with increased risk of legionellosis - atypical pneumonia caused by the bacterium Legionella (The Journal of Infectious Diseases, 2005 ; Epidemiology and Infection, 2007 ; Plos One, 2013).
The air humidity increases with water evaporating, not with rain falling. So, air humidity is not necessary the highest during raining, but rather after raining, especially at high temperatures (IRI/LDEO Climate Data Library). You can probably inhale more water from fog than from rain.
