Q:

What are the official eye colors?

In reading the wikipedia article on eye color, I noticed that the colors listed there  seemed a bit arbitrary. Tangentially, I know that even the words we use today to recognize colors are neither old nor preserved through cultures, languages, or time. As an example, Spanish speaking peoples often use the word black to describe eye color, but English speaking peoples would say dark brown. 
This left me wondering if the worldwide medical community (represented by the world health organisation or something else) has a distinct nomenclature for human eye colors. If they do, what are the various "official" eye colors? 

A:

There is no strong scientific consensus on eye colors.
But for example, per 2019 review article at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639910 the colors listed in that review are blue, brown and intermediate
So one approach is to bundle the non brown and non blue into a single category called 'intermediate'.
The top of a long table is pasted here to demonstrate that.
