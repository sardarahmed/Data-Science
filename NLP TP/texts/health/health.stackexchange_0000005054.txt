Q:

What blood tests are worth doing for a healthy 30-year-old male?

The patient is a 30-year-old male who seems healthy. The patient has to do a blood test for some administrative forms (namely, proof of immunity to rubella and varicella), and wonder what else could be worthwhile to test.
What blood tests are worth doing for a healthy 30-year old male?
A comment deleted by a moderator suggested â€‹"Glucose, HbA1c, HDL and LDL cholesterol, TSH, T4, creatinine, urea, sodium, potassium".
The patient has no concern in particular, and cost is not an issue.

A:

The best place to find this answer is the US Preventive Services Task Force. They are an "independent, volunteer panel of national experts in prevention and evidence-based medicine" who make recommendations for what kinds of routine care are worth doing (in other words, do more good than harm) for what sorts of people (e.g. which age, sex, etc.). They give their recommendations grades based on how strong the evidence is and how substantial the benefit is. 
They created an app to filter the recommendations based on someone's age, sex, pregnancy status, tobacco use, and if they are sexually active. For a 30 year old male, here are the blood tests that are recommended (and the answer to your question).
Grade A (recommended with substantial benefit/certainty):

HIV screening 
Syphilis screening if at increased risk

Grade B (recommended with moderate benefit/certainty):

Hepatitis B screening if at high risk
Hepatitis C screening
Tuberculosis screening if at increased risk
