Q:

Help reading an eyeglass prescription: What does "PL" or "PC" mean?

I'm trying to purchase glasses online but I cannot figure out what the Spherical value is for the left eye (OS).  

A:

I finally found this:

Plano - PL - This indicates there is no spherical correction in this
  eye. A plano lens would have no focusing power or correction to it.

So it's 0.
