Q:

Lack of sex drive

I m married for almost 6months. My husband doesn't have any sex drive. He touched me only once or twice till date. He doesn't want to go to any doctor. Please suggest me medicines to increase his drive (Note: He is not impotent).

A:

See a doctor. Low libido (the medical term for sex drive) can have medical causes. Two examples among many potential causes are low testosterone or depression. 
Also Sex therapy (a type of couples psychotherapy) is a type of counseling that is highly recommended in the medical/behavioral health field for couples with differences in sexuality that causes stress for one/other partner or both.  (This is in addition to - not a replacement for - seeking medical evaluation.)
