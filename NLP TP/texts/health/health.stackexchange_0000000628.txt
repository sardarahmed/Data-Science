Q:

Does cooking food prevent the body from efficiently absorbing minerals?

It is true that we absorb minerals from cooked food less efficiently, because the membranes of our cells are made up mostly of hydrogen ions, therefore cooking food lose its anionic charge and it become more cationic? So in other words, it makes the food less healthy?
This can be demonstrated by Kirlian photography of cooked food which capture the phenomenon of electrical coronal discharges:

Which gives the impression of reduction of anionic charge. Therefore if alkalinity is altered due to cooking, it could influence the structural, functional and enzymatic aspects of the food making the nutritions less absorbable.

A:

Cell membranes are made out of phospholipids and a lot of proteins, not of hydrogen ions. A membrane of hydrogen ions doesn't make any sense chemically in any way.
Cooking doesn't change the overall charge of molecules in food, you can't create or destroy charges out of thin air. To change the charges, essentially the pH of your solution, you need to either add acid or base. Of course you do that quite often in cooking, but the cooking process itself can't change any charges by itself. And even if it did, stomach acid has a very low pH and will change the charges of food anyway. 
The Kirlian photography is pretty, but that's it. The strength of the effect is sensitive to moisture for example, there are all kinds of reasons why cooked and raw food could look differently in these images.
