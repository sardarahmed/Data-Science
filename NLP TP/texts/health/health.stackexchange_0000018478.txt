Q:

How exactly is whole-wheat flour healthier than white flour?

I've read the question about Why is White flour unhealthy. It seems like raw/bleached/white flour is just the endosperm component, but that whole-wheat flour contains the endosperm along with the fibrous portions (germ and bran). 
White flour gets knocked a lot for it being really close to sugar and being a super refined carbohydrate. But whole-wheat flour also has that endosperm component "loose" and readily digestible, there's just other fibrous stuff too. But those fibrous portions are mechanically separated from the endosperm, so the digestion and absorption should be nearly identical to white flour. 
Is added fiber really the only benefit of wheat bread?

A:

The bran (fiber) from whole-wheat flour slows down the movement of food from the stomach into the small intestine (gastric emptying), which results in slower glucose absorption. So, the glucose from whole-wheat flour (with fiber) is absorbed slower than the glucose from white flour (no fiber), which results in smaller blood glucose spikes after meals, which may be a preventative factor against diabetes type 2 (PubMed, 2018).
The fiber from whole-wheat bread can help maintain bowel regularity better than white bread. Whole-wheat bread also contains more minerals, such as potassium and magnesium (Foodmetrics.org)
