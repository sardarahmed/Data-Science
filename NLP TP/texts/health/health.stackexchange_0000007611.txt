Q:

Is there any evidence that phytic acid in oats can be dangerous?

I heard a lot of times that eating oats almost daily can be dangerous because of it. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytic_acid

A:

Although phytic acid has some anti-nutrient properties, the issue in the western world is not undernutrition but over nutrition!
And there is some suggestive evidence that phytates may have a role to play in anti-cancer activity in the large bowel.

The authors have found that phytic acid is a potent inhibitor of iron-mediated generation of the hazardous oxidant, hydroxyl radical. Herein, the authors propose that inhibition of intracolonic hydroxyl radical generation, via the chelation of reactive iron by phytic acid, may help explain the suppression of colonic carcinogenesis and other inflammatory bowel diseases by diets rich in phytic acid.
