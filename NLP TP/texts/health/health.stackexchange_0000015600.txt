Q:

Do nutrition fact labels include the nutritional content of wasted (unreachable) food?

Many packaged foods are in containers or bags which result in a significant amount of the food being left behind in their packaging (soup at the bottom of the can, melted cheese left on the pan from pizza, etc). Are food packagers aware of this waste and if so, are they taking it into account for the nutritional facts on their packages. 
For example, if a frozen pizza manufacturer studied consumers preparing and eating the pizza, and determined that 100 calories get left behind on the pan, on average, are they subtracting that from the nutritional facts, or does the consumer have to do this mental math to properly estimate caloric intake?

A:

No, they do not take waste and left-overs into account.
Nutrition information is by serving or package content:

The first place to start when you look at the Nutrition Facts label is the serving size and the number of servings in the package. Serving sizes are standardized to make it easier to compare similar foods; they are provided in familiar units, such as cups or pieces, followed by the metric amount, e.g., the number of grams.
The size of the serving on the food package influences the number of calories and all the nutrient amounts listed on the top part of the label. Pay attention to the serving size, especially how many servings there are in the food package. Then ask yourself, "How many servings am I consuming"? (e.g., 1/2 serving, 1 serving, or more) In the sample label, one serving of macaroni and cheese equals one cup. If you ate the whole package, you would eat two cups. That doubles the calories and other nutrient numbers, including the %Daily Values as shown in the sample label.
