Q:

Blood count and adenovirus vaccines

Some covid-19 adenovirus vaccines including AstraZenca and Johnson & Johnson are found to have potential link to a rare albeit serious side effect resulting in blood clots with low platelets, particularly in younger patients.
Despite stating that the benefits outweigh the risk, many drug agencies / governments recommend for younger age groups to have a different vaccine (mRNA).
However in other countries this is not possible, for example there are no mRNA vaccines. Assuming that one has access to blood tests (e.g. using private healthcare) and wants to get tested in order to reduce the risk:

should a blood count be done before taking the vaccine? how long before the first dose?
how long after each dose should a blood count be done?

A:

Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT): the incidence is unknown but it appears to be exceedingly rare. Risk factors for VITT are also unknown, although female sex and younger age (<55-60 yrs) were proposed as possible risk factors on initial reports.
A blood test before taking these vaccines will not be informative.
When VITT is suspected and the patient has received one of adenoviral-vectored vaccines (Astra Zeneca or Janssen/Johnson and Johnson) within the previous 5 to 30 days, appropriate tests including but not limited to blood counts are indicated and should be evaluated by a physician.
