Q:

What is "insulin resistance" and why is the word "resistance" used?

"Resistance" means refusal to accept or to comply.  "Insulin resistance" seems to be a loss of efficiency or efficacy of insulin in the body --- or perhaps an excess of glucose in the blood creating problems for the body to absorb sugar and turn it into energy.
As you can see, I don't know what is insulin resistance and I also can never relate the word resistance when I look up definitions for "insulin resistance".

A:

Insulin resistance refers to decreased ability of insulin receptors in the cell membranes to respond to insulin.
Insulin resistance (Wikipedia):

Insulin resistance implies that the body's cells (primarily muscle)
  lose sensitivity to insulin, a hormone secreted by the pancreas to
  promote glucose utilization. At the molecular level, a cell senses
  insulin through insulin receptors...
