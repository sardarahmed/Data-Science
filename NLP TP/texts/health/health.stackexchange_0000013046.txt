Q:

Eating cherry tomatoes daily - Healthy?

Over the years I have accumulated some extra body mass that I want to get rid of. I currently weigh almost 104kg at 1.85m.
To do this I have started exercising again and I am slowly adjusting my diet. First stage is removing most crap from my diet and introduce a low calorie breakfast.
For the last couple of weeks I eat 250g of cherry tomatoes and some other veg like half a cucumber, some radishes or some carrots. I find it tasty, it doesn't bore me (yet), I get lots af fluids (or at least I piss more and more often) and it keeps me satisfied till at least lunch time.
I wash the tomatoes before consuming, aiming to remove any pesticides (or other surface contaminents).
My question is: Assuming I get enough macro- and micro nutrients in other meals, are there any short- or longterm health risks known to eating 250g of cherry tomatoes daily?

A:

I think I can answer this myself now.
After ~3 weeks I started having problems with my intestines. My stool got very soft, sometimes more like diarrhoea. So I stopped eating tomatoes.
Ik took about 2 weeks for things to normalize again.
So I guess moderation is in place here. 1 or 2 times a week shouldn't be a problem, but don't overdo it.
