Q:

Which fish to choose for a good omega 6 to omega 3 ratio without other health drawbacks?

Eating Fish seems to be a good option to improve your omega 6 to omega 3 ratio. 
Now the problem is that many fishes contain pollutants, for example mercury, tin compounds, PCB, dioxins or antibiotics. In particular the fat fishs seem to be more pulluted, but that seem to be the best canditates to get some healthy omega 3 fatty acids without too much omega 6. 
So what would be good fish choices to improve your omega 6 to omega 3 ratio without the health drawbacks described above?
Do you have some references about that?

A:

Also departing from fish, hempseed oil is known to contain the optimal ratio of omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids, and does not present any health drawback to my knowledge.
