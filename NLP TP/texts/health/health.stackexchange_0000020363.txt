Q:

Is a broader term than Neuro-Muscolo-Skeletal used in medical literature?

Many Mechanic conditions involving anatomic deformity or idiopathic chronic joint inflammation conditions are classified as Neuro-Muscolo-Skeletal (NMS).
Is there another widely accepted broader term (such as Skeletal-Joint-Tendon-Bone-Neuronal --- SJTBN) in the medical literature?

A:

Neuro-musculo-skeletal system is already a broad term, which includes 3 systems:

Nervous system, which can be further divided to central and peripheral, somatic and autonomic, sensory and motor system
Muscular system, which includes skeletal muscles with the associated tendons (which you can control consciously), smooth muscles (which you cannot control consciously) and the heart muscle
Skeletal system, which includes bones, joints and ligaments (which connect the bones)

The names of complex systems include only the "main" systems (like the bold ones above) that are on the same level and not the smaller parts of every included system.
To clear some confusion:
A tendon is a part of a muscle that connects the muscle to a bone, so it is a part of muscular system. It is usually said: a tendon of (the muscle), for example, long tendon of the biceps brachii.
A ligament is a band of connective tissue that is not a part of a muscle or bone, but it connects bones, so it is usually considered a part of skeletal system (Biology Libre Texts, Ontology Lookup Service).
The main medical specialties that deal with the above systems include:

Neurology
Orthopedy (mechanical aspect)
Rheumatology (inflammatory aspect)
Traumatology (injuries)
Occupational medicine
Sports medicine
Physical medicine and rehabilitation (exercises to overcome disabilities, surgery, stroke or injuries)
