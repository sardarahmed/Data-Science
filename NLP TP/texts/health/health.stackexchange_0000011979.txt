Q:

How to keep my brain active and alert in natural always

Could you please let me know if any foods available to keep our brain active and alert always.
Sometimes I loss the common sense also to think on few things. For example pronouncing a word that I already know in wrong way. I also forget regular things like locking doors, turning off lights etc. very poor listening skills. I think the common problem for all these is because of low functionality of my brain.
Is there any way to improve my brain usage. Thanks in advance.
I am a vegeterian

A:

For activity you need energy, try eating foods that contain polysaccharides. That's what  athletes eat before triathlon.

Monosaccharides help for short time energy boost although they can turn into fats if not used.
