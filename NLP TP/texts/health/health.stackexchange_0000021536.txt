Q:

Are there any central trackers for COVID-19 trials?

There are several aggregate central trackers for the spread of COVID-19. Like this one, for example.
Is there anything similar for trials? Or trials in the pipeline? Either vaccines or treatments?

A:

I think you're asking about trials
See the clinical trials database

A:

Such a tracker is available on the Milken Institute website. It currently lists 52 vaccine candidates and 79 treatment candidates.
Update: one month later (May 4th) it lists 123 vaccine candidates and 199 potential treatments. Incredible!
Update #2: there are now 202 vaccine candidates and 316 potential treatments, as of August 8th

A:

As far as treatments are concerned, there is https://www.covid-trials.org/. It allows you to filter results by trial status (completed, recruiting, etc.), treatment and location. It also has links to trial results (where available) and registry information.
It does not have information on vaccine candidates, though.
