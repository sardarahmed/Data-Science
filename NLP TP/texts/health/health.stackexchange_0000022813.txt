Q:

Is it possible to get Covid-19 and have 0 symptoms along the complete journey and hence cure by yourself without knowing?

In this link, in the section How long is it between when a person is exposed to the virus and when they start showing symptoms? mentions

Recently published research found that on average, the time from exposure to symptom onset (known as the incubation period) is about five to six days. However, studies have shown that symptoms could appear as soon as three days after exposure to as long as 13 days later. 

I have seen this other link where we can see that the incubation could vary from 0 to 27 days.
Now here mentions how long it last if you have got it, which says its 22 days.

If the Covid-19 goes after 22 days, then could be possible that one gets it and showing no symptoms at all, not even feeling bad at all, the whole time on the Covid-19 process?  
If yes, is there a way to know that you already had it?
Thanks in advance. 

A:

Yes, it is possible to have no symptoms and be infected, various sources, e. g. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32179137.
As for testing after 'clearing the infection', this would be what a serological scarring test would look for, e. g.:
