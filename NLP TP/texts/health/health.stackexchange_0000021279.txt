Q:

Where to find a database containing COVID-19 information?

Is there any global database that enables the stochastic analysis of questions such as age distribution of fatalities, etc? 
A Google search produced only a WHO article database: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov
Update: 

Kaggle 
ArcGIS Dashboard 

A:

I recommend this github project from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE):
https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19
They collect the official numbers from different organizations and ministries from all over the world and update their repository every day.
They don't provide information about the age of patients though.
There is a Japanese project, however, which provides also some age information:
https://covid19japan.com/
But the Japanese people seem to be very disciplined and have a very low infection rate at the moment.
Update:
I found a database with German Covid-19 cases including age information:
https://npgeo-corona-npgeo-de.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/dd4580c810204019a7b8eb3e0b329dd6_0
From the same company (ESRI) there are a lot more data sets online also for Covid-19. One might have to search for age information, though.
