Q:

How to prevent darkening of wrist?

I have noticed that when I use computer for long hours, a part of my wrist and palm color turns dark brownish because of the excessive use of the mouse. And this darkening of skin doesn't go away by washing my hands.

In the above picture I have encircled the part of my hand which gets darkened. Is there anything I can do to prevent this? It is not possible for me to use computer less.

A:

I would try a cordless keyboard and get used to using the mouse pad and keyboard shortcuts as much as possible.
