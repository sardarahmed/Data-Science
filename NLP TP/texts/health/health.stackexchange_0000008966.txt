Q:

Is there by any way to 'remotely' brush teeth

As the title stated, is there any way we can get our teeth clean (like we brushed it) without physical contact of us with our teeth?
Or is there anyway to get our teeth clean in less than 3 minutes (which is the average time one takes to brush one's teeth)?

A:

The short answer is NO
The long answer is: If time is of concern, ask your oral health professional whether an electric toothbrush can improve your cleaning enough so that 2 minutes of brushing are sufficient.
As stated in another question on Health.Stackexchange:

it is the physical movement of the bristles of the brush that removes
  plaque that accumulates on and between the teeth and gums.

No matter what tool you use, contact is unavoidable with the teeth.
I currently have not seen good scientific papers that endorse using high-pressure water or air as a substitute for a toothbrush and floss to clean teeth. 
Here is an article that discusses plaque control using a toothbrush:

The Health.Stackexchange question I sited from:
Is brushing teeth without toothpaste actually harmful?
