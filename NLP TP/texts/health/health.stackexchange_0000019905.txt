Q:

What is the probability of having a second pregnancy with IUGR?

The odds of a pregnancy with an Intrauterine growth restrictionÂ (IUGR) appear to be ~5% in the general population, but, after some searching through Pubmed, I have not been able to find if that number is impacted by a previous IUGR. Is the probability changed for subsequent pregnancies?

A:

Patterson et al (1986) may be a bit outdated, but showed that for first pregnancies 2.5-10th percentile (9.6% of their sample), second pregnancies were 14.2% in that same category plus 3.9% less than 2.5th percentile (overall relative risk 2.2).
For first pregnancies <2.5th percentile (2.8% of their sample), second pregnancies were 18.8% in 2.5-10th plus 8% less than 2.5th percentile (overall relative risk 3.3). 
These numbers are for all pregnancies; if you look at the original paper they also break out cases where both pregnancies were considered uncomplicated (about half of the mothers) and found similar ratios. Their sample was Hispanic mothers in Texas 1972-1981 with gestational age >=26 weeks. 9596 total mothers.
Derks & Koenen 2018 is a more recent review but most of the studies mentioned are also a bit older (this isn't my area of expertise at all, so I don't know if any practices have shifted that would change expectations today), and they have varying definitions for low weight. For most of the studies, recurrence was in the 20-30% range, consistent with Patterson if you expect the population risk to be 10%.
I did not dig further to find if any of these studies used a definition that attempted to measure "true" IUGR which, as discussed a bit in the comments above, might differ.
