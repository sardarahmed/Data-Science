Q:

Why my hands are thin and stomach has a lot of fat

Even though I eat a lot food, my hands are very thin but I have a pot-belly.  I eat 3/4 KG of rice daily which is more than normal but I still don't gain weight in my hands. 
What could be the cause of this?
Please don't suggest to do hand related exercises because I see that most people don't do exercises, yet still gain weight in their hands.

A:

People tend to gain weight around the abdomen and hips because we generally have many more millions out fat cells in those areas and very few in the hands. It is possible to gain weight in your hands, but it is not possible to target weight gain in only your hands. Weight gain and weight loss happens systemically; that is, that your entire body gains and loses weight at the same time in proportion to the amount of fat cells in that part of your body. 
As for the disproportionate amount of fat cells in your abdominal region compared to your hands, I'm afraid you are just built that way.
