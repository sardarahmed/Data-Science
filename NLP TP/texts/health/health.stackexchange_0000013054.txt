Q:

I've unprotected acceptive oral sex with 3 partners, two of which were from escort service. What are my chances to get some desease(s)?

I've unprotected oral sex with 3 partners, two of which were from escort service while I was in not sober state. It was a gay sex (I'm usually rather straight and it was my almost first gay experience) and I was acceptive part. No-one ejaculated in my mouth though but penetration was deep in the throat.
I highly regret about that.
I'm scared so much that now I have some desease and can't take tests because mite biten me and now I have to take 2 weeks antibiotics course to prevent LIme desease(s) and then I need to wait for 2 weeks more before taking the tests.
How high chances of getting some desease?
Which tests should I take and how?
I feel like I'm going crazy.
Thank you.

A:

I would encourage you to get seen by a healthcare professional for testing/advice. This could be from your family doctor or at a walk-in clinic. There might also be a sexual health center near you that can offer testing, advice, and counseling services. Everything would be confidential and should be judgement free (if you feel like you are being judged you can always ask to see someone else).
