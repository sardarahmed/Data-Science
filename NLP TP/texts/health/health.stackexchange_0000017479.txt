Q:

Why are there different perscriptions for glasses and contacts? Help me see eye to eye on this

Why can't a prescription for glasses be used for contacts also? Isn't the eyesight still the same? 
At first, I cynically thought it was just another way for my optometrist to make money -- so he had to charge me for another test. But then I thought about it... and I understand that the contacts need to fit to your eyes and such, so they need to know how bulgy or small your eyes are, etc -- but does the overall eyesight prescription stay the same? 
Or is the reason, as I have theorized for the second prescription for contacts, they are testing the size of your eyes and getting measurements?

A:

Partly the additional sizing information required for contacts (Diameter and curvature of the cornea are needed for contact lenses but not for glasses) and the power also changes because the physical distance between the eye and the lens is different.
