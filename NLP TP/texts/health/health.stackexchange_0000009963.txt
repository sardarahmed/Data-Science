Q:

Identical twins have the same DNA and blood-types, right? But different fingerprints? Why is that? Same for clones?

Identical twins have the same DNA and blood-types, right? But different fingerprints? Why do they have different finger-prints? What gene or part of our body signals what our fingerprint will look like? 
Would the same situation be true of clones if there were to be human clones? Or would their fingerprints match too? 

A:

Fingerprints are formed semi-randomly as the foetus develops in the womb and are affected by such things as chance fluctuations of hormone levels. Similarly, the pattern of freckles and moles on the skin is caused by random mutations and will vary between identical twins.
Identical twins are 'clones' of one another. Their fingerprints are similar but not identical. ... Fingerprints form patterns the same way frost on a window forms patterns -- due to physical forces and conditions, not due to DNA programming.
Yes, clones have fingerprints. No, they wouldn't be exactly like their original: fingerprints are influenced by in-utero and epigenetic factors, not just by the DNA. A clone's fingerprints would be very much alike its progenitor (and some features would be nearly identical), but not the same.
