Q:

Is Alzheimer's disease determined by genes or lifestyle and diet?

Dementia is very taxing on care-giver children. Many parents would rather die than burden their children and rob them of living their own life. I am one of the parents who hold this view strongly.
Is dementia determined by genes or are there some healthy lifestyle practices and diet that middle-aged people (above 40s) can adopt to prevent dementia?

A:

In short:

Alzheimer's disease (AD), in most cases, is not hereditary.
You can decrease the risk of having AD by maintaining healthy weight and regular physical activity.
There is insufficient evidence about the effectiveness of different nutrients, foods, diets or supplements in the prevention of AD.

According to Alzheimer's Society Canada, modifiable risk factors for AD include:

diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, smoking, depression, cognitive
  inactivity or low education, and physical inactivity.

Other risk factors can include: excessive alcohol drinking, high blood cholesterol levels, stroke and repeated head injuries.
Alzheimer disease and genetics:

Most Alzheimer’s disease does not run in families and is described as
  “sporadic”. Rare cases of Alzheimer’s disease are inherited or
  “familial’.

Diet. Various systematic reviews, like this one, mention the association (but not necessary the cause-effect relationship) between Mediterranean diet and lower risk of AD.
Cochrane has a long list of study reviews about the preventative effect of supplements, herbs and alternative treatments on AD; in most cases, there is no evidence of their effectiveness.
