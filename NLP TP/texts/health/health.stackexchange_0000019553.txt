Q:

Has tardive dyskinesia ever "gotten better?"

I have tardive dyskinesia and my doctor said when he diagnosed me that it "might" not go away. I've heard that it's "potentially permanent." Has there ever been a recorded case where the condition has completely disappeared? 

A:

Tardive dyskinesia will, in many cases, get better after the offending drug is stopped. 
In severe cases, it is less common to have complete remission (where the symptoms completely disappear). But it can happen [1].
