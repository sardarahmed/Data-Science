Q:

Can stress increase blood pressure?

Whenever I get my blood pressure checked, whether by machine or person, I become extremely stressed. My heart rate then increases quite a bit into the hundreds, usually around 110-120 (my normal is 55-60) and I get a high blood pressure reading, up to 170/70. 
Can blood pressure increase from being stressed?  

A:

tl; dr - The answer is yes, clinically you can react to having your blood pressure (BP) taken by having an abnormally high reading.
What you are describing is called "white coat syndrome" or "white coat hypertension". However, from what I've found, it's not often accompanied by tachycardia (Increased heart rate). I did find a good discussion on this, and some of the ways that they determined if a person had WCH or true hypertension in this article from the AHA. It discusses the use of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring over clinical monitoring.
I would encourage you to try to find some way to get a true blood pressure reading, as if you are truly hypertensive, the morbidity factors increase, and there are medications that can help reduce it.
