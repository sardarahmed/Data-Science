Q:

Is an old population a contributing factor for the spread of the disease of COVID-19?

There is a public figure/writer on the Internet which plays a sort of "informal journalist", who stated in a tweet (without a source), that "Italy is hit hard, experts say, because they have the oldest population in Europe."
Now this can be interpreted in two ways. That death rates are higher because of this (it makes sense), or that the disease is spread faster because of this. Could this last idea be true?
Is an old population a contributing factor for the spread of the disease, or does the disease infect younger and older populations in the same way?

A:

There are some theories that the COVID-19 outbreak started in hospitals (VOX, March 13, 2020):

Another theory is that intense spread of the virus in the hospital
  system, before doctors realized there was a problem, may have
  amplified the outbreak. Some 10 percent of medical workers in Lombardy
  have been infected, according to a March 3 Washington Post report, and
  health workers account for 5 percent of those infected in the country.

In hospitals, in general, there are more older people.
There were also several cases of quick spread of infection in nursing homes.
Hospitals and nursing homes are environments where people live close together, so this is why infection can spread quickly among older people.
Younger people get infected in schools, when they travel to areas with lot of infected people and when they engage in contact sports, for example.
One of the reasons for a lot of cases in Italy is that they didn't act quickly when the inefction started.
