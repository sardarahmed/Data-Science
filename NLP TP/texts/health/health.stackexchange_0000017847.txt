Q:

Which lab value skeleton diagrams are used to display results for CBC, Chemistry, coagulation panel, etc?

Which lab value skeleton diagrams are used for discrete, cbc/cbcdiff, chem, and coag results?

A:

These skeleton diagrams are used as short hand to avoid having to write units and test names for lab values - you can just look at a diagram of numbers and know what they apply to.  Sodium is always in the same place, as is K, Cl, etc.
The skeletons are as follows:

Na K Cl HCO3 BUN Cr Glu = Chemistry 7
if you add AST ALT Alk Phos TBili Prot Ca = Chemistry 14 (which are usually in vertical form).  

Your diagram has just the LFTs, which can be represented as in your diagram, or in others (it varies).

PT PTT INR = coagulation panel
pH PaCO2 PaO2 HCO3 SaO2 BE = ABG (Arterial Blood Gas)
WBC Hgb Hct Plt = key components of CBC (Complete Blood Count) without diff. 

I found this example of writing the CBC diff, but have never actually seen it written out like that.

Per request, this is a Khan academy video on lab values.  I couldn't find any formal resources on fishbone diagrams, they're kind of passed on in medical education...
