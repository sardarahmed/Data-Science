Q:

Are there any risks about switching to a non-fluoride toothpaste?

Assuming I am not on any prescribed toothpaste and only toothpaste I been using are conventional toothpaste bought over the counter with fluoride. Also, assume I have a good brushing and flossing habit.
Would there be any risks or effects by switching to a toothpaste that does not contain fluoride?
