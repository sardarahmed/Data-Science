Q:

Melanocyte count in our skin

How many melanocytes can be found in one square milimeter of the skin. Is 1500 melanocytes per square-milimeter skin indeed the correct number?

A:

The count of melanocytes per square mm depends on the body region and 1500 seems to be the upper limit. Interestingly in different races, the number of melanocytes is THE SAME.

Quoting from:Understanding the Melanocyte Distribution in Human Epidermis: An Agent-Based Computational Model Approach

The skin color in young and healthy individuals is remarkably uniform.
  A major reason for this is that the melanocytes are evenly distributed
  throughout the basal layer of the epidermis. The density of
  melanocytes varies with the body site from around 900 melanocytes per
  square mm on the back to around 1500 melanocytes per square mm in the
  genital region.
