Q:

Not reaching a calorie goal/putting weight on

I am a UK postman. I wear a Fitbit which tells me I walk around 30,000+ steps a day, sometimes more. 
However, I don't seem to be losing weight. I log my food and its seems I am always 2000+ calories left to eat. I mainly eat well with the occasional boost of the naughty stuff. I am 46 and my rhr is about 57/62
Could I be putting my body into starvation hence the lack of weight loss?

A:

Calorie estimates from fitness trackers such as a FitBit are extremely unreliable, to the point where descriptions such as "wild guess" are reasonable.  For example, a recent study found errors of between 30% and 90%, with walking being the form of exercise with the highest error rate.
At a guess, I'd say the reason you're not losing weight is because the FitBit is overestimating your energy burn by about 2000 kcal a day.  5000 kcal a day is typical for someone engaged in heavy physical labor (eg. digging ditches).
