Q:

Bifascicular Block In Young Male Asymptomatic Patient

An asymptomatic 25 year old male presents with an ECG pattern of bifasicular conduction block (left anterior hemi-block and right bundle branch block) after experiencing "extra/skipped beats".
The patient has no remarkable family or past medical history.
What are the potential causes of the bifasicular block in a male patient of this age and what tests should be done to differentiate these causes?

A:

If the person is well, and investigations show no structural defects, then:

Early-onset cardiac conduction defects in the absence of structural heart disease should prompt consideration of CCD genetic testing, especially if a positive family history of conduction abnormalities and pacemaker implants is identified.

Some other causes not age specific some of which are listed here include ischemic heart disease, cardiomyopathies, hypertension, aortic stenosis, Levâ€™s disease, hyperkalemia, congenital heart disease, sarcoid cardiomyopathy, Chagas disease, and scleroderma.
