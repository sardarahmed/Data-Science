Q:

Is it healthy to drink 1.5L of milk a day?

I drink 1.5 to 2 liters of milk a day. Is it healthy? 

A:

There are several risks related to excessive consumption of milk. A 12 years prospective study run on around 78000 women showed that high consumption of milk (2-3 glasses per day) increased the risk of fracture when compared to people who used to drink one glass or less per week. (1) Similar results were found in other studies like, for example: 2.
The amount that you say, 1.5 L, contains about 1800 mg of calcium, that must be sum to other daily dietary sources (as dairy, green leaves, sesam seeds, water). A study showed that dietary intakes of calcium greater than 1400 were associated with higher death rates from all causes, cardiovascular disease and ischaemic heart disease (3).
Finally, high intakes of calcium can interfere with iron absorption and lead to iron deficiency (4, 5).
