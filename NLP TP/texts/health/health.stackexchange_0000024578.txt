Q:

Nutritional sodium deficiency -- documented cases?

Are there documented cases of nutritional sodium deficiency? I'm curious what the symptoms are, and if it's possible to achieve them through dietary restrictions alone. I could only find examples of hyponatremia with causes other than nutritional deficiency.

A:

Two case reports of hyponatremia in infants fed exclusively with almond, nut, chestnut and soy milk or a homemade sesame seed emulsion were identified.  These cases appear to be due to inadequate sodium in the diet.

According to Sterns, hyponatremia is not a disease but rather a pathophysiologic process indicating disturbed water homeostasis.

Sterns states:

Maximal dilution of urine prevents hyponatremia unless water intake is
extraordinarily large (>1 liter per hour) (e.g., in patients with
schizophrenia who drink water compulsively) or the rate of urinary
solute excretion is extremely low (e.g., in beer drinkers who eat very
little).

There are numerous case reports of a condition called “beer potomania”—excessive consumption of beer—which is characterized by hyponatremia.   Lodhi et al. explain “beer potomania” as follows:

Beer potomania, a unique syndrome of hyponatremia, was first reported
in 1972. It is described as the excessive intake of alcohol,
particularly beer, together with poor dietary solute intake that leads
to fatigue, dizziness, and muscular weakness. The low solute content
of beer, and suppressive effect of alcohol on proteolysis result in
reduced solute delivery to the kidney. The presence of inadequate
solute in the kidney eventually causes dilutional hyponatremia
secondary to reduced clearance of excess fluid from the body.

Published case reports of beer potomania up to 2018 are cited in Joshi and Chou, who also explain the pathophysiology.

Pica is a condition in which patients crave and chew substances with no nutritional value. Ice pica (pagophagia) is seen in patients with iron deficiency. A case report of hyponatremia due to excessive consumption of water because of ice pica (pagophagia) was identified.
