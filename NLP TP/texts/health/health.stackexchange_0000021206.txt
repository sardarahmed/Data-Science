Q:

Will COVID-19 survivors develop immunity from future infections?

For this question, assume that the virus does not mutate.
Can survivors be expected to develop immunity?
Why or why not (what is the thought process)?
The CDC FAQ indicates that they do not know:

Q: Can people who recover from COVID-19 be infected again?
A: The immune response to COVID-19 is not yet understood.
Patients with MERS-CoV infection are unlikely to be re-infected shortly
after they recover, but it is not yet known whether similar immune
protection will be observed for patients with COVID-19.

As good as CDC is, I would expect that there are other excellent institutions and individuals that have insight.
CLARIFICATION: a survivor for this discussion is an COVID 19 infected patient that survives the infection.  My understanding is that there is no reason to believe that the uninfected would develop immunity.
UPDATE: COVID 19 mutant strains have been detected in the UK.

A:

There is a study from Chinese scientists from Bejing on this question:
Reinfection could not occur in SARS-CoV-2 infected rhesus macaques

Combined with the follow-up virologic, radiological and pathological findings, the monkeys with re-exposure showed no recurrence of COVID-19, similarly to the infected monkey without rechallenge. Taken together, our results indicated that the primary SARS-CoV-2 infection could protect from subsequent exposures, which have the reference of prognosis of the disease and vital implications for vaccine design.

One has to state that with four monkeys the statistics is very low, though.
There is, however, also a risk for relapse and further mutations of the virus as already pointed out by brasscup and Alexei.
