Q:

Type of Flu Shot for Person in Late 30s - Which Standard Dose Provides Most Protection?

Updated Question
Of all the standard dose vaccines, which one is most strongest? 
Flu shot doesn't guarantee against flu, but it is a layer of defense. 
According to  this link there is Afluria, Fluarix, FluLavel, Fluzone. How are they different, which one should I ask for?
Influenza Vaccines
For 2015 to 2016 I received FLUARIX QUAD 2015-2015 SYRINGE in Dec 2015
For 2016 to 2017 I received AFLURIA 2016-2017 SYRINGE in Oct 2016

A:

Your pharmacist or doctor should be able to decide which one is the best fit for you. Factors that are considered in recommendations include age, allergies (egg or mercury), and your medical history specifically if you are on a continuous steroid therapy or if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. 
The medication that you received last year "AFLURIA" is not a Quadrivalent vaccine which means it only has the protection of 3 strains of the flu instead of 4. As mentioned in the comments, the strains selected is based on studies by health professionals to figure out the prevalence of a strain in a specific year. To get the extra protection ask for a quadrivalent vaccine and let the healthcare professional make the decision based on what he/she has available and your history. I have not found a study to compare the efficacy of the different quadrivalent vaccines and I do not think there will be one. 
I would cite sources for what I said above, but this is all based on my experience as a healthcare professional. If you need additional information CDC website is your best source.
[edit] also, the CDC provide a tool to figure out which vaccines you need at your age and sometimes provide a specific recommendation. Give it a try: https://www2a.cdc.gov/nip/adultimmsched/
