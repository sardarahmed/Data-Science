Q:

Meaning of "D1 q3w" in a poster to a clinical trial

From a poster to a clinical trial:

I can understand that q3w means "once every 3 weeks", but what is the meaning of D1? I think the first DI must be a typo and it stands for D1 too.

A:

D1 means on day one of the three weekly cycles. DI is a typo.
