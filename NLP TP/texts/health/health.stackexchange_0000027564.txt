Q:

How do whitening mouthwashes work?

I am trying to achieve shiny white teeth. However, I am not trying to do laser whitening or any type of dye whitening. I have recently started using an electrical toothbrush and it was amazing. Now, I am trying to go to the next level by using mouthwashes daily to remove all the discoloration from my teeth to have a whiter look.
I started using [an Optic white mouth wash with an effective peroxide formula] for 2 weeks or so. The results were visible, but if stop using it for a day or two, I notice my teeth reversing to the previous color before using the mouth wash.
Are whiting mouthwashes just a coating layer for teeth or does it actually remove stains? Is there a different mouthwash type that remove stains?

A:

Hydrogen peroxide is an oxidizing bleach. It reacts chemically with the types of molecules that contribute to color.
So, it doesn't really remove stains, nor does it coat anything, but it does make colorful things not-as-colorful, just like if you wash your white socks with chlorine bleach.
