Q:

Clonazepam and pregnancy

What are the risks of my wife taking clonazepam during pregnancy? To be specific, I am looking for recent studies on this, I have done a lot of research and am fairly confused by what I have read.

A:

This is an issue for which YOU NEED to have a risks-benefits discussion with a doctor. Only they can help guide you whether to continue the medication or not, as there may be risks either way.
I am answering this question because it is helpful to be aware that until recently, the FDA classified medications into Pregnancy Risk Categories based upon evidence from studies or lack thereof.  They removed these labels (for reasons outside the scope of this question) but the categories are helpful at least to start with.
Benzodiazepines as a class were Category D in pregnancy including clonazepam.  Some Benzodiazepines were Category X.

Category D
  There is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience or studies in humans, but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks.
  Example drugs: lisinopril, alprazolam, losartan, clonazepam, lorazepam
Category X
  Studies in animals or humans have demonstrated fetal abnormalities and/or there is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience, and the risks involved in use of the drug in pregnant women clearly outweigh potential benefits.
  Example drugs: atorvastatin, simvastatin, warfarin, methotrexate, finasteride

This does NOT mean 100% for sure that a medication should not be taken - it is ALWAYS IMPORTANT to have a risks-benefits discussion with a doctor for medications during pregnancy!
