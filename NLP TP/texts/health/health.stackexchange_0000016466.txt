Q:

Having a 2.4/5 Ghz wireless router next to us is healthy?

What is the official distance that we need to keep from a 20 dBm wireless router that has 2x2 MiMo 3 dBi antennas? 
The given router is this:

Ex.: can we be 1 m far to this wireless router, 24h a day (most of the time) for the rest of our life? Or can it cause ANY reproduction/cancer issues? 
So far I googled for several hours.. but still cannot decide that is it a good idea or not, to put the wireless router 1 m far for 24h a day.  

A:

According to the FCC depending on the frequency, a few Watts per kg absorbed RF radiation is an appropriate safety limit. Since 20 dBm corresponds to a total emitted power of 0.1 Watt, there is nothing to worry about.
