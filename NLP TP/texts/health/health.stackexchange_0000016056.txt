Nutrition and aging skin: sugar and glycation (PubMed, 2010)

The effect of sugars on aging skin is governed by the simple act of
  covalently cross-linking two collagen fibers, which renders both of
  them incapable of easy repair. Glucose and fructose link the amino
  acids present in the collagen and elastin that support the dermis,
  producing advanced glycation end products or "AGEs." This process is
  accelerated in all body tissues when sugar is elevated and is further
  stimulated by ultraviolet light in the skin.

Diet and Dermatology (PubMed Central, 2014)

Rhytides, sagging of skin, and loss of elasticity are all related to changes in the collagen and elastic fibers of the skin, which are
  themselves impacted by diet. Ingestion of sugar, in particular, can
  accelerate these signs of aging...
Foods with a high glycemic index, such as sugar, white bread, and white rice, are rapidly absorbed, leading to higher serum glucose
  levels and corresponding elevated levels of insulin. Insulin and IGF-1
  have been shown to augment sebum production, stimulate adrenal
  androgen synthesis, and increase androgen bioavailability, all of
  which play a role in the pathogenesis of acne.
