Q:

Why do some foods with high calories not fill you up?

I've just returned from the cinema, where I ate a large popcorn and a large drink. This equated to about 1200 calories. I do not feel full at all. However, for lunch I had chicken, potatoes and vegetables, which equated to about 800 calories. Afterwards, I felt very full. I did not have breakfast this morning or snack during the day, nor did I exercise substantially during the day.
Why is it that food with more calories can seemingly make you feel less full than food with fewer calories?

A:

Satiety is not, and never was, a measure of the calories you have eaten. You feel sated when a certain type of neurons fire in your brain. These neurons are triggered by 1) impulses incoming from the enteric nerve network (motor neurons which partake in peristalsis) and 2) a number of hormones, including GLP1, orexins, cholestokynin and the leptin/ghrelin pair. It is however not yet entirely clear if we know all hormones involved, and what mechanisms determine the release of these hormones. 
In two words, it is a very complex matter, and we don't know what exactly creates a feeling of hunger or satiety, but we know it's not something simple as the amount of calories, or the amount of food measured by weight, or the amount of food measured by volume.
