Q:

how to stop frequent nocturnal emission

My age is 28 . I am male and i am un married
I do not watch any content that may arouse feelings  but still i face the problem of nocturnal emission (without any dream) approximately twice a week
What should i do to get rid of this problem?

A:

As I pointed in https://medicalsciences.stackexchange.com/a/11676, since sperm are short-lived, they must constantly be replenished, so the testes produce 1,500 sperm per second. Plus sperm is produced during the whole of the male life. If the dead sperm is not released through sex or masturbation, it will automatically be released by the body.
Some males find that they are more prone to nocturnal emissions during times of less frequent sexual activity because they are not ejaculating as frequently from masturbation or sex with a partner, and in fact — as studies have confirmed — high ejaculation frequency was related to decreased risk of total prostate cancer (Leitzmann, et al., 2004).
