Q:

Is prostatitis a STD or Contagious disease?

As prostatitis is a disease in male's prostate gland, does it mean this is a sexually transmitted disease?

A:

Prostatitis isn't an STD, or a contagious disease, or even a disease at all.  The term "prostatitis" simply refers to inflammation of the prostate gland.  The underlying condition causing the inflammation could be any of a number of things, which, yes, include contagious and sexually-transmitted diseases.
