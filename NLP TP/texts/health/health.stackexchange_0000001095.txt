Q:

How risky is it to try a dog shock collar (e-collar) on yourself?

OK, so this might sound highly masochistic but that's not for my personal enjoyment.
As a dog trainer I strongly advocate against the use of shock/electric/remote collar and I arrived at the idea that a video showing such a collar on a human would make a strong point. Indeed many people using these are saying that it is not that bad for the dog, which I really don't believe to be true.
So are there actual risk (electrocution, burns, etc.) on demonstrating that on myself?
I certainly wouldn't start on my neck, maybe on my leg?

A:

For a one off experiment, a search of YouTube  suggests that while uncomfortable, testing a dog shock collar on yourself is not particularly risky. That said, if you wish to avoid the discomfort, existing videos might get the point across.
