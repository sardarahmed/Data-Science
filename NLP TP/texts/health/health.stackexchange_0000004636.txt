Q:

Acidity of gut contents

How does the pH of the contents of the gut vary from the stomach to the anus?  I know that chyme is very acidic, but after that?

Not sure if I answered this right:

The system begins in the mouth, where the pH of saliva is 5.7 – 7.0.
  In the esophagus the pH is 7.0. The stomach pH is 1.5 – 3.0. In the
  Duodenum (upper part of the small intestine) pH is 4.0 – 5.0, and in
  the lower part of the small intestine (jejunum and ileum), pH 6.5 –
  7.5

The reason for it:

In order to carry out their individual functions, each section of the
  digestive system maintains a pH that suits the needs of the
  environment. The first part of the system prepares the food for
  digestion. This section’s weak acidic surroundings begin the process.
  The second area, the stomach, must supply enough acid to break the
  food into its nutrients. However, when the food continues into the
  intestines, it no longer needs acid. Both intestines bring the matter
  closer to the pH of the body

Basically these values stay consistent with some minor changes, unless a person is experiencing a acid-base imbalance. These are life threatening and can be extremes in acid or alkaline. The pH as you can see stays within the range it needs to be, in order to process food.
