Q:

How does Ponstan treat headaches?

I was having a headache and it remained this way for 3 to 4 hours. Then I took "Ponstan" . My headache was completely gone immediately.
What active ingredient is in Ponstan and how does it work? Also, is it normal for Ponstan to have such a quick effect?

A:

The active ingredient in Ponstan is mefenamic acid. It is categorized as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). 
It works because it 

is a cyclo-oxygenase (Cox-1 and -2) inhibitor and blocks the production of intracellular prostaglandins that are important in pain and inflammatory pathways. Mefenamic acid has analgesic as well as anti-pyretic and anti-inflammatory activities, but is used largely for treatment of pain. 

Basically, like a lot of painkillers, it inhibits the transmission of pain signaling. 
As for speed, how fast NSAIDs lead to less pain depends on a lot of things, including the severity of the pain or when the patient last ate, it can't really be generalized. A very fast relief might also be caused by the placebo effect just by having taking medication.
