Q:

How to diagnose myopia in a 2-year old?

Is there an exam that clearly diagnoses a child myopia level without the need of this child's feedback (as he is not going to give it, given his age (2))?
Like, is there a laser exam or something like that which can give a precise measurement?
I know I can get him to an ophthalmologist, and I will, but I just want to be well informed before hand to avoid not giving him an adequate diagnoses and hinder the treatment we might use.
Thanks in advance for your help!

A:

Refractive errors can be detected by using an ophthalmoscope. To get an accurate measurement you can do streak retinoscopy.
