Q:

Is using vegetable oil bad for a ketogenic diet?

I have read on various sources that vegetble oil is improper for a ketogenic diet. But I do not understand why. 
If the fats are suppose to turn into ketones, which in turn are burned for energy instead of sugar, and since any oil is a fat, why would this stop the process of ketosis?

A:

The general recommendation against vegetable oil has nothing to do with the oil source. The usual complain is that vegetable oils are perceived as "highly processed" and thus "not natural". Which of course is not true. You can't treat extra virgin olive oil same as margarine (aka "hardened vegetable oil"). There are many crappy products made from unspecified "vegetable oil", but it doesn't mean that all oils coming from plants are bad.
Just make sure the oil is a high quality, cold pressed one.
Sorry I can't cite any sources, but when something is a made up misconception, there are no sources to prove it's not real : /
