Q:

Is it advisable to have Bluetooth-enabled devices for infants less than 2 years old?

I have a Bluetooth-enabled health monitor watch. My concern is having such devices for infants who are less than 2 years old. Does it affect them health-wise??

A:

There is no evidence that EMR in the dosages present in everyday activities can have any pernicious effect on human health. Nor is there a sound logical contention to back up such claim. 
So, yes, feel free to use bluetooth, wifi, radio, etc. near your child. Even without them, there is a lot of EMR running amok around you, so there's not much you can actually do in that regard.
