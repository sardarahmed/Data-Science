Q:

Does this infographic show that masks increased the transmission of COVID-19 in Los Angeles County?

As the title says, my father alleges that this graph shows that masks have increased COVID-19 rates. Does the graph prove this relationship, or is this just a faulty correlation?

A:

The old saying correlation does not equal causation applies here. In this case the correlation assumed by the question is that masks cause more transmission i.e. Mask mandate -> transmission + infection.
However, there is another correlation that could be the opposite of the assumed, with the causal relationship being that with increased transmission (and subsequent infections) you get a mask mandate to try to limit spread. For this relationship: transmission + infection -> mask mandate. This equation and the one in the first paragraph are not the same!
If you look closely at the graphs, if it were masks causing the transmission, you would expect the increases to happen after masks mandates were put in place, and for the transmission to continue and increase throughout the period during which mask mandates were in place. You would not expect to see the same rate of infection before the masks were used - note the two other times when mask mandates introduced on April 10 and July 17, you can see an obvious increase in cases before each mask mandate was introduced. Also note the shape of the curve in the period between May 8 and June 15 where the number of cases increases for a while, then reduces until mask mandates were removed on June 15. In addition, after the return of mask mandates on July 17, the curve slope doesn't change after the mask mandate was put in place, instead the rate of infection is more or less constant between early July and early August. Lastly on this point, if masks did increase the spread, you would expect in each case, after the mandate was introduced, that the curve would have a slope something like the one on the extreme right of the graph. This is patently not so, so it can't be the masks causing it.
What is shown in December 2021 and Jan 2022 is the effect of the highly transmissible Omicron variant. This has a reproduction number (R0) of about 3-times that of the Delta variant1. Delta has a R0 of about 5 (range 3.2-8.0 in the literature)2, compared to the original SARS-CoV-2, which had an R0 of about 3. This means that if you had Delta you would, on average, infect about 5 other people. With Omicron, you could be infecting up to 15 people. Masks alone don't work in this case, you also need people to comply with all the other public health measures that are available, such as hand washing, physical distancing, limiting time in close proximity, "isolation bubbles" etc., to be able to limit spread.
Masks have been proven to limit spread of SARS-CoV-23, and mask mandates result in greater levels of mask wearing than you might get otherwise4,5. Thus, the conclusion that mask mandates might be introduced when there is increased spread of SARS-CoV-2 is a logical one to make, and the opposite causal relationship is highly unlikely.
