Q:

What can cause a visual disturbance followed by a headache?

Interesting story: onset of a blurred point in a field of vision which gradually enlarges such that it forms an arc in the right side of the field of vision and then after a while that blurred arc fades away.
Afterwards, the visual disturbance will go away, vision will clear, but then a severe headache (usually unilateral) gradually comes up. 
No other symptoms.

A:

What you're describing has been known since antiquity. What you first describe (an arc-like enlargening area of blurry vision) has been called a scintillating scotoma and artists and patients alike have tried to describe it with interesting results:
  
It is important to note that this happens in both eyes simultaneously, so that the same part of the visual field is disturbed in both eyes. (If it in monoccular, it is different and more concerning, and should be reported to your doctor immediately.)
The headache that follows is a migraine. For this reason, this has variously been called ocular migraine, opthalmologic migraine, visual migraine, etc.
It is never a bad idea to talk to your doctor at least once about migraines, even if they are infrequent, though a significant number of migraine sufferers don't seek medical care.
