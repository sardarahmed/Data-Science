Q:

What is the name of this medical practice?

new here. I am a software engineer and I want to make a thesis about medical practices with virtual mannequins using Virtual Reality.
What I've seen so far is that they use tubes to put down trough the throat and touches the mannequin in certain areas for pain detection or for reanimation practice.
I have 0 experience with medical procedures, standards, rules and tools. To start with I would like to know the name of the practice that doctors and students do with simulated or real patients.
PD. I really don't know which tags should I use, please help me.

There is a site called Anatomy Stuff which specialize in providing replications of the human body.
In particular, they have a section called Anatomy Models, which has a range of human-esque models, but these are a bit obsolete these days!
Clincal Skills Training, another of their sections, has life-like human manikins that can be used to mimic real people.
