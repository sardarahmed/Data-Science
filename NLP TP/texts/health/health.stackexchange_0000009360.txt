Q:

Best way to heavy metal detox

What is the most effective way to detox from heavy metals such as mercury and arsenic that are an unfortunate part of the post-industrial era we live in now. Do we even need to? I'm not talking about acute but rather chronic toxicity.
Detox has the reputation of being unscientific â€” probably because of all the bogus products and procedures associated with it. Is there any way to do a broad spectrum heavy metal detox, or is it individual for a metals? If so, how so?
Ps. Please add or take tags as you feel approopriate!

A:

Unless you live on an area known for having deposits of heavy metals, or you suspect that you have been exposed (in which case you should go see a doctor), your kidneys should be able to take care of the small amounts of heavy metals present in your diet and environment. That being said, heavy metal intoxication can be treated with chelation therapy if needed. There are many drugs for this, most of them target a different metal selectively. This is not exempt of risks and by no means should be performed without medical supervision.
