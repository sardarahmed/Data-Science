Q:

Why does my girlfriend have such smaller stools when we eat the same food?

My girlfriend and I have a fairly well-rounded diet. We eat a lot of vegetables, beans, and grains, some dairy and a moderate amount of meat (maybe one serving per day). I would assume our diet to be at least as high in fiber as the average or recommended diet. We both eat at least 3 meals per day and often she eats a slightly larger meal than I do. I have a thin frame and hers is average.
But here's where we differ. I defecate generally once or sometimes twice per day, and my output is usually at least a foot long and floats. I think it looks pretty healthy. But she only defecates around once every other day and it is only a relatively small amount of hard deer pebbles.
Where does all her waste go? Does she have incredibly efficient enzymes that are making use of the roughage rather than tossing it out? Either way it doesn't seem very healthy for her stool to be so compact, but no amount of fruit or fiber bar eating seems to change the situation.

A:

Modern evidence-based medicine won't be able to fully answer your question, but there are indications that bacteria, or more exactly, the individual gut flora heavily influence your fecal weight or stool mass. E.g., in obstipated patients, other types of gut bacteria were found than in the control group, which still can't tell what is cause and what is effect. Stool transplantation is also an emerging therapy for various diseases (see also here and here), so while there is no better explanation for your question, I think the difference in composition of gut flora may be a good candidate to explain individual variation.
