Q:

can I mix cool water with hot water

My workplace has very hot water and very cool water which is not drinkable. Can I mix both... is it good for health? Are there any ill effects if you drink a hot and cold water mixture?

A:

There is ill effect if the water contains germs. Boiling water kill the germs, and mixing them with cold water will result in a temperature low enough for the germs from the cold water to survive. That's why in some part of the world, there is some believe not to mix hot and cold water for drinking. It can really cause sickness if the water is not clean.
