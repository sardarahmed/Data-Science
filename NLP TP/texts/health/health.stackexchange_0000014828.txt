Q:

Why are some people always warm/hot to touch even with normal core temp?

I have met a few people like me who are always warm to touch even in the winters. With people sitting close often inquiring if I have a fever. Why is that? and Is it normal?

A:

For a constant basal metabolic rate, then those with relatively smaller body surface areas will feel warmer than those with high body surface area.  This is because with a higher BSA the body has to shut down more of the surface blood flow to conserve heat and thereby ensure a constant core body temperature.

In addition, larger animals usually have a smaller surface area relative to their body mass and, therefore, are comparatively inefficient at radiating their body heat off into the surrounding environment.  The relationship between surface area and volume of objects was described in the 1630's by Galileo. 1

But on top of this men have more muscle mass which generates more heat and this needs to be lost by increasing blood flow to the skin.  So, this explains why women are so cold.

A 1998 study found that women's average hand temperature hovers around 87.2 °F, while men's averages 90 °F 2
