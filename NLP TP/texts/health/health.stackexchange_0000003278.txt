Q:

How to gain weight naturally or by food around the house

I'm 24 years old, vegetarian and weigh 31Kg. Can anybody tell me how to increase weight naturally and what food to keep around the house?
Also I would like to ask, in my childhood I did not take breast milk, can that affect my body growth and contribute to the development of illnesses in the future?

A:

Unless you are very short, your weight indicates that you are severely underweight, see here for details. If you are indeed underweight, then you should follow the advice given there:

If you are concerned about being underweight, please seek a trained healthcare provider. 

The general advice that comes second to whatever your doctor's advice is, is given on this page on healthy weight gain. So, you'll need to increase your calorie intake, but make sure you get enough nutrients from all food groups.

A:

To increase weight and be healthy eat plenty of food rich in proteins (black beans, chickpeas, broccoli, potatoes, mushrooms), carbohydrates (Whole grain bread, pasta, cereals) and fat (avocado, olive oil, almonds, walnuts); include supplements and multivitamins in your diet, lift weights (don't do running or cardio) and plan your diet according to your activity level.
