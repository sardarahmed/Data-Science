Q:

Hair graying due to water change

Recently I moved from India to Riyadh, because the change in water my hair started becoming gray.  Is there any remedy for graying hair due to water change?.
P.S: my age is 26 and am sure that this problem is not related with my age.

A:

Treatment: 

Natural dye: You may not want to use a chemical dye as this will just damage your hair worse.
Trying to wash out chlorine buildup. Which will not completely reverse the gray hair, but will help heal the hair and keep it healthy. 
Trimming hair ends. 

Chlorine and sun can cause split ends, which definitely add to a
  damaged look.

Use good hair products to encourage healthy hair and use prevention when around chlorine to prevent extra damage. 

There is no complete reversal treatment, because of the amount of damage it does:

The reaction of melanin pigments with chlorine results in change of
  hair from natural colour (blond to black) to straw colour of keratin.

Chlorine removes natural oils covering hair resulting in loss of hair
  shine and flexibility, as well as making them more susceptible to
  mechanical damage.

Your hair probably became gray due to the chlorine in the water or other chemicals. Other factors such as diet, stress and etc can cause graying hair, but because you mentioned the water being the reason I focused on that. 
Risk factors for graying hair in chlorine exposed water is: 

Previously damaged hair
Chemically lightened hair(whitened)
Dry hair, thin or fine hair 
Permed or relaxed hair

These hair types can get damaged faster and already in a way damaged. 
Prevention: 

Wearing a swimming cap to cover your hair
Wetting your hair before entering the pool and rinsing and washing well after with a good shampoo and conditioner to protect hair.
