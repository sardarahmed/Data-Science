Q:

Are there any sustainable alternatives to eating food?

My metabolism is extremely high. Preparing meals/cleaning up/doing dishes would take up my entire day if I didn't eat out/order food for most of my meals. I'm wondering if there's such a thing as "food pills" or basically some kind of shake that I could get in bulk that I could just drink whenever I'm hungry (every 2 - 3 hours). I don't care about taste at all. Ideally, the shake/pills would have all the required nutrients and I would just take a couple minutes to consume it and then get back to working. If anyone has any ideas, I would be thrilled to hear.

A:

There's Soylent, which is designed for exactly what you describe. 
But even without considerations of taste, I'm very suspicious of this approach, because it's based on some assumptions that I would question. One is that we know exactly what the human body needs and can just put it in a shake. But what if there are micronutrients in real food that we just haven't discovered yet? Or what if the nutrient in the shake simply doesn't work when distilled into pure form, without the natural packaging provided by, say, the apple it came from. We evolved to eat food, and assuming that we can eat a processed version may be misguided.
