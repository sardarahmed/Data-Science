Q:

Why are Ground Glass Opacities termed "Ground Glass"?

What exactly is "ground glass", if this exists?

How do GGOs relate to "ground glass"? Rather than "ground glass", why not call these light-coloured or gray or transculent opacities?

According to Isabel Oliva Cortopassi, MD, chief of thoracic imaging at Yale Medicine and an associate professor of radiology and biomedical imaging, ground glass opacities (GGOs, for short) indicate abnormalities in the lungs. "Ground glass opacities [are] a pattern that can be seen when the lungs are sick," says Dr. Cortopassi. She adds that, while normal lung CT scans appear black, an abnormal chest CT with GGOs will show lighter-colored or gray patches.

A:

As described in this article at radiopaedia.org , the meaning relevant to the question is likely:

Ground glass opacification is also used in chest radiography to refer
to a region of hazy lung radiopacity, often fairly diffuse, in which
the edges of the pulmonary vessels may be difficult to appreciate
The use of the term ground glass derives from the industrial technique
in glassmaking whereby the surface of normal glass is roughened by
grinding it.
