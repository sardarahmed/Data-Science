Q:

What disorder forbids eating raw, but still allow aburi (partially blow-torched or cooked), nigiri?

While at Japanese restaurants, I've overheard at least three different customers  requesting aburi for normally raw nigiri on the menu, for medical reasons. 

Aburi style refers to nigiri sushi where the fish is partially grilled (topside) and partially raw. Most nigiri sushi will have completely raw neta.

By the bye, I don't know Wikipedia correctly used "grilled".  These restaurants just blow-torch the top of the nigiri. 
I still can't figure out what disorder would warrant this distinction between raw and partially cooked nigiri? Wouldn't a doctor just advise all such patients vulnerable to foodborne illness to eat only wholly cooked food and to shun anything raw? Thanks! 

A:

Two types of allergic reactions can occur after eating raw fish:
1) Anisakis allergy
According to The Clinical Characteristics of Anisakis Allergy in Korea (KJIM, 2009), some individuals who have been previously infected with the parasite Anisakis after eating raw fish can at subsequent consumption of raw fish develop a severe allergic reaction to the parasite.
According to Anisakis simplex: from Obscure Infectious Worm to Inducer of Immune Hypersensitivity (Clinical Microbiology Reviews, 2009), an allergic reaction can be triggered even by dead Anisakis from cooked fish.
2) Oral allergy syndrome
Some individuals with pollen allergies (allergic rhinitis) or atopic dermatitis (a type of chronic allergic skin reaction with eczema) cross-react with allergens in raw fish. A 23-year old Japanese woman with allergy to raw fish.
So, with these conditions it's better to avoid raw fish. I can't imagine how would cooking only a half of a fish help in any condition. A half-raw fish is still raw.
