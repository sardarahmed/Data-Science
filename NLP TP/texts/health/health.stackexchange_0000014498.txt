Q:

Can Asthma lead to a Cardiac Arrest and thus require CPR?

I recently read a story, in the story, there was a person that had a severe asthma attack. Another person came into his rescue and performed compressions and mouth to mouth.
It wasnt stated whether or not the victim of the asthma attack had his heart rate stop at all in the story.
My question(s):
- why was it necessary to do compressions?
- can an asthma attack stop heart rate if its too severe?
(If yes then it would answer the previous question)

A:

Asthma can lead to shortage of breath and in severe cases to death by suffocation (called asthmatic asphyxia). Failure of breathing inherently involves that the heart rate stops (called cardiac arrest).

A victim who is unresponsive and not breathing normally is in cardiac arrest and requires CPR.
European Resuscitation Council, New Guidelines 2015 p. 82

So, if the asthmatic victim did not breathe normally anymore (no regular breath in 10 seconds, ibid), they did everything right.
Even if they weren't sure whether the patient was still breathing, they did everything right:
