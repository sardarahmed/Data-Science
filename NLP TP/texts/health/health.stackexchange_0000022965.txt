Q:

Does hydroxychloroquine make tardive dyskinesia worse?

I found this article which suggests to me that chloroquine (hydroxychloroquine?) can make tardive dyskinesia worse. Is my reading of it accurate?

A:

The paper you reference postulates that this occurs in patients who have malaria

Another hypothesis is that the fever associated with malaria may directly decrease brain amines (norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin) because of the malaria-induced spike in temperature. Spikes in temperature can disrupt brain amine function (including synthesis and signaling activity) that can be further exacerbated by exposure to the antimalarials.82
