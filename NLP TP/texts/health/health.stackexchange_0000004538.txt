Q:

Epidemic and outbreak of Disease

What are the differences between an epidemic and an outbreak? Both words mean unexpected or unusual occurrence of the disease. Can someone explain the difference between them?

A:

As a practicing epidemiologist, I'm actually a little puzzled as to the down-votes for this. The difference between an outbreak and an epidemic is pretty subtle, and neither is all that terribly well defined.
The answer: There's not much of a difference.
The CDC agrees with me:

Occasionally, the amount of disease in a community rises above the
  expected level. Epidemic refers to an increase, often sudden, in the
  number of cases of a disease above what is normally expected in that
  population in that area. Outbreak carries the same definition of
  epidemic, but is often used for a more limited geographic area.

In practice, I'd argue that an outbreak is, as they mentioned, a somewhat smaller-scale phenomena. I'd talk about an outbreak of norovirus at a university, while I'd say a state, large city or country was having an epidemic. 
I'd also say that, for very low levels of disease, it's possible to have an outbreak without an epidemic. For example, in a paper I wrote, I characterized the cases of disease in a population as "Low-level endemic spread, punctuated by periodic, short-lived outbreaks". These outbreaks were on the scale of less than a dozen people, so I'd really have a hard time calling it an epidemic, but again, this is referencing the idea that "outbreak" refers to a somewhat smaller geographical scale.
