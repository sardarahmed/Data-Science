Q:

Is the Kawasaki disease related to COVID-19?

Could this child syndrome  have a link to COVID-19? 
Can we find any research that shows evidence?

It’s a new disease that we think may be caused by the COVID-19 virus — we’re not 100% sure because some of the people who got it hadn’t tested positive, so we’re doing a lot of research now but it is something we’re worried about. Although it is very significant for those children who do get it, the number of cases is small.” 
He also says: It’s an absolutely tiny number! I think the number of infected children is tiny anyway.

A:

The causes of Kawasaki disease/syndrome are not well understood.
Kawasaki involves inflammation of blood vessels, and is rare but almost exclusively found in young children.
There are media reports of associations of Kawasaki and COVID-19 but these are fairly early reports and it is unlikely (and I am unaware of any) that there are any sufficiently large samples of cases that have been organized to suggest a true causal role: these alerts are best directed towards physicians to be aware of the possibility when examining patients rather than to the general public.
