Q:

Why was orcein banned in Europe?

Orcein was long used as a food dye before it was banned in "Europe" in 1977, according to the Wikipedia. Of course, Europe is composed of many different countries, so the statement in the Wikipedia seems suspect. Also, no explanation for the alleged ban is provided either in the Wikipedia or any other readily available source that I can find. What was the rationale or specific study that led to its being "banned" and exactly how was it "banned" in Europe given that in 1977 Europe had something like 20 different countries with no central administration.

A:

Searching for Orcein on the EU website:

The article that discusses Orchil and Orcein (page 17)

claims that an ADI (Acceptable Daily Intake) could not be found (bottom of page 18), and then proceeds to outline the case for banning it.
