Q:

Are alternative sleep pattern viable?

I'm curious about possible health consequences of polyphasic sleep patterns, which involves sleeping multiple times in a 24-hour period — usually more than two, in contrast to getting all sleep in one block (monophasic). I'm interested in cases of more than just an afternoon nap.
Are there any studies that suggest possible risks or benefits to health regarding polyphasic sleep?

A:

Steve Pavlina did an experiment on himself for testing the Polyphasic Sleep. On his blog there is a lot of information about the experiment.

However, what is written on his blog is not scientific proof, but from his own perspective.
As he wrote on his blog:

This is a treasure trove of free information for anyone interested in learning about my trial of polyphasic sleep. To my knowledge these are the most detailed polyphasic sleep logs you’ll be able to find anywhere on the web.
