Q:

Any scientific evidence supporting positive effects from listening to binaural beats?

Is there any peer-reviewed scientific evidence supporting positive effects from listening to binaural beats?
If so, what types of binaural beats, and what were the positive effects?
Have any negative effects been documented?

A:

Is there any peer-reviewed scientific evidence supporting positive effects from listening to binaural beats?

Yes, several. Here are two RSS feeds, which will continuously update, with research articles on binaural beats:
PubMed RSS feed - PubMed (US National Library of Medicine) where "binaural beats" appears in the title or abstract of an article. ("binaural beats"[Title/Abstract]) 
Cochrane RSS feed - standard search for 'binaural beats'.
This is the only review article I could find:
Chaieb, L., Wilpert, E. C., Reber, T. P., & Fell, J. (2015). Auditory beat stimulation and its effects on cognition and mood states. Frontiers in Psychiatry, 6. https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2015.00070
I did not find any articles with a meta-analysis of the extant research.
Several very recent articles add to accumulating evidence for positive effects, under specific conditions, e.g., listening to 15 Hz binaural beats but not 5 Hz binaural beats, and with specific individuals, i.e., not every adult will respond in the same manner depending on several variables, many of which have not yet been delineated.

Individual Differences

Frontiers in Psychiatry, 6, 82. https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2015.00082 ("This suggests that the way in which cognitive-enhancement techniques, such as binaural beats, affect cognitive performance depends on inter-individual differences.")

If so, what types of binaural beats, and what were the positive effects?

Please see the articles listed in both RSS feeds. Answering your question with specificity would constitute a review article in itself. ;-)

Have any negative effects been documented?

Not in recent studies where the technique has become more refined based on previous findings. However, I would caution anyone from running out and buying an binaural beats app or the like, unless you know a lot about the topic; you trust the manufacturer; you do not have any potentially contraindicating audiological, psychiatric, neurological, or cognitive impairments or disorders; and you run it by your physician first.
