Q:

Italy’2017 (flu) vs. Italy’2020 (covid): what changed?

If I read Figure 2 of … the impact of influenza on excess mortality … correctly, the excess mortality due to flu
in Italy during the peak weeks of the flu epidemic of 2016–2017 was about 800 deaths/day.  This is way more than what is happening 
with Covid-19 now.  How come the health system is so stressed now?
Is it due to geographical distribution (Lombardy!) which Italy could not compensate by moving resources?  Or is it a different
distribution of deaths vs. being in intensive care?  Or what?

A:

The big difference in Italy today is that many younger, otherwise healthier patients need critical care and more generally that patients need critical care for a long time. These patients are not necessarily dying after they get care, but the extent to which the surviving patients require ventilators and supplemental oxygen is nothing like a seasonal flu and is likely inflating the death rate substantially among those who could otherwise be treated.

Contributing to the resource scarcity is the prolonged intubation many of these patients require as they recover from pneumonia — often 15 to 20 days of mechanical ventilation, with several hours spent in the prone position and then, typically, a very slow weaning. In the midst of the outbreak’s peak in northern Italy, as physicians struggled to wean patients off ventilators while others developed severe respiratory decompensation, hospitals had to lower the age cutoff — from 80 to 75 at one hospital, for instance.
