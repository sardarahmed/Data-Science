Q:

How would a global vaccination campaign stop COVID-19, rather than favor new mutation?

According to this report by Public Health England (p.35):

whilst vaccination may reduce an individualâ€™s overall risk of becoming
infected, once they are infected there is limited difference in viral
load (and Ct values) between those who are vaccinated and
unvaccinated. Given they have similar Ct values, this suggests limited
difference in infectiousness.

If this is true, how would vaccination help stop the virus?
Logic would suggest just the opposite: since vaccination does not decrease significantly infectiousness, chances for new (possibly deadlier) mutations to arise should increase.
Could someone explain which piece of data I'm missing?

A:

As you note in your quote "vaccination may reduce [data shows it does, substantially] an individual's overall risk of becoming infected". If an individual is not infected, they are not infectious and do not spread the virus. New mutations arise in proportion to the number of people infected, so if fewer people become infected (due to the vaccine), fewer new variants are generated.
Here's one study that found "CDC COVID-19 Study Shows mRNA Vaccines Reduce Risk of Infection by 91 Percent for Fully Vaccinated People" CDC press release at https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/p0607-mrna-reduce-risks.html
Study is "Prevention and Attenuation of COVID-19 by BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 Vaccines" doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.01.21257987
Exposure to COVID would be whatever mix of variants were circulating where and when they did the tests. The test population of health workers is described in the scientific paper as being from 8 locations (roughly half in Arizona). Data was collected from mid-December 2020 through mid-April 2021. "Of 93 genetically sequenced viruses, 10 were variants of concern (8 B.1.429, 1 B.1.1.7, 1 B.1.427) and 1 was a variant of interest (P.2) (Table_S3)"
This is of course just one study, but illustrates the concept of protection against infection.
