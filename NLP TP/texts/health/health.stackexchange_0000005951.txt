Q:

Even topical tetracycline causes teeth discoloration?

I learned that tetracycline can cause tooth discoloratoin when taken orally. How about topical use as a creme? Can tetracycline also stain the tooth through skin absorption?

A:

Unlikely. 

Tetracycline topical is generally well tolerated. Side effects
  reported with systemic administered tetracycline such as
  gastrointestinal complaints, vaginitis, hematologic abnormalities,
  dental, and skeletal disorders have not been reported and are unlikely
  to occur with topical administration.

However,

A faint yellowing of the skin has been reported, especially around the
  hair roots

This link agrees with the above.
