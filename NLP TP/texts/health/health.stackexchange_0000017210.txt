Q:

How to deal with conflicting health advice?

With all the information on health how can I know who is accurate?
Healthline ( 7 ) claims that saturated fat is not bad for you while Harvard ( 6 ) claims it is a bad fat.

A:

The best method to verify the autenticity of a scientific news, is to search authorized papers about the subject.
You can find all the published papers on this website: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
Here, and especially on "PubMed" and "PubMed Central (PMC)" (both within ncbi.gov) you can search for a topic and a lot of papers will be shown. Then look for the most recent one, since sometimes newer reviews discover something important. 
In your case, this can be a good starting point.
