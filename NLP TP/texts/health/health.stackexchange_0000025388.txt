Q:

Why Herpes Vaccine Hasn't Been Discovered Yet While Corona Vaccines Find Its Way Within A Year?

There is one question constantly running in my mind: how were COVID-19 vaccines discovered in a very short time span, but Herpes did not find its way even after years of painstaking research?

A:

Two things that come to mind:

Unlike COVID-19, the herpes virus does not completely shut down society. So there's much more incentive and hence funding to finding a vaccine for COVID-19.
We already have researched (but not completed) vaccines for other corona-type diseases like SARS and MERS, and luckily this knowledge helped in accelerating the process of finding a vaccine for COVID-19. See e.g. the recently published article 'Coronavirus vaccine development: from SARS and MERS to COVID-19'.
