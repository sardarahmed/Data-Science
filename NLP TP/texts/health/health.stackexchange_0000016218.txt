Q:

Brown vs White rice

Background
Looking at this wikipedia article about rice, I was suprised (I'm quite ignorant) that difference between brown and white rice is process-based. White rice is brown rice without bran, and both of them are chaffless rice.
What seems strange to me is that white rice is so popular, being that wikipedia article about rice shows a Brown vs White rice table and brown rice seems a healthier food, respect to nutrition values.
Question
As white rice is so popular I wonder, and ask you, are there any health benefits to avoid brown rice?

A:

The main reasons why brown rice is less popular than white are not likely related to health concerns but to the facts that it is:

More expensive, at most places
Relatively less available in the stores
More rough to eat
Less appropriate to make certain meals with it, especially the ones with sugar
Less durable: it has much shorter shelf life (brown rice: 6-8 months; white rice: 4-5 years) (EatByDate) 

It is like why whole-grain bread is less popular than white.
Brown rice may contain 80% more arsenic than white rice. One 2017 study found an association between rice (and hence arsenic) consumption and increased prevalence of diabetes mellitus in some Asian countries.
Some people could be allergic to certain substances in brown rice, but I have found no evidence this would be especially common.
