Q:

Is there an accepted way to remove a tonsilloliths at home?

Are there any safe, medically accepted ways to remove tonsilloliths (tonsil stones) from your mouth at home? Should I instead go to a doctor to get it removed?

A:

I found these water injectors on Amazon which squirt a thin stream of water for several dozen seconds and have a curved tip that can reach back into the crevices of tonsils. I was able to remove several of the tonsilliths. The tips are slightly rough but I suppose they can be cut or filed. Shining a flashlight with the other hand lets you see what you are doing. I had hoped for a vacuum solution but this seems to work for less money. Just take a deep breath and hold your breath while doing it.
