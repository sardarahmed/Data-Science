Q:

Is E. coli contagious?

I have a girl that I'm seeing. She was just in the hospital about 2 weeks ago with an internal E.coli infection in her kidney (she had the other kidney removed due to cancer). She has been given a ton of antibiotics because it was a very strong strain and it took her quite a bit of treatment to get over it. 
Is E. coli contagious? Am I putting myself at any risk with dating activities like kissing, oral sex, sex, etc? I really didn't know you could get E. coli in your kidneys and I have no idea what that means for me as her partner. 

A:

Yes, E. coli  is definitely contagious through direct contact. In fact your girlfriend's pyelonephritis could have come from you after sexual intercourse.
The general mechanism for this would be that you had the pathogenic E. coli on your penis, and then it traveled up her urethra to the kidney.  This is why there is a recommendation for women to urinate after sex.  That very same E. coli on your penis is unlikely to cause you an infection.
Note that E. coli is common in the GI tract, and not uncommonly found on the skin.  Not all strains are pathogenic  and most aren't within the GI tract. Having a conversation as a couple with a health provider is a very good idea.
There is a lot of hygiene that everyone sexually active should consider, but is unfortunately not taught.
