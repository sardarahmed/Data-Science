Q:

Is cannabidiol safe to treat depression of a patient with a schizoaffective disorder?

According to wikipedia CBD might be useful as an antidepresant:

"CBD has been shown to act as a serotonin 5-HT1A receptor partial
  agonist,[33] and this action may be involved in its
  antidepressant,[34][35] anxiolytic,[35][36] and neuroprotective
  effects."
Cannabidiol, Wikipedia

Could it be harmful for a schizoaffective or a schizophrenic?
Does it interact negatively at dopamine or other routes that can worsen such a condition?  

A:

First of all, you have to be aware that most studies cited are on animals, not humans. Applicability of that data for humans is limited.
Second, this molecule is interacting with all kinds of tissues thoughout the entire body. Its pharmacology is quite complicated, but it shows a lot of potential.  In general. Its use for depression is not yet among the most promonent applications investigated.

In the case of schizophrenia:

Conclusions:
These findings suggest that CBD has beneficial effects in patients with schizophrenia. As CBD’s effects do not appear to depend on dopamine receptor antagonism, this agent may represent a new class of treatment for the disorder.

The above should not read as "it safe to experiment with this in schizophrenia". But it is a significant finding as

So far, much of the evidence regarding the antipsychotic effects of CBD has come from studies with animals or healthy participants.
  There have only been a handful of double-blind trials so far reported that have included patients with psychosis.
  The others (Leweke et al. 2012, Boggs et al. 2018) featured smaller sample sizes (N=42 and N=36 respectively) and lower doses (800mg and 600mg per day respectively).
  Leweke et al. compared CBD to Amisulpride, and found both had a similar effect on psychotic symptoms but CBD had fewer side-effects.
  Boggs et al. also tested CBD against placebo as an adjunct to existing antipsychotic treatment, but found no statistically significant effect after 6 weeks.
