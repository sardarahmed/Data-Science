Q:

RDA of protein vs amino acids

As a 180 pound male I find the RDA for the essential amino acids total 17.5 grams.  However, the RDA for protein is 64.8 grams.  Where does this nearly 4x difference come from?

A:

In the human body, there are 21 amino acids (AA) that can form proteins (Britannica). Only 9 of them are essential, meaning you have to obtain them from food; the other 12 can be synthesized in your body (MedlinePlus). 
Most food proteins contain most essential and nonessential AA, so to get 17.5 g of essential AA from proteins, you need to consume more than 17.5 g of them. Anyway, 65 g of protein (RDA) will probably provide more than 17.5 g of essential AA, because RDA does not include only the essential amount of protein but a bigger amount with a wide safe margin.
