Q:

For a purpose of a clinical study, what is considered to be a cardiovascular death?

In the FOURIER study (to lower cholesterol with PCSK9), there is a significant reduction in different types of cardiovascular events (MI and Stroke) in the treatment group and yet the total cardiovascular mortality has not decreased compared to placebo (page 6 of pdf). What kind of other conditions/diagnoses could account for the extra deaths in the treatment group from 'Cardiovascular death' that compensates for MI and stroke?

A:

Cardiovascular death is a general term meaning death caused by anything involving the heart or blood vessels. I can't find and don't think there exists a formal definition. Aside from stroke and MI, the major examples would be:

Sudden cardiac arrest 
Pulmonary embolism
Congestive heart failure
Lethal arrhythmias
Aortic dissection
Myocardial rupture
Cardiac tamponade
