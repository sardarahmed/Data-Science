Q:

Is it possible for humans to be resistant to certain viral infections without having specific antibodies in their blood?

Popular understanding of how viruses work split immunity into four categories:

Virus doesn't affect humans at all
No immunity - will get worst possible infection, seems to be the case with COVID-19
Partial immunity - you get sick, but it won't kill you - happens with flu mutations
Full immunity - very hard to get sick - measles is an example

For #2 and #3 we could expect to find antibodies in the bloodstream proving that this person has partial or full immunity. But is it possible for some people to be resistant to a virus without having the corresponding antibodies in their bloodstream? And if so, how could their immunity be proven?

A:

Antibody production is part of the adaptive immune response but the first line of protection against viruses and bacteria is the innate immune response which is cell based, and involves the release of cytokines, interferons, as well as direct cellular attack of infected cells.
Interestingly a recent study showed that some younger patients with milder symptoms had very low to neglible neutralizing antibody production after confirmed Covid-19 suggesting that their innate immunity was primarily responsible for fighting the virus.

Huang said 10 of the patients in the study had an antibody presence so low it could not even be detected in the laboratory.
These patients experienced typical Covid-19 symptoms including fever, chill and a cough, but might have beaten back the virus with other parts of the immune system such as T-cells or cytokines.
