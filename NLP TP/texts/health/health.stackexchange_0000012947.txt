Q:

What is the difference between soda water and water?

Assuming both water and soda water come from the same tap water source, and the soda water does not have any additives or flavoring. (aka not pop) 
What effect would soda water have on the human body compared to plain water?

A:

Chemically speaking, carbonated water is just plain water with carbon dioxide dissolved in it under high pressure. 

It hydrates just as well as normal water, because it still contains plain H2O. 
There are no additives.
It might have a slightly larger effect on erosion of teeth than normal water because it is just a little bit acidic.
The effect on the gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is little to none.
