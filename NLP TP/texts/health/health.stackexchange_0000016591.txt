Q:

Does calculus also prevent caries?

Calculus is a mix of minerals (calcium and phosphate) and organic material. This organic material consists of bacteria which cause caries, due to their acid waste products.
Is it possible that in calculus these bacteria can be fossilated by adoption/exchange of minerals?
If that is the case could this calculus form a layer around the teeth so that it prevents the bacteria in the dental plaque from causing caries?

A:

Yes, the presence of calculus prevent the demineralization of the surface of the tooth. This is a common finding during routine scaling or calculus removal, where usually the underlying enamel is intact. 
Also, there is a paper about this issue: Evidence for putting the calculus: caries inverse relationship to work who found

caries prevalence is highly significantly lower in calculus-prone than in calculus-free subjects

You can found the detailed explanation on the Fejerskov's Textbook of Dental Caries, and the principal ideal is: if you have calculus means that the intraoral enviroment is saturated with minerals and with pH levels above 5.0, hence demineralization of enamel is very difficult if not not feasible at all.
