Q:

Does early exposure protect against developing allergies later on in life?

I recently read a few papers (here and  here) that concluded that children exposed to peanuts before 1 year of age were less likely to develop peanut allergies later in life than children who were not exposed to peanuts.
Is this backed up by further evidence? If so, is there evidence that exposing children to other potential allergens (eggs, dogs, etc) can reduce the chance of them developing allergies to those things in the future?

A:

Peanuts and Peanut Allergies
It was advised that Peanuts were not to be eaten during pregnancy due to possible allergy issues, but it is no longer the case.

You can eat peanuts or food containing peanuts, such as peanut butter, during pregnancy, unless you're allergic to them or a health professional advises you not to.
You may have heard peanuts should be avoided during pregnancy. This is because the government previously advised women to avoid eating peanuts if there was a history of allergy – such as asthma, eczema, hay fever and food allergy – in their child's immediate family.
This advice has now changed because the latest research has shown no clear evidence that eating peanuts during pregnancy affects the chances of your baby developing a peanut allergy.

For peanut allergies, there is a therapy called Probiotic and Peanut Oral ImmunoTherapy (PPOIT) and a study published in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health suggests that it can help for upto 4 years (Hsiao et al., 2017)

48 (86%) of 56 eligible participants were enrolled in the follow-up study. Mean time since stopping treatment was 4·2 years in both PPOIT (SD 0·6) and placebo (SD 0·7) participants. Participants from the PPOIT group were significantly more likely than those from the placebo group to have continued eating peanut (16 [67%] of 24 vs one [4%] of 24; absolute difference 63% [95% CI 42–83], p=0·001; number needed to treat 1·6 [95% CI 1·2–2·4]). Four PPOIT-treated participants and six placebo participants reported allergic reactions to peanut after intentional or accidental intake since stopping treatment, but none had anaphylaxis.

Other Allergies
As stated in my comment a while ago, there was an article I saw about allergies in general, which stated that there seems to be a rise in the numbers of people suffering from allergies and there is a hypothesis that this is due to the sterility of the environment compared to the past.  I cannot find the article I was thinking of, but the linked Wikipedia page provides information on this with citations.

In medicine, the hygiene hypothesis is a hypothesis that states a lack of early childhood exposure to infectious agents, symbiotic microorganisms (such as the gut flora or probiotics), and parasites increases susceptibility to allergic diseases by suppressing the natural development of the immune system. In particular, the lack of exposure is thought to lead to defects in the establishment of immune tolerance.
The hygiene hypothesis has also been called the "biome depletion theory" and the "lost friends theory" [1].

Although the idea that exposure to certain infections may decrease the risk of allergy is not new, Strachan was one of the first to formally propose it, in an article published in the British Medical Journal in 1989. [21]

[with reducing modern practices of cleanliness and hygiene, there is] a significant amount of evidence that it would increase the risks of infectious diseases. [8]

Biological Basis

Allergic conditions are caused by inappropriate immunological responses to harmless antigens driven by a TH2-mediated immune response, TH2 cells produce interleukin 4, interleukin 5, interleukin 6, interleukin 13 and predominantly immunoglobulin E. Many bacteria and viruses elicit a TH1-mediated immune response, which down-regulates TH2 responses.(Source)

Epidemiological evidence
Epidemiological data supports the hygiene hypothesis

Studies have shown that various immunological and autoimmune diseases are much less common in the developing world than the industrialized world and that immigrants to the industrialized world from the developing world increasingly develop immunological disorders in relation to the length of time since arrival in the industrialized world.[11] This is true for asthma[40] and other chronic inflammatory disorders.[5]
...
In developed countries where childhood diseases were eliminated, the asthma rate for youth is approximately 10%. In the 19th century, hay-fever, an easily recognisable allergy, was a very rare condition.[42]

Treatments
As with Peanut Allergies, Allergen Immunotherapy, also known as desensitisation or hypo-sensitisation, is a medical treatment for some types of allergies.

Immunotherapy involves exposing people to larger and larger amounts of allergen in an attempt to change the immune system's response.[1]
Meta-analyses have found that injections of allergens under the skin are effective in the treatment in allergic rhinitis in children[3][4] and in asthma.[2] The benefits may last for years after treatment is stopped.[5] It is generally safe and effective for allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, allergic forms of asthma, and stinging insects.[6] The evidence also supports the use of sublingual immunotherapy against rhinitis and asthma, but it is less strong.[5] In this form the allergen is given under the tongue and people often prefer it to injections.[5] Immunotherapy is not recommended as a stand-alone treatment for asthma.[5]
