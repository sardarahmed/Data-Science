Q:

Can brushing teeth to hard cause the gums to retract?

I started to notice that the gums around some of my teeth start to retract. Fortunately, this does not give me any discomforts and nothing looks like inflammation. But I suppose that â‰ˆ 0.3mm - 0.5mm of exposed tooth isn't normal.
Can brushing my teeth to hard cause my gums to retract? Some info about me and my habits:

I use a regular toothbrush. Not electric
I often notice I'm brushing quite harsh and often have to pace myself
Never had any dental problems in my life (I'm 24)
The affected teeth are all on the 'corners'. I'm not a native English speaker so I hope you understand what I mean by this
I smoke but never, apart from messing up my lungs, had any related health issues

A:

Yes, according to the article bellow:

But too much brushing, with bad technique, can cause other problems. "People think if they brush hard and thoroughly they are doing a good job, but you can wear away your gums and tooth surface. People think receding gums are a sign of gum disease, but it's often a sign of too much scrubbing."
