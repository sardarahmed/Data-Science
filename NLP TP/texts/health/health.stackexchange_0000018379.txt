Q:

Can you prevent skin tags?

Skin tags, formally known as acrochordons, are small pieces of flesh that protrude from your skin.
You’ll know it’s different from a wart or mole because of its pedestal base. Warts are flat on top and go deeper into the skin, but a little ball of skin dangling from the surface is a skin tag.
The prevalence of skin tags seems to increase with age (Banik & Lubach, 1987) and it has been reported that they are markers for colonic polyps (Leavitt, et al. 1983)
What are the causes of skin tags, how are they formed and can you prevent them?

CAUSES and RISK FACTORS of skin tags
In general, the exact cause and therefore prevention of skin tags is not known (Emedicine). In some cases, skin tags could be associated with the following conditions:

Skin aging and skin irritation due to obesity (Emedicine)
Diabetes type 2, especially if accompanied with metabolic syndrome (obesity, hyperglycemia, high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels) (PubMed, 2014)
Human papillomavirus infection - a sexually transmitted disease (PubMed, 2008)
Crohn's disease (PubMed, 2016)
Acromegaly or gigantism - increased growth due to increased levels of the growth hormone (PubMed, 2006)
Genetic predisposition, Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome and Nonne-Milroy-Meiges syndrome (PubMed, 2015)

SKIN TAGS AS MARKERS OF COLONIC POLYPS
Studies and reviews that have found no association between skin tags and colonic polyps: PubMed, 1993, PubMed, 1989 and PubMed, 2016.
Some small studies have found some association between skin tags and colonic polyps: Annals of Internal Medicine, 1983, PubMed, 1986. The association may be coincidental, since the prevalence of skin tags can be as high as 46% (Emedicine).
PREVENTION of skin tags can include losing weight (if necessary), avoiding skin irritation, avoiding sexually transmitted diseases and treating eventual underlying disorders. 
Skin tags do not likely develop into skin cancers (Stat Pearls).
A dermatologist can REMOVE skin tags if necessary; the growths usually do not recur (University of Missouri).
