Q:

How much music listening is harmless using earphones?

With Smart phones, we can always be connected and can consume media both Audio and video, almost all day without any interruption.
Generally, when people listen to music, its always with earphones plugged-into ears. A common use case is when commuting we always listen to music with earphones.
My Question is: How much music one should listen with plugged-in earphones in a day, without causing ear/organ damage? Looking for a general medical advice here for healthy ear functioning yet consuming favorite music? 

A:

You should not listen to music at 85 decibels for more than 8 hours. And if it's at 88 decibels limit your time to 4 hours. 
To judge this you have to use decibels:
Livescience.com

A person exposed to noise levels at 85 decibels or higher for a
  prolonged period of time is at risk for hearing loss

You shouldn't listen to music , or be exposed to any noise, at 85
  decibels for more than 8 hours at a time, said Gordon Hughes, program
  officer of clinical trials at the National Institute on Deafness and
  Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD). If you've got the volume
  cranked to 88 decibels, then cut your listening time down to 4 hours.

At its loudest, an MP3 player pumps out 105 decibels that's100 times
  more intense than 85 decibels

"One way you can tell if your music is too loud is if you're talking
  to a friend and you have to raise your voice to be heard," Hughes
  said. Normal conversation is around 60 decibels

You can find how may decibels your listening at by going online or looking at your manual for your device. This is more acurate as all devices are different. If that doesnt tell you there are apps and other devices.
