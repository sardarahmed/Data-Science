Q:

A recent Israeli study found the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to have only 64% efficacy against the Delta strain - is that with full vaccination?

The numbers from Israel (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-05/israel-sees-decline-in-pfizer-vaccine-efficacy-rate-ynet-says) indicate the Pfizer vaccine is quickly losing efficacy against the Delta strain with only 64% chance to prevent symptomatic infection - but critically, none of these articles covering that report indicate if that's for full 2-dose vaccination.
Another recent study "showed the Pfizer vaccine was 84% effective against the [Delta] variant after two doses, but only 34% effective after the first dose." (https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/pfizer-moderna-jj-vaccines-efficacy-as-delta-variant-concerns-rise/2419162/). The effectiveness rating appears to be the chance to prevent symptoms.
A slightly earlier article (https://www.businessinsider.com/delta-coronavirus-variant-strongest-threat-vaccinated-people-2021-6) places Pfizer efficacy at >= 88% chance to prevent symptoms with full vaccination, but only 33% for partial vaccination.
Intuitively, the numbers from Israel seem to be an outlier. The critical question: Does that statistic mix full vaccination and partial vaccination?
If the numbers are mixed, that would explain why the efficacy was found to be roughly halfway between partial and full (since some people already had 2 doses while others have only 1). If the numbers are for full vaccination... then it's time to talk about booster shots.

A:

The New York Times (https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/07/06/world/covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-updates) presents several studies indicating good 2-dose protection against symptomatic infection: Britain and Canada reporting 87-88%, and Scotland reporting 79%.
A recent report from Israel claims only 64% protection, but that report is heavily marred by lack of transparency: According to Forbes (https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2021/07/06/pfizer-shot-much-less-effective-against-delta-israel-study-shows---heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-variants-and-vaccines/), "Israelâ€™s health ministry has not revealed the data or the methodology it used to obtain its results."
Therefore, the most logical conclusion at this time is that full mRNA vaccination continues to provide superior protection, probably in the 80%-90% range. The 64% number should be rejected as a dubious outlier until more transparency is provided.
Updating answer with new data recently in - an article presenting data from the New England Journal of Medicine. The numbers are 88% protection from 2-dose Pfizer vs. Delta (consistent with the above consensus), 67% protection from 2-dose AstraZeneca vs. Delta.

The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, confirms
headline findings given by Public Health England in May about the
efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and
Oxford-AstraZeneca (AZN.L), based on real-world data.
Wednesday's study found that two doses of Pfizer's shot was 88%
effective at preventing symptomatic disease from the Delta variant,
compared to 93.7% against the Alpha variant, broadly the same as
previously reported.
Two shots of AstraZeneca vaccine were 67% effective against the Delta
variant, up from 60% originally reported, and 74.5% effective against
the Alpha variant, compared to an original estimate of 66%
effectiveness.
