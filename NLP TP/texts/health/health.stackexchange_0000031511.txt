Q:

How well is the brain protected from physical hits ? Can small hits or blows cause brain damage?

Small punches like Diaz does to himself here :

I am just curious about how hard must a punch be to cause even light brain damage or IQ loss.

A:

Yes, the brain is well-protected from physical hits. The skull and scalp protect the brain from direct blows, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cushioning system protects it from jarring forces. However, even a hit that doesn't result in a full-blown concussion can cause injury to the brain.
The severity of a brain injury depends on many factors, including the force or impact of the blow, where on the head it lands, and how fast and hard the head is moving at the time of impact. Brain injuries can range from mild (where symptoms disappear within a few days or weeks) to severe (leading to permanent disability or death).
