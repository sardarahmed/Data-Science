Q:

Why are corticosteroids not used in the treatment of pneumonia?

Common sense made me think of the need for inflammation reduction in case of pneumonia and the anti-inflammatory characteristics of inhaled corticosteroids. I Googled and found a study1 from 2017 that suggests that corticosteroids might indeed reduce inflammation in severe pneumonia. But it seems that as far as I could find and also from what I understand from a befriended general practitioner the use of inhaled corticosteroids for pneumonia isn't common practice, if ever used at all. Why is this?
Specifically in the case of pneumonia I would think that inhaling any medicine with anti-inflammatory properties such as corticosteroids is potentially the best possible way to get the medicine where you want it to be, in the lungs. Is there a reason why inhaled corticosteroids aren't used (in addition) for treatment of pneumonia?

A:

It would seem that the evidence is that (injected) corticosteroids don't help much unless the disease is severe (septic shock) and/or has a high inflammatory response, in which case there is some evidence to suggest that they do help, but otherwise no benefit.
As to why they don't use inhaled - I don't know. Perhaps because we already have very effective drugs (e.g. salbutamol) for this, which don't have the longer term dependence/weaning problems that corticosteroids do.
