Q:

Why do some medication package inserts suggest talking to a doctor instead of providing advice?

Can someone help me to understand why that information is printed

If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, or think you may be pregnant, or If you are planning to become pregnant, ask your doctor before taking this medicine or pharmacist for advice.

in package inserts of some medicines? What could a small doctor know more about that medicine, what the manufacturer could not know about their own product?
For me it is a useless information which takes space and time of each consumer to read. Why is it there?

A:

The simplest answer is that the information won't fit on the insert. There are tradeoffs and decisions to be made. Some medications are just "don't take if you're pregnant" or "this is fine when you're pregnant" while others are not. It depends how far along you are, what conditions you have, what will happen if you don't take the medication, whether you plan to take one or two doses and no more, or several times a day for months, and so on. They can't print a whole flowchart of how to decide.
Another answer is that the manufacturers literally do not know, because they didn't study their drug in pregnancy. They don't want to take responsibility for advising you with nothing to base it on, so they hand off to the doctor to give you advice.
