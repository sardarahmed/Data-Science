Q:

Risks for VBAC vs repeat Cesarean

When discussing a possible vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC), healthcare professionals often cite the risk of uterine rupture during VBAC as a motivation for repeat Cesarean.  This is however only one of multiple risks associated with either procedure.
Taking all risks into account, what is the combined risk of death or serious injury for a repeat cesarean (for completeness sake, only second cs) as compared to a VBAC (VBA1C), for an otherwise uncomplicated pregnancy (e.g. no pre-eclampsia, diabetes, etc.)?

A:

This question is difficult to answer because risk discussions are individualized.  Instead of answering, I will point you to reliable resources to guide your discussion with your OB.  
One great source of pooled evidence is UpToDate. I would also recommend reading articles from ACOG and AAFP, professional organizations that are going to be impartial as opposed to agenda-driven topical websites.
BUT the ultimate risks/benefits discussion and ultimate decision MUST be held between you and your provider. We cannot provide that for you.
I would recommend reading up through reputable websites like these, then taking the information and your questions to your OB GYN and tell them you are having trouble understanding.  If they are unable to explain something like that to you, perhaps it is best for you to find a different OB GYN who can connect better with you.
