Q:

Why is the exterior part of my left foot Toe is ALWAYS in pain

i've always experienced a little pain in this area : 

but lately it became REALLY painful specially after wearing shoes for few hours, and the slightest hit on it really causes a lot pf pain.
notes:

there is no weird color
there is no "yellow/white liquid" coming out of it (dont know its name)
it is slightly "inflated", like a liiitle bit compared to other toe.
I am 23 years old, male. 
I am really picky with shoes and i choose the most comfortable ones (Sport Nike shoes) and my right foot totally agree with that.

PS : 
Am currently on vacation out of the country so i cant visit doctors, i just want some insights/advice please
thanks a lot

A:

I had a similar issue, which turned out to be pretty simple: I had missed a part of my toenail when trimming it.

The part wasn't actually visible as I've drawn it hereâ€”it was in between the skin there. As the toenail grew, that part began to painfully poke into the skin, especially when wearing shoes.
The pain disappeared immediately on trimming off this part:

Reaching all that way in to the edge of the nail was difficult with ordinary nail clippers (which is why I had missed it), but much easier with nail scissors:
