Q:

What is the best way to obtain pure drinking water in the U S?

Tap water is awful in the U S. I am looking for a way to drink pure drinking water. I researched many options 

carbon filters is a basic option . However they do not remove fluoride 
distilled water is not healthy 
reverse osmosis water is not healthy 

How to organize a daily supply of pure drinking water? 

A:

Mineral water from a glass bottle can have a good taste, is clean and does not contain fluoride (or far less than tap water).
It is sodium in mineral water that is most responsible for its (good) taste. Different brands contain different (small) amounts of sodium, mostly in the range 50-200 mg/liter.
You do not need to seek for "healthy minerals" (calcium, magnesium) in water because you usually get them in greater amounts from foods.
Here on USDA is a list of about 100 brands of mineral waters with nutrition facts, here is one example: 330 mg Ca, 110 mg Mg, 130 mg Na per liter.
Distilled water contains no minerals, so it does not have any taste. Reverse osmosis water is pretty much the same.
