Q:

What are the reasons for developing the wrinkles in the eyes? Is sun exposure an important cause?

Some people develop these before compared to their counterparts. Does the geography has an important effect, because of a sun exposure?

A:

Skin wrinkles are generally caused by a breakdown of the collagen framework within the skin.

Collagen is a key part of your skin's structure. It forms a network of fibers within your skin that acts like a framework.
In young skin, the collagen framework is intact and the skin remains moisturized and elastic. Over time, the support structure weakens and the skin loses its elasticity. The skin begins to lose its tone as the collagen support wears down.
