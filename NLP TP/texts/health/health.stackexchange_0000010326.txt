Q:

How a person with high eye pressure see? Would you give me pictures?

After asking this question:
How can I describe my eye weakness (disease) to a doctor?
I went to an occultist. He said that my eye sight is 6/6 (good) and eye bottom is good healthy too. He did not check my eye pressure and said I'm OK generally. I sitll have bad vision with my right eye.
I went to other two oculists, They said I've an issue with eye pressure and I've to check my field of vision.
Now, I would like you to send my some picture about how a person who have an issue with eye pressure see the world? 
It would be very very useful for me to describe my issue? 
Maybe I see something like white/Gray spot or cloud?! ... Anyway, I can not describe. Please, Help me by sending the pictures if you have one. 
Thank you very much,
