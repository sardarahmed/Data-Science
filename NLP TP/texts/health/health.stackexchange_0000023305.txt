Q:

Alternatives other than face-mask-respirators for protection against COVID-19

Could someone please tell me if these alternatives can also protect one against being infected by COVID-19 virus, when being outside (in grocery stores, markets, etc)?
If yes, how much of protection will they provide?
A professional face-mask-respirator can give us 99.97% of protection, what percentage can give us the other alternatives like the ones shown below?

Or if you know about other alternatives to protect oneself from getting infected when being outside, please share them.
Thanks in advance

A:

Those are face shields to prevent primarily droplets reaching the eyes, and are worn as being more comfortable than goggles to protect the mucous membranes of the eyes, and they don't fog up like goggles can.  However, they don't protect against droplet nuclei which float in the air, and there is no regulated design.

Face shields are PPE that are commonly used as barrier protection for infection control purposes by numerous workers. There currently is no standard regarding face/eye protection from biological hazards and this deficit needs to be remedied as quickly as possible. Due to the lack of a good facial seal peripherally that can allow for aerosol penetration, face shields should not be used as solitary face/eye protection, but rather as adjunctive to other PPE (protective facemasks, goggles, etc.). Given the dearth of available data regarding the appropriate use of face shields for infection control, scientifically sound research needs to be conducted on the use of this form of PPE.
