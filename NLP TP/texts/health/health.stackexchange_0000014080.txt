Q:

Which part of the body has the most nerve receptors?

I am studying a non-medical field so please bear with me.
Which part of the flat skin has the most nerve receptors?
I plan to build a grid of vibrators.

A:

If we are talking about Tactile corpuscle or Meissner's corpuscles and Lamellar corpuscle it would be the  fingertips followed by lips.
I did not find a reference in English, only a German:

Die Fingerspitzen weisen die höchste Rezeptorendichte auf. Damit wird Begreifen möglich.
Lang, Phillip, Lang, Florian: Basiswissen Physiology, Springer-Verlag, 2007; Seite 376
The fingertips have the highest density of receptors. This is why grasping is possible.
Translation into English

The all over highest density in receptors can be found in the Fovea centralis.
