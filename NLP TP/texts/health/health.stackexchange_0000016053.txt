Q:

Optimum / limit daily dose of Vitamin C?

The National Institutes of Health's Office of Dietary Supplements states that the recommended daily amount of Vitamin C for an adult male is 90 mg. The highest recommended dose is 120 mg for breastfeeding women. The upper limit does of Vitamin C for adults is 2,000 mg.
The book "Prescription for Natural Healing" (5th ed.), however, recommends an optimum daily intake of 1,000 to 3,000 mg of "Vitamin C with mineral ascorbates (Ester-C)". I don't have much experience with the book and I'm trying to gauge how helpful it is.
Am I right to see a conflict here? Or are they talking about different things? Is this really as simple as the book making a wildly bad recommendation, or is there reason to think a higher dose is good?

A:

Here are few aspects of high-dose vitamin C supplements.
The upper limit(UL) 2,000 mg for vitamin C is not some sort of recommendation, but a dose, which, if exceeded, can cause nausea and diarrhea, for example.
Does it make sense to take vitamin C supplements?
Vitamin C supplements can correct vitamin C deficiency and improve the absorption of iron from plant foods. But there is no convincing evidence that vitamin C would help to prevent or treat common cold, cancer, heart disease, stroke or age-related macular degeneration.
Are higher doses more effective?
Approximately 70%–90% of vitamin C is absorbed at moderate intakes of 30–180 mg/day. However, at doses above 1 g/day, absorption falls to less than 50% and absorbed, unmetabolized ascorbic acid is excreted in the urine.
There is no convincing evidence that high-dose (oral) vitamin C would prevent or treat cancer or other diseases.
Can high-dose vitamin C be dangerous?
High-dose vitamin C might increase the risk of oxalate kidney stones in some individuals.
