Q:

What type of food (herb, root) helps with sleep?

Right now it's 3am local time.
Ideally I'd like to follow a protocol that would put me into sleep.
I've just had a juicy pear - it contains sugar that gives energy etc... From that standpoint it wasn't a great choice if I want go to sleep.
What are the foods, herbs, roots that are known for sleep-inducing properties?

A:

As an insomniac, I've looked into this myself, and found the following to be natural sleep-inducing foods (in no particular order): 

Cherries -- The tarter, the better. They have melatonin!! And they are great for desert. 
Chamomile Tea -- apparently it contains the chemical glycine, which helps relax muscles and nerves. 
Honey -- the natural sugar of honey helps the insulin levels to raise quickly so the tryptophan (the chemical in Turkey that makes people sleepy after a Thanksgiving meal) can enter the brain easier and help you fall asleep! Plus... it goes well with the Chammomile Tea! 
Almonds -- have lots of magnesium in it, and magnesium contributes to quality sleep. Also, try warm almond milk... 
Walnuts -- Like cherries, walnuts, also are chalk full of melatonin. 
Oatmeal -- Oats also have melatonin in them, but it also has B-6 in it which makes you relax as well. 2 components!

**Unlike Prince, I have not found tomatoes good for sleep. I finds tomatoes or tomato based foods to be too acidic for bed time and it gives me acid-reflux. But I guess it all depends on you and your body!  
Good Night!
