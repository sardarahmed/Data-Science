Q:

What is the distance the COVID-19 virus can travel in the air out of doors and remain infectious for someone breathing the same air?

I edited my question after doing some research. I also edited the question to include phrase "out of door". When indoors the risk is increased considerable with stale air or air that has been circulated from another area that may have the virus. I edited the question to be more specific although it may still need improvement. I am also not sure of the tags.
The measles can be transmitted up to 30 meters and remain airborne up to 2 hours thus far COVID-19 remains I believe an open issue.

A:

According to this March 2020 article, "no studies have directly evaluated the biophysics of droplets and gas cloud formation for patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus". But the author, MIT Prof Lydia Bourouiba, says exhalations can cause gaseous clouds that travel up to 27 feet.
