Q:

What are some healthy food to eat in between meals when a person gets hungry?

For some reason, I get hungry pretty fast. This leads to unhealthy behaviour of eating snacks to keep the hunger away. What are some healthy food to eat in between meals to ward off hunger?

A:

It depends what your definition of healthy is really. If you're looking for something low calorie, I would suggest a large bowl of steamed vegetables. If you heavily season them avoiding salt if you can - think pepper and paprika, they are surprisingly delicious. 
Just cook frozen vegetables like brocoli, corn or peas in a bowl. You can buy them from any supermarket for super cheap, and the meal takes 5 mins in the microwave with basically no prep.
