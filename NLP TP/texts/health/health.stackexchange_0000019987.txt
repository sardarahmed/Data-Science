Q:

Why does stroke cause insomnia?

As per this article,

insomnia is a common complaint after ischemic stroke.
Why does ischemic stroke leads to insomnia ?

A:

Sometimes, stroke may be associated with insomnia, not because of the brain tissue damage, but because of how it affects someone's life.
Insomnia is a likely long-term side effect of stroke, study finds (ScienceDaily, 2018):

Importantly researchers found that although sleep efficiency was
  reduced in patients, total sleep time between the groups was similar,
  suggesting that lesions in the brains' centres for sleep-wake
  regulation are unlikely to cause the insomnia. Rather researchers
  believe that sleep problems experienced by stroke patients are due to
  a number of contributory factors, such as greater psychological
  strain, pain and discomfort as well as reduced levels of physical
  activity.

The article What happens to sleep after a stroke? (Medscape) describes how different stroke locations can result in different types of insomnia:

A pontine stroke may be expected to affect REM sleep.
Particular lesion sites have been reported to cause narcolepsy, destruction of normal circadian sleep/wake patterns, and regional loss.
  of sleep spindles, but also loss of dream life, a peculiar bed-prone
  behavioral stereotypy, and visual hallucinations.
Subcortical strokes affecting basal ganglia may be more associated with excessive daytime sleepiness.
Immediately after a hemispheric stroke, REM sleep abnormalities are more common. Over a period of weeks after a hemispheric stroke, it is
  common to observe reduction in total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and
  sleep stages.
In one study of hemispheric strokes, one third of stroke patients slept more.
