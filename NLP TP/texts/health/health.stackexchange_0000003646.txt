Q:

What heart conditions cause dizziness after/during exercise?

Lots of stuff causes dizziness after/during exercise. But if you Google "dizziness after exercise" you'll get 10,000 articles and lame blogs that are basically just copies of one another that all essentially make the same vague blanket statement:

In rare cases, heart conditions can cause dizziness after/during exercise.

But, LOL, not a single one of these articles/lame blogs actually deep dives into what specific heart conditions they are referring to.
So I ask: What specific heart conditions would cause dizziness after/during exercise, and why do they make one dizzy?

A:

Dizziness or giddiness during exercise is classically caused by obstruction to the outflow of the heart i.e. aortic stenosis (see MedlinePlus). This condition is most commonly seen in either young persons due to bicuspid aortic valve or in elderly with sclerotic aortic valves. In developing countries, it may occur due to rheumatic heart disease also. 
When a normal person exercises, extra blood flow is needed in the muscles. Hence, heart starts pumping more blood to keep up with this increased demand of the body. However, in persons with aortic stenosis, orifice of the outlet of the heart is small and fixed. Hence, blood flow (cardiac output) cannot increase when person exercises. Due to blood vessel dilatation in muscles, blood goes preferentially to muscles and flow to the brain gets reduced. Hence giddiness or dizziness occurs. It can progress to syncope, i.e. transient unconsciousness and fall.
