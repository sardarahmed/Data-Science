Q:

Do shin injuries heal slower than similar injuries on other parts of the body?

Do common injuries, such as scrapes and bruises, heal up slower on your shins? It seems as though there would be less blood flow through shins than, say, the upper arm (which is more "meaty").

A:

It is commonly known by plastic surgeons etc that the close association of skin and bone in the shin area leads to poor healing.  Anatomical studies suggest that this is caused by the comparative lack of deep perforating vessels.
