Q:

How does one manage sarcopenia as one ages?

Sarcopenia is an almost inevitable accompaniment of aging, and we know that reduced physical strength leads to increased morbidity.  For example failing the sitting rising test can predict increased mortality of 500% over 5 years.
Is there good evidence to show that sarcopenia can be slowed by exercise and diet, or even by anabolic steroids?

A:

Morley (2016) states (with more references than I am copying across here),

At a basic level, protein synthesis and/or degradation are controlled by activation of the insulin or IGF-1 receptor.

The primary treatment of sarcopenia is resistance exercise. As was shown by the LIFE study (Pahor, et al. 2014), aerobic exercise can also decrease functional decline in lower limb muscles. Exercise has also been shown to be an important therapeutic approach to reversing frailty. There is evidence to support that excess protein [1–1.2 g (kj day)] may also enhance muscle mass and, to a lesser extent, function (Bauer, et al. 2013). This is particularly true for leucine enriched essential amino acids (whey protein). Essential amino acid supplementation prevents muscle mass loss due to bed rest. A recent multicenter study has shown that whey protein together with vitamin D increased both muscle mass and stair climb. There is some evidence for synergistic effects of exercise and protein to enhance muscle function. Vitamin D supplementation increases muscle strength without increasing muscle mass or power. Vitamin D is more effective in older persons and those with low vitamin D levels. It also decreases falls in persons who are vitamin D deficient. At present, no drugs have been shown to be clinically more therapeutically effective.

For exercise and diet there is the following from Waters, et al. (2010)

With exception of ACEI as a pharmaceutical intervention, the most compelling evidence to combat sarcopenia is resistance training either alone or in combination with nutritional supplements.

For anabolic steroids/SARMs, Morley (2016), states that with:

Nandrolonethere is no evidence that it increased strength
MK0773 (TFM-4AS-1)a 4-aza steroidal drug that has androgen gene selectivity. In females, it increased IGF-1 as well as stair climbing power and gait speed (Papanicolaou, et al. 2013). This study was terminated because of an increased signal for cardiac failure. In women with sarcopenia, it increased muscle mass, bilateral leg press, and stair climbing power but not gait speed (www.clinicaltrials.gov). The study in males was reported at the 90th Endocrine Society in 2008. It showed anabolic effects of MK0773.
EnobosarmIn a 12-week study, increased total lean mass and stair climb (Dalton, et al. 2011). In female patients with cancer, enobosarm increased lean mass compared to baseline, but not significantly compared to placeboOverall, these studies of SARMs have shown no advantage over testosterone.
Growth Hormone/Insulin Growth Factor-1Increased nitrogen retention and increased muscle mass
Ghrelin antagonistsOverall, while ghrelin agonists will increase food intake and muscle mass, it is unlikely that they will produce a significant effect on function in persons with sarcopenia.
Myostatin antibodiesIncreased lean body mass and handgrip
Activin 11R antagonistsIncreased thigh muscle volume, muscle mass, and 6-min walk distance
Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (perindopril)Increased distance walked and decreased hip fracture
Espindolol (B1/B2/B3 adrenergic receptor antagonist)Maintains muscle mass and increased hand grip strength
Fast skeletal muscle troponin activators (Tirasemtiv)Improves muscle function
