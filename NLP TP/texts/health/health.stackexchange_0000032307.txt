Q:

What is the difference between skin cancer to skin lymphoma?

In this version from 03.07.23 of the article Skin Cancer in Wikipedia it was written:

There are three main types of skin cancers: basal-cell skin cancer (BCC), squamous-cell skin cancer (SCC) and melanoma.

Isn't Skin Lymphoma one of the major types of Skin Cancer?
What is the difference between skin cancer to skin lymphoma?

A:

I understand and I might be wrong, from this article, that Skin Lymphoma is a group of rare, usually slow-growing skin cancers that are being caused by cancerous lymph nodes creating cancerous lymphocytes.
While most lymphocytes reside in the lymph nodes, they also effect the skin and may cause some dermatological symptoms finally recognized as Skin Lymphoma or one or more different Lymphoma/s.
I didn't find any traces for the root term lymph in any of the pages of This article with "basic information" about skin cancers.
I assume that Melanoma or Carcinoma are more common types of skin cancer. This is my personal assumption and it might be wrong.
