Q:

If a rabid wolf bites your head and you have recently been vaccinated against rabies, will you still develop the disease?

I have read that if a large rabid animal bites your head, the post-exposure treatment can be ineffective:

...a bite near the head will make the disease act too fast for the treatment to take effect... (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabies_in_animals)

The wikipedia article cites "The Fear of Wolves: A Review of Wolf Attacks on Humans" (PDF). Norsk Institutt for Naturforskning for the claim.
My question is this: if you have recently been vaccinated and a wolf severely bites your skull, will the antibodies still do their job? 
Doctors say the virus should never reach the brain.
Thanks in advance!
PS: Please delete the question, if it's too unspecific or silly. ;)

A:

The CDC points out that:

From numerous studies conducted on rabid dogs, cats, and ferrets, we know that when the rabies virus is introduced into a muscle through a bite from another animal, it travels from the site of the bite to the brain by moving within nerves. The animal does not appear ill during this time.
The time between the bite and the appearance of symptoms is called the incubation period and it may last for weeks to months.

Once the disease becomes established, it is 100% fatal (King & Turner, 1993; Jackson, 2000). However, if treated immediately after exposure it is possible to prevent the development of the disease in most cases (Linnell et al. 2002).
The present treatment consists of a single injection of immunoglobulin (rabies antibodies grown in tissue culture) and multiple injections of rabies vaccine (Jackson, 2000). Survival of patients treated is high except in some cases where bites have been inflicted directly on the head and neck (Shah & Jaswal, 1976; Fangtao et al. 1988). This is because direct viral entry into the nerves without local replication results in very short incubation period, as occurs in cases with multiple bites in the head and neck region (Mahadevan et al. 2016).
