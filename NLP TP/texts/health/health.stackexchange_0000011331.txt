Q:

Considering obesity using BMI

Why is it that medical assessments on obesity is based on BMI when BMI scales are inaccurate?
Take for example Phillip Heath (Mr. Olympia 2016)

Height: 5’9″
  Competition Weight: 250 lbs

This gives a BMI of 36.9 when calculated using the formula (Weight in Pounds / (Height in inches x Height in inches)) x 703)
This is considered half way between obese and extremely obese and 

a very high risk of BMI related diseases

Now you cannot say Phillip Heath is very obese so why do government organisations and health professions use BMI to rate people's level of obesity and look to reduce access to health care or introduce 'Fat Tax' to incentivise weight loss?

A:

All models are wrong, but some are useful.

The same is true for the body mass index. In general, people with a higher BMI have a higher chance of getting obesity-related illnesses than those with a BMI in the 18-25 range. But of course, there are exceptions like the one you mention. That's no reason to discard the entire BMI, because it does work in many cases. It's easier than other predictors (such as abdominal circumference).
Another example would be age, as a predictor of mortality. It's safe to assume that in general, a 90-year-old would die sooner than a 25-year-old. But it's not true that no 25-year-olds die before any 90-year-old.
For the second part of your question: obesity is defined as a BMI >30. In that sense, we can say that Heath would be obese. But once again, this "label" is not flawless. He's probably got a lower probability of getting obesity-related illnesses than someone with a BMI of 29.9 based entirely on a bad diet and lack of exercise. 
TL:DR; BMI isn't a flawless predictor, but it's ease-of-use causes it to still be used.
