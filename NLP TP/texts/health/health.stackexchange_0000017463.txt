Q:

Could genetically modified viruses cure genetic diseases?

Is it possible to create a genetically modified virus to carry a custom genetic payload, that could express protiens that the host is unable to make themselves?
For example, could a virus be created to carry the genetic code to express the insulin protein for diabetics, or Serotonin for Parkinson's or even Telomerase, so we can all live longer?
I'm aware that there would be risks, in not being able to control and sustain the amount of protien expressed, or even the virus mutating or spreading, but in theory, is it possible?

A:

Yes.
Gene therapy is an active area of research; most gene therapy approaches that are studied use some sort of viral vector, those that don't are more the exception and it is unclear how several of those methods would be applied clinically.
There have already been clinical trials of gene therapy with viral vectors, with mixed success.
