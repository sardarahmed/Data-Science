Q:

What are some reliable and free basic online nutrition courses?

I took several human-nutrition-focused courses in my past education, and I'd like to provide a corpus of resources covering fundamental human nutritional information, as, for example, what are calories/carbohydrates, or how are different fats used by the body, or proper hydration, etc. 
Basic stuff for a smart consumer (domestic or wild) to make the right nutritional food choices. I've seen a lot of OCW and slideshows for the topic, but nothing that's quite right vis-a-vis covering the core ideas. Just wanted to ask in the spirit of this question what this community has found that does the topic justice, so I can share with others.

A:

Good question, and this is not a complete answer, as I cannot think specifically of a free course.  I will update this if I find one.  But a very good resource that I feel provides a great foundation for what balanced nutrition is, with a lot of good explanations (that you don't have to be a scientist to understand), is a Harvard public health website. One of the primary researchers involved did a Skype lecture with us, during which he presented the research behind their information, and we felt it was quite solid:
