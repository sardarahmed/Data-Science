Q:

Can one's body temperature affect the quality of his/her sleep?

If so, how does it influence our sleep?  And what can we do to improve the quality of sleep in regards to adjusting our body temperature?

A:

Yes. Body temperature drops at night almost 2 degrees fahrenheit. 
Cranial cooling has been showing to lead to deeper sleep and help insomniacs.
Higher body temperatures during sleep are associated with depression.
As a physician, I have a seen previous studies suggesting that taking a lukewarm shower before sleeping has been shown to help people get to sleep faster [reference needed]. 
Anecdotally, I have patients who report that walking around without socks on the floor until their feet feel cold also report falling asleep faster.
