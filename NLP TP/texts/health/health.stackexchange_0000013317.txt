A:

Any routine and habits affect a persons health, for better or worse. There is no way anyone can tell you what health affects your routine will have on you, only that it increases or decreases your risks for certain diseases.  
A sedentary lifestyle, increases risks of disease, both physical and mental. See:  https://www.lifespanfitn.ess.com/workplace/resources/articles/health-risks-of-a-sedentary-lifestyle 
Having a routine such as using a bike as transportation can help reduce these risks, because bike riding is a form of exercise.  However,being consistently active throughout the day is best. 
Diet also affects people, the healthier you eat, and the less junk you eat the better.  Sometimes peoples poor lifestyle choices do not catch up to them until later in life, or they may find that problems they never thought would happen to them, catch up to them sooner than they would like.
