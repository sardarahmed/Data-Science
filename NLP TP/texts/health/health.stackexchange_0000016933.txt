Q:

Is it possible to get cancer after taking iron supplement of 100mg for 4 days

I took iron supplements of 100mg ferrous ascorbate for 4 days but since day 3 I experienced black stools and strange pain during bowel movement plus got hemorrhoids so I stopped it immediately after day 4. My hemorrhoids subsided after stopping the pills.
This was about a month ago but now when I google I read some linkage between iron supplement and cancer https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321515.php
Can I get colon cancer after taking supplements for just 4 days? I read symptoms of colon cancer and one of them is constipation I experience constipation once in a while but no blood in stools.
Screening for cancer is very expensive. From your experience do you think cancer could likely have happened during those 4 days?

A:

Side effects of iron supplements can include:

Black stools
Constipation
Abdominal pain

So, these are common side effects that have nothing to do with cancer.
In the study described in Medical News Today, they did not confirmed the  cause-effect relationship between iron supplements and cancer, because they only found a substance (a marker) that could be associated with cancer, and it was a laboratory study and not a study on humans.
