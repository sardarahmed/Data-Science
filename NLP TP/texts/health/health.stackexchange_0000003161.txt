Q:

Astigmatism eyeglass lenses -- how much distortion is normal?

I've been wearing glasses for near-sightedness for almost my entire life but only yesterday got glasses to correct my astigmatism. The world now looks rather distorted. To name two examples, my computer monitor appears to be a trapezoid (long side on the left) and table and desks appear to be tilted at nearly a 30 degree angle. Covering one eye or the other provides a view not subject to this distortion; everything is very clear.
I've been wearing these glasses about 3 hours now (on and off with my old ones as I feel eye strain and headache) and the distortion has not lessened.
Is this normal to this degree? Should I return to my optometrist immediately or should I wait a few days?

A:

According to my eye doctor, this much distortion is not normal.
He checked the strength of my glasses and they were not made according to the prescription: the OS astigmatism correction was -0.50 rather than the written -0.25. Getting the glasses remade now.
