Q:

Is water an essential ingredient of alcohol based hand sanitizers?

The two WHO formulations (ethanol and IPA) make up the volume with distilled or boiled water. But is this water essential for the best efficacy of the cleanser or is it only to bulk it out?
In other words is dilute alcohol (75 - 80%) a better hand sanitizer than 99% (with minor additions of H2O2 and glycerine)?

A:

Higher concentrations of alcohol are actually less effective (that Q&A is specific for isopropyl, but the same is true for ethanol, their mechanism of sterilization is the same), see also here.
Summarizing from those answers: higher concentrations of alcohol don't penetrate into cells as well.
This page from the CDC also discusses optimal alcohol concentrations for disinfection and gives some references.
