Q:

Ringing in ears

What is that ringing sound in the ears which prevails even when somebody is in quiet surroundings? Is that sound real or just created by our brain due to some sort of malfunctioning? Some scientific explanation would be more apt.
I'm not asking for diagnosis. I want to know what physical & chemical changes could be behind this issue.
As far as I have observed my body, I found neck pain (most likely cervical spondylosis) to be a prominent reason for this. But the wikipedia article doesn't include it. Is there any valid study that pin-points cervical pain to be a reason for Tinnitus?
I observed that cardio exercises and outdoor gaming activity, temporarily eradicated this problem. The longest relief span recorded by me was 2 days. I can understand that exercise improves the blood flow which could have helped, but what continued the relief for 2days?

A:

Most people describe ringing in ears as tinnitus. From a medical perspective, the definition of tinnitus is a real mess. It is typically described as a symptom and not a disease and diagnosis is often based on self report (although objective tinnitus is when a doctor can hear the sound). Things get messy though in that Heller and Bergman (1953) found that 93% of individuals without tinnitus reported hearing sounds when placed in a very quiet room. In general, the Mayo Clinic does not suggest seeing a doctor about tinnitus unless, it is bothersome, occurs suddenly, is accompanied by dizziness, or is brought on by an upper repository infection.
