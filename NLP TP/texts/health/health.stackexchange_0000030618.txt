Q:

What does "oppose" mean in this context: opposition of the wound edges?

Been interested in cyanoacrylates and their applications to wound closures and ran across this new usage for "oppose", "opposed", and "opposition". Researching further such as looking for wound medical glossary, papers and articles for wound closures, NONE go into defining the term and only uses the term in regular medical speak assuming the reader knows the usage which is understandable. Even dictionaries don't go into the medical usage for "oppose" which was odd considering its widespread among medical sources.
Can anyone shed some light on what it means to "oppose the edges of an open wound" like in the following article's excerpt?
"With this technique, the wound edges are opposed and held in place by the application of Steri-Strips" See https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20880653/.

A:

From the context it seems the answer is the edges lined up opposite and against each other, as the transitive verb form of the word opposite a la the second definition here:

Oppose
transitive verb

to place over against something so as to provide resistance,
to place opposite or against something
to offer resistance to

For opposite:

opposite
adjective
1: located at the other end, side, or corner of something: located across from something.
The two boys lived on opposite sides of the street.
