Q:

How accurate are dogs to detect whether a human has COVID-19?

I read on https://www.businessinsider.com/sniffer-dogs-answer-to-the-covid-19-testing-crisis-mirror-2020-4:

Medical detection dogs able to sniff 750 people an hour could help identify coronavirus cases, researchers say

How accurate are dogs to detect whether a human has COVID-19?

This question is a repost of How accurate are dogs to detect whether a human has COVID-19? [closed], which got deleted because some people complained no study has been done yet on that matter. Since there is no at least one study on it, I'm reposting it.

A:

I wouldn't be surprised if dogs could detect COVID-19, as they can help detect hypoglycaemia in diabetics, warn people who are about to have an epileptic seizure and have been used to sniff out some cancers.
This article on Nature's website (23 November 2020) has the following

Canines seem to detect coronavirus infections with remarkable
accuracy, but researchers say large-scale studies are needed before
the approach is scaled up.
