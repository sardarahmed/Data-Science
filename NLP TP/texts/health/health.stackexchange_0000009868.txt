Q:

Do honey and cinnamon have anti-inflammatory elements in their biological makeup? What other foods do too?

I have an autoimmune disorder wherein my body is constantly inflamed. While I do take anti-inflammatory medications, I am now looking to complement that with my diet. 
I heard that cinnamon and honey are made-up of anti-inflammatory agents (maybe antioxidants, potassium, vitamin-k, etc) -- is this true? What other food items could be considered anti-inflammatory? 

A:

yes you can check MEDLINE and you will find some reports on it,  roibosh tea and several leaves and barks are strong antiinf. drugs https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willow_tree
