Q:

What does the term "biologic therapies" really mean?

Through the years I have often checked various sources trying to understand what are "biologic therapies" but didn't get any general answer or generalized definition of the term.
Every medical treatment (possibly excluding psychotherapy) is "biological".
It may be a classic case were people try to describe something in too few words, similar to what goes with "Chemical Weapons". Every weapon (possibly excluding psychological warfare) is "chemical", but the term "Chemical Weapons" actually refers primarily to:

Bombs containing strong acids or poison

If I understand correctly, and I don't have a single source for this "biologic therapies" are in general:

Synthetic protein-agonists or synthetic protein-antagonists

A specific example would be TNF-Î± inhibitors in the treatment of psoriasis(1) but that's only a psoriasis-specific definition, so what are "biologic therapies" in general?

A:

Wikipedia mentions that the definition varies by you who ask, and since there are some regulations that apply specifically to biologics you'd need to see those specific regulations to see how they apply, but generally my impression agrees with the general idea the Wikipedia article conveys: biologics are derived from biological sources.
Yes, all drugs affect biology, but most small molecules are created synthetically, even if they're motivated by things originally identified in living things. Large molecules like proteins (including antibodies), though, are only practical to make in biological systems.
