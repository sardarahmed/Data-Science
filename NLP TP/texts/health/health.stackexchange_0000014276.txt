Q:

Do detection of Kidney cysts (PKD) at an early stage helps prevention of Kidney Failure?

Kidney cysts are becoming 4th leading factor of kidney failure unfortunately. There is no cure of PKD yet though research is going on! 
My question is "If a person suffers from PKD detects it accidently at very early age suppose at his twenties. Will it be helpful to him anyway as there is no cure available? At early stage, there are only some cysts on Kidney then at later stage where thousands of cysts reside on Kidney stopping Kidney to do its functionality.

Also I found:

Q. Does everyone with PKD develop kidney failure?  
Answer: About 50 percent of people with PKD will have kidney failure by age 60, and about 60 percent will have kidney failure by age 70. People with kidney failure will need dialysis or a kidney transplant.

A:

There is no way to prevent PKD. However, there is a drug in pre-clinical trials now that may be effective in treatment of PKD. 

Researchers at UT Southwestern Medical Center, working with a
  California biotech firm, have developed a potential drug to treat
  polycystic kidney disease -- an incurable genetic disease that often
  leads to end-stage kidney failure.
The drug, now called RGLS4326, is in preclinical animal testing at San
  Diego-based Regulus Therapeutics Inc. An investigational new drug
  filing to pave the way for human clinical trials is expected later
  this year, said Dr. Vishal Patel, Assistant Professor of Internal
  Medicine at UT Southwestern.
