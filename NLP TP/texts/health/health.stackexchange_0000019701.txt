Q:

How important is the experience of the radiologist to diagnose a tendinopathy when reading an MRI?

I read on {1}:

Preoperative ultrasound examination of the shoulder permits a reliable diagnosis of complete rotator cuff tears and calcium deposits (calcific tendinitis). The method is less sensitive but sufficiently reliable for the diagnosis of partial rotator cuff tears and pathology of the long biceps tendon. Examiner experience plays an important role in these special cases. Permanent continuous training in the field of ultrasound diagnosis is a prerequisite for sufficient reliability of ultrasound diagnosis of shoulder disorders.

Is there any scientific study/survey that tried to quantify the importance of the  experience of the radiologist to diagnose a tendinopathy when reading an MRI?
