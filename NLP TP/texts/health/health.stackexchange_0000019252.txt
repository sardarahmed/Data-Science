Q:

Meaning of "sib of 20" in a by-patient case description table

A table from from Cerebral folate deficiency: Analytical tests and differential diagnosis: 

The first column contains patient numbers.
I thought that sib of .. meant "sibship of .." - that is, "in the patient's family, there is a total of NUMBER sisters and brothers". But when I came across "sib of 18" and "sib of 20" I started having second thoughts. Are there really families with such huge numbers of children? 
What could be an alternative meaning for the abbreviation sib here?  

A:

21 (sib of 20) means that the person No 21 is a sibling of the person No 20 (a row before him).
You can check this article:

These patients were members of 28 unrelated kindreds with subjects 5
  and 27, 9 and 13, 10 and 12, 11 and 15 and 19 and 21, being full
  siblings (Table 1).

In the table 1, you can see that the person No 5 is a sib of the person No 27, and the person No 27 is a sib of a person No 5.
