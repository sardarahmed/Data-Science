Q:

Does adding water to drinks reduce their glycemic index?

I have noticed the degree of sweetness of the food corresponds with the likelihood to get acne. 
Whereas, diluting the flavor reduces the likelihood even if total calorie intake is same.
Is there science to support this? 

A:

Question: Does reducing the sweetness of a drink by diluting it with water reduces the likelihood of acne?
Short answer: Not necessary.
I am not aware of any study that would show an association between the mere sweetness of a food and the risk of acne.
There is some evidence that low-glycemic load diet may help reduce acne (Cochrane, PubMed Central).
Glycemic load = glycemic index x grams of carbohydrates in the food. Glycemic index is an estimation of the effect of a food on the blood glucose level after its ingestion.
Examples of high-glycemic index foods (GI >70) are some sweet beverages, cornflakes, instant oatmeal, white rice, potatoes, white bread, pasta, biscuits and other baked goods made from white flour and little fiber (Harvard).
As you can see, high-glycemic foods are not necessary sweet.
Diluting "the sweetness" of a food or beverage may not reduce its glycemic index. The Glycemicindex.com gives this example (but no link to any study):

A more dilute solution, say 25 grams fructose in 500 mL water will
  have a higher GI than 25 grams fructose in 250 mL.

Such estimation sounds counterintuitive, but it makes sense, because a beverage with 5% sugar (25 g fructose in 500 mL water) usually empties from the stomach faster than a beverage with 10% sugar (25 g sugar in 250 mL water) (Nutrition and Metabolism). So, the diluted beverage passes from the stomach into the intestine faster, which results in faster glucose absorption and thus in higher GI.
To decrease the glycemic load of the meals, you can decrease the amount of high glycemic index foods, for example, eating whole-grain bread (high in fiber) instead of white flour products (low in fiber).
