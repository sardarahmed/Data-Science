Q:

Are there any symptoms of Vitamin D deficiency?

I've heard that Vitamin D is mainly obtained from the sun or you have to take supplements. Getting it from the sun also depends on many factors, such as the latitude, time of the day, skin color, area exposed etc.
I am a office worker with light brown skin. I walk in the sun for around 10-15 minutes a day which I think is insufficient. I do not take any Vitamin D supplements, as well. I am a vegetarian, but do drink milk (not fortified with Vitamin D, though) and other milk products. 
I am afraid I might have Vitamin D deficiency, but am not sure. Is there any symptom associated with Vitamin D deficiency? Or would this deficiency only be determined only by a test?
I could not find a reliable source of information on the web.

  nanograms/milliliter to 50 ng/mL is considered adequate for healthy
  people. A level less than 12 ng/mL indicates vitamin D deficiency.
