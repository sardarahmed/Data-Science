A:

Assuming pregnancy takes place, the only reliable sign that a woman is pregnant is cessation of her menstrual period. If she's late, urine tests are a reliable way to confirm pregnancy, especially if the woman has irregular periods.
Up to 50% of women will not experience nausea (the range, depending on the study, is 15-50%); while most will, when they do varies from early in the pregnancy (as early as 2 weeks after the first missed period, often peaking by the 9th week) to late (sometimes even into the early part of the second trimester). 
Urinary frequency is experienced in only about half of women in the first trimester (range 25-60%); Fatigue is subjective and depends on self-reporting; many women do not report fatigue in the first trimester, whereas nearly 100% do in the third trimester.
