Q:

What happens when a hemophiliac woman gets her period?

If there was a woman who is also a hemophiliac/bleeder, what happens when she gets her period? Does her condition affect said period in any way, and if so, how? Would it be troublesome (more than usual) for her, and would she have to face any serious issues?

A:

"Luckily" haemophilia only occurs in men*; women may be carrier of the disease but their bleeding tendency is in general less severe.
However, haemophilia carriers and women with other bleeding disorders (such as von Willebrand disease or platelet problems, e.g. Glanzmann) may experience very heavy menstrual blood loss. In general the menstruation won't take more days, but the blood loss can be much more severe. This could lead to anaemia and potentially death.
To minimise this blood loss, one could suppress the period (e.g. oral contraceptives or an intra-uterine device). Other options would be administration of the part that's missing or malfunctioning (clotting factor or platelets) or blood transfusion to treat anaemia.
* based on the comments below I want to add that it is possible that a woman is a true haemophiliac, but that this is very rare. Haemophilia is an X-linked disorder; because men inherit XY one affected X chromosome will cause the disease. Women have XX, which means that they can "compensate" the effect of one affected X chromosome by the activity of the other X chromosome. She is then a carrier of the disease: there is a 50-50 chance of her son (to whom she gives one X) is a haemophiliac. A woman could inherit two affected X chromosomes if her father is a haemophiliac and her mother is a carrier (and inherits the affected X chromosome). This makes true haemophilia much more rare in women than in men.
