Q:

Covid-19 mortality rates lower among some diabetes patients

It has been found that hospitalized COVID-19 patients have a greater risk of dying if they are men or are obese or have complications from diabetes or hypertension (University of Maryland School of Medicine, 2020).
Yet, use of the diabetes drug metformin — before a diagnosis of COVID-19 — is associated with a threefold decrease in mortality in COVID-19 patients with Type 2 diabetes (Crouse, et al. 2021).
Interestingly:

[N]either BMI nor HbA1C were lower in metformin users who survived as compared to those who died (Table 4). While surprising, this is consistent with the notion that long-term glycemic control does not affect COVID-19 outcome.

While I understand at the moment that more investigation is needed to determine how Metformin helps, if BMI or HbA1C is not a contributing factor in the protective nature of Metformin, what other effects of Metformin on the body could be helping type 2 diabetics and how?

The latter paper (Crouse, et al.) discusses this:

Interestingly, metformin has previously been shown to also have anti-inflammatory (16, 17) and anti-thrombotic effects (18, 19) and excessive inflammatory responses, e.g., cytokine storm as well as disseminated thromboembolic events have been recognized as deadly complications of COVID-19 infection (20–22). It is therefore tempting to speculate that by exerting some of its anti-fibrinolytic activities (18) and inhibiting inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha or interleukin-6 (16, 17), suspected to play a role in the immune response to COVID-19 (12), metformin might improve outcome.

It wouldn't be surprising given that dexamethasone is basically used for that anti-thrombotic effect in treating Covid-19. I'm not sure how much of an anti-thrombotic effect metformin has in comparison; you may wan to check the refs cited in Crouse, et al.
