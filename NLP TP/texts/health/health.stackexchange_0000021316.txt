Q:

Are countries with lower life expectancy expected to have lower death rates due to Coronavirus?

Coronavirus death rates are higher for people in the range of 80+ (14,8%) and 70-79 years old (3,6%). However, there are countries, specially in Africa, where life expectancies are in the 50-60 and 60-70 years old range. Some people (like Bill Gates) warned about possible catastrophes if the virus massively reachs Africa. Could it happen than the lower life expectancy of those countries prevents more people from dying? Is people who lives 60 years old in countries with lower life expectancy, expected to have the mortality rates for Coronavirus of the people of the same age in countries with higher life expectancy, or a person of 60 years old in countries like those is in a physical state of an older person in a more developed country and as such have a higher mortality rate? 

A:

Age is a red herring, only a secondary characteristic correlating to death rates.
It's people that are already seriously ill or already have weak immune systems that are most likely to die soon after contracting Covid-19.  And it's when people are clustered in a close community that they are most likely to contract the disease.
In our society, the people in those circumstances tend to be old and in health-care facilities.
As a result, most of our deaths so far have involved people over 80 years old.
In other societies, a lack of old people doesn't necessarily mean a lack people living in close quarters, that are weak or sick.
There's certainly no shortage of such conditions in many parts of Africa.
