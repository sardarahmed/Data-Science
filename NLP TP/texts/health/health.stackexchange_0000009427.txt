Q:

How does a blind person react to hallucinogenic drugs

I've recently seen a post online stating the question: "What would happen if a blind person tried hallucinogenic drugs." (This entails 5-HT2A antagonists like Lysergic acid and psilocybin, the most common hallucinogenic drugs)
Do blind people have the possibility to experience visual hallucinations and does this differ if someone is born blind or became blind sometime after early childhood?

A:

I guess the best way would be to convince a blind person to take some psilocybin mushrooms or LSD. Perhaps they would actually see some fractals and stuff, since those visions are generated in the corresponding areas of the brain. Even if not, then the blind person would definitely feel the psychedelic effects: the acute perception of self and the surrounding.
