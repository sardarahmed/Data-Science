Q:

What does "c/f" mean in a hospital discharge summary?

I'm reading a discharge summary received from a hospital and cannot decipher the "c/f" abbreviation. Here is the text:

given c/f possible hepatic encephalopathy, started lactulose

I put "cf medical abbreviation" into my favorite search engine, but all I could find was cystic fibrosis which doesn't seem to fit.

A:

The abbreviation "c/f" in this case means "concern for".

Given concern for possible hepatic encephalopathy, [we] started lactulose [therapy]
