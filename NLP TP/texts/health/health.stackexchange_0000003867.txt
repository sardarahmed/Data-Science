Q:

Toxoplasmosis during pregnancy and blood donation

Can a person who was infected with toxoplasmosis during his or her mother's pregnancy donate blood? Or is it unsafe and thus rejected?

A:

People who have had toxoplasmosis are not barred from donating blood (at least in the places I checked). While toxoplasmosis during pregnancy is dangerous for the embryo/fetus, if they don't have lasting damage from it, that person is just like any other person who once had toxoplasmosis, of which there are many (in some countries up to 80 percent of people are immune because they had toxoplasmosis at one time). 
People with a currently active infection would probably be sent away, but since toxoplasmosis infection usually presents like a generic mild infection (muscle ache, mild temperature) and isn't tested for, that's no different than sending away someone with a cold. 
When in doubt, ask the place where you are donating.
