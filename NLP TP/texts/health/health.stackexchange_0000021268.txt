Q:

Having tested positive for COVID-19, will future tests be positive?

The World Health Organization indicates the COVID-19 genome is detected in assays.  Once a patient tests positive, is there any reason not to expect that future instances of the same assay will result positive?

A:

There are two general categories of tests typically used for identifying viral infections: those based on viral genetic material and those based on host immune response.
The CDC page on MERS-CoV testing (also a coronavirus, just not the one that causes COVID-19) is an informative resource to start with (bold added and reformatted by me):

Molecular tests are used to diagnose active infection (presence of MERS-CoV) in people who are thought to be infected with MERS-CoV based on their clinical symptoms and having links to places where MERS has been reported.
Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays are molecular tests that can be used to detect viral RNA in clinical samples.
Serology testing is used to detect previous infection (antibodies to MERS-CoV) in people who may have been exposed to the virus. Antibodies are proteins produced by the bodyâ€™s immune system to attack and kill viruses, bacteria, and other microbes during infection. The presence of antibodies to MERS-CoV indicates that a person had been previously infected with the virus and developed an immune response.

For some diseases, the primary type of test used is measuring immune reactivity; tuberculosis comes to mind.
However, tests currently being used for 2019-nCoV are of the "molecular" type: RT-PCR assays detecting viral RNA. Viral RNA is only present during an active infection. These tests can be used both when a patient is showing symptoms, to identify the infection, and also to retest later to show that the infection has been cleared.
