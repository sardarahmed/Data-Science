Q:

Vaccines and autoimmunity concerns

Medical papers/books exist linking vaccines to autoimmunity yet I am not able to decide whether they should be considered sound and peer reviewed scientific studies or not. Some examples are:

"rare reactions such as hypersensitivity, induction of infection, and autoimmunity do occur and can be severe and even fatal"
"In this review of the literature, there is evidence of vaccine-induced autoimmunity and adjuvant-induced autoimmunity in both experimental models as well as human patients"
"The final section covers diseases in which vaccines were known to be the solicitor – for instance, systemic lupus erythematosus"

Can anyone help me to understand whether the concern about autoimmunity is or is not scientifically supported?

A:

Autoimmunity triggered by vaccination is a documented, but rare occurrence.  The current research shows a correlation between autoimmune conditions and elevated levels of HLA proteins. Certain HLA proteins tend to have a predilection for activating the immune system against “self” cells. HLA proteins also can explain why certain people are more prone to autoimmune conditions that are induced or exacerbated by vaccines.
The risk of vaccine-related autoimmunity is by orders of magnitude lower than that of autoimmunity triggered by infectious disease. Since the latter includes vaccine-preventable infections, for most autoimmune conditions there is a net protective effect of vaccination. 
Current evidence supports administering appropriate vaccines in the absence of specific contraindications.
