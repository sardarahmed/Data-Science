Q:

Vitamin B food source

My question is very simple. What are some good vegetarian food sources for vitamin B? I'm asking this here because I tried to search it on the net but couldn't find much.

A:

Here on Nutrients Review you have lists of foods high in individual vitamins B.
Here on US Department of Agriculture (USDA) are more detailed lists of foods high in individual vitamins and other nutrients.
Roti/chapati, seeds and other plant foods do not contain vitamin B12. As a vegan, you can get vitamin B12 by eating foods that have vitamin B12 added or by taking vitamin B12 supplements. You can get other B vitamins and other nutrients from natural foods.
If a certain food is low in vitamins B or other vitamins, it does not mean it's bad. It's not important how much vitamins a particular food has, but how much vitamins is in your diet (all foods together). You need to get all vitamins regularly, but this does not mean you need to get every single vitamin every single day.  
The Vegetarian Resource Group (vrg.org) and VeganHealth.org seem to be reliable sources of nutrition info for vegans.
