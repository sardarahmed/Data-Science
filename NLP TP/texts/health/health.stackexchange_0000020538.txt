Q:

Good popular informative video guides to human anatomy?

Can you recommend visually illustrative, but still scientifically justified video guides with exhaustive commentary to organs and/or systems of the human body? I'd like to familiarize myself with human anatomy.

A:

Free videos with subtitles:
Introduction to Anatomy: basic anatomical terms, planes, positions, directions..a single 20 min video
Kenhub, comprehensive, organized, with basic anatomical terms, medical imaging, also histology, premium account available with quizzes and study questions
Anatomy Zone, also available on YouTube: 190+ videos, maybe not organized best
Khan Academy: anatomy + physiology combined
Innerbody: interactive images with detailed description
