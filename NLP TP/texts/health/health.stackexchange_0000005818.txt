Q:

Are nutritionists alternative medicine practitioners?

I got the impression, possibly from Ben Goldacre's book "Bad Medicine", that nutritionists are alternative medicine practitioners. Is that the case?

A:

In the US, anyone can claim to be a nutritionist. Registered dietitian nutritionists (RDN) undergo pretty extensive training.
An RD may suggest herbal remedies, which would be alternative medicine, but typically they are helping people manage chronic conditions like diabetes, crohn's disease, or cancer.
