Q:

Peripheral arterial disease and prophylaxis against venous thrombosis

The general guideline is that venous thromboembolic disease should be treated with prophylaxis prior to major surgery.  
What's the guideline when there is concurrent peripheral arterial disease.  I have heard conflicting opinions from both cardiologists and vascular surgeons.

A:

The national guideline center says to seek expert opinion before using stockings for venous thromboembolic prophylaxis when peripheral arterial disease is present since there is insufficient data in this situation.

If the decision is made not to use stockings or other devices, or medications, then the patient should be closely observed for the development of venous thrombosis.
