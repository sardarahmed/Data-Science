Q:

Is it risky to eat at most 12 ounces of canned sardines weekly for about two months?

According to this page https://www.livestrong.com/article/550938-health-risks-of-eating-sardines/
In the 'Concern About Sardines' Mercury Content' section

The FDA recommends a weekly intake of two to three servings of sardines, or 8 to 12 ounces for adults

12 ounces is ~340g

In the 'Canned Sardines' Health Risks' section mentions this:
The only potential health risk of eating sardines may not come from the fish itself, but the can it's in. Cans can contain a toxic chemical, bisphenol A, known as BPA.
Despite concerns about its link to obesity, diabetes, heart disease and cancer, BPA is still used in food cans in America. According to the Center for Environmental Health (CEH), USDA warns that toxins in can linings can migrate to the food inside.
In the CEH study in 2017, 38 percent of cans tested used BPA, and another 19 percent contained toxic PVC in the linings. Lab studies found BPA exposure may cause reproductive disorders, genetic damage and possibly increase the risk of breast cancer.

Which I don't know if this can be counterproductive, regarding to mercury or BPA, for an adult if eating at most 12 ounces of canned sardines weekly for 2 months?

A:

Like you mentioned, 12 ounces of sardines a week fits under the FDA's guidelines, so it should not be harmful to the adult that you described. Sardines contain a lot less mercury than many other fish species1.
Second of all, not all cans contain BPA or PVC. Even in cans that do contain BPA or PVC, the FDA considers them safe at low levels of exposure2,3. However, some researchers mentioned health concerns related to BPA and PVC that have not yet been fully researched2,4. Those concerned about exposure to BPA or PVC can purchase cans that do not contain the compound. 
It is considered safe by the FDA to consume up to 12 ounces of canned sardines a week for a period of two months according to current guidelines.
