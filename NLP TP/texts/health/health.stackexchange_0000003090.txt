Q:

Does fried food cause gastritis and other gastrointestinal tract illnesses?

And why exactly fried food is bad for heath? Simply because of the crust scratching the stomach?

A:

There are many reasons why fried food can be harmful. The chief reason is related to the oil content in these foodstuffs.

It has high oil content which may not be good if consumed in large amounts. Fried food cannot be tolerated by people who have undergone gall bladder removal.
Oils are heated at high temeperatures and in many fried-food outlets (or in general practice), reheated many times. This leads to some chemical reactions, some of which include cracking of the hydrocarbon chains and isomerization. These reactions can produce carcinogenic substances (Srivastava et al. 2010).
Oil vapours from these food can also cause respiratory distress in some people, especially asthmatics.
