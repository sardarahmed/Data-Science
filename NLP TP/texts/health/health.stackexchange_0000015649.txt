Q:

Can we live only on chocolate?

This question is out of curiosity. I have a new colleague. I haven't seen him going out for lunch or eating anything else but chocolate. He eats only chocolate bars whole day, about 3 big bars every day.
I didn't ask him why, since it seems personal. But I am curious about how eating only chocolate affects our nutrition system, regarding to protein and stuff.

A:

1 oz (28g) of dark has 155 calories. If you scale these 155 calories to 2000 (13 oz) then it looks like this:   

Source: United States Department of Agriculture, National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference Release 28, Basic Report:  19902, Chocolate, dark, 45- 59% cacao solids

Below is a table with the daily value:
% Daily Value*      
Total Fat 9 g          13.00%   167.74%
Saturated fat 5 g      25.00%   322.58% 
Cholesterol 2 mg        0.00%     0.00%
Sodium 7 mg             0.00%     0.00%
Potassium 158 mg        4.00%    51.61%
Total Carbohydrate 17 g 5.00%    64.52%
Dietary fiber 2 g       8.00%   103.23%
Sugar 14 g      
Protein 1.4 g           2.00%    25.81%  

Naturally it is high on fat. About the only guidelines chocolate meets are cholesterol and fiber.
Chocolate is also low on essential vitamins.  
Clearly over the long term it will negatively impact health.
3 each 10 oz bars is even more.  It is 4,650 calories.
