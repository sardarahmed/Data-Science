Q:

What does "2/2" mean in a patient note?

I am reading a few patient notes and see 2/2 used several times, e.g.:

Unclear if 2/2 to aspiration
Recurrent UTIs and hosp. for urosepsis - thought 2/2 to chronic indwelling Foley catheter for neurogenic bladder. 
Trach was placed because was unable to clear secretions on her own 2/2 to  respiratory weakness
Her decreased responsiveness was thought to be 2/2 to meningitis
pt has respiratory weakeness 2/2 to multiple sclerosis

What does 2/2 mean in a patient note?

A:

Right Diagnoses. Com
It means secondary to. 
From your question:

Patient has respiratory weakness secondary to multiple sclerosis

If you are looking for a more credible source, this site mentions that it means "secondary to." 
Meded.uscd.edu also mentions its meaning.
