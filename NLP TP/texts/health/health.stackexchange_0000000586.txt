Q:

Can food be addictive?

Is there any scientific literature investigating physical and psychological addiction to food? like e.g. sugar, refined flour, etc.
Some studies, like this one talk about this subject but I'm interested to know more.

A:

Consumption of large quantities of sugar has been shown to cause a state of addictionwiki.
Study from 2002 shown that excessive intake of sugar can cause signs of opioid dependence, because this kind of food stimulates our neural systems.

Repeated, excessive intake of sugar created a state in which an opioid antagonist caused behavioral and neurochemical signs of opioid withdrawal. The indices of anxiety and DA/ACh imbalance were qualitatively similar to withdrawal from morphine or nicotine, suggesting that the rats had become sugar-dependent.

This was confirmed by another study from 2008 that suggest sugar releases opioids and dopamine, therefore it might be expected to have addictive potential.
This has been proven in animal model, so it may translate to some human conditions as well causing eating disorders and obesity.
