Q:

Which vessel could a pumping vessel in the left middle side of forehead be?

There is a vessel located on the left middle side of my forehead which keeps pumping for few times noticeably every few minutes, my question is:
What are vessels flowing on the left-mid side of the forehead that can be felt pulsating?

A:

Map of the superficial arteries (the arteries close beneath the skin), taken from ClinicalGate, which I believe they have taken from Gray's Anatomy for Students

Map of the deeper arteries, ibid
I'm unsure which you consider the left-mid side of your forehead, but you probably felt one of the larger arteries like the superficial temporal artery or the facial artery, but please check for yourself.
