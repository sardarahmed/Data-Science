Q:

How much less effective are the antibodies produced against the Alpha-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein against the Delta-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?

When viruses mutate and the surface of a protein changes that usually results in the antibodies that the body produced against an earlier form of the virus working less well. By what factor do antibodies developed against the Alpha-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein bind less well to the Delta-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?

A:

There is no general answer to this question -- it depends on the viruses involved, the antibodies in question and the specific immune system gene versions of an infectee.
Unlike with monoclonal antibodies, the population of antibodies to a given protein generated by a natural immune response is enormous. That population includes antibodies targeted to different parts of the protein, as the immune system chops up the protein into short (8-20 aa long) peptides in order to "present" those to the various antigen-recognizing immune cells. "Peptide length significantly influences in vitro affinity for MHC class II molecules" doi: 10.1186/1745-7580-4-6
Any given change to the original target protein may directly or indirectly affect from just one to many of its recognized peptides. Thus, a given antibody may have an affinity for the new protein ranging from unchanged (if its target antigen region was unchanged) all the way to essentially no binding (if its target region was greatly changed or eliminated).  An individual's overall Ab "neutralizing titer" against the new protein will depend both on the affinity of individual Abs to the new protein and on the number of each Ab present.
