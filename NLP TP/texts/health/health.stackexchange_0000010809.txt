Q:

Is there ever a time when an appendicitis is not an emergency? Could it explain chronic pain in lower abdomen/pelvis?

Is there ever a time when an appendicitis is not an emergency? Whenever I think of an appendicitis, I always envision it potentially bursting, warranting a swift appendectomy. But is that always the case? Could an appendicitis develop gradually and be the explanation for chronic pressurized pain in the lower abdomen/pelvis? 

A:

Chronic appendicitis is possible but rare (PubMed Central).
Crohn's disease and ovarian cyst are more common cause of the right lower abdominal pain.
Constipation and IBS are even more common.
