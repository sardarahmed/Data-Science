Q:

Is there a TDEE calculator which takes into account sleeping hours?

For the record, TDEE stands for 'Total Daily Energy Expenditure.' I have sleeping problems, which essentially require me to get ~12 hours of sleep a day. I'd assume this substantially lowers my TDEE, but I'd like to be able to calculate the effect more precisely. Thank you.

A:

There are several such calculators where you can input the hours you spend sleeping / sitting / standing etc. One example is here. 
Please note that even this will not give you a 100 percent accurate number.
