Q:

Is there a cure for bad breath?

I typically wake up with a mouth tasting like something died in it. Throughout the day it continues to taste bad, and I'm told it smells significantly worse. This has gotten to the point that it's getting in the way with relationships.
I assume this started during a few-month period of terrible oral hygiene, but since I have greatly improved oral habits, brushing twice daily after meals, flossing and using mouthwash, but the problem continues. Mouthwash alleviates the issue for maybe an hour at a time, and some mouthwashes help for as little as 20 minutes. I've spent a good deal of time googling, and I can't seem to find anything about CURING bad breath by, say, rebalancing oral bacteria. Is there a long-term solution for bad breath, preferably permanent (considering I haven't found anything that works for more than an hour, the standard is pretty low)?

A:

You may actually want to try cutting out the mouthwash. There's some evidence that the bacteria being killed with frequent use of mouthwash may include the healthy sort that your mouth needs, not to mention that it may dry your mouth out, which will also make your breath worse.
