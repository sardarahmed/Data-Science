Q:

Is nutritional values difference between uncooked and cooked (in water) food only due to the additional water absorbed?

I noticed that there is a substantial difference between the nutritional values of some uncooked and cooked food.
For example, 100g of uncooked quinoa has:

368 kcal
Carbohydrates 64g
Fat 6g
Protein 14g

while 100g of cooked quinoa has:

120 kcal
Carbohydrates 21g
Fat 2g
Protein 4g

If I cook 100g of quinoa, the final weight will be maybe 300g because of the water absorption. But what about the nutrional values ? Will they decrease after the cooking ?
In other words, is the difference in nutrient content shown above due to a loss of nutrients or simply the weight change due to water absorption? 

A:

You can see that 100 g of uncooked quinoa has about 3 times as much of everything (calories, carbs, fats and proteins) as 100 g of cooked quionoa, so you can assume that the difference is due to water absorption.
A small amount of carbs, fats and proteins can be lost in the cooking water.
A significant amount of vitamins can be destroyed by cooking and a lot of minerals can be lost in the cooking water (NutritionData).
