Q:

Do we have scientific evidence of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 at all?

There is still no scientific evidence of immunity to SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus. 
The serious virologist say: 
“We don’t know yet  “ ... “we can’t say “    “we hope “  “ we assume “

Troubling headlines have been cropping up across Asia: Some patients in China, Japan and South Korea who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and seemingly recovered have been readmitted to the hospital after testing positive for the virus again.
“scientists are still trying to answer many big questions related to the virus and the disease it causes. Among them is whether patients can be reinfected by the virus after they seem to recover from the symptoms.”
*With other coronavirus strains, experts say the antibodies that patients produce during infection give them immunity to the specific virus for months or even years, **but researchers are still figuring out if and how that works with COVID-19.*
The answer has huge implications for the spread of the disease, since researchers believe it will continue to crash across the world in waves, hitting the same country multiple times.

A:

It's true that we do not have strong evidence that people who have been infected by SARS-COV-2 are immune to re-infection. However, there are a couple of reasons that it is very likely that people will not be reinfected:
1) Though coronaviruses and RNA viruses in general mutate rapidly, making it difficult for the immune system to develop a lasting response, the SARS-COV-2 virus is showing relative stability. This means that our immune system, once it makes antibodies, can use those antibodies in future responses to the virus.
2) This study in macaques showed that monkeys who had recovered from viral infection did not show any signs of reinfection when exposed to the virus again.
