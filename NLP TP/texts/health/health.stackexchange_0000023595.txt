Q:

if diameter of alveoli is reduced to half, resistance becomes?

this is an MCQ for my upcoming exam. I have searched the internet but found mixed answers so far. 

A:

The resistance is defined as pressure difference per flow (basically just an application of Ohm's law).

With Hagen-Poiseulle: 

So if the alveoli diameter is reduced to half (resulting in a halved radius), as the resistance changes by the fourth, it is increased by factor 16 (24).

Note: As the bronchioles terminales are connected parallel, they actually do only make up roughly 20% versus 40% for the other bronchioli and 40% for the upper airways.
