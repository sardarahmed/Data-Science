Q:

Is an "asymptomatic COVID-19 case" a misnomer?

I've seen references to asymptomatic COVID-19 cases, and am wondering if this is incorrect use of the term. If COVID-19 is the disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, then aren't truly asymptomatic cases simply carriers of the virus?
The American Heritage dictionary defines disease as:

An abnormal condition of a part, organ, or system of an organism
resulting from various causes, such as infection, inflammation,
environmental factors, or genetic defect, and characterized by an
identifiable group of signs, symptoms, or both."

A:

As an analogy, people who test positive for HIV don't necessarily have AIDS. However, as a better-understood disease, AIDS has a very specific set of diagnostic criteria, e.g., they must have a CD4+ T cells count less than 200 cells/mmÂ³.
COVID-19 research is still ongoing and the diagnostic criteria aren't as clear cut. In the future we may have a clear definition of what it means to be diagnosed with COVID-19, in which case whether or not there are obvious symptoms will become irrelevant.
In the short term, it's probably safer to refer to asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 or of the coronavirus in common parlance.
