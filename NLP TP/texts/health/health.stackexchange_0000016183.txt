Q:

What residues do Ecigarettes create?

I have a feeling that the glycol and glycerine in Ecigs mostly become glucose and water upon combustion, so that glucose is the main element in vape smoke and residue. 
What chemicals are most prevalent in Ecig/vape residues?

A:

A bit of extra work today has yielded this concerning propylene glycol and glycerine: 

The chemistry of PG and GLY has a studied history. The preparation of GLY in 1779 by Scheele, and his determination that it was susceptible to thermal decomposition during simple distillation, predated even Wöhler’s urea synthesis by half a century. By the mid-19th century, acrolein and acetic acid21 had been identified as products of GLY decomposition. Wurtz synthesized PG in 1859, and determined that it could be oxidized to lactic acid in air in the presence of catalysts. In 1904, Nef provided the foundation for the current understanding of GLY and PG chemistry.
