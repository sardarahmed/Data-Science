Q:

Is there any adverse effect to my feet if I wear running shoes all the time?

Recently I bought a pair of running shoes (with a lot of cushioning) and another pair of casual shoes. However, the casual shoes didn't fit my feet well and I want to exchange them, which would take a few days. I'll go out on a trip tomorrow. I'm thinking about wearing the running shoes for the entirety of my trip. Would wearing running shoes all the time have adverse effects on my feet, since the extreme amount of cushioning might be "unnatural" in a sense?

A:

From what I understand you asking if any type of acute or chronic musculoskeletal issues will arise due to wearing cushioned shoes during a trip.  If this is the question:

No this is perfectly fine.  The cushioning will actually be beneficial if you're doing any type of extended walking.

The only case where this could cause any type of issue would be neglecting to use a medically prescribed orthotic (this is a custom casted shoe insert).  
Any reason you're thinking otherwise?
