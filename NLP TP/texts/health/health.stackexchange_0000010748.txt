Q:

Health and magnetic influence of notebook

How is harmful to keep laptop on the legs or near of the body in terms of magnetic influence?

A:

Magnetic, no.  As Variax points out.
A potential risk would be one of heat from the battery and components within the laptop itself, which gets hotter as the laptop works harder, especially if the cooling vents are blocked (by clothing, cushions, cats, etc.).
Heat is a form of radiation, but it's just that - heat.
