Q:

Can 'Lourdes' be a boy's name?

According to Elza Soares Wikipedia entry, her first husband was named Lourdes Antônio Soares.
Can 'Lourdes' be a boy's name in Brazil? Is this information correct?
Since Elsa took her husbands name 'Soares', I assume 'Soares' is here correctly given as her husband's last name.
To me "Antônio Lourdes" would sound more masculine, in the same way as 'José Maria' is a masculine name.

A:

According to IBGE (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística — Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) on https://censo2010.ibge.gov.br/nomes/#/search, in Brazil there were at least 20 males being born with the name “Lurdes” at least since 1930 to 1970:

But also with the name “Lourdes”:

Therefore, a Brazilian male can have the name “Lourdes” or “Lurdes”, even though it is absurdly uncommon.
Interesting that the chances of seeing a man with the name should be even rarer since the chances of a baby getting to adulthood was lower at the time.
