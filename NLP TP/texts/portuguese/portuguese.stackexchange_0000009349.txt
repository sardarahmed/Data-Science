Q:

Pronouncing ‘o’ as a clitic pronoun versus pronouncing ‘o’ as a definite article in Brazilian Portuguese

How would a typical Brazilian pronounce the following sentence, particularly the two o’s?

Eu vi o computador e o comprei.

The first "o" would sound like /ʊ/ but would the second "o" also
sound identical to the first or would it sound like "oh"?

A:

They are pronounced the same way. You can check that at this site: pt.forvo.com/search/o_menino/pt_br For both Iberian and Brazilian Portuguese.
Here's the thing though: those single letters change depend on the environment. It is not the single o that makes the difference; it is the fact it comes after vi. So, I can understand how you came up with "ew". Ha ha. Learning these things is part of learning correct connected speech. :)
If you say: Eu vi muitas casas no terreno. The "ew" disappears because the environment is different.
