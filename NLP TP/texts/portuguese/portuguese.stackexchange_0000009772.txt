Q:

tinha estado vs estivera

I've tried to search in google and found nothing
Are these 2 equal:

tinha estado
estivera

?
Or is there any difference between them?

A:

Those two forms are almost always equivalent and their English correspondent would be "had been". The synthetic form estivera — pretérito mais-que-perfeito — is less common, more formal and considered old-fashioned by some.
"Ao chegar, percebi que já estivera naquele lugar." (in English, "Upon arrival, I noticed I had already been to that place.") has the same meaning if we change estivera for tinha estado or even havia estado (seen perhaps as less formal than estivera and more than tinha estado).
There are cases in which estivera cannot be substituted for tinha estado because the sentence has a hypothetical connotation and the subjunctive mode would be used. For example, in the sentence "Estivera presente o professor, ele não teria dito aquilo." (in English, "Had the teacher been present, he would not have said that."), at least in Brazilian portuguese, one would not change estivera for tinha estado but one could change it for tivesse estado (and even add the conjunction se and set the order to SV to make it more typical, "se o professor tivesse estado presente").
