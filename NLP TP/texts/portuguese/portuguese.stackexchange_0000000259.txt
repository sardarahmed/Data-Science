Q:

Are the spellings «acção» or «óptimo» correct or not?

After the orthography reform of 2009, silent consonants are not written any more. But I still see the words like acção or óptimo written exactly like that.
Is this incorrect as of 2009 official rules? 

A:

You are right, with the 2009 rules this is incorrect. Some public figures (such as writers) refused to adopt the new rules, and this is most probably the reason you still words spelled that way. Other cause maybe that some people (most) still haven't adapted to the new rules.
