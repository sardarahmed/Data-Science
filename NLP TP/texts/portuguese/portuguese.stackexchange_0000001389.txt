Q:

What is the demonym for those who are born and bred in the district of Bragança, in the extreme Portuguese northeast?

There is a city in São Paulo, Brazil, called "Bragança Paulista".  Those who are born there are called "bragantinos".  What is the demonym for the Portuguese district of Bragança?  I've heard "brigantino", "bragançano", and "braganção".  Perhaps those from southern Portugal use one form and those from the north use another. I'm interested in learning which one a native from Bragança would choose to refer to himself.

A:

My source, a friend born and bred in the town of Bragança, tells me people from her home town are brigantinos or bragançanos. Brigantino is the more common demonym, and derives from the town's ancient name Brigantia. I am not aware of a name for people from the distrit of Bragança as such, or for people from any other Portuguese district for that matter. 
People in Portugal identify themselves with their municipality, which, unlike districts, are very old entities with directly elected officials. The distric of Bragança comprises twelve municipalities. There are names for people from each of these: mirandês or mirandense for someone from Miranda do Douro, vila-florense for  someone from Vila Flor, and so on. 

A:

In Portugal, those from Bragança are brigantinos or bragantinos.
Wikipedia also registers bragançano, braganção, and bragancês, but as a portuense I'm not familiar with these.
It's difficult to be sure; because of the complexity of the demonyms (albicastrense, escalabitano, oliventino, etc), they are often not very well-known. This could easily explain the origin of the different registers.
