Q:

How to say "current surface maps" in Portuguese?

I want to find weather map forecasts with iso-pressure lines and cold and warm fronts, such as this one from the US government:

Warm fronts are in red with triangles, cold fronts are in blue with semicircles.
What is the name in Portuguese?

A:

In Brazilian portugueses, literally you can say 

mapas atuais da superfície

to be sure about the context, I searched some meteorological pages in portuguese like this

A:

I've seen it called "mapa de superfície atual" or "carta de superfície atual" in weather forecast sites. It shows meteorological conditions on surface level (which is not to be confused with sea level) at a specific point in time.  You can also see forecast surface maps for, say, the next morning. There are also "mapas de altitude".
You can find such maps in Portuguese at INPE-Cartas de Superfície (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais)

The Mixed Surface Analysis map shows a comprehensive analysis of current conditions and fronts at ground level using radar and infrared satellite imagery. The Surface Analysis loop animation shows sequential maps at 3 hour intervals for the past 18 hours. A surface weather analysis is a special type of weather map that provides a view of weather elements over a geographical area at a specified time based on information from ground-based weather stations. Weather maps are created by plotting or tracing the values of relevant quantities such as sea level pressure, temperature, and cloud cover onto a geographical map to help find synoptic scale features such as weather fronts.

The above map shows that "current" means "at this moment", not "air current" or any kind of stream.

I've edited and hope this settles any existing doubts about what "current" means in this context.
