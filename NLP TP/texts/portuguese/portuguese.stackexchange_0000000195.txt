Q:

What is the subjunctive in Portuguese?

While learning Portuguese, I've come across the subjunctive. As it was described to me, it was a "feeling" of uncertainty, or wishful.
Is that the true definition? Is there a better way to define it?

A:

O subjuntivo é usado para situações supostas ou imaginárias, para expressar dúvidas ou ações condicionais.
Suponhamos que termine nosso dinheiro, o que faremos?
Let's suppose that our money were finished, what will we do?
Caso venhas, ficarás em minha casa.
In case you come, you will stay in my house.
