Q:

What does it mean "goró"? It is word from Portuguese.
hypothesis: is it a slang for alcohol
And what is its grammatical gender?
Thank you.

A:

In Brazilian Portuguese, "goró" is a slang word used to refer to alcoholic beverages (usually vodka, whisky, beer, etc.), but can also mean specifically the "cachaça". It's gender is masculine, so if you want to say that you will have a drink, it could be said as:

Vou tomar um goró. 

Or in the plural:

Vou tomar uns gorós. 

It's not so common, but sometimes you still hear someone say this slang, although it's not at every region in Brazil that people will know what "goró" means.
