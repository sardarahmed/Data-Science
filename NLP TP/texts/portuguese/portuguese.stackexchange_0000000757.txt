Q:

Use of the word "ecrã"

In some texts of European Portuguese it's common to see the word ecrã to refer to a computer screen, but it isn't used in Brazilian Portuguese if I'm not wrong.
I'd like to know what the popular meaning for this word is. Is it used only for computers — or also for TVs and smartphones, for example? In European Portuguese is the word tela used for the same purpose?
I know that Wikipedia and other sources indicate the words (ecrã and tela) as synonyms, but I'm looking for the popular use.
