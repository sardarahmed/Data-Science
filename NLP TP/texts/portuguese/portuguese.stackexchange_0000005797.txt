Q:

Do diacritical marks (accents) affect alphabetical sorting of words?

Do accents (like ^, ', ~, or even the Ç) affect the order of words, when sorting them?
As a native speaker I never considered those diacritical marks relevant when ordering words, but I would like to know if there is an official source confirming this expectation (or perhaps denying it).

A:

If you're talking about alphabetical ordering in dictionaries or printed indices at the end of books, then the order is this one:

a < á < à < â < ã
  c < ç

So we have:

ca (because/for/than) < cá < cà (ca + a before AO 1990) < cã (white hair)
laca < laça

However, this only comes into play as a tie-breaking rule for when two words differ only in their diacritics (in collation lingo, it's a secondary difference):

pelo < pêlo (before A0 1990) < peloiro (= pelouro)
