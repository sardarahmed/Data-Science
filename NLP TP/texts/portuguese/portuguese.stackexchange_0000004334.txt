Q:

What are the common tennis terms in Portuguese?

Particularly for: 

advantage set / tiebreaker set
game
set
match
love (the term used for 0 or a no score situation)
15/30/40
deuce
advantage in / advantage out

A:

There is a distinction in sports terms between the two major translation markets. In Brazilian Portuguese, the main trend is to keep it as close as the English term as possible:

"tiebreak" (sometimes "tiebreaker") for tiebreaker set
"game" / "game point" for game / game point
"set" / "set point" for set / set point
"partida" or "jogo" / "match point" for match / match point 
"deuce" for deuce
"bye" for bye (when a player advances without having to play)
"wildcard" for wildcard

In European Portuguese, it is generally preferred to find a local expression whenever it is possible:

"set decisivo" for tiebreaker set
"jogo" / "ponto do jogo" for game / game point
"set" / "ponto do set" for set / set point
"partida" / "ponto da partida" for match / match point
"iguais" for deuce
"avanço automático" for bye (when a player advances without having to play)
"coringa" for wildcard

However, due to geopolitical and economical influences, the Brazilian mindset is gaining ground over the European one, and quickly. I want to keep this answer as short as possible, but I can comment on them if you believe they are needed for context. 
Terms which are common for both countries:

"vantagem confirmada" for advantage set
"zero" for love (but "zero a zero" for 0-0)
all numbers are said in local language:

"quinze" or "15" for 15
"trinta" or "30" for 30
"quarenta" or "40" for 40
OBS: Portuguese language prefers numbers written in full.

"vantagem" for both advantage in / advantage out
"break point" / "duplo break point" / "triplo break point" for break point / double break point / triple break point
"ace" for ace
"falta" / "falta dupla" for fault / double fault
"quadra de grama" / "quadra de saibro" / "quadra de cimento" for grass court / clay court / hard court
OBS: it is usual to drop the "quadra de", e.g., "Roland Garros é
  jogado no saibro" for Roland Garros is played on clay courts
"serviço" / "primeiro serviço" / "segundo serviço" for service / first service / second service
"fora" for out
"voleio" / "largadinha" for volley / drop shot
OBS: every other play is called by its English name: "stroke", "slice",
  "smash", "lob"...
