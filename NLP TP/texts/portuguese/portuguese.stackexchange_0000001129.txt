Q:

What's the best way to say "don't reinvent the wheel"?

In this answer on SOpt, I mentioned "não reiventar a roda"-- in an attempt to say, "don't reinvent the wheel". Is this the right "translation" for this idiom? The idiom, for better or worse, means:
Do not make/create/invent something from scratch that has already been made/created/invented -- use what is already there!

A:

The expression "reinventar a roda" is in fact the correct translation for "reinvent the wheel", and is of common usage at least in Brazil. This Wikipedia article (in Portuguese) have more information about this expression.
Note however that when using in the imperative form, you should use "reinvente" instead of "reinventar". Examples:

Não reinvente a roda!
Em geral, não é bom reinventar a roda.

Your usage in that SOpt answer is correct in this regard BTW, although I'd use "não tente reinventar a roda" (implicit "você") or "não tentes reinventar a roda" (implicit "tu").
