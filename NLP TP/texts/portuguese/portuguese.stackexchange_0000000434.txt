Q:

What is the meaning and appropriate usage of "fazer com que"?

Here are some examples:**

Bancos têm de fazer com que o cliente distinga produtos com e sem risco
Faremos com que o caminho da violência para a política seja mais difícil de percorrer.
Chegou a hora de virar a página e de fazer com que a projecto europeu encarrilhe de novo.

It seems that the word means to make or to cause something to happen ("make the client distinguish", "make the path harder" and "make the project restart", respectively). Is that roughly correct and a good guide to when this verb should be used?
I'm also curious if this way of speaking has some ties to formality/informality or regional dialects. Some corners of the internet have reported that fazer com que is ungrammatical; if that's true, does it influence where it is appropriate to use it?

** The first quote is a May 2015 headline, and the other two were on bab.la's text search (a line from a TED talk, and from European Parliamentary proceedings).

A:

That is not a phrasal verb, but it means exactly what you said, to make. The "com" may be dropped, and no meaning is lost – but emphasis and euphony are. 
Note that this is only used with verbs in the subjunctive:
fazer com que eu vá
*fazer com que eu vou 

* means the sentence is agrammatical
