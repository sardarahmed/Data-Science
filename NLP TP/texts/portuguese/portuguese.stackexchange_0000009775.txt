Q:

Is "conhecer" pronounced precisely the way as if it were "conecer"?

In the likes of espanhol, the h makes the word sound a certain way and which is different as if it were espanol.
However, in the verd conhecer, for instance, does the h make any difference at all? It's pronounced as if there was no h in it, isn't it? Why is it there then?

A:

The sound of nh is different from the n and so the h is indeed there for a reason. It is the sound that in IPA could be represented by /ɲ/, a nasal palatal either as a voiced sound or an approximant. In Brazillian Portuguese, the whole word could be pronounced as /kõ.ɲeˈseʁ/ (the pronunciation of letters such as the o or the r may vary but uniformly the sound /ɲ/ will be realized for nh).
In Spanish, this sound that we represent by the digraph nh is represented by the letter ñ; the pronunciation of nh and ñ are virtually the same in the two languages.

A:

The 'nh' in European Portuguese has the same sound as the 'ñ' in Spanish. This causes conhecer to be pronounced differently from conecer (which is not a word in Portuguese). The answer given by the Brazilian also applies to eu-pt.
