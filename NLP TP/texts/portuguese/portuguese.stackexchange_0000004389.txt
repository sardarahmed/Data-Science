Q:

How to transliterate 中文 in Mandarin pronunciation to Portuguese?

I am working on an art project that I would like to collect the hundreds of different transliterations of 「中文」 zhōng wén in Mandarin Chinese. (Pronunciation available here: https://translate.google.com/#zh-CN/de/中文)
How can I transliterate zhōng wén in Portuguese? (For example, "zhong wen" would be the closest pronunciation in English.)

A:

For European Portuguese, the best transliteration that I can find is:

xhoun'uén

Explanation:

We don't have the "xh" sound, but neither does English have "zh".
I think it would be understood.
We could also use "ch" instead of "x" here - it has this same sound.
But with "ch" I can't find a way to mark the light separation between the consonants and the vowels - the h in "zhōng".
The "ou" could mean a longer o sound ("choupo"), but also a sound like the name of the vowel "o" in English: /ou/ .
The apostrophe is used in Portuguese to mark elision of letters, mostly in informal speech.
The "é" is an /ɛ/, an open e. (see http://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/ipa-sounds/ipa-chart-with-sounds/ )
