Q:

The meaning of "Batuta"

According to the Priberam definition, the word "Batuta" applied to people denotes someone brave, fearless.
In Brazil we  have a famous movie named "Os Batutinhas" ("The Little Rascals" in the original), which leads me to believe that the word can be used as a synonym for "bad children".
Besides, I always see the same word being used to denote a "cool guy" like in:

Obrigado por me devolver o livro, você é um cara batuta.

So, which is the most common meaning of "Batuta"? Are there some differences between regions (maybe between countries)?

A:

"Os batutinhas" is an old TV series from the early 50's and I often watched it when I was a teenager.  
As far as the word is concerned, "batuta" can mean "baton" the stick an orchestra conductor uses.  It can also mean "a bully guy", though.  
In the diminutive form, to me it sounds like "os capetinhas", "os endiabrados", "aqueles que estão sempre aprontando alguma" and of course it refers to children under the age of ten.
As for "você é um cara batuta", I've heard it a few times and it can mean anything good, like: "you are a nice guy" or, in Portuguese, "tu és um cara legal" (I prefer this one) or "tu és um cara safo", "tu és boa gente", "tu és sangue bom", all of these slang phrases.
