Q:

What would they say after a sneeze in the 1950’s in Rio?

My grandma learned Portuguese in Rio in early 1950’s, and years later when anyone sneezed she’d respond in Portuguese.
I can’t remember her words now, but it’s not any of the words from other questions that I checked...
Also, if you sneezed a 2nd or 3rd time she’d say “outra vez, outra vez.”
Would anyone happen to know if they used to say something different that long ago?

A:

Born and raised in Rio, the usual comment I would hear after someone sneezed was, and still is, "saúde".  Saúde translates as "health" and the person who says it is expressing a wish of "good health".
Less frequently one might hear "Deus te abençoe" ("God bless you")  
In 21st Century Portugal I've heard "santinho".  ("little saint") which you hardly ever hear in Brazil.
