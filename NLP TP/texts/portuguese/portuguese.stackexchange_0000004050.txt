Q:

"a essa altura do campeonato..." How can we explain its usage to a non-native speaker?

If you explain it means "depois de tantos acontecimentos", one who is learning Portuguese as a foreign language may come up with "a essa altura do campeonato o povo acaba/acabou ficando anestesiado" or, worse, "a essa altura do campeonato eu nem vou trabalhar amanhã".  Then again, if you say it means "tarde demais", you may hear them say something like "Eu cheguei a essa altura do campeonato" or "Encontrar às 11 da noite? Para mim é a essa altura do campeonato."
To explain that "a essa altura do campeonato" means "depois de tantos acontecimentos" or "tarde demais" is an easy task.  However, how can we explain its usage?
EDIT
In addition to definition and examples, the answer I'm looking for should explain usage.  Something like "use it if the context is such..." and "don't use it if the context simply..."
EDIT II
Not everyone seems to understand what I'm looking for.   The answer to my question must include definition of "a essa altura do campeonato", example sentences and. most important, why one uses it, what's the implied mood? (surprise? anger? hopelessness? none of these?) 

A:

I love explaining topics to students by providing some examples, show your friend some examples so that they will get it easier. I know how hard it is to try to learn a language by single words, it sucks. I get it much easier by seeing an example than being taught by a professional. 
Here are some examples that I made up of conversations including that expression: 

Philip: Hey, bro! How is life going?
You: It is falling apart! 
Philip: Why?? Have you lost your job?
You: No, worse! My girlfriend and I have recently argued and she decided to move to Italy. I love her so much, I wish she were here.
Philip: So, why don't you go there and bring her back? You have a car, maybe you still reach her!
You: Nah! A essa altura do campeonato, she must be about 1000 KMs away from here.
Philip: It's never too late!
