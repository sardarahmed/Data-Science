Q:

When to use "fui" and "era"

I'm having a hard time figuring out when to use fui or era. For example, you say Nòs fomos estudantes, but you can also say Eu era dancarina. They are both in the past, but not a specific point in time, yet one is using fui. It is a bit confusing. Any help would be great!

A:

The main difference is aspectual. "Fui" is conjugated in what we call pretérito perfeito, which usually means that it happened in the past and it ended shortly afterwards. "Era" is conjugated in what we call pretérito imperfeito, which means that it happened in the past but it was for a longer time. Since you are conjugating the verb ser, it doesn't make a difference which one you should use for semantic reasons that this verb has.
If you used another verb such as "dançar", we would have different results:

• Eu dancei muito (I danced a lot) — pretérito perfeito

• Eu dançava muito (I used to dance a lot) — pretérito imperfeito
