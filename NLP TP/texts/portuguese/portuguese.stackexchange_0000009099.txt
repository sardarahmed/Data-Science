Q:

Use of "Dar" to mean find

One of the uses of the verb dar in Portuguese seems to be "to find" as per the definition in Priberam:

Dar
[...]
28. Achar, descobrir, encontrar (ex.: deu com a fotografia escondida no livro).

However, I've found some people online suggest that using it this way sounds like broken Portuguese outside of  fixed expressions like "Dar um jeito" and properly it should only be used in the phrase ""deu de cara com" outside of some fixed expressions.
So, I was wondering if using dar/deu to say "find" actually sounds broken if it  isn't in "deu de cara com" or fixed expressions like "dar um jeito"

A:

I am from Portugal, and I am perfectly familiar with that usage. There’s nothing broken about it. I reckon people who said it are just not familiar with it. Maybe younger folk don’t use it.
Anyway, the way you put it, which is the way Priberam puts it, is confusing. It is dar com, not just dar, that means ’to find’. In my experience it is especially used when you find things in unexpected places, or people doing unexpected things, or hiding, or doing things they were not supposed to do. Examples from the Dicionário da Academia das Ciências de Lisboa (2001; dar II.5):

Deu com as crianças na despensa a comerem as bolachas
Demos com a porta da casa arrombada
Demos com ele a mexer na minha carteira

It can be a good surprise:

Acordei a meio da noite, fui beber água, e dei com o João a arrumar a cozinha; ele que nunca faz nada em casa!

It’s also used when you can’t find something:

Ando aqui às voltas há montes de tempo, e não consigo dar com a tal loja
