Q:

Is there a comprehensive list of Portuguese words ranked by frequency of use which is freely available online?

While studying Chinese I was presented to a a number of lists of most commonly employed characters, which is a truly invaluable resource for beginners and teachers approaching a foreign language. 
Soon after I found out such lists exist for a number of idioms (e.g. English, French), from which fascinating discussions regarding geographical and area-specific differences of vocabulary use. 
However I cannot find the same (i.e. freely available online resource) for Portuguese language. 
Please, would anyone know here of some website containing such a database?

A:

As Artefacto pointed out in a comment, Linguateca gives access to several corpora with the frequency information you're seeking. Check their Rank and frequency in Portuguese.
