Q:

Are there any good free online Portuguese courses?

I recently started to learn European Portuguese (ptPT) and I wonder if there are any good (free) online courses or webs/apps to learn and train. I already have training books etc, but I'd like to have some learning app like duolingo or babbel. Unfortunately, these websites/apps are only available in ptBR.
Anyone knows any good app/service here?

A:

Well, I found http://www.memrise.com/. There are apps for iOS and Android, a good Web-interface, its free, and the courses are really good. Helped me a lot so far!
They even have ptBR AND ptPT :)
