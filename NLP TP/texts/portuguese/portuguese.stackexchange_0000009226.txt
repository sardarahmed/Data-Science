Q:

Na Espelho / Nas Espelho

In the mirror.  Would it not properly translate to Nas Espelho..
Because you have Na (in) and well you want to say As (the) mirror.
= Nas Espelho   the proper way to say
Meu reflexo aparece nas espelho

A:

No, it would not, it would be "no espelho". Word-for-word:

in + the + mirror

translates to

em + [o/a/os/as] + espelho

"Em" is the translation for "in"; "na" is a combination of "em" + "a" ("in the").
The definite article in Portuguese agrees with both the grammatical gender (masculine/feminine) and number (singular/plural) of what it refers to, a little like "he", "she", and "they" do in English. So "as" means "the" only for a feminine plural word. "Espelho" is a masculine and singular word, so its "the" should be "o", not "as":

em + o + espelho

And "em" + "o" becomes "no", not "na":

no espelho
