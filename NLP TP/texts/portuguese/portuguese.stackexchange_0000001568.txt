Q:

How would you translate "butt-hurt" into Portuguese?

Despite being fluent in BR-PT, I'm blanking on the possible equivalency. 
Butt-hurt means..."Getting your feelings hurt, being offended or getting all bent out of shape because of something petty or stupid." Basically, having an overemotional response to perceived insult. 

A:

I'd suggest a good translation to "butt-hurt" would be magoadinho/a, which is the diminutive form of magoado/a.
Portuguese definition of magoado:

adj. Que acabou por se magoar; que sofre ou expressa mágoa; em que há pesar; pesaroso.
Que possui nódoa; que sofreu uma contusão; contundido.
Que expressa ou sente dor (física).

Magoado/a, therefore, would translate to "(adj.) hurt" in English.
It is my understanding that "butt-hurt" has a derogatory tone to it, whilst also being a colloquialism.
Moreover, the diminutive form of words doesn't necessarily correlate to the "small form of the word", neither in English nor in Portuguese.
For instance: camisinha is not a small shirt; pegadinha is not (always) a small footstep; and both menininha and "girly" may be derogatory ways of saying that someone is too feminine.
Thus, magoadinho/a adds a derogatory, even sarcastic tone to being magoado/a, much like the transformation the prefix "butt-" does to "hurt" in the expression "butt-hurt".
