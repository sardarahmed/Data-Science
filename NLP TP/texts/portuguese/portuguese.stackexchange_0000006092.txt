Q:

what does kkkk mean in Portuguese?

We received feedback from our Portuguese user, but we couldn't understand what does he/she mean, even we translate to English with google translate, will please someone explain to us?
The original feedback was:

primeiro a avaliar kkkkk kkkkk decha o "sim" aqui em baixo kkkk

A:

A series of Ks is the way that laughter is generally represented in Brazilian Portuguese. It is akin to hahaha or hehe or lolol etc, in English, such that the longer it is the more the laughter.
Furthermore the automatic translator is stumbling because they write "decha" instead of "deixa", so the second bit was intended to be "leave a yes under here".
