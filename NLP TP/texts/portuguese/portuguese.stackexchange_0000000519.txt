Q:

Equivalent expression for “good timing”

In English there is an expression "good timing" which means that some event happened at the right time or that multiple events happened at the same time (when desirable).
Examples:

One of the secrets of cricket is good timing.
You arrived just when I needed you - good timing!

What would be a natural way to translate "good timing" to Portuguese?
Google Translate suggests "cronometragem boa" which sounds really strange and technical to me and "bom timing" which made me laugh but not very certain about it's validity ;)

A:

I believe that are several different possible translations for that, but I believe that best one is:
Sincronismo

[en] One of the secrets of cricket is good timing.
  [pt] Um dos segredos do cricket é o bom sincronismo.

For the example below, "sincronismo" works well, but it seems too technical. Perhaps a more colloquial way to say so would be:
Bem na hora

[en] You arrived just when I needed you - good timing!
  [pt] Você chegou bem quando eu precisava de você - bem na hora!

The following doesn't seem so natural, but also works:

[pt] Você chegou bem quando eu precisava de você - bem sincronizado!
