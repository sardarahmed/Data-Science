Q:

How to translate the word "Design" in Brazilian Portuguese?

Examples:

Please choose the proper design

The word 

"Design"

by it self in a menu option, what is the best way to put it?

Banner Design
Landing Page Design

What would be the proper translation for Brazilian Portuguese?

A:

This is a topic that has often bugged me. In technical fields, such as engineering or computer science, to design is to devise a product, service, or piece of knowledge to be produced or implemented. The best words in Portuguese to describe this action would be projetar or planejar (and their cognates):

Projeto de Pôster
Projeto de Página Inicial

A software designer, for instance, would be called engenheiro(a) de software in Portuguese.
That being said, in Portuguese, the word design is often used to describe art pieces as products or services already built, where planning is no longer implied. In those cases, I think estilo is better suited to convey the desired meaning:

"Vamos estilizar nossa página corretamente"
Por favor, escolha o estilo apropriado

For example, the occupation known as fashion designer is usually translated as estilista [de moda].
