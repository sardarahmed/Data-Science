Q:

How to translate "BOTH AM & PM" or " AM ONLY" or "PM ONLY" into Brazilian Portuguese?

My question pretty much has all the samples.
I was wondering if there was a better way to translate instead of using:

AM ONLY = APENAS DE MANHÃ
PM ONLY = APENAS DE TARDE  or APENAS NÁ TARDE?

Or do you guys think that Brazil is already well acquainted with AM and PM and leaving such translations as the ones below is perfectly fine?

AM e PM
Apenas AM
Apenas PM

A:

Most brazilians have no idea what "a.m." and "p.m." stand for. Even those who do will find it strange to see them being used in Portuguese.  You'll be safe saying:

pela manhã e à tarde
somente pela manhã
somente à tarde

You'll be even safer if you specify:
. aberto pela manhã de 8 às 12 h.
. acessível à tarde, das 15 às 18 h.
If all you say is "pela manhã", some people won't be sure whether you mean from 7.00, 8.00 or 9.00 a.m.  Likewise, "à tarde" can mean from 12 noon, 1 p.m., or 2.00 p.m.

A:

There is no translation to that, the correct Time format in Portuguese is the 24h format so this translation is unnecessary in Portuguese. 
The representation should be :
7:00h or 19:00h
07:00h is acceptable too.
