Q:

Other words to say "carro" in Portuguese-speaking countries

Eu vou de carro ao parque para fazer exercício.

I know in European Portuguese they call it differently. I tried looking it up but failed. Do you have other names for this transportation?

A:

Veículo or automóvel can be used instead of carro.
Viatura for police car.
In other contexts we can associate veículo and viatura to other means of transport also: truck, bus and motorcycle.
Slang:
Possante for turbo (fast) car.
Lata-velha (calhambeque) for old car.
