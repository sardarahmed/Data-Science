Q:

Short form of «versus» as «vs»

In English I can write A versus B, A vs B or A vs. B.
Can I do the same in Portuguese? 
Also, is the English word versus also versus in Portuguese?
I need to used it in sentence like Chicago time versus GMT time. So can I say Chicago time vs. GMT time? 

A:

I don't know about the general case, but in the case of sports games, I've seen what would be written as "vs." in the US written as "x" in Portuguese:

A x B

If you search the Portuguese Stack Overflow site for "x", you will find (hidden amongst all the other uses for "x" in programming) many examples of "x" being used where "vs." would be used in English, both in question titles and question bodies:

Phonegap x aplicação nativa

REST x Web Services: são a mesmas coisas?

Existe alguma diferença de consumo de memória em gravar os elementos HTML x objetos jQuery?

But you will also find "vs." used for this, just like in English.

versus is a word in Portuguese, with the same meaning and spelling as in English, but a slightly different pronunciation: /vérsus/ (as this is Portuguese, the final /us/ means English "oosh", not "uhss".) The Priberam dictionary gives contra as an exact synonym, meaning against. In some phrases, contra might be a more natural choice (just as against might in English).

A:

Yes, you can do the same in Portuguese. 
About the use of x: It is very common in Brazilian Portuguese. I am not sure about the use of x (for vs) in Portugal, but Artefacto’s answer gives some hints about it.
In Brazilian Portuguese x is often used in texts about sports matches as well. I don’t like it, but people do write o jogo Corinthians x Palmeiras in Brazilian papers and websites. The hyphen or dash (o jogo Corinthians-Palmeiras) is rarely used for this purpose in Brazil.
I see no problem using horário de Chicago vs. horário GMT (or vs or versus) in a table caption. I would use it myself.
