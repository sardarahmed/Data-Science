Q:

Is there an equivalent idiom for "when you get right down to it" in Portuguese?

"when you get right down to it" is an idiom meaning "all things considered"
e.g. "When you get right down to it, a human being is not a physical entity. A human being is a piece of software. Body cells are constantly dying and being replaced."
Is there a set phrase or idiom which conveys the same in Portuguese?

A:

Which option to choose depends a bit on the context, but you could say:

No fundo [or the more emphatic no fundo, no fundo]
No final das contas [or no fim das contas]
Na hora do "vamos ver" [or "do vamo vÃª"]
No frigir dos ovos
Ao fim e ao cabo

The last two are rarely used in informal situations, at least in Brazil. They also seem to be less known to younger generations.
