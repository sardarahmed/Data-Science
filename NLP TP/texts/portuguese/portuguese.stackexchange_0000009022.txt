Q:

"não assistas TV" - correct?

Let's say, I want to say to my friend "don't watch TV", with "tu". The imperative negative form of "assistir" is "(tu) não assistas". But when I search this very phrase in google, nothing appears, whereas for "(voce) não assista" some results do.
Why is that?
How to command to my friend "don't watch TV!"?

A:

Well, most Brazilians don’t use tu-conjugations, and tend to substitute the indicative for the imperative anyway. So you shouldn’t expect to hear não assistas TV from a Brazilian.
The Portuguese do use tu-conjugations, but they don’t say assistir TV; they say ver TV or, more commonly, ver televisão. So in Google you do find não vejas TV (16 results), não vejas televisão (156 results); não veja tv returns 1,280 results, most of them from Brazil, some from Portugal.
