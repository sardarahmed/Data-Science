Q:

dizer-lho -- correct?

I've just found this

E olhe, não sei se me fica mal dizer-lho, mas a rapariga quer-lhe deveras, João
Eduardo.

in a portuguese book.
However, this topic verb + -o and verb + -lo claims that verb-ar /verb-er + lo ==> verb-a / verb-e-lo. Namely, the r gets eliminated off a verb when a verb ends, among z and s, in r.
t
So, is this dizer-lho correct or not? What's a rule here then?
I'm asking about the Portuguese of Portugal only.

A:

The final r (or s/z) are dropped only when appending -o/a/os/as or when appending -nos after the 1st person plural.
The only exception is quer+o ⇒ quere-o (qué-lo is not really used that much).
