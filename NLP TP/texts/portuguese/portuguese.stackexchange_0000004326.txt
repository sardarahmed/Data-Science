Q:

"What a year!" Translation

What could I say for "What a year"?  In the context of:

"Today marks the end of my first year running a restaurant. And what a year!"
"Today, I'm one year older.  And what a year!"
"This is the end of my year in Venezuela.  But what a year!"

*Background rambling:*

I love that you can use the "que X" construction in Portuguese in such a more versatile way than anything in English.  For adjectives it's kind of "How X!" and nouns it's usually something like "What a X!" or "What X!"  "Que transito!" "Que pena!"  "Que chuva!"
However, my intuition tells me for something like "What a year!" as given in the examples above, "Que ano!" doesn't really work. (although like most of my intuitions about Portuguese recently, I don't know really know why that is.)

I'm sorry but your intuition is failing you. The best way to say "what a year!" in Portuguese is "que ano!".  Anything else that I can think of wouldn't be idiomatic: "eta ano!", "Ã´ ano!", "mas que ano, hein?"  These three examples might occasionally fit in some specific contexts but that would be all.
