Q:

How to translate "Minute Stepping" into Brazilian Portuguese?

This is related to working with time, as in hours and selecting minutes. 
As we know, minute stepping can be a custom setting, as in 5's, 10's, 20's, and so forth. How can I properly translate that into Brazilian Portuguese?
It doesn't have to be in a sentence, due to the fact that it can be a standalone option, such as in my case, "Select Minute Stepping". But we can use that in a sentence in the same way. "Please choose the appropriate minute stepping according to your desire". 

A:

Translation precedents seem to favor the word incremento:

Valor válido : Um número de três dígitos. Cada unidade representa um incremento de 5 minutos. Exemplo: "003" é igual a 15 minutos.

That being said, I like the term precisão, em minutos better. It is not unheard of:

In an example, it would be something like

Selecione a precisão, em minutos

If the minutes UI element is visible, you can drop em minutos, since it's implied:
Precisão:    1 minuto
             2 minutos
             5 minutos
             10 minutos
