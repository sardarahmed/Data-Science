Q:

Is there a word or slang in Brazilian Portuguese for smooth in this sense?

In English, the word smooth can be an adjective applied to an action that means doing something with a lot of skill to make it look effortless, or you could apply it to a person to - like "that guy is smooth". Typically it means that the person operates seemingly effortlessly often in a charming and very skilled manner. For example:
Girl: Are you lost?
Guy: Only in your eyes.
Girl: You're smooth.
Is there a word in Brazilian Portuguese for this term? One close word could be jeitoso but it doesn't seem to have exactly the same meaning.

A:

You may say that someone has a tender speech. In this case, "he is smooth" would sound something like:

Ele tem uma fala mansa.

or

Ele tem fala mansa.

You may end up sounding like someone from the beginning of the 20th century, though.
A friend commented the alternative "bom de lábia":

Ele é bom de lábia.

You should understand that these are, though close to the tone of smooth in the given example, not generalizable to actions in general.
For that, I would recommend the more formal "com maestria":

Ele performou um salto com maestria.
