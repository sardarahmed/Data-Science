Q:

What is the Portuguese translation for "sparkler" (german: "Wunderkerze")

I have searched dict.cc and google-translate. I have even asked my Portuguese friend. But apparently there is no Portuguese word for sparkler.
Is there?
PS:
This is what I mean:

A:

You can see here sometimes we don't translate "sparkler" in Portugal... When we translate, we use "Foguetes Mágicos", as you can see here and here.

A:

The name of the object is foguete.
This is a decoration mostly used (in Portugal at least) for birthday cakes.
Note that faísca would be spark, not sparkler.
