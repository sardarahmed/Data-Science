Q:

What is a "Doleiro"?

I often see in some programs the word doleiro, like in News. Usually, they are involved in corruption. But even searching on the internet, I'm not sure if this is a correct definition (Wikipédia):

Doleiro é o indivíduo que compra e vende dólares no mercado paralelo. Ao caracterizar alguém como doleiro a Polícia Federal já indicia a ele ao menos nos crimes de lavagem de dinheiro e evasão de divisas. Dessa forma, entende-se que o doleiro é quem converte moedas de um país sem autorização ou além dos limites permitidos das leis vigentes.

Is doleiro this? Is this definition correct? Is there any other possible meaning?
If someone can explain me with "easy words", because I'm not a fluent speaker of portuguese, I would be happy.

A:

Briefly, "doleiro" is the guy who gets your dirty money from crimes or illegal practices here in Brazil and deposits it in offshore tax-havens. 
By doing this, the "doleiro" is committing two crimes: "tax evasion" (evasão de divisas), which consists in withdrawing money from one country and depositing it in another country without any formal notification to the competent authorities) and "money laundering": hiding valuable objects resulting from illegal operations.
Because these amounts cannot simply be deposited into the beneficiary's bank account (such a move would raise suspicions), a "Doleiro" seeks a safe destination for the money.
It is quite common for a "doleiro" to own legal currency exchange offices, which are often used to secretly perform those irregular money operations. Very rarely can the Internal Revenue Service trace such moves.
I hope I was helpful.
