Q:

What is the most universal Brazilian pronunciation of -te at the end of a word?

Many Portuguese words end in -te.  What vowel sound should I make when pronouncing these words, particularly with a Brazilian pronunciation?
Various online sources transcribe these words using different vowel sounds, so I'm sure there's some variation, but what is most widely used?
Examples:

este
garçonete
colete
mote

I've seen these transcribed (at least) the following ways:

[-t͡ʃɨ]
[-t͡ʃə]
[-t͡ʃy]
[-t͡ʃi]
[-t͡ʃe]

That's a lot of variation! It covers practically an entire quarter of the IPA vowel chart.  Further, the use of /y/ seems odd to me, because I've never heard these words pronounced with a rounded vowel sound.  /i/ and /ɨ/ seem the most like what I've heard. Is there anything like an actual consensus on which pronunciation is most common?

A:

I made a separation by state/region and expanded the options a bit, ordering by my sense of most used forms by the people here in São Paulo in the day by day:

[-t͡ʃɨ]: São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Goiás, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul;
[-t͡ʃi]: São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Northern of Paraná, Goiás, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul;
[-ti]: Northeastern of Brazil (Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas, Pernambuco, Paraíba, Rio Grande do Norte, Tocantins, Ceará, Maranhão, Piauí), some parts of Santa Catarina (Itajaí valley, Florianópolis city);
[-te]: The capital of Paraná State (Curitiba), Inner Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul.

These ones I've never heard before, at least in Brazil:

[-t͡ʃy]
[-t͡ʃe]
[-t͡ʃə]

Conclusion: there is not exactly a consensus in Brazil as a whole. There can exist a consensus by the region or state. 
However, you can use any of the forms that you'll be understood in entire Brazil. Depending of the form, people will just realize you are a foreigner.
