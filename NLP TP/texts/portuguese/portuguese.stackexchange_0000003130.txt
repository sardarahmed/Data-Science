Q:

How could we best explain the idiom “vê lá, hein!” to a non-native speaker?

A non-native speaker of Portuguese has asked me to explain what "vê lá, hein!" means.
context:

pai ― "Sua mãe e eu vamos viajar e vamos ficar fora uma semana. Eu ouvi que seu primo Henrique disse que vai aproveitar e vem passar alguns dias aqui. Vocês dois vão ficar sozinhos... isso me preocupa."
filha ― Ora, papai, eu já tenho dezesseis anos e sei muito bem cuidar de mim. Não preciso de conselhos.
pai ― Vê lá, hein"

I was going to tell him it means "assim espero" (so I hope) but it just doesn't seem to convey the right meaning. It pretty much depends on intonation too, from a gentle "vê lá, hein!" to a loud and angry "vê lá, hein!".  In this particular case it would be the latter.

A:

In my experience as a European Portuguese speaker, vê lá in this context generally means:

Be careful with what you do or say; think of the consequences.

Now here we´re told it is a loud and angry vê lá. The daughter’s reply («não preciso de conselhos» or «I don’t need (your) advice») is the only reason I can see for the father’s anger. So I would interpret this vê lá as a warning for the daughter to watch her tongue. It would be like saying:

You be careful how you talk to me or there will be consequences.

For the sake of completeness, in a calm, even if severe, tone, vê lá would likely be meant as an exhortation for the daughter to behave wisely with her cousin.
Just a note on the individual words. Ver generally means see, but it can also mean examine, consider. I think it is this latter meaning that gave rise to vê lá. Lá generally means there, but here it is just a filler, a bit like here in look here. And hein (também grafado hem) is an interjection, in this case reinforcing what was said before; it could be interpreted as are we understood?
