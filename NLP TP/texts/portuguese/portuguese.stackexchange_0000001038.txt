Q:

What Portuguese proverb conveys "You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours"?

I'm trying to find an equivalent proverb in Portuguese.  Literally, (tu coças as minhas costas e eu coçarei as tuas) there isn't any that I know of.  Is there any in current usage in Brazil and/or Portugal which conveys "help me in my difficulties and I will help you in yours".

A:

You can use:

Uma mão lava a outra
