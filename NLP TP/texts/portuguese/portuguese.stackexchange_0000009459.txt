Q:

Is pretérito perfeito composto widely used in modern European and Brazilian Portuguese?

While thinking over this question in Latin community and pounding the differences in the use of composite past in French and Portuguese, I discovered that conjugation tables, discussions of Portuguese past tenses, or even Wikipedia sometimes do not even mention the composite variety of simple past (pretérito perfeito composto, aka eu tenho falado), discuss only pretérito perfeito (eu falei).
Is this tense somehow less important or very rare in modern Portuguese? Or does it have to do with the differences between the European and Brazilian Portuguese?

A:

No, it's not rare at all, even if it's of course not the most common tense.
I think this conjugation website gives the most common reason for conjugation tables to omit some or all of the compound tenses [1]:

Is the given verbal conjugation complete?
No.
For compound tenses conjugation is not shown, since those are easily constructed from the verb's past participle and an auxiliary verb

In general, there is a number of compound tenses (see also here), as well as the so-called locuções verbais, which might look quite like tenses themselves, and they're all for the most part fairly commonly used.

[1] Freely translated from the [original](https://conjuga-me.net/):

A conjugação verbal apresentada está completa?
Não.
Para os tempos compostos não aparece conjugação pois estes formam-se facilmente com o particípio passado do verbo e com um auxiliar
