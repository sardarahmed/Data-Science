Q:

"pelo andar da carruagem..." When and where did this saying originate?

To be honest, in my lifetime I've seen closed carriages only in films and museums, which  makes me suppose this expression was coined very long ago. Was it a foreign expression (French, for instance) which somebody translated into pt-PT and was brought to Brazil by the Portuguese?  Is it a genuine Portuguese saying? Or is it just a Brazilian expression?  Can you think of any contemporary expression in Portuguese having the same meaning?
"pelo andar da carruagem" translates as "the way things are going..." 

A:

According to several sites (e.g., this and this) it's part of a proverb:

Pelo andar da carruagem se vê quem vai de viagem. or
Pelo andar da carruagem se vê quem vem nela.

And I find no reputable source, but this site and this paper claim that this proverb is of Portuguese origin.
A more common expression with the same meaning is "Pelo jeito [que as coisas vão]."
