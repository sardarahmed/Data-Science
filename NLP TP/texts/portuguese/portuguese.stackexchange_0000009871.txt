Q:

Is there equivalent for "I'm starving to death" in Portuguese?

In English the sentence "I'm starving to death" in the meaning of "I'm very hungry" (rather than of a real pathological condition). Is there an equivalent in Portuguese (using the word 'death')?

A:

No expression with the exact word "death" (morte) comes to my mind, but the almost literal translation of the expression in English, i.e.,

Estou morrendo de fome.

("I'm dying of hunger.") is very common.

A:

From a Portuguese (Portugal) perspective, it is more common to say "*Estou a morrer de fome" than "Estou morrendo de fome".
In Portugal the gerund has been largely replaced by "a+infinitive".
Examples:
"Estou a comer um bolo." â€“ "I'm eating a cookie".
"Estou a passar a ferro."  - "I'm ironing clothes".
While in Brazilian Portuguese the main verb comes in the Gerund form, the European standard  uses the Infinitive form preceded by the preposition a.
