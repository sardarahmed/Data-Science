Q:

How would one translate "pick up lines"?

In English, there's the phrase pick up line. It stands for a sentence or group of sentences (usually not more than a few, definitely less than a paragraph) that indicate an attempt at one person to "pick up", or attract attention from, someone of the opposite sex.
Some samples of pick up lines in English are:

Did it hurt? When you fell from heaven?
Hey baby, I wish you were asynchronous, so you'd give me a callback.
Guess what I'm wearing? The smile you gave me.
Know what's on the menu? Me 'n U.

I know (or suspect) that similar "lines" exist in Portuguese, but what are they called? Linha de levantar doesn't seem like it fits.

A:

In Brazilian Portuguese, the best translation would be the substantive "cantada":

sf bras, coloq* seduction and a proposition. dar/passar uma cantada em to make a pass at someone, to chat someone up.

But I should add that there are some other completely different meanings for the word "cantada" (specially as an adjective or verb instead of a substantive).
And, as stated by bfavaretto in a comment, the word "xaveco" probably also fits.
However, in my personal opinion, "cantada" fits better than "xaveco" because for me "xaveco" seems to be a bit (but only a bit) too broad for this because it could also fits sometimes (but surely not always) as a synonym for "paquera". And "paquera", although related, is clearly not the same thing as "cantada".
* "sf bras, coloq" means feminine substantive, Brazilian, coloquial

A:

In European Portuguese, a possible translation is frase de engate.
