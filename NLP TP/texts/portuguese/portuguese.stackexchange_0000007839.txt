Q:

Which term would be appropriate to say "next" on a button within a sequence of pages?

I have a digital wizard-like survey that has multiple pages with buttons "previous", "save" and "next" on it.
What term would sound more natural to label the button "Next", to prompt a user to proceed to the next page?
(1) Siguiente or (2) Seguinte?

A:

In PT-BR, you could use:

Back -> Anterior
Back -> Voltar
Next -> PrÃ³ximo 
Next -> Continuar
Save -> Salvar

A:

In Portuguese, you could use, like in the example shown in the image below:

Back -> Anterior
Next -> Continuar
Save -> Guardar
