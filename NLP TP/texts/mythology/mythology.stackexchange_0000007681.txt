Q:

What is a type of creature that steals souls?

I an writing a book, and I cannot find any soul stealing creatures that still look human! I was wondering if you could give me any examples?

A:

This appears to be a folkloric belief that has gained significant traction in the era of modern horror fiction.

The wiki for Soul Eater mentions an introduction of this idea in the Iliad:

But when even Bellerophon came to be hated of all the gods, then verily he wandered alone over the Aleian plain, devouring his own soul, and shunning the paths of men

Iliad, 6, 202-204
The wiki also traces the origin primarily to the Hausa people of Nigeria, and includes multiple academic references, chiefly:
Witchcraft, Sorcery, Rumors and Gossip. (Cambridge University Press, 2004)
"Black Stomachs, Beautiful Stones: Soul-Eating among Hausa in Niger." In: Modernity and Its Malcontents: Ritual and Power in Postcolonial Africa. (University of Chicago Press, 1993)

I'd also posit that this is the function of incubi and succubi, in that interaction with these creatures would result in the devil stealing one's soul.
