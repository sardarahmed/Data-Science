Q:

Is there a Greek myth where a father tries to protect his son, but the son dies anyway?

I heard a myth when I was a child and I think it was about how a father had a prophecy that his son would die. He took it seriously and attempted to protect his son but in doing so his son died. Sort of like you cannot escape fate kind of direction. Does anyone know if this is an actual myth and what the people involved were?

A:

The most famous myth corresponding with your query would be the tale of Daedalus & Ikarus. 
In the period of Romanticism, Daedalus came to denote the classic artist, a skilled mature craftsman, while Icarus symbolized the romantic artist, whose impetuous, passionate and rebellious nature, as well as his defiance of formal aesthetic and social conventions, may ultimately prove to be self-destructive. 
Stephen Dedalus, in Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man envisages his future artist-self "a winged form flying above the waves ... a hawk-like man flying sunward above the sea, a prophecy of the end he had been born to serve‚Äù.

A:

Zeus and Sarpedon (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarpedon_(Trojan_War_hero)), note that Zeus is the highest deity in the Greek pantheon. For the reasons of his inability to save Sarpedon cf. 

To the Moirai (Moirae, Fates) the might of Zeus must bow; and by the
  Immortals' purpose all these things had come to pass, or by the
  Moirai's ordinance.

The Moirai and the Horae are children of Zeus and Themis. Themis symbolizes a universal balance and order that can never be broken, not even by Zeus :
