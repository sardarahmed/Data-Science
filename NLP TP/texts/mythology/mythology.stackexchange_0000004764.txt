Q:

Who was Thalia's mother?

I do not mean Thalia the muse/grace/nereid. I speak of Thalia the nymph, daughter of Hephaestus. She has a stub Wikipedia page that says Zeus forced he in the form of an eagle and buried her body to avoid Hera's jealousy. But , it makes no note of who Thalia's mother was.

A:

I've done some preliminary research, and found nothing on Thaleia. 
This is one of those wonderful little "mythical myths" where the only sources are secondary: all we know of this nymph comes from a mention in ancient text "The Life of Aeschylus" with no author attributed. The mention is apparently in relation to a lost play of Aeschylus.
So that's all the information there is, and it's highly unlikely there will be any more information forthcoming.

PS- thanks for raising this question.  The wikipedia article should be amended to use the spelling in the sole reference, Thaleia, because the current spelling in the wiki injects needless confusion.
