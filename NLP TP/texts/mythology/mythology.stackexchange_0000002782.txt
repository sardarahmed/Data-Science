Q:

Famous treasure related with the Norse gods?

Is there any famous treasure related with the gods of Norse mythology? Something like a famous vault or maybe cave. An accumulation of important things that they wanted to protect, for instance.

A:

The Norse gods of the sagas don't seem to have accumulated treasure in caves or chests, but they had many marvellous items, mostly made by the dwarfs. They included Frey's ship, Skíðblaðnir and boar, Gullinbursti, Odin's spear Gungnir and ring Draupnir, and Thor's hammer, Mjölnir. 
The Nibelungenlied tells of the Rhine Gold, which later became a key feature of Wagner's Ring Cycle of music dramas. 

A:

If you are looking for archaeological evidence of Norse/Viking (unfortunately, the terms are often used interchangeably) religious practices, then there are a number of academic papers available online (for example, this one titled Evidence of the Viking Religion Through Archaeology). Much of that evidence comes from grave goods (like miniature Thor's hammer (or, "torshammere") amulets), deposited in Norse/Viking burials, but there are also several examples of carved monuments and standing stones (like the Ardre stones from Gotland) that depict aspects from Norse Mythology.
Many pagan "cult" sites associated with Norse/Viking mythology have been discovered in Scandinavia. A good example is the temple site at Gamla Uppsala, where archaeological investigations have revealed the remains of the temple dedicated to Thor, Odin, and Freyr.
In the case, of the temples at Gamla Uppsala, we have an account of how the temple actually appeared in the 11th-century in Adam of Bremen's Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum. It is perhaps worth mentioning that Uppsalla was also described as being the domain of Freyr in the Ynglinga Saga. A number of translations of the Ynglinga Saga are available online, for example here.
