Q:

Japanese Trickster Demons

Are there any trickster demons in Japanese mythology, I am aware of the somewhat tricksy Japanese god Susanoo-no-Mikoto, but are there any demons known for tricking people in Japanese mythology?

A:

Tengu (天狗)

A lot of my knowledge about them comes from the oral tradition, but the Wiki makes an interesting point that they were originally regarded as demons in the Buddhist context.  In the Shinto contexts, they were simply yōkai (妖怪).
Tengu are often thought of as a type of forest goblin, and may be benefactors or adversaries, which is typical of tricksters.
Tengu are known for their long noses and, often, their martial skills, particularly with the sword.
