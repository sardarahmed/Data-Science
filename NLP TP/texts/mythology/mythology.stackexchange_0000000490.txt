Q:

What were the five parts of the Egyptian soul?

This is an offshoot of a question asked about the Ba and Ka. 
What were the other 3 parts of the Egyptian soul and what did they represent?

A:

The five parts of the Egyptian soul were the Ren, the Ba, the Ka, the Sheut, and the Ib. 

The Ren was the name given to a person at birth. Egyptians believed it was part of a person's soul and that  it would live for as long as that name was spoken or the person remembered.
The Sheut was the person's shadow or silhouette. Egyptians believed that the shadow, somehow, contained part of the essence of the person.
The Ib was a metaphysical heart and to ancient Egyptians it was the focus of emotion, thought, will and intention. They understood it as the seat for the soul.
The Ba was the notion of personality. Everything that makes a person unique.
The Ka was the vital fire or spark, that distinguishes living people from dead (warm vs. cold).

A:

The ancient egyptians believed the five parts of the soul were the Ba, the Ren, the Ib, the Ka, and the Sheut.

The Ba was the personality, whatever makes them unique.
The Ren was the secret name, the identity of the person. They still exist even if they die if their name is remembered.
The Ka was the life force that leaves the body when it dies. The ka can also power spells, but doing so can be deadly.
The Ib is the heart, the record of good and bad deeds. It is weighed against the feather of truth. If the spirit passes the test, it was blessed with Aruu, the Egyptian paradise. If it failed, the heart was eaten by Ammit the Devourer.
The lais the last part of the soul is the Sheut, or the shadow. It could be used to perform a shadow execration, even more powerful than a standard execration. It was the silhouette of the soul, a backup copy.
