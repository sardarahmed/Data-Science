Q:

Twice a bridesmaid, never a bride?

I was reading Lafcadio Hearn's New Orleans Superstitions, when I came upon this proverb:  

There are many superstitions about marriage, which seem to have a European origin, but are not less interesting on that account. "Twice a bridesmaid, never a bride," is a proverb which needs no comment. 

Is there a vodun, voodoo or even European story behind the superstition? 

A:

From what I gather, the origin is uncertain, but it seems common sense that "if association with a bride and the high profile of the day did not attract a husband after two opportunities, then perhaps there was little hope" (Marriage Customs of the World 98).
In terms of pinpointing the locale of the superstition, I believe that the modern use of bridesmaids -- in the sense that they appear alongside the bride at the time of wedding -- stems perhaps from Biblical origins, at least if you believe Wikipedia, and so it makes sense that this superstition would crop up in Europe. 
Further research is needed.
