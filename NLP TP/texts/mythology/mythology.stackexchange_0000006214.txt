Q:

Ancient celtic-iberian deity roughly named "Pecosuosucivo"

I'm looking for the exact name and possible etymology of an ancient celtic-iberian deity roughly named "Pecosuosucivo", as I can faintly recollect. Probably linked with the town Úbeda in the province of Jaén. Any suggestions are welcome!

A:

This name doesn't seem Celtic. It could be derived from vulgar Latin based on:
Pecus (guard) suos (acc. plural oneself) succentīvus ([those]around)
or 
Pecus (guard) suos (acc. plural oneself) su (over, on, regarding) cibo (food)
Pecus can also derive from the Indo-European root for "livestock" but that doesn't seem to make much sense here.
