Q:

Why is it so bad to be born in the Year of the Fire Horse?

Japan's birth rate dropped precipitiously in 1966, only to recover completely in 1967.

This is apparently because 1966 was the "Year of the Fire Horse" - that is, in the 60-year zodiacal cycle you get by crossing the twelve zodiac animals with the five traditional elements (fire, water, earth, wood, metal), 1966 was in the Horse Year of the Fire cycle - and women actively avoided having children in that year because children born in that year were said to have poor prospects for marriage.
Is there some sort of mythological story explaining why it's so bad to be born in the Year of the Fire Horse? 

A:

1966 was a hinoe-uma (丙午) year. This does not come from "crossing zodiac with elements" per se, but is instead a specific combination of celestial stem and earthly branch in the traditional sexagenary dating system.
Both the stem hinoe (丙) and branch uma (午) belonged to the element of fire. This overabundance of fieriness informs the astrological interpretations that those born on this year have a fiery character - impulsive, vociferous, quick to anger. To the Japanese in particular, hinoe uma is believed to a year of disasters due to its (somewhat irrational) association with great fires.
Specifically, there is a traditional superstition in Japan that women born in the year of hinoe-uma would shorten their husbands' life (and presumably vice versa but not quite as oft-repeated). This interpretation seems motivated (with little basis) by the great fires of Edo, and was popularised along with such tales as that of attempted arsonist Yaoya Oshichi.
Oshichi had a crush on someone she met during a previous fire, and attempted to set another fire in order to meet him again. Notably, she is believed to have been born in 1666, a hinoe-um year.
