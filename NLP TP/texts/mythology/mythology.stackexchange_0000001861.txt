Q:

Is Zeus subject to the decrees of the Moirai?

In Herodotus's Histories (I.91) it is said:

When the Lydians came, and spoke as they had been instructed, the
  priestess (it is said) made the following reply. â€œNo one may escape
  his lot, not even a god.

This would seem to indicate that the gods are subject to the whims of the Fates. Of course, this is also simply the opinion of a mortal, albeit a priestess. 
Contrariwise, Zeus is often considered as the leader of the Olympians, with all of them subject to his will. This would seem to include the Moirai. 
Is there any evidence for or against Zeus being subject to the will of the Fates? 

A:

Yes, surprisingly,

The Moirai were independent, at the helm of necessity, directed fate, and watched that the fate assigned to every being by eternal laws might take its course without obstruction; and Zeus, as well as the other gods and man, had to submit to them.

From here

Quintus Smyrnaeus,
"To the Moirai (Moirae, Fates) the might of Zeus must bow; and by the Immortals' purpose all these things had come to pass, or by the Moirai's ordinance."

We see this directly in a known myth,

Nonnus, Dionysiaca,
"[Zeus swore he would grant Semele a wish, but she requested he appear before her in his full glory which would bring her destruction :] Father Zeus heard, and blamed the jealous Moirai (Moirae, Fates), and pitied Semele so soon to die . . . [Zeus tried to dissuade her] but he had no thought of fighting against the threads of Fate."

But Zeus was the guide...

Pausanias, Description of Greece
"[In the temple of Zeus at Megara :] Above the head of Zeus are the Horai (Horae, Seasons) and Moirai (Moirae, Fates), and all may see that he is the only god obeyed by Moira (Destiny)."
Pausanias, Description of Greece
"[In the shrine of Despoine (Despoena) at Akakesion (Acacesium) in Arkadia :] On the first relief are wrought Moirai (Moirae) and Zeus surnamed Moiragetes (Guide of Fate)."

Zeus was the Moiragetes- the Guide.
