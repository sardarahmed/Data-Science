Q:

What minor gods are linked to Demeter?

I ask about those who would fall under the category with Triptolemus, whom helped Demeter teach mortals about agriculture. 

A:

Here's a link to a list of agricultural deities major and minor on Theoi.com, which includes Plutus, god of wealth and good harvests, Bootes the herdsman who ended up in the stars, the Horae who ordered the seasons, and Macaria, goddess of blessed earth.
