Q:

Are angels ever depicted fighting in Abrahamic religious texts?

Revelation 12:7-17King James Version (KJV)
  7 And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,

How do angels fight?
All Christian, Jewish and Islamic authors accepted. Canonical, mystical etc. 
Here are some cases of binding I know of:

Revelation 20New International Version (NIV)
  The Thousand Years
  20 And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key to the Abyss and holding in his hand a great chain. 2 He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil, or Satan, and bound him for a thousand years. 3

And in Tobit

3 The reek of the fish distressed the demon, who fled through the air to Egypt. Raphael pursued him there, shackled him and strangled him forthwith.

Binding and shackling does seem to be the main way for an angel to deal with an enemy, but are there others? Has an angel ever used a sword for anything but guarding the way to the Tree of Life?

A:

We know that they do, but we do not know how. Take a look here (Isaiah 37:36-38):

36 Then the angel of the Lord went out and put to death a hundred and
  eighty-five thousand in the Assyrian camp. When the people got up the
  next morningâ€”there were all the dead bodies!

185000 Assyrian slain by one angel. But how? Sword? Mace? Magic? Thermonuclear weapon? 
And obviously Jacob vs the angel (Genesis 3-24/25):

24 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the
  breaking of the day.
25 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the
  hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint,
  as he wrestled with him.

A simple touch and Jacob is beaten. But this is the extend of what the Bible says.
