Q:

What are Hera's favorite cities?

In the Iliad, Zeus and Hera are fighting. Somehow, for reasons I don't remember, Zeus asks the names of Hera's favorite cities. After she tells him, he says he shall sack them.
What are the names of Hera's favorite cities? Are direct reasons given in Mythology of why they are her favorites? Any indirect reasons (i.e. she is the patron goddess)?

First result in a quick Google search brings Ancient History Encyclopedia article on Hera:

In the Iliad, Hera mentions three cities particularly dear to her -
  Argos, Sparta, and Mycenae (or Mykene).

Wikipedia article on Hera:

"The three cities I love best," the ox-eyed Queen of Heaven declares
  (Iliad, book iv) "are Argos, Sparta and Mycenae of the broad streets."

In the Iliad:

Then in answer to him spake ox-eyed, queenly Hera:â€œVerily have I three
  cities that are far dearest in my sight, Argos and Sparta and
  broad-wayed Mycenae.

Hom. Il. 4.50
I don't know why she liked Sparta or Mycenae, but Argos had been always her town, where her cult was particularly strong. Homer refers to her sometimes as "Argive Hera".
You can read more in Wikipedia article about the Heraion of Argos.
