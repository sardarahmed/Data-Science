Q:

What is this Norse symbol?

It is possibly Icelandic but I can only find it in one place with no name or explanation. Similar to a helm of awe but with an A in the middle and the ends are alternating circles and crescents.

A:

I can notice 3 kinds of symbols (anarchy, Venus or gold, and silver or the crescent moon of Islam) in an overal feel of a Ægishjálmur (Helm of Awe) or Vegvísir.
Anarchy
The A enclosed in a circle is the symbol for Anarchy.
Do note that you stated in your question that you thought all symbols where Norse, I think that the creator took some artistic liberties to make the art more aesthetically appealing. h\t @DukeZhou

Anarchy is the state of a society being freely constituted without
authorities or a governing body. It may also refer to a society or
group of people that totally rejects a set hierarchy.Wikipedia on Anarchy(It is a little more complicated than the quote text says but you get the idea).

Venus/copper
The circle with stripes is the alchemical symbol for copper and Venus.
Copper was associated with the planet Venus by alchemists. In our modern world this symbol is a symbol to denote the female sex.

Crescent moon
The crescent moon is a notable symbol of Islam (although there are disagreements by a growing group of modern Islamic scholars) but is actually more notable as the symbol of the Ottoman Empire following the conquest/fall of Constantinople in 1453. .

The other crescent moon is the alchemical symbol for silver and The Moon
