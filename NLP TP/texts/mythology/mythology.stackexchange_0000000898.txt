Q:

The Last Glacial Period in Myth

Many cultures have a flood myth. Is any one aware of any myth having to do with the last glacial period? Or do all mythologies start when the ice has melted and caused wide spread flooding?

A:

In the Pacific Northwest USA, the Indian lore has many flood myths. The area has its fair share of floods, however, there was a glacial lake called Lake Missoula during the last ice age. The lake was held back by ice dams that broke at least once (called a glacial lake outburst flood), flooding nearly the entire Pacific Northwest. Though there has never been a solid connection with this event and the Indian lore, it is often suggested whenever the two are mentioned in the same place. As a resident of the area, I hear it all the time whenever the area's ancient history is discussed.

Addendum
It's a mistake to think that all or even most flood myths are the result of glacial melt. In fact, floods in general are the most common natural disaster; nearly every area in the world experiences them from time to time. Floods are most often caused by tsunamis and rivers overflowing from snow pack melt (not the same thing as glacial melt). There's a few notable exceptions throughout history, but most floods are caused by those two. And considering most ancient communities gathered around rivers and shorelines, it makes sense that a great many flood myths would develop around the world.
