Q:

What is the story of the Chimera?

The Neo-Hittite Chimera (850â€“750 BC) from Karkemish is housed in the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations in Ankara, Turkey:

This chimera is presumably a precursor to the more well known Greek chimera. Do we know of any stories associated with it? Is it mentioned in Hittite mythology?

A:

After researching on the topic for a considerable amount of time, it seems most of the sources which describe the Neo-Hittite Chimera, do not contain any myths about the creature nor any in-depth details.
Therefore, it leads me to believe what another source said (emphasis mine):

"On the orthostats at Neo-Hittite sites, the Chimaera had no narrative context and served only to ward off evil, but in Greek myth the beast was to be conquered by a hero"

Which means, the Neo-Hittite Chimera was created just to "ward off evil" and hence does not have any myths associated with it.
