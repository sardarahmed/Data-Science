Q:

Can anyone identify what Chinese mythology creature this is?

I got this as a gift and I originally thought it was a foo dog but it has both paws on turtles, not on a cub or ball as foo dogs do. It may be a Pi Yao or Pixiu but I'm not so sure.

A:

Since it has hooves (not paws), scales,  and horns, it is almost certainly a qilin or "Chinese unicorn". I don't know why it is standing on four turtles, except that the turtle and qilin were two of the sishou or "four divine creatures", along with the phoenix and dragon.
They could be guarding dragon and phoenix eggs (the red spheres are different sizes) but this is just a guess.
