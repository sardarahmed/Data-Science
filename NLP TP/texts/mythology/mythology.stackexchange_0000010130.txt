Q:

Are/were there are any culutures where darkness is good and light is bad?

We have an association of light=good and dark=bad, to the point where we even use them as synonyms. There are a lot of pretty obvious historical bases for these metaphors:

Sunlight is the ultimate source of energy (and by extension, food and warmth) on Earth
Humans have poor low-light vision, and are vulnerable at night
Things generally get darker when they get dirtier, etc.

Is this a human universal?
Are there cultures/mythologies that flip it around?

A:

The Daoist principle of Yin and Yang doesn't see light and dark as good and bad, but as complementary.
Yin is characterized as slow, soft, yielding, diffuse, cold, wet, and passive; and is associated with water, earth, the moon, femininity, and night time.
Yang, by contrast, is fast, hard, solid, focused, hot, dry, and active; and is associated with fire, sky, the sun, masculinity and daytime.
However, there is no good or bad associated with Yin or Yang.
