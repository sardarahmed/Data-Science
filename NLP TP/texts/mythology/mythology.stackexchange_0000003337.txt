Q:

What does mytheme mean?

What is the meaning of the term mytheme? 
When did the term first come into use, and what are some examples of mythemes?

A:

Oxford dictionaries provides us with the following definition:

In structuralist anthropology and literary criticism:
each of a set of fundamental generic units of narrative structure (typically involving a relationship between a character, an event, and a theme) from which myths are thought to be constructed.

It is, in effect, a common ground between different mythological stories.
Vampires and Selkies for example might be based on a mytheme of shapeshifting.
Hades and Nirvana may have the mytheme of the afterlife.
I hope this answers your question.
