Q:

How did you survive my 100-step punch?

I remember from long ago a story about a martial artist, The Bully, who was renowned for his "100-step punch":  if he lands the blow, you will die after taking 100 steps.  One day another martial artist, The Hero, gets into a fight with The Bully, and is hit by the 100-step punch.  The Hero staggers away, and The Bully believes he has won.
Later, The Hero returns to defeat The Bully.  Surprised, The Bully asks, "How did you survive my 100-step punch?"   The Hero replies, "I only took 99 steps!"
If this sounds familiar to you... 
Where did this story come from, and is there a better rendition of it than my paltry summary?

A:

This reminded me of the unique "Kill Bill" (Vols. I & II) movies. Found the following on Pinterest:

Pai Mei played by Kung Fu movie legend Gordon Liu in Kill Bill -
  character is based off of the villain White Lotus with Gordon Liu as
  the hero. It was a 1980 Shaw Brothers Kung Fu film called Fist of the
  White Lotus. In that movie after delivering the version of Kill Bill's
  "Five-Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique", a man would die after 100
  steps. "See, my Kung Fu is better than yours. I only took 99 steps!" ~
  Gordon Liu.
