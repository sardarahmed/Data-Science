Q:

Which way blows Zephyrus?

This is more like a technical, geographical question.
When we say Zephyrus is the west wind, do we mean coming from the west or going west?
Which way would my boat go if Zephyrus blew into the sails?
(I thought here would be a better place to ask rather than a geography forum)

A:

From the west. 
Note that Boreaus, the North Wind, brought cold winter air from the north.
