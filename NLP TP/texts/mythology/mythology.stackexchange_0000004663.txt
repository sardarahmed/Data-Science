Q:

What are the origins of April Fools' Day?

On April Fools' Day, 1 April, it's the custom in several cultures to play practical jokes and to spread hoax stories.
Where and when did this custom originate?

A:

No one really knows for sure but the idea is in France in the 1500s New Year's celebrations would start a few days before then end on April 1st.  When the date changed to January 1st people who still celebrated on the old date would be made fun of as April fish.  A few centuries later people would try to stick a paper fish onto someone's back, without them noticing, as a prank.  It seems that over time people forgot all that and just stuck to pranks and other silliness.
