Q:

How many different werewolf variants are there?

I know there are different types of lycanthrope, a shapeshifter with 2 shifts. I know that different cultures (like japanese, western, norse) discuss the consent of lycanthropes. But how many different types of shifters in these stories are lycanthrope?
