Q:

Are dragons intelligent?

Intelligent can mean a number of things, so to simplify, lets limit it to capable of human speech. It is a common quality in movies and books to give dragons the power of human speech, but are such qualities given to any dragons in mythology?

A:

Fafnir, in the Völsunga saga, is a dwarf that slew his father and stole a fabulous treasure, including the cursed ring Andvaranaut. Fafnir then turned into a dragon. Fafnirs brother Regin trains the young hero Sigurd, and eventually goes with him to slay Fafnir. As Fafnir is dying, he speaks to Sigurd, and tells him that his gold and Regin will kill him. 
In another myth, we have the dragon Níðhöggr, who is gnawing on the roots of Yggdrasil, the world tree. Snorri's Edda as well as Grímnismál tells of the squirell Ratatosk, who runs up and down the three bearing words between Níðhöggr and the Eagle sitting in the tree's top, meaning that Níðhöggr must be capable of some sort of communication
