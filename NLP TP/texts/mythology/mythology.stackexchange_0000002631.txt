Q:

What's a good source on Fairies online?

I would like to research Fairies and their wonderful virtues, as described in Celtic mythology. Can someone suggest rich and readily available sources on the subject?

A:

You can find a lot of sources on Internet Sacred Text Archive ...
You have to scroll down to approximately 7/8 and you can find all the fairy texts you need. Or ctrl-f fairies.
