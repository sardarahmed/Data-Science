Q:

Skagganauk abyss?

In Roger Zelazney's Creatures of Light and Darkness, he imagines the Egyptian Typhon, brother of Set, as a void that often takes the form of a stallion.  He calls this entity "Skagganauk Abyss", which I always took to be a form of Ginnungagap, the primordial void of Norse mythology.  This modern interpretation is resonant, so I'm wondering about its mythical roots.

What is the possible meaning of "Skagganauk"?

Was it purely invented, or does it come from somewhere?

A:

As stated here: "Typhon appears as a black horse-shadow, without a horse to cast it. He contains within himself something called Skagganauk Abyss, which resembles a black hole, not a term in common use at the time"
So perhaps composed form Old Norse words with little regard for grammar:

ska√∞i - death, harm
ganga - to go (into), to reside in
auka - increase, augment; add; exceed, surpass;

as in "the abyss, going into it exceeds death", which would be a very poetic description for a black hole.
