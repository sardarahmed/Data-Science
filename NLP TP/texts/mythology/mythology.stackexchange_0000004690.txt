Q:

How did so many cultures come up with their own swastika?

Before two and a half hours ago, I thought the swastika was only in India and World War II. Then my art teacher put on a video about ancient Greek and Roman mosaics. In this video, I saw what was dubbed "Ancient Greek Swastica." I thought this an error and did a little research (I later found the link above). In no way is it only in India and World War II.
The Wikipedia article on it lists over a score of cultures with their own swastika with their own name to that culture. Among them are: Greek, Roman, Egypt, Native American, Japan, China, Celts, Aztec...
How do they all have their own version of a swastika relatively meaning a variance of the same thing in each?
I don't see how cross cultural contamination could have happened on this large of a scale. We know the Greeks/Romans knew of the Celts and Egyptians. Japan modeled their language on China's. The Romans traded with China. I can't be sure the Native Americans had contact with the Aztecs, but it is a possibility. And if this is a cross cultural contamination, where did it start?

A:

The swastika is one of the oldest symbols in Rock Art and its many derivative forms date back tens of thousands of years. At one time virtually all cultures used it to signify either the four cardinal points North South East and West or the four seasons or both. As people migrate they take their signs and symbols with them so it is today found globally. Hitler adopted it because he associated it with Aryan peoples but it originated long before it appeared in Northern Europe.
