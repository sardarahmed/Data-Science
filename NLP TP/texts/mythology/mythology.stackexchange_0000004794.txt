Q:

Japanese god of tea

Is there a Japanese god or goddess of tea? 
I’ve read that Inari is a god of various things, such as rice, sake, and tea... But is there a deity that is god of tea in particular?

A:

My understanding of the Japanese tea ceremony is that it arose out of the Zen tradition, which has no gods.  
However, I did find mention of a Japanese kami associated with tea, Inari Ōkami.
There is also god of tea, Lu Yu, author of The Classic of Tea, in Chinese folklore, .
