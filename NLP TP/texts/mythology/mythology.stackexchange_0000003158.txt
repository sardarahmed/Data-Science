Q:

Searching for a deity of water and fire?

The title says it (almost) all.
I'm searching for a deity whose aspects are BOTH fire and water. Any religion/pantheon is ok.
It could be a greater spirit or something like that, but I prefer a god.
Edit 1: I'm looking for a deity that whose domains are exclusively fire and water. No omnipotence and other bigger stuff.

A:

Yannis on the rignt track: the Celts had a number of deities whose healing power combined a solar element with water: Grannus, Sul, Brigit and Borvo/Bormanus. (The Brigit lore relates mainly to the saint, as a number of healing wells were sacred to her, and an everlasting flame was kept at her sanctuary in Kildare. But it's assumed that the lore is a continuation of earlier beliefs.)  
The deity Apam Napat, who appears in Zoroastrian texts and the Hindu Vedas, is another contender. Although he's the son of the waters, the Indian texts associate him with the fire-god Agni. One theory is that he represents fire in the water, a sort of stored fire.
