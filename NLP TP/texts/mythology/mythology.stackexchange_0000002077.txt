Q:

Is there a god called Iob/Job/Yov?

R. Simon Ashenburg in Debek Tob reconciles a contradiction in the Bible regarding the name of Issachar's son which is given as Yov (יוב) in Genesis 46:13 and elsewhere as Yashuv (ישוב) in Numbers 26:24 by explaining that his name was really Yov but since that matches the name of an idolatrous deity, an extra ש was added to his name so he was called Yashuv.
My question is whether we know of any ancient mythology which had a god named Yov (or Yob, or Iob or Job) or something similar.

A:

A friend of mine wrote to me that this is probably a reference to "Jove" which is another name for the Roman god Jupiter.
