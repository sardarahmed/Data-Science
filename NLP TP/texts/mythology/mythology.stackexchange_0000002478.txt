Q:

Is Chronos Kronos?

Well, I saw a youtube comment on the latest Crash Course Mythology video-

Chronus has nothing to do with time. That's Kronos, a primordial deity separate from the titans and infinitely more important.
  Chronus took over the position of Sky God from his father Ouranos, and was later usurped by his own son Zeus who took the same position.
  I'm sick and tired of people misrepresenting Chronus and Kronos. This is Renaissance era confusion and it needs to stop.  

I also see

No they didn't actually. Kronos (the titan) was spelled Κρόνος whereas Chronos was spelled like Χρόνος, which makes perfect sense since 'chrono-' is used as a root to convey time.

As used in chronological, chronicle, and chronic pain.
So, now I'm confused. Is Chronos Kronos or not? Preferably either using a primary source that says Chronos is the lord of time, or something.

A:

First of all, never get your mythology from Youtube comments.
Second, the second comment is the accurate one. Χ in Greek is transliterated as ch, and that's where we get our time words from (as they mention).
I believe the first comment is just confused, where the user once read what the second person is saying, but got it exactly backwards. In both cases they're right in saying that originally Chronus and Cronus (or Khronos and Kronos, Greek Χρόνος and Κρόνος, "Time" and "Father of Zeus") weren't the same. The first person got it backwards, and the second one got it right.
