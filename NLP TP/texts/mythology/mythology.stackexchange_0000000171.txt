Q:

Worship of Epona in the Roman Empire

Epona is said to be "the sole Celtic divinity ultimately worshipped in Rome itself" (see Wikipedia article quoting Phyllis Fray Bober).
Is there any reason this divinity in particular was worshipped in the Roman Empire and none of the numerous other Celtic gods despite the apparent habit of Romans to borrow divinities from everyone they conquered?

A:

Epona was a protector goddess and also the goddess of fertility and was welcomed into many homesteads at the time because she just about covered everything. The Romans believed that they should never anger the gods and so when a new god surfaced that had a high likability like Epona, the Romans took them in.
However, Epona wasn't highly worshiped by Roman Soldiers because she didn't hold powers that the soldiers requested. 
Epona was only worshiped by mothers and farmers and was probably only worshiped in the Northern parts of the Roman Empire.
