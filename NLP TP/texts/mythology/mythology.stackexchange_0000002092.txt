Q:

Is there a preferred, scholarly edition of the Gesta Danorum in English?

Been meaning to read this for a while, but there are quite a few translations out there.

A:

The translation by Peter Fisher, with an introduction and commentary by Hilda Roderick Davidson, is easy to find, and reputable.
