Q:

How and why are Idunn and Tyr gods?

In the eddic poem Hrafnagaldur Óðins, stanza 6, Idunn is identified as an "elf" (alfar) and the "youngest of the elder children of Ivaldi." This implies that Ivaldi had two sets of children, probably by different mothers. Thus Idunn is a sister of the famous smiths, the Sons of Ivaldi. In addition to that, according to the Poetic Edda, Tyr is said to the sons of the giants(Jötunn) Hymir and Hroðr. In that case, how and why are these two gods?

A:

To answer briefly: Being a god was not about belonging to a specific "race". 
For Idunn, we can compare with the division of the gods into aesir and vanir, where the latter were in some sense linked to the alfar (in the poetic Edda, the term "aesir and alfar" refers to all the gods). Being linked to the alfar thus was not a disqualification.
For Tyr, having a giant as one of your parents was very common among the gods: Odin's mother was certainly a giant, and so was likely Thor's. Thor had one son, Magni, with a giantess (Magni is one of the gods that will survive Ragnarök and wield his father's hammer). Such pairings of gods with giantesses are extremely common: Frey and Njord both married giantesses. There is also Aegir, a giant, and lord of the Sea, possibly also the grandfather of the god Heimdall. Finally, there is Loki, who was explicitly a giant as well as a god.
Thus, being related to giants or elves was not in any way unique or something that diminished the status of a god. Being a god was about supporting the world order, not a matter of parentage.
