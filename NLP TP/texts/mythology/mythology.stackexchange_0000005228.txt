Q:

Where to find myths about the origin of civilization?

Is there a particular book (from a trustworthy source of course) I can see/buy or website(s) (preferably academic, that legally allow(s) non-academics access to this information)?
Edit: Initially, I had in mind myths about ways through which humanity is taught civilization (e.g. a deity teaching humans laws, and how to live by laying the foundation of city-living in general) but I guess I'll also accept the additional information this question seems to ask for.

A:

A few suggestions:
The Structural Study of Myth (Levi-Strauss, 1955)
Patterns in Comparative Folklore (Eliade, 1948)
Sacred Narrative: Readings in the Theory of Myth (University of California Press, 1984)
Creation Myths of the World (Encyclopedia, Two Volume)
