Q:

In ancient Egypt what did the Ba and the Ka represent?

In ancient Egypt what did the Ba and the Ka represent? They were parts of the soul but why two parts?

A:

The ka is like the spirit; its the element that makes something alive. In contrast, the ba is more like the personality of a person.

The Ka was the life force, astral double or spiritual twin ... the Ba was the impersonal life force of the soul, the essence of one's individuality and unique characteristics.

There were in fact five parts to the Egyptian view of the soul, not just two.
