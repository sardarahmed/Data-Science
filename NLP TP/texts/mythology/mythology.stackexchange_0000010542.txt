Q:

What norse mythology books do you recommend for young children?

My children have norse names due to my and my partner's interest in norse mythology. My oldest child (6) is becoming more and more interested in the origins of his name and about Odin, specifically. Are there any books that would be age appropriate to help him better understand the history here.

A:

I found D'Aulaires' Book of Norse Myths quite effective at that age.
