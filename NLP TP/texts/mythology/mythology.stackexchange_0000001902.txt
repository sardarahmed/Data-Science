Q:

Why did the sky exist when Ouranos was castrated?

So Ouranos was castrated by Kronos and Titans.
When that happened, why didn't the sky just collapse?

A:

The castration is taken as a metaphor for the transfer of power from the old generation to the new.  It is not a voluntary relinquishing of power.
Ouranous actually is the sky, in the same way that Gaia is the literal earth. His name means "sky".  You can look for a parallel with the Norse Ymir, where they use his body parts to create the universe.  
Castration is generally viewed as a curtailing of power, thus the act is symbolic of transfer of power to the next generation.  

Note: Kronos is popularly believed to mean "time", which is interesting because time is, in some sense, a function of distance, which requires matter and space. (i.e. He is the son of the sky and the earth, void and matter.)
However, there is also an argument that Kronos derives from the Indo-European root for "cut". 
Regardless of the "true" origin, which must always be obscure, name meanings are very important in Greek Mythology.
