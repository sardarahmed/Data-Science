Q:

Why are mermaids naked?

In images from Roman to contemporary Britain, mermaids are usually not wearing any clothes. Other types of fairies, spirits, and gods are usually depicted at least partly dressed.
Why then are mermaids naked? Or aren't they?
Are mermaids naked in written sources like fairy tales and legends, too? And do they explain the nudity?

A:

A number of reasons: mermaids are part of nature, not culture, Classical depictions of marine deities and other spirits show them naked, and because mermaids are supposed to be sexy.
