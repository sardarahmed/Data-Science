Q:

When did Odin and Loki became blood brothers?

In the beginning of the Lokasenna, Bragi denies Loki a seat with the gods. However, Loki reminds Odin that the two of them had their "blood mixed", and that Odin had promised that neither of them would drink with the gods unless both of them were welcomed. Odin is then left with little choice but to order Vidar to find a seat for Loki:  

Bragi spake:
8. "A place and a seat | will the gods prepare
  No more in their midst for thee;
  For the gods know well | what men they wish
  To find at their mighty feasts."  
Loki spake:  
9. "Remember, Othin, | in olden days
  That we both our blood have mixed;
  Then didst thou promise | no ale to pour,
  Unless it were brought for us both."  
Othin spake: 
10. "Stand forth then, Vithar, | and let the wolf's father
  Find a seat at our feast;
  Lest evil should Loki | speak aloud
  Here within Ã†gir's hall."

Is there a story that explains how Odin and Loki came to be blood brothers?

A:

According to an annotation by translator Henry Adams Bellows, 

There exists no account of any incident in which Othin and Loki thus swore blood-brotherhood, but they were so often allied in enterprises that the idea is wholly reasonable. The common process of "mingling blood" was carried out quite literally, and the promise of -which Loki speaks is characteristic of those which, in the sagas, often accompanied the ceremony; cf. Brot af Sigurtharkvithu.

Assuming this information is correct, there is no extant story for this.
