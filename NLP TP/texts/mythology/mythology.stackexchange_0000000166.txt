Q:

Is the Kraken a single being or a species?

In Norse mythology, the Kraken is said to be a gigantic octopus (or sometimes a squid) that attack sailing ships. It is said that the Kraken would surface at Ragnar√∂k.
So far, I haven't found any articles stating that the Kraken is a single entity. Nor have I found anything which denies it. Is the Kraken a single being or is it a species?

A:

The Kraken is a single entity. However in modern times it became a more loose term having sailors during the 1500-1700s calling giant squids "Krakens". The possibility of so many sightings led people to believe that this was a race.
The Norse mythology named the beast Kraken based on the word Krake means "a twisted animal" while Krake in German means "Octopus"
The Kraken in Norse mythology was definitely a giant squid because octopus was too far south for Norsemen to come into contact with.
