Q:

Was the Argo sentient and capable of conversation, or was its speech more like Siri or the USS Enterprise computer?

The Argo was built with a branch from the Dodona oak which, according to numerous sources, could speak.
I’m wondering about the nature of this ability: did this “speech” make the Argo a fully developed character with opinions and desires of its own, or was it more like the magical equivalent of Siri, a voice-interface only capable of limited statements, answers to specific questions, and occasional prophecies?

A:

I would say Argo was not self aware. Instead, Zeus “... spoke through the wood taken from one of his Dodonian oaks, as stated in the first book of the Argonautica (Apollonius of Rhodes, 2009), when a talking beam that Athena had made from a Dodonian oak and fitted in the middle of Argo’s keel, spoke with a terrible voice that frightened the Argonauts.”  - Oracle Trees in the Ancient Hellenic World
