Q:

Any ancient myths/folklore/tales/etc. about extraterrestrial voyages/beings/people or even about voyages towards earth?

Stories that are about extraterrestrial beings who visit earth and either return to their place of origin or not. They can also be about people from earth visiting the moon or other planets and either returning or not returning to earth. Like Lucian's True Story (if I'm not wrong) and the tale of the bamboo cutter.

A:

It doesn't survive, but there seems to have been at least one earlier work about space travel: Antonius Diogenes's Wonders Beyond ThulÃ«. This book, which was apparently presented with a straight face (unlike Lucian's satire), involved a character going past the edge of the earth and visiting both the Sun and the Moon.
Unfortunately, the work itself is lost; we only have fragments and a short summary now. But it seems fairly clear that Lucian's trip to the Moon and the war between the Lunars and the Solars was parodying Diogenes's definitely accurate stories.
