Q:

Is there a tale of Zeus having sex with a deer?

I heard about a myth saying Zeus had sex with a deer, but after hours of research, I hold nothing. Can anyone tell me of this myth?
I am especially interested in acquiring any information about a supposed child that came of this union.

A:

This is the story of the nymph Taygete, one of the Pleiades. When Zeus pursued her, Artemis transformed her to a hind (or a cow) with golden horns. However, Zeus wasn't fooled by the disguise and raped the nymph. The result of their union is Lacedaemon, the legendary founder of Sparta.
