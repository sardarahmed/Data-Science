Q:

Where does the idea that dragons hoard gold come from?

Where does the idea that dragons hoard gold come from?
I can't think of many myths of dragons hoarding gold. The closest I come up with is the dragon that guarded the Golden Fleece. And even that's a stretch as it wasn't gold specifically.

A:

The Colchian dragon isn't the only dragon protecting treasure in Greek mythology. A couple more examples: 

Ladon guarded the golden apples in the garden of the Hesperides,
Python guarded the centre of the earth at Delphi, and
Ares assigned a dragon to protect his sacred spring near Thebes (look up the myths of Cadmus). 

However, if you are looking for a dragon protecting gold specifically, then I think the more characteristic examples from European folklore are:

Fafnir, the dwarf-turned-dragon in the VÃ¶lsunga, and
The firedrake in Beowulf.

In fact, unless I'm horribly mistaken, the latter one is often credited as the main inspiration behind Smaug, the iconic gold-hoarding dragon in J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit.
