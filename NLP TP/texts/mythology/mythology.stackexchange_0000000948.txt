Q:

Is there an Indian Wild Hunt myth?

In the Wikipedia Wild Hunt article, an Indian related myth is mentioned1: 

M.M. Banks cautioned against viewing the Wild Hunt as a peculiarly European phenomenon, identifying a similar tale of cavalry being heard on the wind that was located in the early twentieth-century in the Ghats, India.

The cited source is Banks, M.M. (1944). "The Wild Hunt?". Folklore (London: The Folklore Society), which I don't have access to.

A:

The example seems to be a particularly bad counterexample. I reproduced the relevant part of the article you cited:

"On 29th January (1818), another body of the Peshawa's cavalry was caught in a defile of the Ghats . . . between the hammer and the anvil of an infantry detachment and a cavalry force, and slain or scattered. . . . Fort after fort tumbled into British hands while the Peshwa raced and doubled with a celerity and hopeless misery that impressed themselves on the communal mind so that to this day the villagers remember that spectacle . . . and the scamper of the horses' feet is heard on the wind.  
        Ed. Thompson, The Making of the Indian Princes (1943), p. 250.

It does not claim what Wikipedia implies, that the cavalry on the wind is an ancient myth that survived in popular folktales until recorded in the twentieth century. Rather, it seems that this is a very recent historical event that is remembered and connected with natural phenomena. How long will a local tale survive to become myth remains (from what I can tell) to be seen.
