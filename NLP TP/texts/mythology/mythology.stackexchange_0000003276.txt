Q:

Are there any four-armed creatures in any pantheon?

Related to my last question: Are there any races/species of creature in any pantheon with four arms (and two legs and one head)?

A:

Such creatures are easily spotted in Indian depictions from various times. Ganesha, Lakshmi and Vishnu are probably the most popular, and there is a  book on the topic which might be useful:  Doris Srinivasan Many Heads, Arms and eyes: Origin, Meaning and Forms of Multiplicity in Indian Art (Brill, 1997).
