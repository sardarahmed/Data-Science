Q:

Is being reborn as a god in Hinduism possible?

I know Hindus believe that people can become plants, animals, humans, monsters when they are reincarnated, but do Hindus mention that people can become gods after death?

A:

Very interesting question. Whether you can be reborn as a god in Hinduism is debatable, and many people have different opinions. But as per the scriptures, it is possible. According to one of the most revered texts of Sanatana philosophy, Srimad Bhagavatam, the positions of gods of the heavenly kingdom, known as Amravati, can be attained by anyone, given that he should fulfill some criteria. For example, Indra, the god of thunder and rain, is not the name of a god but is a position. And one can attain the position by performing one hundred rajsuya yajnas (horse sacrifices). When a person completes 100 successful horse sacrifices in his lifetime, in next, he will be born as Indra, the king of the heavens. The position of a god cannot be attained in the same lifetime, one has to complete his duties of the present life, and in the next, he will move to the next life according to his pious credits.
Hope this answers your question :)
