Q:

"Decipher me or I devour you" has been cited in Brazil for decades as a challenge of the Sphinx. Is it actually made up?

"Decifra-me ou te devoro"/"Decipher me or I'll devour you"
Just recently I remembered hearing this phrase when I was kid.. I'm brasilian and I was thinking how bad*ss it is and all and so I decided to research a bit more into it and, to my surprise, Google results for the translated phrase all seemed to be of brasilians repeating it translated, no relevant results at all that seemed to point to source, etc.
Google results:

"decifra-me ou te devoro" - "About 47,300 results"
"decifra-me ou devoro-te" - "About 29,500 results"
"decipher me or i will devour you" - "About 510 results"
"decipher me or I devour you" - "About 115 results"

So it seems really prevalent, this appears on scientific papers, books, it's cited by journalists, etc. Is this a borrowed phrase? Did it just slip into Brazil consciousness? Is there a different translation that'd actually point to a source? I'm spooked.

A:

"Decifra-me ou te devoro" uses wording that cannot be very old and also has a distinct literary ring.
"Decipher" originally meant being able to read/understand the arabic numerals, "cifres", which was enlarged into an ability to read unshapely hand-writig.The point it is that it relates to text which is not the case of the original story about solving a riddle. It is totally improbable that some older translation would have used 'decipher', so this form has  been coined in more recent times.
The repeated  syllab "de" and the (a)symmetry me/te might have a barely notable presence but they should be credited for the popularity of the formula.
