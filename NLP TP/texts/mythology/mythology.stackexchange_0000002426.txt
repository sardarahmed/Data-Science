Q:

Are there any stories which are about a species that is neither human nor divine?

I am aware that some mythologies/religions include species apart from humans and gods (e.g. Islam and Norse mythology). However, are there any stories which are  written about them? My definition for "stories" for this questions, will be stories that are about individuals or groups seen as the protagonists, or heroes, of the stories.  
Please note that I am not looking for origin stories of a particular species, nor stories about people who are (semi-)divine, like avatars of Hinduism  or demigods of Greco-Roman mythology.

A:

You mention nymphs, so I'll direct you to Daphne, who is the heroine of her story. It may start with Apollo, but he is distinctly the antagonist, thus, while the story involves him, it is about her. (I suspect Ovid's Metamorphosis will be fertile ground for you in your search.)  
I am also going to propose John Gardner's Grendel, which may not be strictly canonical, but is certainly worthwhile and a part of the overall Beowulf body of literature. 
(Also, technically, Sun Wukong is neither human nor a god, but a monkey born from a magical stone who gains power through Taoist training.)
