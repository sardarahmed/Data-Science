Q:

Were the furies/erinyes of one accord?

There were 3 furies/erinyes. They were to ensure punishment in Hades.
Did each of them serve a different purpose? Or did they do the same thing?
For example- 1 fury would punish a person for eating too much ice cream, another too many cookies, and another too many jelly beans. Or was it all 3 furies to punish one person for eating too much dessert?

A:

It depends on the source.  In the Oresteia, where their role is central, they are represented as having a single purpose, that of hounding Orestes for the blood sin of killing his mother.  However, in the Aeneid Book VII, Juno sends Alecto on a solo mission.
The names of these three Furies are variously translated (Wikipedia is not definitive in this regard) and their individual names seem to indicate that each specializes in punishing a different type of crime.  
In many mythologies, particularly Classical Mythology, there is the idea of the tripartite goddess (think "mother", "maiden", "crone") who often represent three aspects of a single entity or idea. 
Thus, although the Furies may be thought to possess distinct attributes, they are all aspects of the single idea of vengeance, i.e. righteous "fury".
