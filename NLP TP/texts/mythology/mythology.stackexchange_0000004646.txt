Q:

In what mythologies other than the Basque are the Sun and Moon both female?

In Basque mythology the Sun goddess, Eki, and the Moon goddess, Ilazki, are sisters.
In what other mythologies are the Sun and Moon both female?

A:

There appear to be many American tribes which have similar views but the question is really much more complicated. It should not be assumed that all languages have gender, that gender implies sex, or that the moon or the sun at different occasions is the same entity, etc. etc. A classic 10 page paper by Claude LÃ©vi-Strauss The Sex of the Sun and Moon (Structural anthropology v.2 c.1963) has treated the question in a most enlightening way.

sometimes in one myth to the other in the same group the sun and the
  moon are  two women or two men (p.219)
