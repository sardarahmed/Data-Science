Q:

Is there a creature in mythology that is a frost bird or a frost phoenix?

I searched a lot but I couldn't find a creature that is similar to a frost phoenix or a frost bird, or a giant creature similar to a frost bird for example.
It's for a project (I like to keep real mythology in my story) and I want something as close as this as possible.

The Pomola is  a snow bird spirit in Native American mythology, it lived on Mt Katahdin and caused cold weather

In Penobscot folklore, the Pomola was a bird spirit that lived on Mt Katahdin. It was associated with night, wind, snow, and storms. Apparently it had a moose's head according to some legends. The Penobscots and Abenakis avoided climbing to the top of this mountain so as not to disturb it.

In Greek mythology, the giant Alcyoneus had seven daughters: Phthonia, Anthe, Methone, Alcippe, Pallene, Drimo, and Asteria.
When their father was slain by Heracles, they threw themselves into the sea, and were changed into ice-birds. 
To be more specific, the species they transformed into was the kingfisher.
