Q:

Besides Apollo, no main Roman god shared the name of its Greek version -- why?

Was this deliberate or is it more than we decided upon the correspondence and the Romans did not see them necessarily as the exact same god?
If deliberate, did the Romans want to separate their religion from the Greeks?

A:

Before the Romans conquered the Greeks, they already had their own pantheon of gods. As they assimilated the Greek religion into their own, they found similarities between their gods and the Greek gods and ended up associating the greek gods with their own already-established names. Apollo was considered a pretty popular god overall, having been the god of many things (music, arts, plague, the sun, etc), and being that he was adopted pretty late, there weren't any equivalents to him in the previous Roman religion.
