Q:

What is the origin of a common Christmas tree quotation concerning an old Babylonish fable about an evergreen tree?

Searching for "evergreen tree which sprang out of a dead tree stump" gets nearly 3000 hits.
The Seed of the Woman and the Power of Darkness - Donbor Syiemlieh - Google Books is an example:

"An old Babylonish fable told of an evergreen tree which sprang out of a dead tree stump.
The old stump symbolized the dead Nimrod, the new evergreen tree symbolized that Nimrod had come to life again in Tammuz!
Among the Druids the oak was sacred, among the Egyptians it was the palm, and in Rome it was the fir, which was decorated with red berries
during the Saturnalia!" (Walsh, Curiosities of Popular Customs, p. 242).

Obviously I didn't check all results, but those that I did check contain that same quotation, and almost all give the same attribution.
The problem is, while page 242 of that book does talk about Christmas trees, and the writing style is similar, it doesn't include the above quotation or anything like it:

The quotation doesn't appear elsewhere in that section or anywhere else in the book.
So what is its origin?

TL;DR:

… those who attribute the quotation to Walsh are misattributing and/or misquoting.
The direct quotation originates with Ralph Woodrow, who paraphrases and cites, but does not quote, Walsh.
… page 152 in chapter 20 of Woodrow's Babylon Mystery Religion.
