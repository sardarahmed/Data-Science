Q:

What is the significance of the number of orishas?

According to Wikipedia, different oral traditions refer to different numbers of orishas:

Yoruba tradition often says that there are 401 orishas, which is associated with a sacred number. Other sources suggest that the number is "as many as you can think of, plus one more - an innumerable number". Different oral traditions refer to 400, 700, or 1,440 orisha.

Why is 401 sacred to the Yoruba? What is the significance of the other numbers?

A:

There is some information here about why the number 400 is sacred (and the "plus one" probably indicates it being innumerable, i.e. a multitude and one more): Number of Orishas

This only answers what the significance of the 401 is, but not the other numbers, sadly.
There are also completely different numbers, here for example 1200 Orishas
