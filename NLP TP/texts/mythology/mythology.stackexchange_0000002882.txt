Q:

What culture does this duality symbol belong to?

While browsing today I came upon this symbol tagged as duality, but I am unable to identify it. 

Does anybody recognize where this symbol comes from? Is it part of a culture/religion or just something an artist doodled?

A:

I don't think it would be possible to know for certain unless we ask the artist who drew it, but the symbol looks like a very simplified version of the Chinese taijitu,  the "yin and yang symbol":
