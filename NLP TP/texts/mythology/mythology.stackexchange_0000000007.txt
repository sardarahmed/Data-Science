Q:

Did Zeus have any male lovers?

Many of the Greek gods were bisexual. Did Zeus have any male lovers?

A:

It seems there is only one: Ganymede.
I've consulted these sources for a list of Zeus' lovers:

Zeus Lovers by J.M. Hunt
Zeus' Lovers | GreekMythology.com
Zeus's Love Affairs by Nancy Conner
Zeus's Many Lovers by Kip Wheeler

Here are his lovers, in alphabetical order:

Aegina, a nymph
Alcmene, princess of Mycenae by whom Zeus fathered Heracles
Callisto, a nymph
DanaÃ«, princess of Argos by whom Zeus fathered Perseus
Demeter, goddess of the harvest
Dione, a Titaness
Electra, princess of Mycenae
Eurynome, an Oceanide and Zeus' third bride, mother of the Charities
Europa, a Phoenician woman
Ganymede, Trojan hero
Hera, Zeus' sister and first wife
Io, a priestess of Hera in Argos
Leda, a Spartan queen
Leto, Titan goddess of motherhood
Maia, one of the Pleiades
Metis, a Titaness
Mnemosyne, Titan goddess of time, and mother with Zeus of the Nine Muses
Nemesis, goddess of revenge
Persephone, Zeus' daughter
Semele, princess of Thebes by whom Zeus fathered Dionysus
Taygete, a nymph and one of the Pleiades
Themis, Titan goddess of law

Again, Ganymede is the only male on this list. But given Zeus' romantic eclecticism, it's probably safe to assume he's not the only actual male lover. The earliest version of the myth (in the Iliad) doesn't claim they were lovers, however.

A:

While the vast majority of Zeus's lovers were female, one of Zeus's lovers was the mortal Ganymede. 
Ganymede is noted as the only one of Zeus's lovers to whom he granted immortality.
