Q:

What were Ares's powers?

Poseidon, God of the Sea - water powers
Zeus, God of lightning - lightning powers
Hades - God of the Underworld - devilish powers
But what about Ares? Is he good at fighting? Can he summon swords at will? What is a "war" power?

A:

Well he's not a strategist, that's Athena.
I think it's fair to say Ares is a good fighter. But he's not the best- he's lost to Athena, and he has been on the losing side of a war as well. And that doesn't mean he's literally anything else - he runs in the face of battle, he sneaks around with Aphrodite behind her husband's back, he is hot headed and impetuous and bloodthirsty. He's a warrior who's a step above a barbarian(he represents the violent and bloody aspects of war), not a general (Again, that's Athena, she's not goddess of wisdom for nothing), or even a great warrior like Hercules, who did his Labours to atone for his crimes.
Ares is usually portrayed in a less than flattering light, and is frankly a bit of a bloodthirsty flake. Deimos and Phobos, Terror and Dread, are his attendants, without military strategies could be planned like chess strategies, because your men would never cut and run in the face of battle.
You could possibly extrapolate based on his children(Deimos and Phobos being the most commonly and closely associated with him), but he's not a DnD character. It's not a case of every god having a signature spell to summon something that represents them.
