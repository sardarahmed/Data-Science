Q:

Did the ancient Egyptians have a word for "cult"?

The ancient cultures of Greece, Rome, and Egypt did not have a word for religion, at least in our modern understanding of the word. Greece and Rome did have terms for religious practices though, threskeia (θρησκεία) and cultus, respectively. Did the ancient Egyptians have a similar word, or term? I have been unable to find such a word, just the English word "cult" substituted for the Egyptian word.
