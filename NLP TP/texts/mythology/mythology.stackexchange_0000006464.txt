Q:

Are there any examples of gods or people boasting of their ability to engage in multiple acts of sex in succession?

Are there any examples in mythologies of gods or people  boasting about their ability to engage in multiple acts of sex (multi-orgasmic) in succession? I am looking for examples in which they specify a number (as exaggerated as it may be).
EDIT: I should have specified that I am looking for examples in which the multiple acts are done with the same people, not with new partners. I am trying to exclude possible examples of the Coolidge Effect.

A:

Heracles is said to have had intercourse with the 50 daughters of Thespius or Thestius in one night, all of whom bore him sons (Diodorus Siculus, Library 4.29.3) In another version, one daughter refused, making the number 49 (Pausanius, Description of Greece 9.27.6).
However, in some less impressive versions, this took place over a week (Herodorus apud Athenaeus, Deipnosophists 13.4) or 50 nights (Pseudo-Apollodorus, Library 2.4.10; Tzetzes, Chiliades 2.221).
