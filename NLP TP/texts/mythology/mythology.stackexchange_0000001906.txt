Q:

Is "Viking mythology" the same as "Norse mythology"

Does "Viking mythology" and "Norse mythology" mean the same, or are there any differences?
The Norse deities were: Odin, Thor, Heimdall... Does it mean, that the Viking deities were them too?

A:

A "Viking" was a a warrior who went raiding abroad. (See the Jorvik site for more on this.) They were probably the most famous medieval Scandinavians, but they were a small subset of all the Norse people.
Having said that, warrior gods would have been closest to their hearts, and Michael Enright has theorized that the rise of the god Odin was linked to the cultural and religious rise of warbands with a charismatic leader. (You'll notice on the show Vikings that Ragnar Lothrbrok has a close connection to Odin.)
So while farmers would have mainly worshipped Frey or Thor, and merchants and sailors probably focused on Njord, warriors certainly focused on Odin.

A:

Snorri Sturluson would likely have had some thoughts on the subject.
Norse Mythology generally refers to stories about the Gods and Giants, codified first in the Poetic Edda, and later in the Prose Edda. (There are several English translations of both, but my favorite is Kevin Crossley-Holland's "The Norse Myths".)
"Viking Mythology", if I understand your meaning, would likely refer to the Sagas, which are often, but not exclusively, generational stories of heroes. Many of the Icelandic Sagas are concerned with the history of the settlement of the island. 
I bring up Sturluson because both the Prose Edda, and sagas such as Egil's Saga are attributed to him.
