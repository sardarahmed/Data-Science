Q:

Are the Anunnaki mentioned in the Bible?

The following Bible passages mention “Anakim” and “Anak”:

Num 13:22; 13:28; 13:33
Deut 1:28; 2:10-11; 2:21, 9:2
Josh 11:21-22; 14:12; 14:15; 15:13-14; 21:11
Judg 1:20.

They sound similar.
Is there any known connection between the biblical Anakim/Anak entities and the Sumerian Anunnaki gods?

A:

How could they be related ? Anakim just means "sons of Anak".
It is just a race of giants, and there is nothing giving them godlike power or something.
Anunnaki, as I explained in another post, means sons of An. While the terminology is the same, there is nothing in common between those 2 words.
EDIT : The sumerian language is apparently an language isolate. So it is just a coincidence.
More than that, in the International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, an hypothesis linked this word with a goddess from the eastern cultural block, but it is not linked to a semitic deity. Still, I don't see any link with the sumerian gods.

A:

Abraham came from Sumer. His birth place was "Ur of the Chaldees", namely UR KAŠDIM (אוּר כַּשְׂדִּים). This is explicitly stated in Genesis 11:28:

"And died Haran before the face of Terah his father in the land of his
birth in UR OF THE CHALDEANS."

הָרָ֔ן עַל־ פְּנֵ֖י תֶּ֣רַח אָבִ֑יו בְּאֶ֥רֶץ מוֹלַדְתּ֖וֹ בְּא֥וּר כַּשְׂדִּֽים׃

hā-rān,   ‘al-pə-nê te-raḥ ’ā-ḇîw bə-’e-reṣ mō-w-laḏ-tōw bə-’ŪR KAŚ-DÎM.

Haran was Abraham's brother and Terah their father. So there will absolutely be linguistic and esoteric interconnections with Hebrew, Akkadian, Assyrian. You don't share a border and common history without retaining some linguistic elements.
"Language Isolate" just means they (Sumerologists) haven't yet figured out how Sumerian relates to the surrounding languages.
