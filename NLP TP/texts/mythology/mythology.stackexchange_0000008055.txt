Q:

What were the names of Anahita's horses in the original Avestan language?

Most sources on the internet agree that Anahita's four white horses are named Wind, Clouds, Rain, and Sleet. These are obviously the English translations of these words. I am looking for the original Avestan words. As far as my research has gone, I have found these as the originals: Vayu “wind”, Maēγa “clouds”, Vāra “rain”, and Snéshar “sleet” Since I do not know Avestan, I am uncertain how correct these are. Any help with confirming or rejecting any of these would be greatly appreciated.

A:

(Just for what little it worths, "most sources on the internet" seem to be carbon copies of each other, be it Wikipedia, Encyclopedia Iranica which seem to refer back to articles in JSTOR. Anyway.)
A search through An Avesta Grammar in Comparison with Sanskrit reveals that you're on the right path with early Iranian roots:
WIND --- Av. văyu-, Skt. vāyu-
CLOUD --- Av. maēʒəm, Skt. mēghám
RAIN --- Av. vāra-
SLEET --- Av. fyawhunte (they shower sleet)

The Avestan text the four horses of Anahita can be found in and its English translation is here, p 201. I am not convinced these are names per se. It seems that the supposed names are simply describing the four horses: āsyangha vātaēibya, swifter than winds; āsyangha vāraēibya, swifter than rains, āsyangha maēghaēibya, swifter than clouds. Throughout the text, the editors seem pretty consistent when capitalising names.

Notes:
abh For its translation see 1st karda of Sraosha yasht Hādokht.
abi The meaning of “aurusha” is also “crimson”. See Tir yashta, 1st Kardāh.
abj i.e. (Steeds) who do not cast any shadow; a=not; saya=Persian sāyeh=shadow. Dr. Mills taking the word as “āsava” translates it as “swift”.
abk Or moving in accord with the divine will (mainyava + vasangha)
abl i.e. the speed of the horses of the holy Sraosha yazata as mentioned in this paragraph is swifter then wind, bird, arrow, etc
