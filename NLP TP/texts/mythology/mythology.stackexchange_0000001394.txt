Q:

Is there a myth of someone living in the sun?

Is there a Greek myth of some sort of a god, human, or other creature living in the sun?

A:

So far as I know the Greco-Roman myths about the sun consistently refer to it as an object, usually the wheel of a chariot which is handled by Apollo or Helios. The Greeks didn't personify or anthropomorphize the sun.
