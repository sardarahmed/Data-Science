Q:

Is there a single term for the study of mythology?

I know folklore studies are called "folkloristics" and people who study folklore are called "folklorists". 
Are there equivalent terms for mythology? Is there a single term for the study of mythology, and what do we call someone who studies mythology?

A:

Mythologist - there is no such word in the Longman Dictionary of English Language and Culture. But there are other dictionaries of other languages and culture, for example: The Explanatory Dictionary of the Russian Language:

Мифолог - Ученый, исследователь в области мифологии (Толковый словарь Ушакова)
Mythologist - Scientist, researcher in the field of mythology
