Q:

Persian Zeus in Xenophon's Cyropaedia

In the Cyropaedia, the fictional biography of Cyrus the Great, there are, at least, 26 instances of "Zeus", in many cases used like... "By Zeus!"
This is interpretatio graeca, of course, but, if we reverse the process, who would be that god of the Achaemenids that in Xenophon's work gets called "Zeus"?

A:

Found the answer in the book Xenophon's Cyropaedia: Style, Genre, and Literary Technique, by Professor Deborah Levine Gera:

The gods Cyrus sacrifices to are all Greek ones, although Xenophon may
  have had their Persian counterparts in mind: Zeus is actually meant to
  be Ahura Mazda, Hestia is the god of the hearth-fire, Helios is
  Mithra, etc.

In Traditions of the Magi: Zoroastrianism in Greek and Latin Literature, by Dr. Albert F. de Jong the question is more thoroughly addressed:

Ahura Mazda = Zeus
The identification of Ahura Mazda with Zeus is more frequently
  encountered in Greek literature than the Iranian name of the divinity.
  It is commonly accepted that it is always Ahura Mazda who is to be
  understood when Greek authors mention Zeus among the Persians.

As an example, the same Persian Zeus can be found earlier in Herodotus' Histories:

As to the customs of the Persians, I know them to be these. It is not
  their custom to make and set up statues and temples and altars, but
  those who do such things they think foolish, because, I suppose, they
  have never believed the gods to be like men, as the Greeks do; but
  they call the whole circuit of heaven Zeus, and to him they sacrifice
  on the highest peaks of the mountains; they sacrifice also to the sun
  and moon and earth and fire and water and winds.
