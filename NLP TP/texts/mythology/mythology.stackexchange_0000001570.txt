Q:

Were all the sons of Zeus brothers of all the godly sons and daughters of Zeus?

Since in Greek mythology, there are sons of Zeus as demigods, are they brothers of all the godly sons and daughters of Zeus?
Also, wouldn't the demigod's mother technically be the mother in law of Zeus' offspring?

A:

The Demigods and the Godly offspring of Zeus would be half-siblings.
The title step-mother comes by marriage, at the very least in the common law sense, however most of Zeus's special lady friends were mistresses or one night stands.
This is all without going in to some of the more curious reproductive methods.
