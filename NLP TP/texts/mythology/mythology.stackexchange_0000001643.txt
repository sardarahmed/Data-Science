Q:

Where did Mars live (what part of Rome)?

I'm doing an important project on Mars.
Where did Mars live?

A:

The first cult centre for Mars in Rome was the Altar of Mars on the Campus Martius, or Field of Mars. The other main temple of Mars lay outside the city boundary, built to fufill a vow made during the war against the Gauls. 
This link lists the main Roman temples of Mars.
Hope this helps.
