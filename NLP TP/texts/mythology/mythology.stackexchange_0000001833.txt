Q:

Mythical Creatures associated with Bells

Pretty much what it says on the can. I was wondering if there where any mythical creatures or "folk" (little people, Huldufolk, etc) associated with bells, or the sound of bells.
Thank-you in advance to anyone who takes the time out of their day to answer my curiosity.

A:

I somehow associated fairies with bells. Quick check on wiki shows that 

Bells also have an ambiguous role; while they protect against fairies,
  the fairies riding on horseback — such as the fairy queen — often have
  bells on their harness

There is a prooflink on the passage: "Briggs (1976) "Bells" p. 20."
