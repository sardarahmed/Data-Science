Q:

Does Loki die at the end of Ragnarok?

It is believed that most gods including Odin, Thor, and multiple other gods and goddesses die at the end of Ragnarok.

A:

Yes. Heimdall and Loki slay one another.
From the Prose Edda by Snorri Sturlson in the Gylfaginning Ch 16, emphasis mine:

The Wolf shall swallow Odin; that shall be his ending But straight
  thereafter shall Vídarr stride forth and set one foot upon the lower
  jaw of the Wolf: on that foot he has the shoe, materials for which
  have been gathering throughout all time. (They are the scraps of
  leather which men cut out: of their shoes at toe or heel; therefore he
  who desires in his heart to come to the Æsir's help should cast those
  scraps away.) With one hand he shall seize the Wolf's upper jaw and
  tear his gullet asunder; and that is the death of the Wolf. Loki shall
  have battle with Heimdallr, and each be the slayer of the other. Then
  straightway shall Surtr cast fire over the earth and burn all the
  world; so is said in Völuspá:

Different translation here:

The wolf swallows Odin, and thus causes his death; but Vidar
  immediately turns and rushes at the wolf, placing one foot on his
  nether jaw. On this foot he has the shoe for which materials have been
  gathering through all ages, namely, the strips of leather which men
  cut off for the toes and heels of shoes; wherefore he who wishes to
  render assistance to the asas must cast these strips away. With one
  hand Vidar seizes the upper jaw of the wolf, and thus rends asunder
  his mouth. Thus the wolf perishes. Loke fights with Heimdal, and they
kill each other. Thereupon Surt flings fire over the earth and burns
  up all the world. Thus it is said in the Vala’s Prophecy.
