Q:

Are there any deities or mythological beasts inspired by snow leopards?

I don't know a lot about the mythology of central Asian cultures (where the snow leopard comes from). I'm trying to find more information on the cultural impact the animal could have. 

A:

There is a collection of snow leopard myths on the Snow Leopard Conservancy website: 

Nepalese Myths Surrounding Snow Leopards (1)
Nepalese Myths Surrounding Snow Leopards (2)
Tibetan Myths Surrounding Snow Leopards
Snow Leopards, Mountain Spirits and Sacred Space in Northern Pakistan
The Otter and the Snow Leopard
