Q:

What do the "runes" on this pendant say?

I found this pendant on AliExpress, and it looks pretty nice. But I'd like to know what the runes mean, if anything?

A:

Sorry to say, it's actually nothing more than the Elder Futhark, the eldest of the runic alphabets.

You can read more on it on Wikipedia. A good giveaway that it doesn't "say" anything is the lack of repeating characters on the pendant.

A:

As others said, the symbols spell the runic alphabet from the Elder Futhark. They circle Yggdrasil, the mythical tree that connects the nine worlds in Norse cosmology, where Odin hung himself in order to attain the knowledge that he shares with those who pursue runemal.

A:

This is literally the Elder Futhark runic alphabet spelled out. In other words it's the equivalent of "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
