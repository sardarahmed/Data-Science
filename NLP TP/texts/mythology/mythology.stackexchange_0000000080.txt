Q:

What is the River Styx?

The River Styx is mentioned quite a lot when a Greek hero meets his demise. 
However is this really a body of water in Hades? 
Is it made out of something else? 
What is the River Styx?

A:

The River Styx is one of the five rivers of the  Greek Underworld, rivers that separate Hades from the land of the living.
During the Titanomachy (the Titan war), which was fought between the Titans and the Olympians, the goddess Styx sided with the Olympians.
Once the war was won, Zeus, king of the Olympians, promised that every oath be sworn on Styx's name, as a sign of the greatest respect.
He also proceeded to name the River Styx after her.
Achilles was dipped in it as a child and was rewarded with invulnerability, except for his heel, which was where his mother was holding him, hence the term :  Achilles' heel.
The full list of rivers surrounding Hades :

Acheron - the river of woe

Cocytus - the river of lamentation

Phlegethon - the river of fire

Lethe - the river of forgetfulness

Styx - the river of hate

A:

It is the mystical division between life and death - or rather, life and afterlife. It is a symbol of that border.
It is definitely not made out of normal water, as falling into the Styx causes one to lose one's memories. Which is why one has to take the ferry to the other side.
