Q:

What is the greek/roman myth with woman proud of her three sons but they die

I remember (and I may be mis-remembering some things) a myth where there was a mother and her three sons doted over her and ran for her every wish. The three sons carried her somewhere and got her there on time and she was so overcome with pride she said something along the lines of " I'm so proud of my sons I wish they could stay like this forever! " and the gods heard her and turned her sons into statues.
I cant remember the myth exactly and I looked through several myths that were similar to no avail. The moral of the story was something like 'careful what you wish for' but I remember it was more deep than that and that's why I wanted to read it again.

A:

Probably Kleobis and Biton.  When they could not find their oxen to pull the cart, they themselves drew the cart the six miles so their mother could attend a festival at the temple of Hera, and when she prayed that Hera reward them, they fell asleep in the temple and never woke again.
This was generally discussed in matters of what makes for happiness.
