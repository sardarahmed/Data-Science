Q:

How many gods/goddesses are there in total in greek mythology?

If there was a diagram with every god in it, that would be cool, but I doubt you can find that, so a number will do I guess.
How many gods/goddesses are there in total in greek mythology?

A:

A lot.
Theoi has a nice family tree-

And so you count, and get a total of...
3142 gods/godesses
If you count the Potami, Naiads, and Astriaos as 1 god/goddess, and including Titans as gods.
