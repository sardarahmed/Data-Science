Q:

Why did Snorri Sturlson link the Norse Gods to the Trojans?

In the Prologue to the Prose Edda, he seems to develop a genealogy of the Norse Gods being descendants of the Trojans. Starting with the Trojan king Priam, he develops connections, like for example Thor being son of the Ethiopian king Memnon and Tróán (the daughter of Priam). Why did he do this in the prologue, what was its purpose?

A:

It was fashionable.
Being connected with Troy was considered prestigious.  Hence Virgil claimed that Aeneas had escaped the fall of Troy to go to Rome and become an ancestor of Romulus.  An unknown author claimed that a descendant of Aeneas, Brutus, had become the first king of Britain and given it its name.  Snorri was working within that tradition.
