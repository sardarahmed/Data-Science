Q:

Books analysing Norse mythology (specifically Odin)?

What I am looking for is not a collection of stories and myths per se, but something more general like an analysis/dissection or meta discussion of the myth of Odin and Norse mythology in general. Something like Campbell's "Hero with a thousand faces". 
Odin fascinates me by the scale on which he was revered (the guy has over 100 names!) and his character (combining the wisdom/wanderer god and the warrior/leader god aspects). If any of you could provide me with some worthwhile material on this I would be truly grateful!

A:

Stephan Grundy's Odhinn the Cult of Death, and Diana Paxson's Odin: Ecstasy, Runes, and Norse Practical Magic are both pretty good, and available on Amazon. If you've already read the Prose and Poetic Edda you'll have a good grounding in Norse myth generally, these two books will probably answer your questions.
