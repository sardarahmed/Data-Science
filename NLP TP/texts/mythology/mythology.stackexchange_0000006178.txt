Q:

Native American (possibly) apocalyptic prophecy about inanimate objects coming to life

I am in search of a difficult-to-Google fact. I once saw a Discovery Channel-esque documentary about an apocalyptic prophecy that all of the tools and other man-made objects would at some point take on a life of their own and turn on humankind. I'm pretty sure it was from a Native American culture (I thought Mayan but that didn't turn up anything useful online so maybe not).
Does anyone know whether this is/was a genuinely held cultural belief somewhere, if so what culture, and where I can find out more?

A:

You may be referring to a legend in the Huarochir√≠ Manuscript mentioned in this book: Colonial Spanish America. Animate objects in this text are linked to a beginning-of-the-world event, the first sunrise, set in ancient times (which can of course also be considered an end-of-the-world event for the mythical time before the first sunrise).
An exhaustive study of this can be found in Linda Brown's When Pre-Sunrise Beings Inhabit a Post-Sunrise World: Time, Animate Objects, and Contemporary Tz'utujil Maya Ritual Practitioners
