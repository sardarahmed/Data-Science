Q:

Did tales about a house made of sweets predate Hansel and Gretel?

Having heard the tale of Hansel and Gretel orally, the brothers Grimm published it in 1812. One of its most memorable themes is the witch's house made of sweets. Does such a theme predate this tale? And if so, when did it first appear?

A:

Yes, the theme of a house constructed of sweets does predate the Hansel and Gretel tale.
It appears in the fantasy The Land of Cockayne which was included in a 14th century manuscript from Ireland, the earliest known literary text in English from that country.
