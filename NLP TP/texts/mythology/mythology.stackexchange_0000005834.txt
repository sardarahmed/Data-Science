Q:

fate in mythology

How did the ancient Greeks deal with the concept of fate that is the characters have "free will" they are intelligent and their choices are not predetermined but certain events are predetermined.  (this is my understanding)
What is Priam just killed Paris as a baby?    What if he later killed/exhiled Paris or at least didn't make him the Trojan ambasador?   (possibly not canon) What if Priam immediately returned Helen and had Paris killed/exiled?  What if Priam made Paris continue the duel until one of him /Menelaus was dead?.. etc
Why couldn't Oedipus just refuse to marry anyone or at least anyone older?

A:

A lot of Greek myths dealing with the concept of fate/destiny (Oedipus most clearly), are used to illustrate how you can't escape your fate, no matter how you try or what measures you take, it will always find you and fighting it will only make it worse. That's the main takeaway from these stories, so I think it's safe to say it reflects at least a fairly prevalent attitude of the time.
If you consider myths to be more along the line of fables, with a lesson or some sort of moral, you could say Oedipus couldn't refuse to marry because you can't escape fate. Or you could say he couldn't refuse to marry because his story is also one about hubris and pride, and Oedipus was foolish enough to think he could escape his destiny and had successfully cheated fate by leaving his adoptive parents, and tempted the fate he was already doomed to enact by marrying. He literally sealed his own fate.
Ultimately, from the Greek mythology I've read it seems that the Greek attitude towards fate was somewhat fatalistic- free will is an illusion, the gods are dicks who toy with us for sport, what you have coming will get you sooner or later, have some more wine.
