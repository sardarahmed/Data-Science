Q:

A rock on a beach

I've heard of a story in greek mythology, but I am missing a lot of details. Can you help me recover the place where, supposedly, everything happened ?
A guy goes alone to a village to steal wine and gold. When the villagers find out, they chase him. He decides to flee by the sea, with a boat. And when the villagers get to the beach, someone giant arrives, and throws a rock on the villagers. The rock has stayed here since then.
This should have happened on the West coast of Greece.

I'm sorry, the story had been completely deformed by the person who told it to me. It was supposed to be the story of Ulysses and Polyphemus the cyclops.
