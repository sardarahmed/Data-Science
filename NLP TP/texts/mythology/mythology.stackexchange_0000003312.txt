Q:

The Enchantress and the blue rose tree

Does anyone know the title of this story and where it was translated from? 

Source: the Golden Bough

A:

Sir James George Frazer cited this story from the 1873 book Russian Folk-Tales by William Ralston Shedden-Ralston. Ralston, in turn, translated it from Ivan Khudyakov's 1861 collection Russian Fairy Tales, where it was numbered 109. Clearly the story is Russian in origin.
Ralston did not give the story a title, which probably indicates that neither did Khudyakov (but I can't read Russian, so someone else would have to confirm this). Traditional folk tales rarely come with names, or rather, only one widely accepted name. Hence many fairy tale collections use numbering instead. So we could reasonably say, there isn't a title.
On the other hand, in his The Golden Bouch, Frazier gave the paragrap containing the story the subtitle, "Death in the blue-rose tree". You could treat this as a title - it's as close to a name as there is for this story, in English at least.
