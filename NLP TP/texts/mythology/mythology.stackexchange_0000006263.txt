Q:

Greek female name associated with gifts, a tool, a weapon, or a lie - must sound relatively 'normal' for a modern name

I'm writing a story, and the beginning of the story has a woman in it that doesn't actually exist - she's a figment of some mental manipulation upon the protagonist by a magical Greek cult.
I've done some googling but couldn't find what I'm looking for - which is:

A name for this female character that doesn't sound too out of
place for a modern name (there's definitely some leeway here)
Doesn't immediately jump out as "Yeah, that's definitely something
greek/mythological"
And has some sort of connection plotwise with her role in the story.

Basically, the protagonist has had their memories tampered with, with the idea of turning them into an assassin of a government official.  The female character is a fake memory/creation to help "smooth over" the critical memories - giving the main protagonist a fake sounding board and a source of suggestions for courses of actions.  So anything along the lines of:

Tool or Toolmaker
Lies or Figment
Artificial Creation
Gift
Two-Edged Sword
Weapon
etc

Any ideas for a female name that would work?

A:

Basically you'd have to modernize an existing name to your purpose.
*(F) = Female
*(M) = Male
Hesiod, Theogony 211ff (trans. Evelyn White; Greek epic 8th or 7th century B.C.):[3]
And Nyx (F)(Night) bare hateful Moros (M)(Doom) and black Ker (F)(Violent Death) and Thanatos (M)(Death), and she bare Hypnos (M)(Sleep) and the tribe of Oneiroi(M)(Dreams). And again the goddess murky Nyx, though she lay with none, bare Momos (M)(Blame) and painful Oizys(F)(Misery), and the Hesperides(F) ... Also she bare the Moirai(F)(Fates) and the ruthless avenging Keres (F)(Death Fates) ... Also deadly Nyx bare Nemesis (F)(Envy) to afflict mortal men, and after her, Apate (F)(Deceit) and Philotes (F)(Friendship) and hateful Geras (M)(Old Age) and hardhearted Eris (F)(Strife).
