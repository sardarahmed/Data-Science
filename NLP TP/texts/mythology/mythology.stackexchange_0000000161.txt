Q:

How did Gilgamesh die?

Do we know how and in which circumstances Gilgamesh died?
According to these answers seems that The Epic of Gilgamesh doesn't mention that, however Wikipedia page mention something about Sumerian poem - The Death of Gilgamesh.

A:

According to The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature, my best guess from reading the translated text provided is he died of old age :

..... hero ...... has lain down and is never to rise again. ...... has lain down and is never to rise again. He of well-proportioned limbs ...... has lain down and is never to rise again. ...... has lain down and is never to rise again. He who ...... wickedness has lain down and is never to rise again. The young man ...... has lain down and is never to rise again. He who was perfect in ...... and feats of strength has lain down and is never to rise again. ......

It doesn't give an specific explanation for his death, but the text is fragmentary at best and several parts are missing.
