Q:

Anyone know what this symbol means?

Someone drew this symbol on my arm, and said it was an egyptian one and had some meaning, but I can't find it anywhere. The top that is obscured curls to the left.

A:

Looks like the Adinkra "Aya" (fern) symbol:

Adinkra is not Egyptian, though. It originates from the Ashanti and Baoulé peoples, in the neighborhood of Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire (respectively).
