Q:

Are there any myths of little girls with the head of a wolf?

I keep seeing a girl with the head of a wolf, with red eyes, and long hair.
As I'm a very impressionable person I probably saw an image in a mythology book, or a movie, and I can't get this girl out of my head, so now when I'm in a dark room I see this image. It's not a cute kind of girl, it's a scary monster in the dark kind of girl.
Is there such a creature in any mythology? This creature could be a part of a pack, or something, as I think I have seen an adult version of this as well.

A:

Tracking down which creature you saw might be difficult - humans with canine heads is surprisingly common in mythology, though often described as a dog head rather than a wolf.
From ancient Cynocephali tribes (THE KYNOKEPHALOI)  whose name literally means dog-head in ancient greek, to relatively recent urban legends (Michigan Dogman (Wikipedia)),
from the friendly Scottish wulver to the less friendly islanders described by Marco Polo: (The Travels of Marco Polo/Book 3/Chapter 13).
I couldn't find references to little girls specifically, but in terms of women there's the Telkhines but since I struggled to find any art, I doubt that's what you're looking for. If you are able to remember where you saw it we might be able to help more.
