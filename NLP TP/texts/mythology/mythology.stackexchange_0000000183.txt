Q:

What species is the Lady of the Lake?

In Arthurian legend, the Lady of the Lake is usually depicted as a beautiful woman. However, she is clearly not human (as she seems to spend most of her time hanging out underwater). One might think mermaid, but I don't recall any mentions of fins or similar typical mermaid characteristics.
Is there any clarification, in Arthurian mythology, about what the Lady of the Lake is, or anything about her physical capabilities?

A:

Many early Celtic legends apply male and female characteristics to geographical features.  
If you take Mary Caine's works on the areas around the Isle of Avalon, the hills of Glastonbury, then the location of the lake is female.
Where the Michael ley line (red male energy) intersects the much shorter Mary ley line (white female energy) at Glastonbury Tor, the Mary ley leads to Pomparles Bridge.  This was said by the Monks of the Abbey to be the place where Excalibur was returned to the lake.  The lake therefore being female energy.
Sir Thomas Malory is the first to use the phrase "Lady of the Lake" in his poetry.  This has come into popular culture as anthropomorphising the lake itself.  He does however give us the physical description of "An arm in white samite" which takes the sword.
