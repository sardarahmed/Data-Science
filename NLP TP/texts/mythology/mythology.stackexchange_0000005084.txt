Q:

What is this symbol on my necklace?

I bought this pendant in Italy around 10 years ago, I think from Rome. 
Iâ€™ve always been curious as to what the bird with the sun above it (etched onto the red glossy background) represents. I was a child at the time... I only picked it up because I thought it looked cool without really asking what it is. Could it be a specific symbol in Italian culture/history?

A:

This is the dove with a halo, as a christian symbol for the Holy Spirit or the soul.
The colour red is associated with the blood of Christ and with the Holy Spirit.
The fact that you bought it in Italy (Rome) supports this, as there is a big christian community as well as many pilgrims and tourists visiting Rome and Vatican City.
